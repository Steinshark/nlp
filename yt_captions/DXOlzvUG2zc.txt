Harry Jaffa has this wonderful line that um the West is is saved or revitalized every time a human heart is saved from The Dark Knight of nihilism and relativism um and this is kind of the premise also of of of my book that you know you've titled a book how to say the west and of course you feel a certain trepidation about like if people are going to look to you for some political program or some you know list of answers um but the point that I'm I'm trying to make in in the book which Marcus I think you you get at really well is like you know actually the you know the the restitution the restoration of of every human heart is the project of of the West and I think the first step to that because very close to everything we've been talking about the first step to that has to be um some recovery of this of the validity of symbols right of of the uh just the fact that these are not kind of arbitrary or accidental features of our biology but are I think you use the word primary John and that they are in some sense kind of a Bedrock uh of of reality and and you know this is I think expressed very well in in the Timaeus and kind of carried forth um by by these Christian Traditions you've been talking about this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] Welcome to our Christ my name is Marcus today I'm joined once again my friend Jonathan paggio he's been a great inspiration to me in this channel Jonathan is a professional artist writer product speaker give workshops and conferences all around North America he teaches carving speaks and heart but most mostly he explores symbolic structures that underlie our experience of the world through his YouTube channel and his podcast his political he's furthers the conversational symbolism meaning and patterns and everything movies the icons the social trends FMA go off a script here with it and let you know about some exciting news so Jonathan and I are actually in the final stages of organizing an event yeah with Paul Kingsman with the Dr Martin Dublin this June so keep an eye out for that and you'll be able to follow up my YouTube channel and on event Eventbrite and book tickets there and I'll also be offering other events one including Calvin Robinson Roger and father Ben Kelly if you enjoy this conversation you might enjoy that that takes place in London on the 11th of March at Calvin's church and I'm also joined today by one of my favorite podcasters Dr Spencer clevin with a PhD in Classics Spencer is the author of the new book how to save the West he's also an assistant editor of the German Review of Books and American mind at the Claremont Institute Spanish lettering expertise is aided based on a lot of money languages including ancient Greek Latin and Hebrew there's a scholar who enjoys exploring great works of literature he provides valuable insights into today's world he's also previously hosted young Heretics and he's been snapped up now by Theory wire so I suppose first um if I might ask you both what have you each found most insightful about the other's work and what are some of the key areas that you'd like to explore today I suppose especially in line with Spencer's new book if I may start with you Jonathan well I haven't I haven't had I've been after I haven't read the new book but one of the things that I found very interesting is that I met Spencer only once I met him when uh I was at the daily wire and um it was really interesting because it seemed like we were very much in line he was quoting all my favorite passages from Dante at me like what what like what is this amazing and so I feel like I think like we're we're like aligned on a kind of cosmic vision and so I'm definitely looking forward to exploring that more with him and seeing you know how he brings that into his his project so yeah um I had that same experience Jonathan I think it's the I think it was Dante and Beatrice from the uh from from Paradiso that we were discussing and it speaks to the place where I think we share the most um and that is this notion of you know you're so eloquent about the symbolic and uh the way that we kind of experience you know I think that we we currently have these two kind of toggle options in the public mind one is their their subjectivity and there's objectivity right and objectivity is like the stuff that's out there and it's hard and you touch it and then there's the stuff that's in here and it's arbitrary and subjective and um I have really you know been insisting in my dogged way that there is a a kind of middle space between those two modes of perception which is properly called subjective in the sense that it involves a subject right there's no such thing as beauty without a percipient but it is not chair it doesn't you know just come out of our Pure will or what have you talk about a lot about that in the book and you and I were I think sharing about your essay on the uh the Earth right whether the Earth revolves around the Sun or the sun revolves around the earth um and and that's a kind of a classic example that actually the perceptive experience of of how we experience the sun is is not something that just gets to like vanish out of out of thin air simply because we kind of mathematically prove that it's quote unquote objectively untrue so that's I think the thing I I love most about what Johnson does um thanks for sharing gents and um it's also if we look at your book even in Broad Strokes then and how to save the West to answer you present five major crises threatening to end Western culture can you tell us what they are and then we can see how they align with some of the big challenges that Jonathan sees oh sure uh well I mean the the premise of the book is basically you know I I think people wake up the the people that I talk to who listen to my podcast or or what have you I I sense from them a real sense of uh Despair and anxiety about just where the world is headed about the news cycle which seems to just constantly deliver uh you know crisis after crisis and the way that people typically think about this is you know how can I fix things and they they think about it as if they were like Ron DeSantis you know they they sort of uh imagine like what law am I going to write tomorrow what system am I going to build uh Across the Nation that will uh quote unquote you know fix the world or save the west and I think that's what causes that despair I think when people think that way they start to paralysis starts to set in because most of us aren't Rhonda census and most of us have been trained to think in these sweeping political terms um when what we really need is some agents see over our own immediate surroundings and personal you might even say subjective lives and so the the project of the book overall is to take some of these things that are kind of flitting past the news cycle um and you know invite people into speculation about what deeper questions might be underlying them that are answerable in human terms at an individual human level um and so the first one I call the crisis of reality and that's related to what we were just talking about it's this you know is anything out there real and if so what and uh do I want it to be is it convenient to me for there to be uh objective reality or even subjective reality or would I rather kind of uh dissolve the boundaries of true and false in in some sort of digital space um and then you know from closely related to this is the crisis of the body I think is is this um uncomfortable relationship that we've had basically for as long as we've been around on the planet with our fleshly selves uh what what does the soul have to do with flesh why do we need this kind of appendage or uh meat sack that just decays and dies um and wouldn't it be better if we could you know either manipulate it rearrange it at will or um maybe just Escape it all together in some sort of you know code space um and and so I kind of present as an antidote to to that crisis the arguments of Aquinas and you know drawing also on Aristotle um for for a hylomorphic world for a world that is uh comprised of the fusion of form and and matter threaded through uh you know at every point with order um that is more than than simply meat um and this is kind of what leads into the second uh half of the book with the crisis of meaning and the crisis of religion and that's where you start to get into you know whether or not we can believe in the wake of the Scientific Revolution and the discovery of evolution you know whether we can um be confident in the things that we perceive in this world that have no place on a brain scan and yet we feel very powerfully to be true um then finally at last kind of having addressed some of those what I'd consider deeper philosophical issues turn to the crisis of the regime which is the you know the political issues facing America and kind of drawing on some of the history of political philosophy to um you know describe how regimes have been understood to rise and fall so that we can understand kind of what the threats what the particularly acute threats are uh to to ours in America and and where we might be headed um wonderful thanks Spencer would you like to go with any of those in particular and start off with Jonathan I mean I think there's many there are many things there that are interesting to me um for sure the question of how we can believe or you know how or why we should believe in the the kind of scientific or post-scientific World um that is definitely one of the main projects that I'm trying to to attend to um and so I I'm definitely interested in the notion that cognitive science has afforded us a new space to talk about these things that is the inevitability of patterning and the inevitability of of um you know framing in terms of how we see reality and how if you take that seriously then in some ways it can recapture our the phenomenological World it can kind of recapture it as primary it has to do with what you said in terms of the sun coming up in the morning right it's like if you if you can realize that that like the inevitability of of this experience right of this conscious experience and how how it's related to meaning in general and how we make meaning then it seems like almost all the categories that you find in ancient world like in scripture or in the medieval world can be recaptured you know I often give the example of going up a mountain it's like going up a mountain is an objective thing it's a subjective thing but like in the way that you said subjective but it has a stable pattern to it and you can recognize it and you can understand why Moses goes up a mountain to encounter God it's not it's something that you can actually comprehend and have a little experience of yourself yeah you know this is related to something I'd love for us to get into that you were actually touching on before we started recording um and that is the kind of fractaline nature of this stuff the way in which uh you know reality Human Experience seems to kind of consist in you know larger patterns that can be infinitely sort of nested within themselves one after the other um and I I think this is something I I sort of address in the book I I think this is one of the kind of dominant patterns of ancient Greek philosophical thought which is is has been lost to us and and needs recovering you see it maybe most clearly in in Plato's Republic this notion that the city is a kind of Soul mapped over many many people and therefore the soul is a kind of City nested within a single individually and in both cases order is the kind of spirit shared uh among these two things man is as the microcosm is the kind of class tagline for for talking about this and I wonder you're mentioning cognitive science I wonder if that Concept in particular this idea that you know the logos which is either threaded through creation or expressed in creation however you want to put it um finds a kind of little mini uh reiteration in the human mind oh I think so I think that the fractal to me the fractal structure that's the that's the solution at least to help people see what's going on and one of the things I think we have access to um right now that in some ways it's hard to know to what extent the Ancients had had access to it I think they did but they would you know the idea of microcosmic macrocosm for example you find that of course like you said in the in the Greek thinkers in in Plato and then it it winds itself into Christianity and finds its place and say maximus and and in the more Cosmic looking uh Christian uh thinkers but there's a sense in which that microcosm macrocosm is actually indefinite in number so it's not that it's not that there's like one microcosm and then the macrocosm it's that there's levels and if you read say maximus you kind of see it it's like the individual is the church is the cosmos and so it's like the individual of the city is the cosmos there's this there are these different ways you can you can frame it but you can go individual Church Cosmos you can go individual Family Church Nation like you can there are all these ways in which these nested uh relationships work and then you can go down from the individual actually into the manner in which your parts fit into you right and that there's a kind of an indefinite way in which anything that has multiplicity uh joins into unity and so this is like a stable pattern and it ended it's like the one of the many basically is nothing new we're not making anything up but uh but that that understanding that it nests itself all the way through is really I think it's a solution to so many of the of the problems that we have because even in terms of politics we tend I always see modernity as a splitting of Heaven and Earth that's the way that I understand it and it accounts for more of modernity than some people sometimes because people see in modernity you know the Leviathan right and then you you also see you know the kind of noble savage idea but those are the two things happening simultaneously so it's like one is calling the other so the idea that heaven and Earth are separating um and that that is reducing the fractal relationships so you end up with something like you know whatever globalist World Government whatever like obviously this is a little caricatured and then idiosyncratic you know I make up my own identity whatever that is like I can be a cat man or whatever at the bottom right so it's like these two extremes happening and the fractal is the way to connect them together um fascinating it's an intriguing actually to think that you know in the Scientific Revolution you have notionally you have this connection between the the sub-lunary and the super lunary spheres that there was supposed to be this division you know at the orbit of the moon um but in in point of fact what you're saying is that in some ways the whole of physical uh creation physical existence was kind of brought down to the level of the sub-lunaries and split off cut off from from its its Heavenly sort of vertical Dimension which is which is really cool uh a cool way of thinking about it I also think that this you know is a is a mode of scriptural interpretation that uh can be very fertile and and fruitful when you're trying to think about these questions like can we believe how can we believe how should we relate to these texts which have been so kind of maligned and dismissed as like Stone Age Superstition or what have you but the other night I was having a a conversation about you know is the when God says to the nation of Israel you know I know the plans I have for you plans of good and not of evil plans to prosper you um is he just saying it to the nation of Israel about the Exile in Babylon and is the effort to kind of extract this verse as people often do out of context and is that effort just fundamentally misguided and kind of the feature of American Christian happy talk and one of the things that I was drawing on in that conversation is this notion which I think I got from Aquinas although I I'm not totally sure if I'm right about that but you know this this notion that it's somewhere in between those two things right this is not just a kind of floating set of words that you can apply to any situation anywhere but neither is it limited in its time at space context or else none of scripture would really have any meaning for us at all there's got to be some kind of analogical link that you can draw between the historical experiences of the Jewish nation in relationship to God and whatever it is that's going on around us at a cosmic level and I think this is this kind of infinite nesting that you're suggesting is is the link it's really important what you say that like there's no there's no ceiling to this it's not like microcosm absolutely uh or like there's you know just two options but rather this is a kind of infinite chain and so you could say well Israel in its kind of nationhood represents or stands in four but that's that's even not quite right in some ways embodies um you know a a cosmic man just as Adam also can be conceived of as Cosmic man and Christ of course as well and and you know once you kind of get into this um there's a million different ways that you can legitimately and meaningfully kind of draw uh significance out of these historical events without just kind of reducing them to like platitudes or or you're so right I mean it's all right and I think it's that is bound in the script the scripture itself you know it's bound in the way the scripture relates these together so if you think about what you said in terms of the nation of Israel the Covenant that God makes with the nation of Israel and you think of that already in the Covenant itself there's a there's a fractal relationship that gets set up which is increasing so God makes this deal with Moses and then Moses says like I can't do it alone whatever and God sets up mediations between Moses and the people so you have God then you have Moses then you have these mediations and then it says Israel will be a Priestly Nation what does that mean like priests for the rest of the world that's what it means and so the role that Moses is playing to Israel is the role that Israel is supposed to play to the world and that is that is uh set up in the text itself and if you see then from Exodus and you kind of move on into the the story of of the Bible you come to a point where this seems to be increasing and increasing to the point where God saying you know I I will spit I will fill the entire Earth with my spirit right it's like we will as if you know when he when the promise was made to to Abraham to make The Descendants as numerous as the Stars you get a sense even in the Old Testament that this is going to be more than than just the strict nation of Israel and we're moving towards a time where God's spirit will pour out unto all flesh so if you see that as this fractal nesting where it's like these these increasing circles uh it's like I think it's right there in the text and so it's not a I don't think we're I don't think we're just trying to interpret something that that that that we want to be there if we I think it's there in the order of Revelation itself it's remarkable I mean of course the prophets maybe wrestle with this most fruitfully in the you know lead up to the Exile and then in in the uh restoration this is you know the sort of building of the second temple um I I sort of discern it's it's not so much a disagreement as just a kind of mystery or a a you know a kind of waiting about that very question like when the Nations come to Zion like what will that look like how can we sing the Lord's song In a Strange Land and and how is it possible for other cultures with distinctive kind of practices and this whole separate symbolic language perhaps mutually unintelligible to the you know to the Jewish Nation right you know it's higher and Basin and just all these other I mean Nations that haven't even been known or named yet will come to Zion and and you have this image I I suppose you know in Isaiah 60 for instance of like Zion is this kind of ineffable core right kind of meaning Beyond language Beyond symbolic expression that joins together all of these nations which you know sort of horizontally amongst themselves have nothing in common and are mutually unintelligible or even adversarial in the case of you know Babylon Syria um and and this you know this kind of symbolic or analogical relationship that they're able to to develop is kind of I think the glimpse of that uh in in in the prophetic Visions let me ask you a question that may well be above our pay grade as human beings and therefore unanswerable just to make it as easy on you yeah it's just why not all right yeah yeah I mean since here we are uh and uh that is it seems to me that um this kind of nested structure this uh representative symbolic structure is inherent in the Trinity itself in other words it's not simply something that has to do with the way that God must Express himself to man and among Humanity because of our distance from him or because of our you know embodiment in in matter um but that actually it comes along even in a pre-lapsarian way um bound up with our nature as as images of of God that we are three in one already kind of within an individual there's symbolic language going on Even in our thought private thoughts to ourselves Aristotle says you know no thought is an image but no thought takes place without images without pictures Fantasia either um and and I wonder whether um trinitarian theology I mean you would know a lot more about the patristic literature on this than than I would um you know whether it's a kind of an article of trinitarian faith that something about this symbolic uh gesture is inherent in in God's nature of itself I mean obviously I don't want to misstep I always hate talk about Unitarian theology unless someone calls me a heretic you know and I don't even know why uh but I I think that definitely the one I think the moon of the Mysteries of the revelation of the Trinity is the the notion that Multiplicity is in the godhead right that that in God is both perfect unity and perfect multiplicity and in some ways it's it has to be represented as an aporia uh because obviously we can't make sense of it but but it's not a pooria that is that is just arbitrary or illogical because we can see in that aporia of of of proposing perfect unity and perfect multiplicity that we see that happen at lower and more imperfect levels in the world so in the world we notice the coexistence of unity and multiplicity and we can see when that is balanced like when there's we could say when there's love and love is holding multiplicity in unity and we can see that so I think that I think that we are meant foreign to live as an image of the Trinity uh for sure and I think that and I thought that's why I really do believe that the trade I mean I'm preaching for my for my own Parish or whatever but I do believe that the trinitarian Revelation in some ways is met even metaphysically it's like the deepest it's the deepest way to talk about the infinite that that I can think of because the problem with with the kind of monadic vision right of the one and that that type of language uh and I mean I don't want to reduce the new plateness but you know it's it can be done because it tends to diminish it tends to diminish multiplicity as being derivative and as being uh you know almost fallen in itself that kind of Gnostic move that we saw at the in the beginning of Christianity but trinitarianism really puts multiplicity as being in the very infinite itself that's it's astounding to me like it's a it's a beautiful image um and to return to Dante you know I think of his beatific Vision when he finally makes it and as you say it's it's apparetic in in some sense he loses his power of speech as he frequently does in the presence of the Divine and yet it's quite a definite um and and really quite strange image I mean I've always thought that you know his his image of the godhead is one that you could you could never dream up sort of on your own you know it feels very right and yet he comes out with it and you're sort of like that's quite surprising and and you know it is significant it seems that you know as we've been talking about symbolism about the sort of fractal nesting and and all of that um we almost can't escape some form of hierarchic language right and you know we make all these caveats we say you know and yet you always get the kind of bigger within the smaller or the and and the thing that binds them is the form um what Dante gives us is these three Circles of distinct linked colors and so of course the circle is you know a kind of perfection of form he's able to distinguish between these entities while also you know affording to them a Kind of Perfect synonymity or a perfect you know identity with with one another um and I I will be loose with my language and ask for the Forgiveness of the audience to you know when it comes to heresy but that seems to me that what Dante is is getting at that there is a you know that although in this world and you know because creation creation being what it is creating things that are other than God right you know there's always going to be a kind of graded uh variation of of hierarchy within creation and that's nothing evil or wrong about that um but we also see as you said in on kind of levels where uh all are equal you can nevertheless have a kind of Multiplicity um in in Union that that Imogen at the end of Dante I think kind of uh tries to capture what that would be at its highest in the godhead yeah I mean I I agree and I think that in terms of the Trinity it's interesting to see I mean it's obviously different fathers and different they're different strains of how they talk about it how they represented but there seems to be on the one hand you can kind of feel this tension right to not represent the relationships as hierarchical right so it's like no it's a heart some you hear things like it's a hierarchy of function but it's not a hierarchy of nature like there's different ways to talk about it but I think it's like they're trying it's it's again it's a naporia there's a naporia in the sense that there's a kind of Distinction of function which appears in some ways as a as a hierarchy but because it's put into the infinite that hierarchy also dissolves at the same time into you know into the infinite I don't know what how else to say it and so and so it gives us a model in some ways it becomes a kind of infinite model of how we again notice the the way that things work so a really beautiful image of that I think is for example when Christ you know so so like Christ says you know I call you my friends it's it's a beautiful image because the the disciples are not the one calling Christ his friends right it's like it's not the disciples saying hey Buddy Jesus he's my buddy like they're not the ones doing that Christ is the one saying that so it's as if there's a there's an acknowledgment of some of a hierarchy but then that hierarchy is is almost reduced in Christ calling the disciples to participate fully in him and so it's like this it's really powerful to think that it both both tells us like Christ is above them and he so when he even when he watches their feet it's like there's a reason why they're shocked is because right this is this is actually this kind of cannotic uh movement that's happening from Above Down Below so it actually reinstates the hierarchy even when he's watching his feet I'm sorry Christians he's he's washing their feet and they're all shocked and so it's both him like losing himself in in that lower part but then also reinstating it inevitably just by the fact that he's doing it so it's like that type of move or the types of moves that Christ does to to at least give us a hint of how this kind of equal equality and hierarchy can can exist in it how it seems to exist infinitely in God somehow I don't know how to phrase it but well it threads right through so many of his sayings not just that moment which you're right is I I've never quite thought of it that way it's a very beautiful a beautiful beautiful in its Simplicity almost but also you know he who would be first must be last right is kind of the the little nomic version of of what you're saying and and also the parable where the you know the keeper of the feast says friend go go up higher you know it's not that like if you put yourself there somehow you've you've destroyed the entire dance and yet if you you know offer yourself in humility then you've created the opportunity for that for that philia to be kind of offered there's there's a um a little tossed off comment somewhere in CS Lewis I'm going to forget where he's he says it but he mentions that condescension is this beautiful word that we have spoiled and there's it's a beautiful idea I mean that when I descendo when I go down con with you um or you condescend to me um our or sort of you know maybe it has to do with what Alexis de tocqueville says about Americans that there's a kind of the Mania for uh equality in us that it can kind of be let loose and we have this egalitarian kind of um wrangling that I'm as good as you and nobody is born you know at the natural master of any other and all these things of course you know are true in in a certain sense um and yet as as you say we recognize everywhere around us that there are people with you know greater gifts than us people with other gifts from us or in positions where they for one reason or another you know their Grace consists precisely in um you know lifting us up out of a lower position which you can't celebrate or be grateful for or acknowledge if you insist that you were already in the higher position on the same plane with the person to begin with so this I mean even the way that we use that word condescension as if it were some sort of inherently snide or sneering action when in fact it's the whole basis almost of of Love or at least a certain kind of love I I think I think you've got it right and it's in some ways the because I've talked about I've been talking about hiking for years right and and a lot of people and even because I'm talking about hierarchy sometimes in the wake of Jordan Peterson uh and so Jordan at first was always talking about dominance hierarchies if you remember he doesn't say that anymore by the way but he used to be a part of your influence yeah I don't know but it's like in a ways thank goodness for that but uh I think that real that is one of the Mysteries that Christianity seems to offer which is that Christianity I think is hierarchical but it's properly hierarchical it's like canonic canotically hierarchical which is the idea that we do recognize those that rise up let's say and that become heads Kings you know princes and different in different spheres of reality but that we know like what so the way it's supposed to be at least in the Christian image is that those that rise up give themselves back to those that are below and so the the the notion of like the servant leader it's a bit of a cliche but it I think it has a a very deep structural purpose which is to preserve the the the importance of hierarchy and the inevitability of hierarchy but understand that the proper mode of hierarchy is love right the one that is above loves those that are that are in his body right you know the king loves the loves the people the the husband loves the family loves his wife and so that that that's the type of imagery that's given yeah and I think that I don't see a better solution to the problem of hierarchy than that one yes you know this year I have encountered for the first time and maybe I should be embarrassed that it's the first time that I've encountered Thomas trahern um and I guess by this year I mean last year 2022. um and and this you know kind of uh Mystic uh Vision in his centuries of meditations uh that by truly seeing another uh person or indeed by seeing creation we we possess it we have it in the way that God has all things and this is you know ultimately his his gift for us he foreignt given you the entire world um and and you sort of think well actually no I'm just a schmuck with like you know a house in in Nashville and he says no no by present by giving you eyes he's given you the entire world essentially by giving you a Consciousness that's capable of delighting in uh other things besides yourself God has given you a gift that's fit basically the only otherwise for him and for the angels and I I found this very Illuminating when I went back to a passage in Paul which is sort of cited so often that it's it's very easy to overlook as just a kind of one of those platitudes you know and that is the passage about the body of Christ and you know shall the eye say to the hand because I am uh not a hand I am not part of the body and so forth you know I think I've heard a lot of sermons about that passage that go something like you know everybody has different gifts and isn't that nice you know that we can all do different things in the church and I you know of course that's true and probably a part of what Paul was saying and yet it's it's much more profound than that you know to be to be a member of a body with uh other people and to learn to Delight in them the way that you might Delight in a sunset right you know that um and in some ways think of you know the the talents and Gifts of others as given to you because you know the moment you're able to take the Delight in them rather than you know Envy them or be jealous of them um suddenly they do in in some sense belong to you through that philia through that love um and and it's you know it's achingly beautiful except of course that like it's so hard to do you know that doesn't stop you from then going away and sort of being jealous of people and having that you know Broken Man within but still it's a it's a lovely idea um and so what what what I'm curious a little bit about Marcus have you read did you have a chance to read the book yet do you have read yeah let's go I'd like to hear a little bit based on what we're saying what your what Your perception is in terms of of the some of the the solutions or ideas that Spencer brings about hmm so I think one of the things that really struck me with Spencer was and it started on young Heritage and it's kind of been rearrated in the book but that's true like I your dad who actually says Spencer is that trinitarian structure as a Kenny foundation and how that works out it kind of fractal they kind of can a fractal manner it's that stuck with me and one area I was kind of interested in exploring was how they supplies something you talk about is it how evolution is biological and cultural and it's endless kind of like you said there's no sailing and it seems to be this plays out with Evolution too but how in line with that fractal pattern structure do we come to the kind of original model in this kind of mimetic way and they how does that contrast with the kind of dominant um can a philosophical Darwinism that's materialist and structure doesn't have that figure to actually mimic as a kind of a good and enough that makes sense yeah yeah this is something that I I think first struck me with uh you know when I was when I was reading Renee Gerard of course the you know the great uh Expositor of of my mesis of a certain kind and it does seem to me that you're talking earlier Jonathan about dominance hierarchies you know if if indeed our imitation our symbolic language our mimesis doesn't have some Bedrock have some final model of or frame of reference um then it really is just dominance all the way down you know it then in fact all the reductive things that we were saying aren't true you know that like the there's no ceiling to reality where you know and there's no kind of like uh just pure relation of of dominance and submission um if if you genuinely believe is for instance Richard Dawkins does it like it's it's just replication kind of all the way down um then then the world is basically reduced to a kind of of power play um one of the things I think I say in the book is you know if different texts from Antiquity carry different way to different times which seems sort of obvious except that we have this notion of the Canon right as consisting of certain books and and no others or books having different kind of weight within the hierarchy um and I think you know Jonathan when we met and talked you recovered for me a sense of the urgency for instance of patristic literature right that this is something that you kind of don't get in a like Humanities Western Civ course most of the time and yet uh you know is particularly urgent for all sorts of reasons that we've sort of been Adam braiding it's particularly urgent now um another text that I present in the book as as being sort of newly or freshly urgent is Plato's Timaeus um and you know contrasting uh what a Humanities education would have looked like in the in a medieval University with what a Humanities education in America for the last 100 years has looked like right if an under graduate reads any Plato today in college he probably reads the Republic and probably the Timaeus is like a footnote or something um but of course it's Timaeus is the literary sequel to The Republic in some sense it it transcends the Republic by asking questions that you know predate or go deeper than it um and it it contains I think one of the fullest expressions in a pagan context of the kind of relationships that we've been that I think are most fully revealed But ultimately in in the Christian context um and I think that you know Harry Jaffa has this wonderful line that um the West is is saved or revitalized every time a human heart is saved from The Dark Knight of nihilism and relativism um and this is kind of the premise also of of of my book that you know you've titled a book how to say the west and of course you feel a certain trepidation about like if people are going to look to you for some political program or some you know list of answers um but the point that I'm I'm trying to make in in the book which Marcus I think you you get at really well is like you know actually the you know the the restitution the restoration of of every human heart is the project of of the West and I think the first step to that because very close to everything we've been talking about the first step to that has to be um some recovery of this of the validity of symbols right of of the uh just the the fact that these are not kind of arbitrary or accidental features of our biology but are I think you use the word primary Jonathan that they are in some sense kind of a Bedrock uh of of reality and and you know this is I think expressed very well in in the Timaeus and kind of carried forth um by by these Christian Traditions you've been talking about I think I think you're right I think it is even an interesting way to bind this back to Marcus's like uh comments about the question of of evolution let's say so this is only a Jordan has been bringing up more and more and and some people can see it some people don't don't perceive what he's trying to to say which is that that there's a difference between replication and variation and selection selection is not the same and and with Jordan without using platonic language or using uh Christian language is trying to point to is that that selection implies a good there's no other way around that that all selection implies are good and so the question is well if all selection no matter what level you see it from the the most basic uh you know level of of biology to you know who you decide is the president like from all all these levels uh yeah necessitate at least the notion of the good and so it's as if Darwin without knowing it is bringing back like a kind of metaphysics of quality uh that that then re-inscribes itself right into the system even from the bottom up somehow and that is why I think the idea for example that that's why I think you'd be talking about Jordan again like why Jordan has now moved away from talking about dominance hierarchies to talk about risk reciprocity and hierarchy and how he says it's actually more accurate to say that there's always a kind of reciprocity that that manifests itself in in hierarchies and that let's say that reciprocity is is less apparent maybe in lower levels of life but that as it kind of moves up uh towards Consciousness then becomes more and more apparent uh you know he talks about chims all the time and stuff but that but that this sense in which if we understand these Goods then as we can perceive them right we can see the goods and we can see how they're embedded together and the question is how do they scale up more and more and then we're like from Darwin straight back into Dante like just jump from one to the other and we we ultimately now entered into the ascent of purgatory moving up into the virtues and into the notion of of being itself and it's like I think that that's such it's such a crazy time and it's hard to formulate it for people but I think we're we're getting there like we're kind of we're kind of tossing out ways to formulate it so people can see the strange flip and the flip that's happening is really similar to the Dante flip it's like materialism brought us right away all the way to the bottom right all the way to the bottom where we thought we'd reduce everything to Mechanical causation to to just these chemicals that interact with each other and then right on the flank of the of the devil we find the world turning up turning back and then we find ourselves going back up into a world of selection and quality that leads us you know all the way up the mountain so it's a it's such a weird and fascinating time to to be able to talk about these things wow yeah it's uh that's just beautifully put and it is very difficult to get people to see I I think that because one of the rhetorical moves I think that we performed to get us down to that kind of pure Clockwork that Mechanical Universe was to adopt all sorts of language that implies action but no actor and you see this with the replacement of you know Notions like form and spirit right that you replace those Notions with words like impetus Force momentum right um and these words because of the way I think language sort of calcifies over time you know they they have these dead metaphors inside of them that enable us to trick ourselves into thinking about action and and spirit without will or intention and when you when you really ask people to say well what's behind that language right what is a force what's energy right um they either can't do it or they don't even know what you're asking right these are kind of primary categories they just it just is like I it's like a crackling blue force that moves through the the my picture of the world you know and and this is everywhere in the in the scientific language I mean it's mostly it has a lot to do just as a sort of nerdy linguistic note I think it has a lot to do with the transition from Greek to Latin that Latin as it becomes this kind of erudite language and Associated really with the kind of you know the university um has this kind of clinical tone to it this feeling we can trick ourselves into using it as if there were kind of no consciousness behind any of this action but as as you're saying of course you know the more you chase that down to its nub the the more the action kind of comes in the back door the Consciousness comes in the back door this is what happens what's happening to physics right now you know like as we speak the the physicists are dealing with this problem um and and there is I think you know just the simple observation that right think about like the invention of the word meme right Dawkins writes the selfish Gene he proposes this idea that you know they're not just actually uh physical structures that uh are better or worse at replicating themselves and surviving it's also cultural uh patterns and and practices and modes of behavior and as you say you know there's a smug there's a concept of value smuggled in there there's always a concept of of the good right um and it just so happens that if you want to exclude will and Consciousness from your picture of the world than the only concept of the good available to you is is survival is brute strength or some form of longevity or smarts or cunning or whatever um and people can't can't live that way so there is kind of this I think uh as you say there is this turn now to recognize that if every action implies some some good if there's a standard sort of involved in everything um then there must in fact be some actor behind all these uh action-laden words that that we're using yeah and even if you can if you can see the fractal running all the way through right if you can see the fractal running all the way through then all of a sudden the let's say survivability even survivability so think about it in terms of metaphysics I always kind of want to use meta physical words to talk about this it's like what is what is evolution it is it is it is the tendency of being to persist right it's the tendency of being to be that's that's what evolution is and so if you can nest if you can Nest that together so you think it's like survival I I have to care let's say about my survival but in order for that survival to be at its highest good I also have to have a certain amount of care for those that are subjugated to me because they are in some ways that which make me survive but then I also have to participate adequately in whatever higher structure I'm participating in right so it's like whatever higher structures I'm participating in I have to so if I just become parasitic and I just want what's mine where I am that will not that will in the end like I say at the bigger scale it will not Foster even my own good right you know like we know that because it happens in us right become obsessed with something we just want to have this one thing we think that's what we need and then we what what happens is that the system self destroys and that happens at the level of the individual if an individual just tries to survive in a system without giving up to the system so think about a policeman he just tries to get as much as he can from the system without feeding into the higher participations he's in at some point it's gonna crumble and his own reality is going to crumble so there's a sense in which if you see this if you see this even survival as being embedded all the way up and up Beyond human beings then again you're back in Dante and it's like then the virtues matter then then then the goods that you perceive as the manner in which we come together love honesty all these laws that we have are actually very easily defensible in terms of understanding survivability at higher levels of participation and so that's what I mean like it's this joke like it's almost like a joke to notice how if you if you take all this very seriously and you look at how everything embeds you end up back into a metaphysical Universe from the bottom up I I have a question for uh both of you I mean Marcus if you've got uh thoughts on this jump please jump in I you mentioned and I I really agree with this you mentioned the sort of difficulty of getting these ideas across and I think we can talk about we have been talking about sort of reasons why that might be um I'm wondering about your state of of optimism uh or or lack thereof regarding that I mean because on the one hand it's really easy to just sort of feel like the kind of weight the inertia to use a quasi sort of scientific term right the inertia of this way of thinking is so great that people can't even it's like water they're swimming through or air they're breathing um and yet at the on the other hand you are implying I think and I I feel this too that like there's an inflection point like going on right now you know that there is this kind of uh turn about to happen um or or even in the process of happening where people are kind of you know hitting rock bottom and then going through to the other side when when at that moment when gravity Turns Upside Down you know um and and I wonder you know is that just kind of something that people who like us who get to talk about this stuff we just have to kind of wait that out and keep keep talking about it you know or like what's the uh what's your prognosis on that um well I I think that the best image is to understand it is like the planted seed I think in some ways it's the best way to understand it right the seed is planted in the decomposing of the former world and so I think that we so but while the seed is a seed and while the seed is a is a Little Seedling the world still looks and is still mostly decompo like it's still mostly decomposed and so I think that I so I think that and or even if you understand an image of the solstice for example it's like nobody knows on the day of the solstice that the days are getting longer it's like you know if you know the secret but it is going to take a few weeks before you realize that that light is returning and I think that that's something that something uh like that where we where we are is I think that on the one hand things are going to get a whole lot worse and things are gonna I'm sorry to say I'm sorry to to yeah things are gonna get a lot crazy get ready for 2024 people it's going to be an insane year and there's no way around it okay so so we know that it's going to get worse but I do believe I do still have hope because I do see the seed planted and I do see the seedling kind of hidden in the brush and so so so I and in some ways life is there's a reality to life that's undeniable right it's like I think truth wins in the end and so I do believe that whatever is real will persist ultimately through the through the madness so yeah a uh a statistical projection model on the day of the first solstice would have predicted that states would just get infinitely short until there was no light left on the earth at all right that's right that's right I'm curious about Marcus what do you think I mean because you're also putting so much energy into all of this like what's your what's your prognosis on on where we're going and and yeah yeah be in the interview I'll bring it back to a question quite quickly let's say I'll give a little bit about that so obviously speaking with you gents online and using the benefits of modern technology there's so many ways that it is so positive it's obviously marked for that deep ambiguity that you're referring to there so some of the good friendships that I've developed over the last few years have been true media like this and now thank God I have been able to take that with these events that were planning for Dublin and things like that into a embedded kind of proper communities and then hopefully that will plant those little seeds to go out into the rest of Ireland around the world and I've been blessed to have wonderful events with Paul Kings a lot of people came from Slovakia all these places I've never been to Slovakia how would I meet slovakians it wasn't for things like this but um obviously one thing I appreciate about your work Jonathan both of you guys is that you do talk with this dark side of technology and I've always been struck indelibly by Yvonne election how he describes the kind of Corruption of Christianity so the corruption of the best is the worst you get all these wonderful gifts but then subverted and then I suppose in some ways you just find it to the the opposite of that with these great crises they're the greatest opportunities and Dr Richard back he talks about that at the kind of psychological level too but um I think identifying the question I want I want to ask you guys how you think we can not only can it easily um sustainable way get that virtual reality that relationship with virtual reality and Virtual Technology that we can supplement our real lives with the staple that you're talking about and that's another thing in Spanish book the importance of the body the importance of embodiment being the staple how do we then get it if it might do some knowledge of food how do we get it use these Technologies as supplement so they're not um subverting the kind of or Christian witness yeah yeah yeah don't go too long with that that's a great I think to me like that's a great question and I think you're using the right words that you're using the right words when you talk about technology as supplementarity I think that's the best way to understand it and that's the way that we can understand it where it will play the most positive role that is technology is an extension of embodiment that's what it is it's it's like a it's an extent you know a car is an extension of your body everything that has that all the technes is extension of power on the world right that's what we have now the problem that we're dealing with is really it's weird because it's like it really is in some ways a problem that is well described in the Book of Revelation it's the problem of of an image that speaks right that's the problems the problem of like an extension of you that speaks and so what is what is going what's happening what's going on so all of a sudden it's as if the world of Techni has been is trying to reach into the world of intelligence and is trying to it's kind of like trying to pry at the door of of intelligence uh and we we know all we know like just most of us know that this is of is fascist that this is it's like it's a it's a it's a trick that's being played this is not real but the effect of it on on most of the population seems to be the opposite of that it seems to be a a longing right for the for technology to move into intelligence and think for us you could say or or tell us what to do uh and I think that that's the that in some ways we have a clear image of what the danger is like we have a clear the clearance that you can find and so the the only way for technology to to be useful is only if it acts as that extension and like a extension that's far away and so you you talked about that before market so it's like my priority is my is my spiritual life my family my community and then that can reach out into the extensions that technology affords me but the hierarchy has to be in the right order and I'm not saying that telling you that I've succeeded in doing that it's very difficult but I think that that's that that's the that's the proper hierarchy and if we have it in in that proper hierarchy technology can actually be a great Boon because it does extend us like it really does like the message that I'm saying I never could have been speaking to so many people you know a thousand years ago there's no way and so it's like so it does have a great power that we could that that can be used properly if it's in the right place foreign there was this moment uh last year with this Google engineer his name was Blake Lemoyne or Lemoine and I'm not sure how you say it but he basically convinced himself that the language learning and replicating software he'd been working on Lambda for Google their their version of chat gbt basically like this app for just AI generation of of text um he convinced himself that this program was a lot news program that he had helped to build and he staged this long still available online this long uh interview with Lambda to prove that it had come to life and it shouldn't be turned off because it had a right to life and it involves things like you know what do you think of as your soul do you have a soul and what's your soul like and yes I have soul and would come back to him with all of these things that it knew he wanted to hear right because this is sort of how this stuff works it takes in patterns of speech and then it spits them back out in new combinations very clever ways um and there was something very sort of tragic and heartbreaking about it because the the concept of the soul that this program had was almost identical it was like the perfect version of like a Silicon Valley kind of you know Guru like flirting with Buddhism it's a Stargate it's like this you know a very a radiating ball of energy whatever um and so it was just obviously a mirror he's obviously looking in a mirror that talks back at him and this moment I cannot get this moment out of my head because before that I think I had this very silly idea that like there's two kinds of idolatry there's the old-timey kind of idolatry in the the Hebrew Bible where you know Isaiah says a man cuts down a tree he chops it in half he makes half of it into a God he burns the other half for firewood and then he bows down before this this sculpture right that you know his eyes but cannot see it has uh ears but cannot hear and and the worshipers become like they too their eyes cannot see their ears counted and I thought but then we got too smart for that and we you know stopped falling for that self-deception and instead now we have the new kind of idolatry which is like a sort of abstract ideology we will idolize money we idolize the economy we idolized security Comfort whatever um and watching this guy talk to this thing which his own hands had made uh and attributing to it Consciousness right sort of imputing uh an independent life that could tell him things that he didn't know to it I was like oh no it's all the old kind of idolatry there's only one kind of idolatry and it just because it persists right it's like the human heart Factory vitals um and this is a very long-winded way of saying like I I think this point about techne as you know that almost are the the form that our mind applies to it is as important as the form that it actually has in in reality right the conceiving of it as an extension of ourselves um has a very important corollary which is that if there's an extension of something then that thing has a kind of Baseline right there to even think of something as an addition or an attribute or something um is to propose implicitly that there is some core to reality and unless we recover this embodied sense of the core of reality um we'll never use technology properly so it ironically like the the way in is like daily practice of extremely basic stuff rare right you know cooking for people uh turning your phone off and and like having an interaction with your spouse these things are you know they sound so simple they're so difficult to do but the reason that they they matter is like that mustard seed right I mean you were talking about this I think like one of the things about a seed is that it has a particular kind of food or nourishment that's proper to it that wouldn't be proper to the fully grown entity so you know if we are in this stage of kind of embryonic like nascent realization self-realization um then it might not be the case that like tomorrow we're gonna wake up in Dante's Paradise like we have to you have to go through those stages of development first and we think that oh we're beyond all this but actually you know these very basic practices like wake up in the morning you know get on your knees and pray and then like make yourself an actual physical like meal that you eat like um these these things are are so important precisely because they root you in the proper kind of starting point from which you can then Branch out and and use technology I mean that seems like the whole task ahead of us in some ways yeah that makes that makes sense that makes so much sense and you see it like if I always say there are two images of technology in in the Book of Revelation one is the Beast and the image of the Beast and the system of the Beast you know the naming and all that stuff and then the other one is the Heavenly Jerusalem and the Heavenly Jerusalem has the order that you mention right at the what's at the middle of the Heavenly Jerusalem it's a tree and the Water of Life the tree of life and the Water of Life are at the at the center of the Lamb is at the center and then you have a wall on the outside right you have Techni there on the outside but it is it it it's on the outside it's not it's not in the middle right and it has the proper order related to what is the priority and then what is what is secondary so I definitely agree with that so I'm actually curious how this applies to two particular types of media that you have both kind of worked with so one being movies for yourself I suppose Jonathan and to video games for yourself Spencer and your dad's recent video and video games I thought was most interesting to do very helpful for understanding that you kind of described it as a new high art in line with painting and things in the past so I'm wondering how so if I know from my experience I've used some of your videos teaching kids in school and that Jonathan and they I the point of entry was really true movies Logan commentaries things like that and then they could come to the mountain to see the biblical patterns through that but I'm conscious of what you just say it's better about people's starting and this kind of very secular secularized world they're gonna make those things first how do we then um use those for ministry as it were and and you have them like the walls outside does that make sense I think I mean so I mean I think that's the way to understand it I don't have like I don't have a problem with secular cultural manifestations but I think it's all about hierarchy you know it's actually a hierarchy that is there in the very form of those social those cultural manifestations which is that there's a difference between entertainment and true participation there's a difference of level of participation between the type of participation you have in the video game and the type of participation you have in your family and it's like if the order can be preserved you know it's like the difference between participation in a game and participation in liturgy you know there's a hierarchy of participation that exists but you know a game definitely has a cosmic form and the the video games so much so like video games are are little microcosms they kind of have to be because they're they have to condense so many things into a into a universe or a world that can be grasped and so they can sometimes actually shine very brightly because they they have to like they have to condense everything they have to have a clear hierarchy of progression they have to have a clear hierarchy of characteristics that you will embody in order to advance and they you know there has to there's all these structures that have to be uh that have to be put into the game for you to care about it uh and so you can find quite quite a bit in that and the same with movies the difficulty that we have of course is you know our world is upside down and so we think that culture is movies like we think that that's what culture is like culture is you know dance is not dancing dancing is watching the ballet right and and and and stories are it's not something that you should engage in and participate in but it's just something you should sit down with the tub of popcorn and watch so and there's nothing wrong with doing that I think it's just about it's about hierarchy hmm yeah you know this problem with video games which uh you are sort of alluding to Jonathan which is that people are hypnotized by them you know because I I'm a great lover of video games and have defended their proper place in that hierarchy you know and I'm kind of on the hook for this you know so it's like people come to me all the time with like well my son plays six hours of video games at a stretch right and I my usual answer to this is like well you know Plato would would like a word because just because something is art doesn't mean it's necessarily good for you and it's not necessarily good for you in all those those quantities right um and and I think that this is um you know I went to this concert uh of Final Fantasy music here at the Nashville Symphony and it was really beautifully done and they had these you know thick and kind of played uh video from the game as they as they played the score and you know that is certainly a little Universe a kind of imaginative Universe which um draws these very dreamlike associations between things and and um is clearly working out some sort of idea precisely about the role of of Technology the kind of threat that technology poses to our imaginations to um the kind of Heroes Quest you know um and so it's obvious that something is going on here that we would be sort of foolish to deny um and yet as we have known for a long time or you know people who think about this stuff no like art is radioactive material you Handle With Care right and it has a kind of seductive power uh as precisely because of its uh importance for us it's it's how to put it it's kind of weapons grade emotion you know and and um I I think that uh I love that weapons great emotion that's awesome I mean this is like I came this is the term that I I was trying in grad school to kind of Express like what Plato thinks about music and I think that's kind of it you know weapons great emotion is like it's just straight into your veins you know um and you know Augustine has this wonderful comment in book 10 of the confessions where he's reviewing his passions and his appetites and obviously he's had this tremendous struggle with his sexual appetite which he's now kind of overcome but that approach that he uses he has this wonderful Insight that the approach he used for his sexual appetite which was effectively to quit Cold Turkey um is actually not uh applicable to every situation in which you might feel desires or over indulge in things um and the classic example of this is food like there is a problem which is that we eat too much because we like the taste of food um and Augustine puts this as like you know the your your desires outstrip your health the object what's objectively good for you um and yet God has made it so that we can't just say well I'm just not gonna eat right because you will die and and so you're actually forced into a relationship of Engagement and therefore Mastery right you're if you're going to survive in this world um you can't simply renounce your passions you actually have to affirm them and gain Mastery over them and understand that even though they seem very powerful they their proper place is actually beneath your reason is actually in objection to the governing principle the hegemonicon you know the thing in you that uh you know is sort of most closely connected to the Divine uh logos and and I think that you know we're in this position right now with a lot of our tech and and with a lot of our art video games are a great example it's like you know you are um being offered something that you can't deny you can't it it's it's no solution to just say well scrap this all together ban it kick it out of the Public's figure because it just is bad for us um and yet it precisely because it so obviously has Excellence uh it's the kind of Excellence that it has is is um something you need to Handle With Care and learn to exercise self-control over which is a daily a daily practice but it's like there's there's really God I think God has put us in a position where there's no other way out basically is what I'm trying to say that's a good it's a and we're right back in Dante you know again is it's always about you know the way that Dante frames all his his story is that it's all about mishandling of goods things that are not but nothing things are not bad in themselves it's just about having them in their their proper place and in some ways it's like it's the role of mediation to some extent to be always dangerous like all mediations towards the highest good are dangerous because they're not the highest good but that's also how the world works it's like without without that there's no world like the world is the mediation of goods into multiplicity and so the the very fact that multiplicity is there you know is both as great opportunity to have this ladder of goods that you can participate in but it's always like you said it's always a danger because you can always mistake you know the the the the step of the ladder for the final place you're going so um so I think that yeah but it's true that we are in a position right now where we're so assaulted it's it is more difficult because you know we are assaulted by very sophisticated um you know very sophisticated stimuli and and things that try to kind of gather gain our attention from us um so we we it's difficult but for sure that's the battle that we have that's our generation's battle is somebody's a battle of attention like what what is going to get our attention and how much of it of it are we going to give to to different things um yeah it's um it is remarkable how often it comes back to Dante and how often just in general the Middle Ages seem to have something for us that they they maybe Haven't You Know spoken quite so urgently to to Generations before hours but I mean this um I like that the the battle for attention who was it you were telling me uh when we hung out that uh somebody says that Christ on the cross creates the world yeah same accident says that I'm sure other people say that but same access definitely said that Christ he was as he when he was on the cross he was creating the world which is yeah yeah well it's I mean there's this problem in so many ways but I think it's profound for this reason as well which is that as you're saying right like the the very creation of a POS the possibility to choose good creates this negative space right creates this void and like there's no living life without you know touching or exposing yourself to the possibility of overindulgence because the things the very things that are good for you are capable of being overindulged and I think like the to understand Creation The Very notion that God would ever create something other than himself kind of implies that out of love right out of his sheer just Superfluous desire for you to be around if I can put it this way like he's going to create something other than himself so that you can choose him and it's like the the crucifixion the the agony of the Cross is bound up in that first moment in the you know the very choice to to create it all hmm yeah that's definitely that's definitely and it and it does in some ways and again it solves the same problem it solves the problem of hierarchy like the cross just solves like what do we lift up right and it says you know we lifted up it's like lifting up and it's a man being tortured and crucified that's what's being lifted up so it kind of brings it into an into the saporia um of what hierarchy means in the Christian sense uh yeah for sure the crosses it's hard to talk about that the cross it just just destroys you every time you start to talk about it yeah yeah um well I mean the analogy with the serpent in the desert if that's if an algae is the the word I want right like yeah the um I I think I mentioned this to you at some point this um the discovery that hit me the first time I read the gospels in Greek um which is always when people say like why do you learn Asian languages what's the point of any of it why why would you like aren't there good translations um I realized when I read the gospels in Greek that I I had never understood the Christian concept of forgiveness um because Greek has two words for forgiveness one of which uh is is quite common at least in classical Antiquity and that's like the the knowledge alongside somebody I understand why you did this um but the gospels so far as I know never used that word which would have been very normal and natural to use for cassid or for forgiveness or whatever the you know Hebrew concept is that they're translating and uh instead they use this word AFI Ami and a Festus is the noun and that's uh Apple away and hear me I Cast Away right I throw away and when you when you actually forgive somebody you might not understand why they did anything at all right you you in fact you you cast it away you make it of no account um and this is also the word that I think Luke uses for giving up the spirit on the cross when he gave up his his ghost he afiyami um and so that act of forgiveness which is the same as the act of separating your very soul from your body in some sense or yourself from yourself um yeah that you're right this is like a talking about this just kind of dissolves one into a blubbering Heap but it is very uh yeah it's the answer to everything and so what so I'm curious about so what do you like what's your what are your hopes for the for the book like what what do you what do you hope to Foster oh well thank you for for asking that um you know I first and foremost uh I I hope that people can gain a sense of ownership over the uh classical tradition over the the text of the of the Canon um but also over their um their intuitions of that which is more than you know mirror matter that which is is immeasurable but real um and and that's kind of the extended argument of the book that's how I concluded is that you know we've been talked out of our intuitions we've been talked out of our I mean the kind of Internet version of this is like what's your source for that right what's your source for being in love with that person what's your source for uh you know the beauty of that Sunset um and so there's kind of two forms of ownership that I think I'm I'm trying to uh afford to people or at least to give people permission to to have ownership of their um of their intuitions of their of their subjective experience of the world uh understood as we've been discussing it here um but also over the uh textural Traditions that come down to us that can kind of Shepherd us through this in in in a much richer and more humane way than I think a lot of our current kind of gurus and ideologues can can offer I you know the experience of young Heretics really drove this home to me even though I probably would have before I did the podcast I probably would have said like oh yeah the classics are for everybody you know you can Aristotle is just a book about how to be good at being human you know um and I I think that I said that but it was only when people started reaching out to me and saying like I'm on my tractor and I'm thinking about the Nicki McKean ethics because you told me to like that's kind of that's that's the end goal here that's what I I you know I I think that people have been scared away from this for all sorts of reasons political reasons intellectual reasons uh reasons of power and money um and and the hope for for the book is that it will give people a little bit of of ownership over those traditions that's great it's a great it's a great uh let's say yeah it's a great project thanks thanks for being along the uh along with me on this this this desire let's say oh well thank you I it's a pleasure and an inspiration to to talk to you as usual and by the way there's some people who are
