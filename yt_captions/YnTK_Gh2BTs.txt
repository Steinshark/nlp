ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the air things Masters this is the first tournament in the Champions chess tour 2023 the double elimination bracket style which I still cannot really wrap my head around but I am trying to do my best and today we have our winners bracket final which is Magnus Carlson versus Hikaru Nakamura just like we all expected all right just like when the Golden State Warriors were an absolute Juggernaut in basketball all right we knew they were going to play in the finals we knew that these guys were going to play in the finals as well however their usernames are not Fabiano caruana and Aquarium 76. uh this will be the appetizer game of the day and then we will take a look a long hard look at the battle between Magnus and Hikaru allow me to provide you with an appetizer game friendly reminder that this is not the end of the event because we still have the losers bracket and then we have the Grand Final Etc all right I wanted to show you one more game because this is one of the most insane games I've ever seen sit back relax enjoy the next 20 to 25 minutes of your flight to the promised land of Chess Recaps I will be your captain I am your captain I won't be your captain I am your captain all right Fabiano caruana is playing aquarium 76 because the other 75 were taken uh his opponent is from Uzbekistan and this game was nuts because it began with a Queen's Gambit declined defense it was Queen A4 check hitting the bishop in the night and then it was a line that I've never seen in my life where black does this and then E5 exploding the center of the board and then it just went completely crazy Fabi took upon he got his Queen attacked Queen F6 threatened Checkmate that has just literally mate now the bishop came out with threats of Knight C2 and Fabi played A3 Knight C3 that guy sacked his Knight did this got in and then Fabi took on d52 now apparently this is all Theory you wouldn't you couldn't tell that because Bobby's up five minutes on the clock but this has all been played before uh and White's King just stands here and it's like you got no setup ons got no dark squared Bishop your other Knight is gone this Knight is in jail this bishop is stuck defending it actually black has nothing and throughout this game Fabi was just like making moves just making normal moves but then Fabi played Queen G1 to I guess try to play for G4 G5 stuff and black black immediately got in with his Queen and things were looking very very dangerous I mean this king is like on the verge of mate so in order to try to create counter play following play G4 and then Rook F1 a move that is unpinning the rook and really really ugly black played B5 breaking down the center then Rook D5 then took then took on B5 this is mate that is made in one move Queen C3 position looks absolutely horrible white has five dark squared pawns and a dark squared Bishop I mean I don't know what you can play here the computer does the computer wants you to play H5 to make sure that there's no back rank made and if this to play Rook B8 and start some sort of monster attack the guy goes here though yakuboyev and Fabi now plays A4 and in this position suddenly has a big attack himself like he's cultivating G5 and so on and H4 I mean he's got the whole the whole house going well you know King is just on D2 the king's just on D2 the whole game like like this is normal G5 take H5 uh oh now you can't stop me oh wait yes you can Rook F6 but now Rook G1 oh oh King is running check though Rook blocks Queen take oh King f8 ran into a fork Queen B4 hits both and fabi's King survives the absolute apocalypse uh and now he just goes to an end game where he's got an extra bishop and that is more than enough at this level of Chess to win you would probably need like four more Bishops and uh many many checks later Bobby walked up the board promoted his pawn and black resigned what a game King D2 Knight A1 and let's just play chess I just have a king in the center of the board normal stuff just typical day in the office for a 2800 level Grand Master and Fabi will play in the final of division uh two he is not in division uh one but that's okay I mean there's a lot of a lot of players okay Magnus and Hikaru that's why you're all here let's go I will take you through the story of this match so Magnus began game one by the way is he ever going to change his profile photo his profile photo is play Magnus but they were acquired by Chelsea I don't know maybe he'll just permanently have that make like a nice little photo like in the mountains like Hikaru that'd be nice all right game one begins and this one already krakalackin Catalan style uh for white but this is called like the symmetrical grunfeld you give up the pawn you get it back and early on Magnus had you know these nights in the center he's got these Bishop that was terrible and the reason that Hikaru is not taking and so on is because he has to deal with this so now we get this position a big trade and basically black is down upon and he's going to try to win it back with Knight E4 and Knight A6 and Knight D7 and Rook C8 and the bishop is very strong and white is going to say all right you want the pawn back come and get it come and get it but actually you gotta get this Pawn B4 fascinating idea point is you Gambit that pawn instead to create a target with the Knight and now you play A3 and Knight C6 back is nice takes takes and here the computer wanted Magnus either to trade Rooks or to play Rook B7 and go for that pawn but instead Magnus played Rook B6 which is still fine and he got a position after a massive sequence of exchanges that look like this Magnus knew this was a win Magnus knew that after the moves Knight C4 A4 King F3 King E3 he must be winning why is white winning the engine only says plus one because the engine is inaccurately giving an endgame evaluation why is white so much better here because in positions that have material equality and symmetrical equality like you know everything is the same in the end game the person who has much clearer targets who can Target their opponent's weaknesses and a much more active set of pieces like a king White's King is right next to the epicenter this dude is drunk he's just asleep in the corner like he somebody wake him up all right because he gotta get in the action and that's what Magnus he knew that I mean he knew when the whole exchange happened right hikaru's got to defend this position though so hikara plays F5 to try to block out White's King and here comes magnus's King running and he gets there but up not so fast you can't take my Pawn just yet all right you can't take my Pawn because you're gonna lose your knight now here was the first moment magma should have apparently just played Knight B2 and he's just going to win the pawn and it's a really really bad Pawn to win because it's an a pawn that's a really bad Pawn to lose it's worse for Hikaru if that pawn was over here it would be a lot easier to defend against but it's not now something really weird happens check and Magnus doesn't take now I don't know what happened here I'm sure that as the goat he has an explanation uh it wasn't a mouse live I don't think he slipped I think he just didn't like something about this maybe he didn't like some infiltration of Black's Knight but that doesn't make any sense because F3 maybe he didn't like that the king is so active just in the way of everything you know maybe he didn't see a Way Forward very well could be he just he didn't see a way that you know F4 is coming all of us I don't know he decided to wait and Hikaru just hung onto the pawn he's like all right you can't have my Pawn anymore and then Hikaru pushed all his Pawns and I mean it was a Mad Dash it was not a very accurate game toward the end they both had 10 seconds on the clock but this is just a draw this is just a draw because you will get this Pawn you will run to the pawn and while white it wasn't the cleanest draw or anything but once white gets there black is just gonna hang out they're just gonna hang out like you can win this over here I'm gonna go win that and I'm gonna sacrifice my night for your Pawn make no mistake you can lose this game all right you can lose this game by blundering a nightfork all right Knight F3 King C6 95 check boom night Fork it's a winning King and pawn end game King Shields and okay I can't draw arrows because jaws.com has 30 million people on it at any given moment so all the servers are down but uh the point is Right King E5 King F6 King F7 um but that doesn't happen and they just end up drawing uh there was a uh I think it was Peter lecko who said Magnus Carlson would have won this game against any other human on the planet any other human Hikaru is the best defender in the world it's not close I think Magnus is second but I still think Hikaru is like Far and Away the best defender in the world to watch him save a position that Magnus would beat most people in after three four like I think if you gave Magnus this position against me I don't know I mean you'd need like probably 10 beers for me to draw this with black maybe more you know I I I really it's only Hikaru can do this like he can defend in the most annoying way and just survive so Magnus can't win this game he's just unable to break through we gotta go to game two game two was the weirdest game I've ever seen Hikaru play like honestly why because Magnus played a fiancado and then played a double fee in keto which he has played recently played this in the last round of Tata steel and it's like you kind of maybe knew this was coming nothing about what Hikaru did in this game made sense to me as a viewer not as a player I'm not better than him when I say it didn't make sense to me it's like when you watch the game and you don't understand you guys have been there you watch a Hikaru or a Magna streaming like how do they do this to people why did Hikaru play Knight bd2 like there are some positions where the Knight goes to D2 like in the London but the Pawn's here right I mean I would have expected you know Knight C3 I think he was trying to play something unique he was trying to take Magnus somewhere into the forest somewhere all right but he played Knight D2 and then he played Knight B3 and Anish giri tweeted this position and went that's the official random world champion why because he's teasing he's teasing the fact that what why is the Knight on B3 and it only went from bad to worse Bishop G5 take take A5 E5 and I was like wait this is like and then Hikaru took and I mean the computer was all over this it was like it's minus one and the guy's down four minutes that's what I'm saying it's one of the weirdest games I've ever seen from Hikaru like you almost wish you can illegally adjust the Knight you know in tournaments you say I you know adjust you touch the piece you don't you're just trying to it's like just you just cheat you know Slide the Knight over to C3 from where I can go to D5 but why is the Knight there I mean it can't go anywhere and I was like what is what is this game and Hikaru you know put the other night on C3 because some Knight had to be on C3 and then put an iron D5 and night before Magnus traded Knights to open his a file I mean it looked like that's it I mean C5 lockdown Bishop F6 but then Hikaru played A3 and he started breaking out of the position and then he played this move that move lost the game Bishop D7 loses it loses to a little sequence Queen E7 hits the bishop attacking the rook and it threatens Bishop C3 where the Rook now needs to abandon the defense of the bishop because if you go here I just go here and your Bishop is stuck you can't take because this you can't move anything so Queen E7 winning just winning I mean it just it's winning like the alternative to that is black just wins this pawn and then goes on to win the game later and Magnus plays King G7 and folks when I tell you if you don't beat Hikaru in the only moment in the game that you get to beat him you'll never beat him A4 H4 A5 and Hikaru comes back from the absolute depths of Chess hell he's not even worse he's not even worse I mean that like that game was just about what I mean you know I'm sorry if I play like this I'm gonna lose all my games all my games Hikaru is just a defensive God like yes Magnus missed this chance I think in this game in particular probably it's more Magnus missing his chance than Hikaru being like like the first game was just unreal defending this game was like okay if Magnus plays Queen E7 probably it's just right it's just a one move thing but Hikaru doesn't lose just to draw how nuts they drew a little I mean unreal crazy stuff crazy stuff now we have game three game three we have a Bozo Indian BOGO Indian uh C5 this line very interesting line where black damages their Pawns but the position is actually shockingly resilient and just develops A5 nice bind on the queen side you can trade like this but because black gets the activity on the a file it actually offsets the weaknesses of these pawns they are very ugly and like the double b pawns but there's no way to attack them and uh he's just active very active play here Knight E4 very nice idea from Hikaru effortless effortlessly holds Magnus the point is that after this I'm gonna take the queen first I'm not gonna take the Knight and lose my Bishop and uh yeah uh they repeat moves you say what the heck was that well what the heck was that is that was just a solid game that was what that was I mean that was Hikaru holding with black you know Magnus went for Knight F3 Hikaru played super super nice line in the BOGO Indian and uh neutralized effortlessly and then they played game four Hikaru was white and I was like oh look a Berlin ah no not a Berlin but do any of you have any idea which Spanish Magnus plays Magnus likes to play the Spanish with black which one does he play trivia no none of you have any idea you're just here because I stare at the camera because I put Magnus on the thumbnail because you like to laugh at my hairline and you like to make jokes in my comment section absolutely understand have a great day I said understand have a great day not understandable have a great day anyway Magnus likes to play the Marshall all right in the Marshall Sicilian I mean in the Marshall Rue Lopez the d-pawn doesn't move it goes to D5 straight away it doesn't go to D6 the point is that black gambits the pawn on E5 to create this powerful Central post and then go like this with the Bishops and the Queen and what that gives you is a very aggressive position with Queen H4 and so on however Hikaru came very well prepared played rookie 4 which is the right move trying to go here and kick out the queen and to the untrained eye this looks nothing short of just you know two five hundreds after a work day like you know two dudes playing chess against each other uh but uh no actually it's a very legitimate line and here white has the option to play on with Bishop to E3 but Hikaru says Nope I am forcing a draw time for Armageddon the way Armageddon works is that two guys bid all right they are bidding they say I will play with this amount of time with black I bid nine minutes so I want to play Black and I will bid nine minutes and I will start with 9 Minutes versus 15 minutes however in Armageddon there's no bonus time no bonus time so when you are down seven minutes you are down seven minutes and now came the most absurd moment in the Rivalry of Hikaru Magnus I might have ever seen kikaru bid eight minutes and 59 seconds why because he thought Magnus is going to bid nine minutes he he was like I think Magnus will want nine minutes to 15 I'm in a bid 859 this man Magnus Carlson Soul reads Hikaru like Daniel negranu does in poker compilations how he just like says you have King Nine Magnus bid ate 58. that's nuts that is the coolest thing I what he knew Hikaru was gonna bid 859 he bids 858 that is absurd so Magnus plays Black and in a match that's this close you do not want to play with white because you just you have to win you have to win black house draw odds in Armageddon so when black is down time but draws the game black wins time for Armageddon look at this eight it's fit it's 15 for white and it's well he took three seconds on the first move but it's 8.58 this is crazy I mean that is a massive deficit of time but I got news for you that's a lot of time nine minutes is a lot of time all right and Hikaru played exactly the right opening you got more time you got to play a locked structure let's close it up all right we're playing a reverse Kings Indian we have A4 we have Knight A3 Knight comes out Bishop comes out and Hikaru plays in a way that's very cagey very maneuvering like very closed maintaining his five minute time Advantage all right castles H4 Bishop comes out and now we have a trade so Hikaru is going to rely on this and this and putting the Rook here and Magnus is going to rely on the queen Side and being solid and meeting Hikaru when he gets there and here comes Hikaru and his position was nice take take Queen C7 Knight to H1 there was a really really engine-like idea here to sacrifice your e-pawn and then do this this is so scummy now the bishop can't move the bishop can't move and the Knight is going to E4 something like this where white completely locks the center door and is like all right time to attack boop boop boop boop boop boop boop just everybody completely locked position Hikaru is a person though he's not a you know boot machine like stockfish so he plays Knight H1 Knight H1 is defending this and right around here I actually thought okay Hikaru is going to win this is a perfect position for Armageddon up five minutes you now have to play H5 like you have a beautiful attacking potential here one problem the guy on the other side is Magnus like how do you beat Magnus right Magnus plays Bishop E6 and right here I think there was another moment uh take take I think the engine really wanted Hikaru to do this to play with the h-pawn but it's still not easy I mean it's not over and because Hikaru hesitated now Magnus immediately finds F5 that's a very important move it's an important move because if you take it uh I now have my Rook on the sixth rank to defend myself and suddenly you're actually under attack even though you thought you were attacking me uh and if you lock the center then I just go back and again close position benefits the guy playing for a draw right so H5 gh5 and right here Hikaru actually lost the game he lost the game to a very disgusting tactic a very very disgusting tactic which in a weird way Magnus kind of maybe saw but maybe not I guess he didn't see it because if he saw it he would have played what he played there's Knight takes E5 and the point is that after F takes C5 this is a clearance sacrifice you clear out the C6 Square for the queen but it's not the check that matters it's the teaming up with your Rook laterally Rook H6 stuff ah no sorry not Rook H6 Rook takes G3 Rook takes G3 wait but then why is King H2 so good F F4 first and then Rook H6 okay yes F4 first and Rook H6 yes you block this wow okay again I just thought it was Queen C6 Rook H6 I forgot there was a bishop covering that's why I commentate the games that's why they play the games uh but Knight E5 Queen C6 and then F4 disconnecting that Rook H6 idea uh Magnus had to see that uh but again he's not playing for wins he just plays Knight P4 so again and uh that's it I mean Hikaru now has to try to find a way through but Magnus takes a pawn and he just comes back so now Magnus is a pawn up Hikaru is still playing against you know the clock a little bit but Magnus trades the queen and he's just gonna get another Pawn Hikaru is doing his best but unfortunately the time Gap gets closer and closer and Magnus just brings the king and he's upon up his Pawn is super strong and you know what happens when white doesn't win in the Armageddon the other guy wins in fact Magnus was like -4 and he was like I'm not playing D2 I'm not risking anything I'm playing Rook takes A6 putting my Rook here and this is just unwinnable for white you just can't win this it's not winnable for black it's not winnable for white and we got this we got this pawns fell off the board and right here the guys agreed to a draw because uh it's a draw you could say why didn't Hikaru try to flag him because you're not it black is playing for the win like uh you know so Magnus wins the first matchup uh taking a page out of uh hikaru's Playbook um and the Hikaru Playbook is not winning a game in a match that you win yesterday Hikaru didn't win a game five draws including one in Armageddon and this time Magnus gets a win in Armageddon all I gotta say is I really feel like Armageddon is a lot of fun but I really don't feel like if you're trying to put chess on a TV five draws are fun Marshall draws are fun it's hard it just can be boring if you're not that interested in it right like if every football match in a series was drawn or zero zero or one one people would be like is this you know it's hard chess is hard anyway Magnus wins Hikaru now has to play the winner of Wesley's well whatever the brackets in the description but he has to play the winner between uh Eric icy and Wesley so so Eric I see and Wesley so the winner plays Hikaru if Hikaru beats that person or that person beats hicaro they move up to play against Magnus and that is how the Grand Final is decided and if Magnus loses in that Grand Final then they do a grand final reset I I think God help me I don't understand double illumination I'll see you in the next video get out of here
