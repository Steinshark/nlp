not too long ago skillsoft reported the top paying 
certifications in tech and i really want to take   you through what those certifications are but 
also and more importantly what they really entail   this is for anyone who's looking to bump 
up their salary maybe get a new job kind   of advance their career and also have the salary 
to go with it before we get into it though make   sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech 
and coding related videos shout out to some of   these subscribers here thank you for all your love 
you all are just amazing let's get right into it okay before we get into it though it's really 
important for me to share where this data is   coming from this is a skillsoft survey and 
they surveyed over 3 700 u.s respondents   who participated in the global 
knowledge i.t skills and salary survey   so this is data that is based from the u.s from 
3 700 respondents obviously these certifications   how in demand they are will vary based on where 
you are located uh your employer what specific   industry and tech you are in getting more niche 
but i really wanted to share this with you if   you are someone who's entering the new year and 
wanting to level up okay let's start from number   10 and work our way up to number one number 10 
on the list is a vmware certified professional   data center virtualization the average salary 
for someone who has this certification is 132   947 also i want to mention once again these 
are all u.s numbers so u.s salary and u.s   data so what exactly is this certification it 
sounds really complex well it's pretty much what   it sounds like when you break it down so it's 
a certification designed to demonstrate your   technical ability or technical competency with 
vmware vsphere and also related technologies   okay for those of you who are like tiffany what is 
vmware what does that even mean maybe you're new   to the tech industry breaking into it or maybe 
you're not and you're just like what the heck is   it vmware allows for businesses to run multiple 
applications and operating system workloads on   one server so let's kind of get into an example 
of that so when you think of it you can think of   creating a virtual machine that behaves like an 
actual computer so it's a virtual machine that   behaves like an actual computer so this is really 
great for example in development work when you are   trying to test your code on different platforms 
uh this is something that you can utilize coming   in at number nine on the list is cisa or certified 
information systems auditor the average salary for   this certification is 134 460. also fun fact 
this is one of the oldest certifications it's   actually been around since 1978 which is pretty 
crazy okay but now your question is which was   kind of my question to be honest is what do 
they do what is this certification used for   so a cisa audits reviews of computer information 
systems and performs you know detailed or   in-depth evaluations of them it's pretty much what 
you would think of when you think of an auditor   but for technical companies for technical 
roles for different computer systems according   to the global knowledge report to achieve a 
certification candidates must pass the cisa exam   which consists of five different domains this 
is a hard exam to pass and i definitely think   it's well it is for someone who's already 
in the tech industry so the five uh areas or   five domains i guess you could say are auditing 
information systems governance and management   of it information systems acquisition development 
and implementation information systems operation   maintenance and service management and number five 
is protection of information assets so as you can   see there is a lot to the certification and it's 
definitely for someone who's pretty familiar with   the tech industry and really has a strong career 
in it coming in at number eight is ncp mci uh   multi-cloud infrastructure the average salary 
for this is 142 810 so that's the annual salary   uh and this certification is to really recognize 
a professional a working professional skills   and abilities to deploy administer and 
troubleshoot this technology so when   you think of this certification how i kind of in 
simple terms or terms that i understand understand   the certification is it's kind of like they say a 
lot of places online it's like a badge of honor to   really recognize your skills that you've acquired 
to deploy manage and optimize enterprise cloud   no surprise here a lot of the certifications on 
this list are cloud related as cloud continues   to be one of the more in-demand skills or areas of 
skills coming in at number seven let's talk about   project management i feel like i'm a game show 
for now coming in at number seven you know listen   we're talking about technical certifications we 
have to make it kind of fun here or else it can   get kind of dry you know what i'm saying okay so 
number seven is project management professional   the average salary for this certification is 148 
thousand nine hundred and six dollars and you can   guess here this is what it sounds like it's all 
about project management project managers are such   a huge part of teams and companies that really as 
it says they manage the project this certification   for anyone who is looking to get into the area 
of project management is one of the most highly   regarded certifications for pms so if you are 
looking to start a career in the product not   looking to start because you already should 
have some experience for this certification   but if you are looking to really get that next 
salary increase or maybe move companies or get   that next title whether it be senior or just 
have some credibility taking the certification   will really help get you there coming in at number 
six is the certified information security manager   the average salary for this is 149 246 dollars 
and this certification is pretty much what it   sounds like information security manager so 
this is for anyone who really wants to gain   another certification that's looking to become 
management or really grow their career in it   so online it says it's an advanced certification 
which indicates that an individual possesses the   knowledge and experience required to develop and 
manage an enterprise information security program   so you are possessing the knowledge to manage and 
develop enterprise or i.t security information   basically showing you kind of know what 
you're doing in it okay number five on the   list is certified information systems security 
professional the average salary is 151 853   this certificate really highlights and promotes 
that you have a lot of expertise in cyber security   so if you are someone in cyber security or 
looking to get into cyber security you will   need experience in it first before taking this 
certification but it's definitely one that once   again will really enhance your career coming in at 
number four on the list is certified in risk and   information systems control the average salary 
for this certification is 151 995 dollars and   this certification is really all about validating 
your experience in building a well-defined agile   risk management program and this is coming from 
the crisc certification website itself they say   it's based on best practices to identify analyze 
evaluate assess prioritize and respond to risks   so once again as you can see a trend here it's 
between cloud and security coming in on number   three i'm sure there's no surprise this is on the 
list which is aws certified solutions architect   this one i'm talking about is the associate 
so one of the first ones it is the first one   you have to take the average salary is a hundred 
and fifty nine thousand and thirty three dollars   this is an amazing certificate something that i 
studied for i actually never ended up taking the   exam i need to i studied for a long time for 
it and then work got in the way but um it's a   really in-demand certificate and you can really 
continue to build on it so as it kind of says in   the name this certificate validates your expertise 
in designing and deploying scalable systems in the   aws ecosystem coming in at number two is the 
google certified professional cloud architect   you see the theme here of cloud the average salary 
for this certification is 169 thousand and twenty   nine dollars so this certification demonstrates 
your ability or an architect's ability to design   develop manage secure scalable and reliable cloud 
architectures okay the one we've all been waiting   for number one which is the google certified 
professional data engineer the average salary   for someone who has this certification is 171 749 
no surprise here the demand for data engineers is   growing at a crazy fast rate that i mean there 
isn't enough people who do this to keep up with   the demand so data engineers essentially analyze 
information to gain insight into business outcomes   and really help with business decisions or product 
decisions based on the data that is analyzed okay   that is the top 10 certifications in technical 
roles i really hope this inspires you when you are   continuing down your career path in tech to really
