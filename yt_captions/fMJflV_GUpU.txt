Everyone knows about the Fibonacci numbers 1, 1 and then I add those two together to get 2, then 3, 5, 8... What would happen if instead I start with three numbers and now I'm going to add all three together. So that gives me 3 and I'm now going to add these three together. That's gonna give me 5 and then these three together that's going to give me 9 and then I'm gonna get 9, 5 and 3; 17. And we're gonna get a different sequence of numbers. Well, it's a bit like the Fibonacci, but it's got three instead of two. So it's called the Tribonacci numbers. Let's call this Fn and so this is the Tribonacci Tn. And you have that Fn plus 1 divided by Fn goes to the golden ratio. So we can also do the same thing with the Tribonacci numbers but they go to what's called the Tribonacci constant. With the Fibonacci numbers one of the ways we can sort of think about what, how they're going to end up is say, well let's start this 1, x, x squared, and x squared was equal to the two previous ones together. So here this is x squared is equal to x plus 1. Here we're adding the three previous terms. So we get 1, x, x squared, this term is going to be the sum of all three. So it's x cubed, and now we have x cubed is equal to x squared plus x plus 1. And so that's a polynomial. Whilst I can reasonably well solve quadratics, cubics have a far more messy to solve so I'm going to get a calculator to do that. So this gives us 1.83929 and that's gonna...
- (Brady: Tribonacci constant!)
- Tribonacci constant. (Brady: I'm assuming there's a fourbonacci constant and a fivebonacci?)
- They're called the n-bonaccis and, so here I've got an interesting shape. It's got a, a fractal boundary going around it. Well, it's got a nice property to it. So I've got this tile here and this is the same shape but a little bit smaller. And then I've got again the same shape but smaller. The edges of these, if can find it, I have to get them the right way up and there we go. So the edges are such so this shape, at different sizes, actually fits onto itself. And that means that these edges might, must either be straight lines, which they're clearly not, or fractal. It's not a fractal itself, but the boundary is a fractal. So now I will take a third shape and put them there and magically, I have my same shape. These are three sizes of this one shape and when I put those three together, I get the same shape. If this one scales up to this one, this one scales up to this one, and then this one scales up to the whole thing, I can take this one step further. So what I've done here is make a larger version of this object. So this piece here becomes this tile here. This piece here becomes this tile here. And then this tile here is replaced by the whole piece here. It's the, the three tiles - if I rotate this to there you see that this is just these three titles. So now we could imagine doing this another time, and another time we can get larger and larger regions. We could ask, well how many tiles am I going to have in them? Well, this pattern is made up of one of the smallest tiles, one of the medium tiles, and one of the large tiles. This is made up of one medium, one large, and then one of the scale size beyond large, which itself is made up of: one small, one medium, and one large. And when I go into the next step up, I'm gonna have one copy of this, one copy of this, and then one additional large one. So at each stage I'm going to take the three previous pieces, put them together to get the next one up. And so, what are we going to have? Well it's back over here. I have my 1 1 1, I put those together so I get 3. 1, 1 and 3 gives me my 5. The next one up is going to be my 5, my 3, and my 1 which is going to give me 9, and so on like that. So this shape is called the Rauzy fractal and it was found by GÃ©rard Rauzy. The interest is sort of studying how matrices act on three-dimensional space. And there's a lot of nice theory for how, for certain properties of how matrices act on two-dimensional space. Especially a matrix, which has one expansion and one contraction. What that will do is you have these things called eigenvectors and you pull down in one direction and you expand so that everything gets squashed down and pulled up. There's a whole theory in that called Markov partitions, which have - basically have nice properties as you get pulled down and smeared out, you can turn that into a nice periodic product. And what rauzy asked, well, what about for the the cubic case when we're dealing with three-dimensional space? So the specific matrix you're studying here has as one of its eigenvalues this number, the Tribonacci constant. And so because the Tribonacci constant is turning up in the thing you're trying to study, that's how it turns out in these these tiles. And the golden ratio and Fibonacci numbers are really important in the study of the two-dimensional Markov partitions, and so when you go up to three dimensions, you have to deal with cubic things. It's quite natural, it's sort of almost the ancient Greeks who, well, who felt that a cubic number really was a cube. So they didn't, some people say they didn't even believe in fourth powers. When you're dealing with three dimensions you naturally have cubic stuff. 
- (Brady: Do they exist in sunflowers and things like that?) They don't exist in nature in the way that they, just like the Fibonacci isn't quite as popular by - in nature as it's meant to be. Umm, the only place beyond this that I know of them is an object called the Snub Cube, which is quite an attractive little polyhedron. Just a reminder that there's now a Numberphile podcast.
