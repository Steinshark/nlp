an extreme ultraviolet lithography machine costs 150 million dollars that's a lot of change and it makes you wonder is having euv really that big of a deal you might have heard about this or that company managing to quote unquote achieve seven nanometers without the use of eov what should we make of that can we do seven nanometer chips without uv the answer is yes but you won't want to and they probably won't work as well in this video we're going to look at why we so badly need euv to make the next generation of semiconductors and what companies have to go through without it but first gosh another newsletter ad i'll make it quick i'm putting more time and effort into new content for the newsletter including my exploration of taiwan's startup space i think it's cool and worth checking out the link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two all right back to the show prior to euv the leading edge lithography technology was duv deep ultraviolet lithography it uses an argon fluoride laser with its 193 nanometer wavelength to etch wafers i have been told that industry professionals say arf rather than arf but i refuse to bend to their corrections arf was first introduced with asml's pas 5500 series at around the turn of the century this step and scan machine could etch for the 90 nanometer node generation improvements to this technology help take the industry from there to the 65 nanometer process node generation over the past 30 years the lithography industry went from using simple g-line mercury lamps to eyeline to powerful eczema lasers to etch on wafers more powerful light sources have improved resolutions and created more powerful chips had things gone right the industry would have smoothly moved from etching with 193 nanometer light to 13.5 nanometer light when euv came but a funny thing happened euv started missing its delivery targets and it would do so for the next 10 years until the dutch cavalry arrives the industry found itself needing to squeeze more out of 193 over and over again so the industry found renewed energy with the introduction of immersion lithography where you shoot that 193 nanometer light through water to improve the resolution arfy as i will continue to call it first entered the industry in around 2007 with the introduction of the asml xt 1700i machine this machine thus enabled the 45 nanometer process node but what will the industry do about the generation that comes next let me pause here so that we can talk about what the node names are all about for up until now the node processes had once corresponded to its smallest half pitch or gate length moore's law guides how the industry chooses its numbers to meet moore's density doubling targets each new node generation has to be 70 smaller than the next thus from 65 nanometers to 45 nanometers the next scheduled node after 45 nanometers would be the 32 nanometer node in 2009 70 of 45 and the 28 nanometer node in 2010 to 2011. but by this point even with immersion techniques arf lasers cannot physically achieve a half pitch smaller than 40 to 45 nanometers in a single exposure and the half pitch cannot actually get to be in the seven nanometer range but such literal naming techniques wouldn't be useful for marketing purposes so the industry decided to keep the shrinkage going the headline number would keep shrinking by 70 each generation even though the half pitches no longer moved i've heard more than a few people cry out that this is dishonest marketing and a few people want the government to get involved which i think is kind of amusing but i want to point out that simple half-pitched lengths like chip frequency numbers no longer meant what they used to long before 45. the goal is for the end user to know that this node delivers better performing chips than the older generation the smaller number still does this anyway now that the node names and the half pitch lengths are no longer the same i'm going to refer to the nodes themselves from now on as n28 and 10 n7n5 and so on this is how tsmc does it in their corporate communications the actual literal hat pitches will continue to be delineated in nanometers i have digressed so let us get back to business so now that optical lithography resolutions have bottomed out for now does that mean semiconductor performance has plateaued no the industry managed to produce better chips over the next few years and that is for two reasons the first reason is that with the n22 process node in 2012 the semiconductor industry transitioned to using a new type of transistor the finfet finfets are a type of transistor that is no longer planar it is essentially 3d with multiple fins side by side and covered by a gate you do not need to know the intense engineering details that's for a future video but know that a three gate finfet can be up to two times as effective as an old school planer gate while using the same amount of space finfets are also the reason why intel samsung and tsmc's node numbers are jumbled and not all that comparable intel had been the first company to make the finfet transition with the first n22 finfet iv bridge cpus out in 2012. samsung and tsmc followed thereafter when tsmc debuted their finfet implementation a little later they decided to skip ahead from n22 to n16 intel refused to do the same so there we go to keep things clean i'm just going to use tsmc's node terminologies gosh this is confusing part of the reason why finfets were so difficult to implement is because their 3d structure interfered with the second big reason behind improved semiconductor performance multiple patterning i have talked about multiple patterning before at the risk of repeating myself this is where you use several mask layers in order to pattern a single design layer the industry started with what we call double patterning pitch split sometimes referred to as litho h litho h or lula lily whatever l e l e at about the n22 node process generation if you have a dense layout that cannot be handled with a single exposure le has you create two lower density layout masks you then use two exposures to superimpose the two masks and create a single finer image on the actual wafer the biggest and most fundamental problem is figuring out how to split a single design into many for double patterning this hard work is performed in the background by a specialized multi-patterning tool like calibre multi-patterning so for human chip designers it is like as if nothing ever changed for now double patterning by itself worked fine for the n20 and 16 and n14 nodes but the node process generation after that required going an extra step with euv still unavailable for the n10 node the industry introduced two new forms of multi patterning triple patterning and self-aligned double patterning let's talk about the first one for now triple patterning or la la la pitch splits this is conceptually similar to double patterning you create three masks of lower density layouts and superimpose them onto the wafer has one super fine image seems simple right so why is triple patterning more troublesome than double patterning the problem is that a third layer introduces immense new complexities eda tools foundry design rules and chip designs all need to be rejiggered the big problem is a computational one finding the optimal way to split the final design into three masks is far more difficult than it is with just two masks here's what i mean take a square a square has four nodes in it with double patterning each of the two masks handle opposing sides of the square and with this four node shape there are two double patterning options available for coloring the eda software thus has to check through them for design rule violations and whatnot with triple patterning the number of variations explodes exponentially for that same square four node structure triple patterning has 18 variations rather than just two with double patterning a five node structure 30 and so on a semiconductor design can have hundreds of different nodes and design variations the software needs to check through at least a good portion of these this problem is not solvable in polynomial time in other words for you computer science nerds out there it is an np complete problem this is a massive slowdown and in the end the chip designers themselves had to be retrained to change their design tendencies triple patterning also has an economic problem each mask is expensive and triple patterning inherently needs three of them those costs add up for instance double patterning at the n20 node increased the costs of the lithography module 50 from n28 and depending on whose cost module you consult intense triple patterning makes its photography module 3.85 times higher than n28 triple patterning managed to get the industry to the n10 process generation however i hope that i have made it clear that by now the industry is desperately trying to keep its head above water until euv arrives so now we have come to n7 and seven is another 70 node shrink on top of n10 euv was close to being ready but tsmc by this point the market leader more on what happened to intel later on felt that it needed more time to feel comfortable with this new tech before putting it to use for flagship customers however n7 had to hit high volume manufacturer in 2018 when the apple a12 and huawei kitting 980 chips ship thus at the start tsmc had two versions of n7 one with just multiple patterning and n7 plus a little later using euv afterwards tsmc would transition into an n6 node so n7 is an interesting node the final node conceivably achievable with 193i technology it is not cheaply achieved the 193i version requires triple patterning as expected but also adds on something called self-aligned quadruple patterning self-aligned quadruple patterning is a double dollop of the self-aligned double patterning or sadp which i briefly mentioned earlier in this video but skipped over sadp uses chemical vapor deposition or cvd to apply chemical layers of spacers to the sides of a template what does that mean in plain vanilla lithography you put a layer of resist onto a substrate you expose it to light and then etch away the resist nice you got your lines with sadp there is more work to be done you add a template layer on top of the substrate and you do lithography on that first to create your lines apply resist expose to light etch yada yada then the foundry uses cvd to add spacers to the sides of the original template lines think of it like guard rails then you strip the inner template lines away leaving the deposited spacers behind etch accordingly the density is now doubled now you got something like a bunch of high density parallel lines self-aligned quadruple patterning does all of this twice twice and seven is an unusual node two in that it breaks a number of prior design rules thus old chip designs have to be re-engineered to accommodate i wish i can explain this a little better but trust me you don't want to know i've read it 10 times and i still don't get it either at this point only a small percentage of the chips total features are being actually produced in one exposure self-aligned quadruple patterning imposes additional constraints on the chip designer as you might have guessed more parallel lines with those lines widths being fixed and not easily changeable imagine trying to draw the rest of the f and owl but you can only use fix with parallel lines this is extremely restrictive and makes for less efficient designs furthermore error margins at this point are extremely tight boundaries have budgets for the amount of errors they can tolerate but if you mess up the relative placements of these critical edges it is a failure mode and should be avoided intel's n14 is roughly equivalent to tsmc's n10 in terms of transistor density intel's n14 would be the node that broke its famed tick-tock strategy it launched in 2014 and stayed as the flagship node for years until when it was finally succeeded by intel's n10 ramped up in 2019 who really knows exactly why intel's n10 ramp which is roughly equivalent to tsmc's n7 took so long to come to market but we can guess i reckon they tried to cross the n10 to n7 node gap without euv which means doing all of the multiple patterning techniques we just talked about in this video and more for non-tech brian krazanich has said that in certain cases the company needs to use quad penta and hexa patterning for select features as they need to expose the wafer up to six times to draw one feature i am not super surprised that it wouldn't yield no wonder global foundries ditched their seven nanometer node uv did not seem commercially viable until the 2014-2016 time period when asml's insane dual shot laser pulse technique drastically improved uv light source power output so i feel like intel just got caught in a tough spot has first threw the breach now with euv n7 features can be produced with up to 30 percent better cost efficiencies right off the bat even taking into account the euv machine's 150 million dollar price tag in 2020 tsmc made a rare blog post to celebrate 1 billion and 7 chips they rarely do these posts so i think they must have thought it to be a really big deal and i agree something i learned while doing this video is just how fuzzy and vague these node processes are between generations and foundries not just their names but also their physical dimensions and performance metrics too it is a reflection of the way leading-edge chips are made now at this point node manufacturing processes are worked alongside the chip designs themselves a methodology known as design technology co-optimization everything is optimized and nuanced the size of the fins and the pitches for instance some are shrunk others are not the design choices are as carefully curated as your hipster's cafe because everything has a trade-off the magic of human abstraction is that they take all these nuances and sweep it under the rug as a single number some website says that this country or that country has achieved seven nanometers or seven nanometers equivalent and we all start thinking certain things seven in one place isn't the same as seven in another we shouldn't take headlines at face value the devil is in the details alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll
