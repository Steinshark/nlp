i received an email from a viewer named gilad 
levy who had a math question for me pertaining   to the game of dungeons and dragons challenge 
your imagination to come alive which is why   i've got all these ridiculous dice out big fan of 
crazy dice i've got like the d4 so d for dice and   then four for four sides d12 d20 classic i mean 
just for overkill i've also got my d60 and d120   which is completely unnecessary and of course 
the staple of the dice world a candy jar's worth   of d6s anyone who visits me in the office can 
just um grab a couple of these as a treat and   so gilad's question was not actually about the 
numbers or the geometry or anything on this   dice it's about a modification you can make to 
dungeons and dragons so if you're rolling a d20   for some reason like you need a high number 
so something good happens to your character   so i just roll this roll 12. not bad but what 
if you want to give that player an advantage   what you can do is bring in a second identical 
dice so instead of rolling just the one dice   you roll one dice and a second phantom dice so on 
the main dice i've got 11 and on the phantom dice   i've got four okay at that point you can choose 
whichever one you want so you pick the better one   the higher one so you go i rolled an 11. so every 
time you roll if you have with advantage you roll   two dice pick your favorite in this case the 16 
and discard the other one and gilad's question was   if you're rolling two dice picking the best 
one so you have an advantage what is the new   average value what is the expected value from 
rolling identical dice at the same time they did   look online first which i appreciate people doing 
that before they email me but all i could find   was people putting values into spreadsheets 
like on a case-by-case basis and then taking   the average manually and don't get me wrong 
big fan of spreadsheets but we can do better   my zeroth step as always was just to simulate it 
in software so i put together some terrible python   code uh this is it here it's not great i'll link 
to it below if you want to check it out it just   rolls two dice a million times keeps track of 
which was the maximum value adds them up and   gives you the average at the end and i've got my 
laptop here running that exact code which you can   now see next to me here so uh this line that's 
just saying run some python code that i've called   higher of two rolls if we run that it asks you how 
many sides on your dice let's do the d20 doing a   million rolls and there it is the average result 
of rolling to attacking the highest is about   13.829 you think was that accurate doing it a 
million times so we can redo the same thing again   let's do another 20. this time 13.83 okay so we're 
always getting about 13.83 uh 420 give or take so   we can be reasonably confident that's roughly the 
right value and of course uh let me clear that you   can do that so we did that for uh let's you know 
do the d12 then you're gonna get an average of   about eight and a half we try it for our 
friends the d6 over here it's going to be   around about 4.47 ish so now we can get these 
results and we're confident they're correct   now we have to crack the logic behind it with 
some tweaks to the code instead of just getting   the average value you can of course get it to spit 
out the probability of getting any given value and   that's exactly what gilad did and they did a plot 
for the record a single d20 every single face has   a 1 in 20 chance of coming up that means they're 5 
each and if we did the chart for this it would be   a bar chart where every single number is five 
percent perfectly flat and i've not joined it   together as a line because it doesn't make sense 
to have an in-between value i've just done a bar   for every single value to show you the percentage 
and what gillett had plotted was the same thing   but with rolling for advantage and you can see 
you get a perfectly straight line it starts with a   0.25 percent chance of getting a one and then it 
goes up half a percent each point every single   number you go up on the dice until 20 which is 
the most likely is the biggest is a 9.75 chance   and we're like that's interesting and we'd run 
the simulation over and over and we checked our   numbers and they add up to one so the whole thing 
holds together so now we had two questions one was   why when you plot the probability for each of the 
different faces with advantage do you get this   perfectly straight arrangement of the 
probabilities and secondly the average girl had   noticed is always about two-thirds of the maximum 
value i say about two-thirds it's going to be some   weird number probably involving e it won't be that 
simple but they had spotted roughly two-thirds and   we had to answer both those questions and my 
goodness i was not expecting the result we got   this video is brought to you by jane street 
who are also supporting the 2022 international   mathematical olympiad try a sample puzzle at 
the end of this video gene suite have actually   provided a brand new imo style puzzle that 
you can try we'll put it at the end of the   video but it's based on that cosahedron not the 
dice just the actual shape super interesting   check that out at the end but for now we're 
going to try and crack what's going on with   the probabilities when you roll for advantage 
we're not going to do the d20 though that's a   little bit too much we're going to start 
with our friend the d6 whoops that's gone here i have some d6 and we can look at what 
happens if you roll two distinguishable d6   so i've now got a green one and a blue one at the 
same time and uh each of them could have oh i've   got two fives there you go each of them could have 
any of six possible values of four and a three   so we can do a two-way plot where we've got 
all the values the blue can have on one axis   or the values the green can have on the other 
axis and inside each square we can put what   that combination is and importantly each of 
the squares has a 1 in 36 chance of happening   because that's just 6 squared we could now go 
through and color in what values we would get   if we rolled that pair and we picked the highest 
so the only way to get one is the bottom corner   so there's a 1 in 36 chance of doing that there 
are three ways you can get two if you get any of   these you would choose 2 as the biggest number so 
that's a 3 out of 36 chance here's all the ways   you could get three and then four and then five 
and finally um six and then i realized what i was   looking at is the same bar chart from before in 
fact we can just stand these up and there you are   that's our bar chart because the probabilities are 
proportional to the number of squares and that's   why you get that straight line it's because if you 
add consecutive odd numbers 1 3 5 7 and so on you   get the square numbers 1 4 9 and up in this case 
36 and i was so excited when i realized this and   so we can see the numbers for the case of the d6 
because it's 1 over 36 3 over 36 5 over 36 and so   on 36 is just the number of faces squared so if 
we want to go back to our d20s it's just 1 over   20 squared wow one over 400 that's 0.25 which is 
why we had 0.25 likelihood for getting a 1 if you   roll with advantage and then it goes up by double 
that every single time so the next one up is 0.75   all the way up to 9.75 percent that's where the 
straight line comes from i'm so pleased when you   start with a probability question and then you can 
turn it into a geometry question that then gives   you your probability bar chart for free ah so 
pleasing but now where does the average come from   it's working it out time so we're gonna do this 
in general for an insider dice bear with me   okay so we don't know how many sides the 
dice has we got n sides but we know it's   going to be like this that's going to get too 
higher every single time until you get to n   each of these represents a probability of 1 over 
n squared because we know there's a total of   n squared of these in because if you clap small 
back down again you get your square so good the   question now is for each of these values 
on the dice which i'm going to call these x   just because we've already used n how do we 
know how many blocks are above them well this   is just the odd numbers so that's 2x uh let's 
go minus one so it starts at the right point so   uh so we know each of these has two times x minus 
one blocks above them and the probability is then   that times one over n squared so i'm going to put 
that on n squared so there you go so for any value   x on an inside a dice this is the probability 
of getting that if you roll two of them with   advantage so what's the average value well it's 
the chance of getting a value of one times one   chance of getting two times two chance of getting 
three times three this is the chance of getting x   times x and then you gotta add them all up future 
matt here in the edit because i realized past   matt was getting a bit confused i did have to 
do the summation of each of these values the   probabilities times the value of each face x but 
i put a one over n at the front which you can see   there i was getting ahead to when i wanted to do 
the ratio and then i changed my mind so later on   you can see when i was bringing the uh 1 over n 
squared at the front because it's independent of x   and the summation i put an n there to cancel 
it out i don't know what i was thinking but the   point is it all works don't worry about the top 
line everything is perfect from here so it ends   up being uh 1 over n squared outside the sum of 
what we had before but now over here we've only   got 2x minus 1 times x and i just worked out what 
that was before and i remembered it it's 1 over   n squared and then this thing here is n on 6 
times n plus 1 times 4 n minus 1. and that's   it and you're like hang on i can cancel this out 
because if i've got an n squared there and an n   there what i've actually got out the front is just 
a 1 over 6 n and that's it that's our equation and   sure enough it works if you put n equals 20 into 
that you get out 13.825 exactly what we got from   our simulations if you put in n equals 6 you get 
the same result that we got from our simulations   this is the equation for the average value for 
any n-sided dice if you roll two of them with   advantage all we have to do now is work out where 
that ratio of approximately two-thirds comes from   and that's not so bad to do because the ratio 
we're talking about is the ratio of this average   to n so we're just going to divide this whole 
thing by n which yes i could just squared   that in what i'm actually going to do is i'm 
going to rewrite that as 1 over 6 n plus 1   on n 4 n minus 1 on n convince yourself that's the 
same these are all multiplied together we want to   know what is the limit as n goes to infinity 
like in theory as we approach infinitely large   n sided dice what would this ratio be well 
if well a six is a sixth that's not changing   n plus 1 over n as n goes to infinity that's 
just going to equal that's going to equal   1. that's easy put that in there right okay 
and 4n minus 1 over n as n goes to infinity   that's just going to equal 4. so actually it's 
1 6 times one times four four on six it equals   exactly two-thirds i couldn't believe it so 
it's not just like oh this is roughly two-thirds   it's probably the inverse of root two it's 
probably something involving e no it's exactly   two-thirds i so there you are so in general just 
as a rule of thumb if you're rolling two dice   with advantage the average result you're going 
to get is two-thirds of whatever the dice is   easy but hang on what if we were rolling three 
dice hey standup maths matt here so i'm building   a model of our diagram from before out of dice 
so it's now the dice chart made from dice which   is deeply pleasing but it does mean you have 
to ignore the numbers i'm just using these to   represent the different regions little areas 
in our two-way uh sample space from before so   you've got uh what the first ice could be going 
you know across horizontally one two three four   and eventually i couldn't build five and six 
and now the second dust goes straight up so one   two three four and then five and six and so the 
blue is one one so one's the biggest number the   orange ones here are all the combinations where 
they're ones and twos and so two is the biggest   number and then you got where three is the biggest 
number four so biggest number and i could build   five and six same as before however we now need 
to add a third dice so instead of having a 2d plot   with two axes we're going to swing this sideways 
and have a third axis coming out in this direction   we've got three perfectly good dimensions let's 
use them so now i can start building up this   here we go direction oh um i need to put these 
wait i'm going to take these off for a second   oh i should have glued these together so i 
did there it is right so there's the shell   now of in the 3d plot all the combinations 
of the three d6s which are ones and twos   we can then add on the shell for uh threes because 
there's no one two three so these are all the dice   where three is the biggest value and then you've 
got all the fours uh all the fives finally all the   ones where six is the biggest uh value on the 
outer shell and now you can see how much of an   advantage rolling three and picking the highest 
is if you rolled a single d6 by itself one and   six are equally likely if you roll three and 
pick the biggest there's only one one of these   out of uh 216 possible options where you get all 
ones and there's 91 cases where 6 is the biggest   number so instead of being equal it's now 1 to 91 
just ridiculous and these aren't 2d areas anymore   they're not 1 over 36 which is the number of faces 
squared they're 1 over the number of faces cubed   so they're one over 216. so each of these volumes 
is a 1 over 216 chance of happening there are 216   of them and then you can work out how many there 
are from each layer but unlike the odd numbers   there's no obvious formula for these values i mean 
they must have some kind of pattern and they do   these are the centered hexagonal numbers so if i 
hold that one nice and still right in the middle   and you get that in focus you've got one right 
in the center and then you've got concentric   rings which are hexagonal numbers so there's 
one and then six around it and then so on it's   so good and we can use that equation to do the 
working out for the three dice case let's do it   as soon as i get up our equation for the odd 
numbers is easy enough it's just 2x minus 1   and if you're unfamiliar the odd numbers go 1 
3 5 7 and so on and x is position one gives you   one when x is two position two it gives you three 
now the center hexagonal numbers they go one seven   pretty sure it's nineteen yes nineteen thirty 
seven i've written them down down there thirty 37   61 91 and that 91 that was the final outer 
shell of this and those are all the shells   below we need now some formula where you put it 
as x is one and you get one you put in x as two   you get 7. and that happens to be written it down 
as well it's 3. actually let's do this in blue   so it matches it is 3 times x outside of x minus 
1 plus one you will occasionally see that with a   plus where they've zero indexed this list but i'm 
against my better judgment uh starting from one so   there's our formula for how big each shell is of 
all these different ones here so now we can get   rid of all this ridiculous extra bits and we're 
going to build that up into the equation for what   the average value is when you roll three dice and 
with advantage pick the biggest value so first of   all that's the value of each shell we have the 
probability of each shell which is the number of   cubes multiplied by the probability that each 
volume represents which as we established before   is just one over the number of faces squared so 
i can check in also cubed took a cubed down there   that's the probability we're now going to multiply 
that by the value which is the whole thing by h1   is x then we need to add them all up from the 
first face eq equals one up to the nth face   future matt here to again clarify past matt got 
a bit excited and put the one over n at the front   because that's when you want to compare the 
average value as a ratio to the number of   sides but then i decided in hindsight actually i 
want to look at just the equation for the average   first and then divided by n to get the ratio 
sorry back to past mat and i can give you   the grand conclusion the average value if 
you roll three dice and just pick the highest   is one over this time for n pretty exciting 
times n plus one times 3n minus 1. nice and neat   check that out and so we can go through and 
plug a bunch of values in i did put in the value   for a d20 so if your n equals a 20-sided dice 
you now your average value for a d20 comes out at 15.4875 there we go so just over three quarter 
it's about three quarters before it was two-thirds   oh that's too neat too neat to not be true okay 
let's find out let's find out so i'm going to get   rid of our working out down here oh my goodness 
we've now got at the top there that's our value   for the average we want to know now what that is 
relative to n so we want to divide that by n again   so now this is the average on n so we just put a 
squared down there and oh actually that means we   could rearrange it we could take that n squared 
like we did before and we could chuck one over   there we could chunk one over there and now we 
want to know as what's the limit as n goes to   infinity of this well it's going to be the 4th is 
still going to be the same that's going to be 1   times 1 that's going to be 3 it is it's three 
quarters there you are okay so it turns out if you   roll two dice and pick the highest is two-thirds 
if you roll and just for comparison you put that   over there so when we had two dice the oh wait m 
if we had m dice so we had two dice case that was   two thirds this here this is our three dice this 
is the m equals three dice case is three quarters   the big question now on everyone's lips 
is if we worked out the m equals four case   you roll four dice you pick the highest will 
the pattern continue will it be four fifths there's only one way to find 
out and it involves hypercubes   right if we're rolling four dice at once 
we're going to need four orthogonal directions   on our space of all possible results which means 
we're gonna need more dice more glue and more   dimensions and i'm not gonna start gluing together 
as tempting as it is hypercubes but in theory   each time you add another number on the dice 
you're just it's a bigger and bigger hypercube   of possibilities and you have to work out the four 
dimensional shells how many 4d content like hyper   volumes there are in uh and you know what we're 
just going to work it out using algebra because we   know what the equation is for each of these like 
each of the shells and four dimensions because   it's just the difference between two consecutive 
hypercubes it's x to the four subtract x minus one   to the four and spoiler we could have done that 
um with all the other ones anyway point is we've   now got the sequence of numbers that goes 115 65 
175 269 ah what's the pattern well these are the   rhombic dodecahedral numbers so we went from 
the odd numbers to the hexagonal numbers   to now this is the rhombic dodecahedron the 
greatest of all the dodecahedra and that actually   makes sense because if you've got a square the 
the diagonal cross section like the center cross   section of a square is a line and actually that's 
why when you look at it from the corner you see a   line but it's wrapped around and the middle cross 
section of a cube is a hexagon which is why if you   look at it perfectly quarter on it looks like a 
hexagon and they're centered hexagonal numbers   and as some of you may know if you get a 4d cube 
and you cut it perfectly in half on the on the   hyper diagonal the cross section of the 4d cube 
is a 3d rhombic dodecahedron it's so pleasing   think of it like the 3d hexagon and and that's 
why the numbers if you add together consecutive   centered rhombic or decahedral numbers you get 
the hypercube numbers ah maths the point is   we've got the equation we can crunch it through 
it like we did before indeed i've done it give   it a go it's good fun and it ends up four fifths 
it's four fifths if you roll four you don't have   to worry about the hypercubes and the runway 
decahedra all that jazz if you roll four dice   and pick the highest value you will get on average 
four-fifths of whatever the value of the dice is   sort of some of you have already thought does 
this work in the opposite direction so it seems   very very likely that if you roll m dice you end 
up on average if you just take the highest one   getting m divided by m plus one times however 
many faces you've got that seems very very likely   and we haven't proved that carries on going 
up pretty sure it does if you go backwards   you put in the case for one dice a single 
one m it should be half it's not half   it's well it would be it is in the case of if 
there are infinitely many faces as it tends to   infinity which is how we were working out it's 
exactly half but it's not exactly half it's a   half of the value so the average volt roll 
on a d6 is three and a half the average roll   on a d d20 here we go it's 10 and a half on my d60 
30 and a half because there's an even number of   faces and you're always getting a whole 
number in fact before when we worked out the   average for rolling d20s 15 which is three 
quarters and a half so i my conjecture is   it's always for m dice rolled with advantage 
it's m divided by m plus one times n   plus a half feel free to prove disprove or 
extend my conjecture i think it's good enough   for the size and number of rolls in the standard 
dnd game so there you are if anyone ever says   there's no practical reason why you want to know 
that the central cross section of a 4d hypercube   is a 3d rhombic dodecahedron now you 
can just throw some dice in their face   super applied mathematics anyway thank you so much 
for watching this video and thanks to jane street   who not only sponsor this video and my 
channel they also sponsor the international   mathematical olympiad which is happening this 
year from the 6th to 16th of july in oslo norway   and it's where teams all around the world send 
six pre-university math students to compete in   like it's like the mass version of the hunger 
games it's like the number games they all have to   run out and get like the best calculator there's 
nothing to do like that no they they solve very   difficult mass problems and oh my goodness they 
have some serious problems so jane street have   set a sample problem if you would like to try it 
and they say imagine you're on a huge icosahedron   so actually like this like a like a d20 but ignore 
the numbers imagine you start on a random vertex   and you can choose to walk to any of the other 
vertices nearby but when you get there you're   completely disorientated you can't see where you 
came from you can't see any of the other vertices   all you can do is leave a marker leave a stone 
that you can have as many stones as you want   of as many different colours as you want so you 
leave a stone of some color and then you walk to   another vertex but when you get there again 
totally disorientated but you can look down   to see if you've previously left a stone there and 
you can leave or do whatever you want with your   marked stones and the question is at the beginning 
of your journey what is the minimum number of   stones you have to take with you so you know for 
certain at some point you can say i am definitely   at the exact opposite vertex of where i started 
and they've got all the exact wording of that if   you want to double check it and they've got some 
other variations of the same puzzle in terms of   being on infinite planes or being on other shapes 
at janestreak.com imo 2022 so you can check that   out you can see the puzzle try it for yourself 
it's good oh my goodness it's fiendish but you   can give it a go and of course you can keep an eye 
on the imo see who wins number games this year and   so there you are huge thanks to jane street for 
making the imo possible and indeed my channel
