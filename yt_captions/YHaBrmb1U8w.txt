hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by mobil1 we're going to be learning about the differences between race car oil and road car oil thanks to discussions i've had with the engineering teams from mobile one rausch yates engines and stuart haas racing i think it's often the case we see something done in racing and as a result we feel like it's a good idea for our road cars when actually they're quite different applications with significantly different needs so for this video we're going to be comparing oil you might use in your own car to the oil used in nascar for road cars there are all kinds of tests and regulations as criteria that the oil must meet in nascar oil regulations are pretty unrestricted allowing for very specific formulas and open-ended ingenuity to the sport so how does a highly regulated road car formulation differ from the unrestricted nature of oil and nascar we'll break this down looking at differences in engine design drain intervals oil viscosities oil additives including the highly debated subject of zinc content or zddp and finally bespoke versus mass market formulas starting with engine design modern nascar engines are 358 cubic inch v8s specifically we're looking at a rauch yates engine who supplies the power plants to teams like stuart haas racing these naturally aspirated engines create different power levels about 510 550 and horsepower depending on the tapered spacers used which act as an airflow restriction certainly they're making more power than the average road car and these engines are capable of revving close to 10 000 rpm a pretty impressive number when you consider these are pushrod engines using a single camshaft mounted in the center of the v to open and close the intake and exhaust valves and while there are certainly many v8 road car engines the industry is trending towards downsized turbocharged engines road car engines feature significantly more sophisticated valve trains with variable timing variable lift and even variable duration smaller displacements are used often around 2 liters or about a third of the size of a nascar engine of course it's important to think about what the overall goal for the engine is in racing the goal for a nascar engine is to maximize power without breaking down pretty straightforward more power is a competitive advantage so you increase your chances of winning engines will last about three races before needing a major tear down and service or about 1500 miles the engine oil can be changed out anytime the car isn't on the track so typically it won't go more than about 500 miles without an oil change of course road car engines need to last far longer than fifteen hundred miles while powertrain warranties are generally good for about sixty thousand miles typically engines can easily reach a hundred thousand miles and if properly maintained over two hundred thousand miles in fact mobil one motor oils are designed to keep important vehicle engine parts in excellent condition for 250 000 miles but again reliability is part of the goal of course efficiency and emissions are important but it's critical that engines last a long time for consumers to want them imagine owning a road car that needed oil changes every 500 miles or an engine replacement every 1500 miles not ideal today's road cars are pushing oil drain intervals as high as 10 000 15 000 even 20 000 miles between oil changes moving on to viscosity grades you'll see a wide range of oils used in production cars while some engines will run thicker grades like 0w40 or 15w50 the industry trend is once again heading towards thinner oils like zero w20 or zero w16 which offer efficiency advantages if you're curious if these thinner oils can still offer good protection and engine reliability i have a full video dedicated to this subject i'd recommend checking out it's also important to keep in mind that road cars in comparison to race cars are rarely at full throttle and thus the demands and challenges placed on the engine oil aren't as severe as racing applications on a high speed track in nascar the engine might operate at wide open throttle for 90 to 95 percent of the race full load nearly all the time that's a lot of heat a lot of pressure and brutal stress is constantly passing through the engine this leads to our viscosity discussion you'd probably expect these higher power race engines are using thick oils but you might be surprised to learn you can find the equivalent of sae 20 grade to sae 30 grade oils being used in nascar and potentially even thinner for qualifying again keep in mind the goal for nascar the engine needs to last about 1500 miles let's make up a hypothetical scenario to illustrate this point say by using 0w50 you're able to get 10 000 miles out of a race engine by using a thinner oil like zero w30 maybe you see slightly more wear but you also have a small bump in horsepower by using that thinner oil and in racing it's all about finding small incremental improvements to give yourself a competitive edge as long as that engine still lasts 1500 miles who cares it makes sense to use an oil as thin as possible to give you the least amount of frictional losses within the engine thus maximizing horsepower for road cars the equation is a bit different horsepower certainly matters but there's a far greater focus on optimizing efficiency while simultaneously maximizing engine longevity from an additive standpoint i was surprised to learn that racing oils will tend to include many of the same types of additives antioxidants and detergents can help with carbon buildup on race engines and road engines alike dispersants rust inhibitors anti-foaming agents which help with the high rpm of race engines even when dry sump systems are used though one road car oil additive poor point suppressants which helps thin out the oil in cold temperatures isn't necessarily as useful in racing applications where startup temperatures generally aren't well below freezing like road car engines may experience if it's minus 40 degrees at the racetrack it's probably not a nascar race day one big difference between a race oil and a road oil is the zinc content or zddp zddp is a family of compounds which include both zinc and phosphorus and they're a hotly debated subject of online oil forums with the general belief that the more zdp and oil has the better let's break this down first how does it work when exposed to high heat and pressure zddp creates a sacrificial layer on your engine's hardware if for some reason there is metal to metal contact at this region instead of your engine's components getting where the sacrificial layer of zddp takes on the burden and it's very good at doing so ztdp is in a constant cycle of being sacrificed and then rebuilding in the same location as a result of the heat and pressure interestingly the oil concentration of zdp doesn't dramatically change during the oil change interval as it undergoes this cycle now having that sacrificial layer sounds great so we should want oils with plenty of zddp right well small quantities of engine oil can actually make its way into the combustion chamber and in doing so exit out the exhaust unfortunately zdp specifically the phosphorus in it acts as a poison to catalytic converters used in too high of concentrations it will cause the emissions equipment to fail so because of emissions equipment road car oils don't have enough zddp right well not exactly true again zddp plays a role when you have metal to metal contact if you're not having metal to metal contact and you're maintaining a robust oil film between moving parts which is absolutely how road car engines should be operating then you're not reliant on zddp much of the concern over the necessity of zddp is as a result of an old engine style flat tap it camshafts in this scenario a cam lobe is slamming into a it to open the valves metal to metal contact can occur and zddp plays a big role here but modern engines have been using roller lifters for decades which use a wheel where the camshaft lobe contacts the lifter this dramatically reduces wear and minimizes friction greatly reducing the need for zddp don't believe me in the early 2010s nascar switched over from flat tappet lifters to rollers i asked if this led to a reduction in zddp used in their oil formulations and yep zddp concentrations were cut by about half now racing oils still tend to have more zddp than road car oils about double but this isn't purely because of the emissions equipment sure race engines don't typically have catalytic converters so there's no worrying about phosphorus poisoning you wouldn't want to run these higher concentrations through stock emissions equipment but race engines also operate for much longer durations with high loads and pressures providing more opportunities for zddp to be useful especially true depending on the style of engine and materials used again the main goal of oil is to create a film between moving metal parts so that wear doesn't occur in the first place today's production engines are very good at this and in addition have much tighter tolerances than the old days when zddp played a bigger role in keeping engines safe modern engines also have materials improvements such as diamond light coatings or plasma sprayed cylinder liners that minimize the wear from any metal to metal contact that may occur simply put today's engine internals are better designed yes zdp is a useful additive but mobil 1 tells me that the durability of today's road car engines is not hindered by concentration limits of zddp finally it's worth discussing the advantages of designing a bespoke engine oil for a specific engine versus creating an engine oil for the entire automotive market when designing for passenger cars you have a massive set of requirements the oil must pass these are worst case scenario tests to ensure the oil works in anything from super old cars to brand new cars so the oil is built for worst case for the cars that are the hardest on engine oils not necessarily your car in nascar you're encouraged to take advantage of this fact for example a noack volatility test measures how much of an oil evaporates at high temperatures if you see gm's dexo certification on the back of a bottle that means in the noack test less than 13 of the oil evaporates off but that's gm's requirement for a wide range of their engines for a racing engine you could specify your exact needs based on that single engine and not just for this test but any of the tests that can be used to evaluate an oil another example is looking at viscosity an sae 30 grade oil is not an exact viscosity there is a range that falls under the categorization of a 30 grade for a nascar engine you can specify the exact viscosity you need for your engine at a much finer level of detail than an sae 30 grade range getting this viscosity in the perfect balance of performance versus reliability might be worth a few extra horsepower and of course this comes at a cost in nascar there's only so many avenues to go down due to the rulebook to maximize horsepower so is it worth it to spend say a hundred dollars a bottle on bespoke oil even if it meant only gaining one horsepower yes absolutely new formulas are continuously tested there could be as many as 20 bespoke formulas created and tested during a single nascar season always seeking to further optimize performance now would it be theoretically possible to apply that same logic to your car and have a very expensive oil that gives you another horsepower sure but no one wants to spend a hundred dollars per quart on their road cars off-the-shelf solutions have undergone the test to be proven to be effective and if power was the goal you could put that money elsewhere and likely find different avenues for significantly greater performance gains intake exhaust better tune you get the idea so i hope you've enjoyed this insight into the world of race oils if you'd like to learn about the advantages of switching to synthetic oils from conventional or how oil viscosity grades keep getting thinner or if you can use synthetic oils in old cars i'd recommend checking out the links in the video description before mobile 1's formulations end up in a bottle they undergo about 20 000 hours of lab and field testing along with 500 000 miles of road and track testing you can find mobile one synthetic motor oil at an automotive retailer or service center near you if you
