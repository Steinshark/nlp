[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and this is the oneplus 7 not the oneplus 7 pro the oneplus 7 it's that phone that you might have forgotten existed but if you know anything about oneplus phones it became pretty familiar pretty quick so we had the oneplus 7 pro already i've raved about this phone and i'll link the full review below if you want to check it out the 7 is just like the oneplus 6t but refreshed for this year so we already have the oneplus 6 it got refreshed a couple months later became the oneplus 6t so this is like a oneplus 6t t so it doesn't have any of the crazy features of the pro it's just a solid steady phone making all the safe moves for a lower price it has a teardrop notch instead of the pop-up camera it's their classic 1080p 60hz oled display they've been going with instead of the crazy 1440p 90hz oled of the pro it has their 20 watt dash charger instead of the crazy 30 watt warp charging it has a regular vibration motor instead of the amazing one from the pro and it has a healthy six or eight gigs of ram instead of an absolutely massive up to 12. and has one less camera it drops the ultra wide and it's just the standard camera and the telephoto i wish they'd kept the standard and the ultra wide like the s10e since i believe the ultra wide is way more useful and more fun than a telephoto and i feel like everyone's realizing this in 2019 but that's not what they did still a 2x so basically you can think of this as either a stripped-down oneplus 7 pro or what i think is more accurate a refreshed oneplus 6t and what they've done is kept a lot of the things that people liked about the oneplus 6t which by the way was a pretty good phone won my phone of the year last year and they've continued it in this one so now it has the snapdragon e55 still the newest chip it's got that clean oxygen os with frequent software updates and if you haven't already noticed this one is running the android q beta so that's why it's got a little bit of a different look and the different buttons and quick settings etc oneplus phones are some of the only ones that can get the betas this early the alert slider is still here awesome as always although for whatever reason it's just a little bit smaller just a little bit it has six or eight gigs of ram like i mentioned it's not 12 but it's still more than the pixel for example can say right now and then the front speaker grille and the speaker itself are a little bit bigger it doesn't make a huge sound difference for music and videos but low-key it is a bigger target area to hold the phone up when making phone calls so that's nice matter of fact there are certain things to like more about the 7 than the 7 pro for certain people so for example it's a smaller phone and plenty of people including me felt the 7 pro is just a little bit on the big side so the size of the 7 is more comfortable on the hand more pocketable easier to reach the tops and corners things like that there's not that many compact flagships you know and it's a flat display instead of a curved one that sort of bleeds over the edges i talked about this in the seven pro review i'm not the biggest fan of the curved glass and the extra glare and the accidental touches that'll come with that so i'm pretty happy with the flat display and then just little things like it's a little bit more likely to be water resistant thanks to the complete lack of moving parts no pop-up camera so no worries about durability and of course the phone is cheaper starts at 500 pounds so the oneplus 6t t aka oneplus 7 i feel like if oneplus only released this phone this year and no oneplus 7 pro we'd all still kind of know this is obviously an incremental improvement over last year but that wouldn't be such a bad thing because we already know the oneplus 6t was already a great phone but so many other things have happened in the phone world in just the past couple months that this relatively minor improvement just got really easy to fall on the radar you can also get it to stand out or look a bit different if you want with a skin from our channel sponsor d brand if you want to also since they don't make any matte black version of this phone this year you got to take that upon yourself to get rid of fingerprints and speaking of take it upon yourself if you really do want to import this phone you have to take it upon yourself and pay a little extra for the shipping to get it to your region and make sure the bands work with your carrier of choice and all that which they usually do but it's worth checking so if you just search oneplus 7 on google or youtube or anything like that you will get bombarded with oneplus 7 pro photos and videos and articles and everything it's so easy to forget that this oneplus 7 exists why why did this phone fall so far under the radar well there are two main reasons one that i love and one that i don't love so much to start with the one i don't love so much this phone is so under the radar because that's where oneplus put it like they're not launching this phone in the us so it's focusing more heavily on europe and asia but also oneplus is actively moving their brand positioning from straight up budget to much more premium and part of that is attacking the higher margin higher price market so not only is oneplus 7 pro a great phone but that's what it's doing for them legitimizing their more expensive products they're going from flagship killer to hey we also make a flagship fine but the other reason it's under the radar is because everyone else is kind of putting it there the competition is putting it there there has never been more competition at this sort of premium mid-tier price than there is right now asus zenfone 6 samsung a70 redmi k20 pro pixel 3a pocophone 2 is probably coming out soon it's lit so this is your psa that the oneplus 7 is an option to import for the price but it's just that now it's an option it's not the clear front runner anymore and it's got a whole bunch of very interesting competition in that little slot from like 300 to 600 that being said i do still really like this phone there's a lot of things from that phone of the year that it takes and continues and i can see myself using it every day and that's not something i say about every phone so that says a lot about the oneplus 7. and it also represents that shift in priorities for oneplus as a company and just the markets in general and it also represents a very crowded radar which if you know what i know about competition is a good thing for all of us thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
