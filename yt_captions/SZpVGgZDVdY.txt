depending away from you've either heard all about real me or you've never heard of real me before their first firm launched in India only for just over $100 and it was insane value but since then they've branched into more global and more premium territory enter the real me x2 Pro it is the highest end firm the company's ever made and on paper it's really something in the box as well as the TPU case and below the smartphone you get a pretty standard USBC cable what is super impressive here is the charger more on this in a minute so whilst using this phone there have been - I guess you'd call them moments of surprise the first where it specs and bear in mind when I say this we're talking about a phone that starts at 399 euros so 350 pounds in the UK or 450 dollars and for that there's the Snapdragon 855 plus chip the best you can get right now and a 50 watt super vooc flash charge er that's twice the power of the one on the note 10 plus oh yeah add to that five cameras including a 64 megapixel sensor and a 90 Hertz fluid display it even has a lot of the things that are usually skipped when trying to cut the price like a dual speaker setup the ability to take ultra steady video recording and even superfast u FS 3.0 storage if you go for the higher storage models that's a lot of stuff and I almost thought the price was a typo because with small phones there's usually some sort of catch so i unboxed it i used it i really pushed the phone to see if those jacked specifications translated to a great real-world experience and the results from this were the second surprising thing so the first thing i did was plug it in i had a friend the other day who said he was super happy with his new iphone 11 pro max partially because he could charge in under two hours this phone the roomie acts 2 pro in my testing of fully charged in 33 minutes zero to a hundred and it's not even a small battery of four thousand milliamp hours build wise it's pretty much bang on what you come to expect from a $500 phone these days metal needs blast in a smooth body with a curved back for extra grip they've not tried anything crazy with the design like they have with past devices pretty plain looking in most lighting conditions but then it comes to life if you shine a direct source on it my one gripe with the body is just the transition from the side to the front of the phone is a little sharp not a deal-breaker and I do like the gold accents on the power key and around the primary 64 megapixel camera it's really all about what's on the inside though because as I started to use it one thing became clear in order to hit a price like this we only have had to make some difficult decisions as to the things that are important in the phone and the things that are less important and thankfully generally I agree with their decisions there are compromises but they feel like smart ones for example the camera system is pretty close to top tier you get a quad camera including a 2 x telephoto lens as well as an ultra white and for the main camera it's using Samsung's new ISO cell bright gw1 sensor and the resulting shots are more detailed than those from a galaxy note m+ if you look outside the window here you can see that after taking a photo the x2 Pro also applies some pretty solid HDR it's not the best but decent the ultra steady video on the other hand reduces quality and it's not the most effective solution but the main 4k video is good plus you can take five times optical hybrid zoom photos and in low-light it's about as good as other $500 phones and this right here should give you an idea of the phone's internal microphone audio quality this is often overlooked but I think it's really important also speed this phone is top tier processing meets fluid ninety Hertz display and you might already know that is a combination not to be underestimated he's being too cute I can't get rid of him the 90s display feels more responsive than the 60 Hertz on most and the UF s3 storage means wicked load times I pulled up my call of duty mobile account on this phone and really really good experience the audio the screen but more importantly the graphics I was able to display whilst keeping a solid frame rate the phone's liquid cooling system is pretty good it still gets warm but nothing alarming even the Wi-Fi is awesome here in some rooms of the house I was getting to times plus the speed of my Samsung there's a four by four minor antenna for stable signal again this is something we tend to see on flagships for example the iPhone 10 S has for the iPhone 10 R has two so I already mentioned that really have clearly spent some time deciding what things are less important telephone so what's missing here well coming from the galaxy has 10 5g which was around $1,200 at launch the biggest compromise I noticed was display to give credit even this is far from bad on the grill me it's a 6.5 inch Super AMOLED display supporting HDR 10 plus brightness is similar and both even automatically filter out blue light to reduce eyestrain is just that Samsung's bezels are narrower and I prefer the hole punch over a notch thus hurt taking one look at the iPhone 11 situation and real me actually starts to look pretty good you don't get wireless charging an IP rating or micro SD card support and the phone is still on Android 9 but the 10 update is coming and I wouldn't say those things are deal-breakers for me I was also happy to see they have retained the headphone jack the haptic engine on phone for vibration and feedback it's not great but it's also not bad and that's pretty much it having seen the price having seen the specs I was on the hunt for compromises but there really aren't many one thing I would say is that whilst with most phones the base model the standard variant is the best value and the one to go for with this you might want to creep up to the 128 gig model for an extra 50 euros I just don't think the 64 gig base storage is quite enough in 2019 plus with the more expensive models you're not just getting more storage but faster storage the dual speakers are loud and crisp I pulled up some old mister who's the boss videos to test and vocals sounded great plus they also support high res and Dolby Atmos sound the fingerprint sensor covers a larger area than past generations and it's fast but actually the face scanner even faster and it works some pretty obtuse angles so a lot of time by the time you've picked it up and you've turned the screen on it's unlocked you've also got NFC for google pay and on a final note the software skin is color OS the real me was initially launched as a sub brand of Oppo and even though they're independent now a lot of opus technologies and software remain so yeah that is the real me x2 probe and it feels like as much of a surprise as the pocke phone f1 did last year it's an affordable phone stacked with specs and even if we assume you're paying an extra 50 euros for the highest storage model it is still easily some of the best value we've seen all year the company actually has an entire range of smartphones now starting at the super entry-level and working the way up to this and it's a fitting phone to be able to talk thanks for watching my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I will catch you in the next one [Music] you
