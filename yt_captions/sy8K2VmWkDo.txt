[Music] hey what's up i'm kphd here and this is it this is a the sequel to the phone that shook up the the folding phone world last year it was it was headline worthy this is the galaxy z fold 2 5g it's the fold too and i'm shooting this in a bit of an unusual location as you can probably already see i'm in a trailer in the middle of the desert in arizona because i'm out here essentially hosting david blaine's ascension project where he's gonna float up into the sky while holding on to balloons it's it's kind of insane and it's a pleasure to be here but i figured while i'm here i will have samsung ship the phone out here and then i also had andrew at the studio ship uh komodo out here so we're gonna do a little uh first impressions and hands-on of this phone before uh tomorrow there's the launch so watch that i'll link it below if you haven't gotten to it yet but this is the phone now a lot happened last year with the galaxy fold right but the benefit of being samsung and just experimenting out in the open like that is you can make mistakes and learn a lot from them you learn a lot more from mistakes usually than success and so one thing i've noticed about the galaxy fold 2 z fold 2 is a lot of these changes are learned directly from the fold 1. so the box of course here is a little bit cooler if i do say so myself but as you get into it you'll notice it doesn't come with quite the same array of accessories like the top thing here is paperwork and that's kind of it so you get the phone of course and then there's just a fast charger included which of course you would expect for the two thousand dollars that this phone will cost again this year but this time there's no case there is no headphones and there's nothing else that really feels special about the stuff that comes with it which to me honestly is a little bit of a bummer like i thought there was no question this phone would come with all that extra stuff and then a note about the screen protectors so we took the plastic off at the beginning and that was all great but the fold 2 comes with a plastic screen protector on the front display and on the inside on the main display so i asked samsung very specifically about this the screen protector on the front display is cool to remove yourself and they said that was fine i did that easy just like any other screen protector but they recommend someone officially from samsung removes this pre-installed main screen screen protector and i don't know how i feel about that i it doesn't look that great it does have like a little bit of a haze i feel like i'm going to want to remove it pretty soon i'm probably going to remove it but i'll let you guys know on twitter when i do attempt that but my impression here of the phone overall really is there are three main areas where there are major improvements uh and that would be the screens the hinge and the cameras and there's other stuff there's little design tweaks and there's improved specs and all that but all the rest is really minor or it revolves around those main three things i'll leave uh youtube chapter time stamps below if you want to skip to your favorite part so of course like i said the specs are updated too but we've seen those already snapdragon 865 plus 12 gigs of ram 4500 milliamp hour dual battery and the design i think feels more refined you can see it's boxier it's a little weightier and i'm such a big fan of the satin finish it's not even funny it's still mystic bronze you can also get mystic black but it's really in the big areas where you see not just hardware improvement but real potentially big usability improvement too so let's start with the screens this one's pretty simple both the cover screen and the main screen got big upgrades the cover screen is now full size so it goes from like that little 4.6 inch display with huge bezels that was i think easily the worst looking part of the first fold to a genuine corner to corner full size 6.2 inch display it's still really narrow but i feel like this alone is going to change the way i use the fold the tiny cover screen before was actually pretty limiting and i didn't want to use the phone closed as much but now that changes a bit i feel like the full size smartphone type of size on the outside will change the behavior before you even open the thing but then on the inside once you do open it up there is your second big screen change the bezels inside are a little thinner it's now a 7.6 inch square display versus 7.3 but i think more importantly the huge corner cutout from last year is gone for just a single 10 megapixel hole punch selfie camera and i'll talk more about why that makes a lot more sense in the camera section but the bottom line is that ends up giving you a noticeably more impressive huge canvas of the screen like this is what i was hoping for when i was dreaming of improvements for folding phones it's impressive and this main screen is also now bumped up to yes high refresh rate 120 hertz it's actually adaptive refresh rate so it can modulate anywhere from 11 to 120 hertz depending on what's happening on the screen but yeah this is one of those things again that i mentioned even last year with the fold one of improvements i'd like them to make and we have it here now now one of the things i was wondering about is the crease since it's now using the same ultra thin glass on the z flip and i'm i'm seeing the crease still it's not like it's going to disappear after one generation uh you run your finger over it a little bit and you can still feel it like the z-flip but again just like those other phones it's not quite as big of a problem if you're just looking at the content and not looking for the crease so the screen's pretty sweet thumbs up for me so it's just such a what a difference that cover screen makes right but that brings us to the second big piece which is the hinge and i'm just going to keep saying it the hinge to me feels like the most important part of a folding device i just got done in my last video raving about how the surface duo's hinge is one of the most impressive things in any piece of tech in a long time and now this hinge i was kind of trashing it before with the first fold but now this hinge does a lot of the same stuff so this is now the second version of their zero gap hinge it looks pretty similar to the first one conceptually it's still the same with their hinge and the back plate but this year samsung will actually let you customize the back plate color between a couple i think it's four different colors which is super cool if you're willing to wait a couple extra weeks for the customization to come through but now this new hinge will allow for freestand anywhere from 75 to 115 degrees meaning it can basically stay put in almost any reasonable angle you want and then there's a bunch of software features built around this new hinge that i'm going to be testing for the full review it's still called flex mode and there's a slowly growing list of apps that will recognize when the hinge is folded halfway and then it'll treat the app like a mini laptop basically uh if you're watching a youtube video for example and half close it it'll put the video in the upper half or if you're in calendar or gallery they also have special layouts in flex mode and even the camera has a special mode for when it's half folded so clearly they see people using it half folded a lot more because of the hinges ability to do it makes sense and speaking of cameras that's the last big piece here for the fold two now the first fold already had pretty good cameras it was flagship quality at the time and you again get flagship quality cameras here triple 12 megapixel system on the back regular 3x telephoto and ultrawide but that's not the big improvement here the update is the layout of the cameras which was kind of clunky if you remember that big ugly cutout in the first galaxy fold so if you're ever to make an argument about if this is the right way to do a folding form factor i think the camera layout being much smarter here is a good argument for it so it's the triple cameras on the back like i mentioned in that mesa that squared off camera bump like the note main camera telephoto and ultra wide then on the inside like i said earlier just a single 10 megapixel selfie camera and on the front cover display again a 10 megapixel selfie hole punch camera so you can take photos and videos like normal with that huge viewfinder that part's still great but now instead of having that huge cutout for better selfie cameras if you really want to take a good selfie you can just do rear camera selfies and it'll turn on that bigger cover display and let you use it as a viewfinder that's really smart i believe this will also be coming to the first galaxy fold but now that's just so much better of a way to take selfies with a high quality camera there's also now dual preview mode which turns on the back camera so you can show the subject of the photo and the framing there's just a bunch of other software stuff being built into one ui that will also come to the old fold but it works that much better because of the bigger cover display and the improved hardware here but overall i my impressions are pretty positive for fold too and a lot of the things they've done even the smaller things feel much more considered for a daily driver now it's still a folding phone it's still second gen it's still not ip certified no dust resistance there's still durability questions with this hinge and the inside screen but a lot of the stuff they've changed the fingerprint reader being on the power button now the better cameras the new software modes the hinge that just feels a lot more sturdy and a lot more fluid i like it so i'm gonna pop my sim card in it and i'm gonna start using it as my daily driver multitasking beast and i'm gonna review it so let me know in the comment section what you guys want to know whether it's the cameras or durability battery is another one it is a 4 500 milliamp hour battery which is not small but it's also a 7.6 inch quad hd 120 hertz display so that's that's not small either so there's a lot of stuff to test and i'll check out your comments for that but that's been my first impression of the escobar galaxy z fold 2. stay tuned for the full review thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace you
