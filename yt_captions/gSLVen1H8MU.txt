alright guys welcome to a camera comparison with a bit of a twist so got the pixel 3x l1 plus 60 and the huawei mate 20 Pro with each of their respective night modes installed so we're gonna compare the cameras generally at night and then using these night modes and I think the results are going to surprise you well right now we're using the 1080p footage from the front cameras so let me know which one you think is better in terms of the video and the audio quality so although night mode only really comes into play with photos for most people video quality is just as important and there are some interesting results right off the bat the 1 plus 60 records 4k video at 60 frames per second which makes footage look a whole lot smoother but this reduces the bitrate of video so for the sake of comparison all phones are set to 4k 30 and I like the color reproduction on the 1 plus video is bold and punchy but zooming all the way in and problems emerge compared to the other two phones bright areas are not as well controlled not to mention the more sophisticated denoising algorithms present on the pixel and the mate 20 Pro it's also worth drawing your attention to stabilization where the oneplus falls behind a bit both the pixel and the oneplus 60 combine electronic image stabilization with optical image stabilization and they are both very good but the pixel is just a tiny bit steadier and the mate 20 Pro on the far right using its artificial intelligence stabilization might just be the best of the bunch okay on tonight mode all three have the potential to be amazing night mode can transform a scene from dark and dingy to clean and well lit but the first thing you might notice is that while the 60 remains sharp it severely lacks consistency in handling bright areas credit where do it generally makes the whole image brighter than the other two phones which is a good thing but when it's at the expense of such exaggerated white areas in my opinion the overall image suffers one of the things one plus was quite proud of with the 60 is that it can capture a night mode shot in less than two seconds compared to four for the Huawei and while this is true it doesn't change the fact that photo from this phone are actually more likely to blur moving objects like people and cars detail was an area that surprised me so I went round and took a series of night shots with all phones and then cropped into them 15 times and while all three phones were pretty impressive well the pixel takes the cake and it's not even close shots just seemed to look like they were taken on a much higher resolution camera than with the Huawei and the oneplus and at this magnification on the other two there is obvious noise and textures have become pretty muddy but on the pixel 3 you can even read text and look at the difference in how evenly this board is exposed across the three Google has knocked it out the park with its night mode and amazingly it's about to get better you might remember that the Huawei has three times optical zoom and if we use this in night mode and compare it to the single lens pixel 3 which uses software alone to zoom the pixel is actually better to reiterate what you're seeing now is a 45 times zoomed in night mode image and the pixel 3 XL which doesn't have a telephoto lens is still looking sharp because the 1 plus 60 doesn't actually let you use the telephoto lens when taking night mode shots I've just had to crop in afterwards so it's like a digital zoom right soo so far it does seem like the oneplus is getting completely crushed here but it is worth remembering that number 160 is a much more affordable phone than the other 2 and the fact that it's being pitched next to two of the best devices in this category I really like this photo and I'd say it's pretty indicative of the general outcome of the test you can see the slightly higher saturation on the pixel slightly cooler tones on the meet xx Pro and the overexposure of the oneplus one benefit of the Huawei is the ultra wide lens and this can dramatically change the way a landscape looks but just bear in mind that the quality of this lens is not as good as the primary one so even when you're using night mode the photos will come out with just that little bit more noise and one more thing worth testing was photos of people which is not really something night mode was made for Bert if you stand really still it can come out quite nice on all three when things get really dark your benefits from a faster capture time compared to the hallway which gets a little more easily blurred its image is also way brighter but comes at the cost of noise funnily enough if we switch over to the front cameras there is almost no correlation with results from the rear cameras Huawei keeps the face turns more realistic but one plus in most cases has the sharpest front camera both in terms of photos and videos the one thing that the Google pixel has though is its wide-angle lens on the front which results in a much wider field of view and importantly unlike the ultra wide on the back of the Huawei meet 20 pro this results in no noticeable deterioration in quality alright so that's pretty much the comparison and I'm confident that nightscape mode will get better on oneplus phones just like their electronic image stabilization did but at the same time and technically their software is in a final form and Google's is actually the one in beta so what do you think which phone do you think does better considering the price they are pitched at thanks a lot watching my name is error and this mister who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
