ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the road to Grandmas Series this is episode number five and in this series I am taking you through my return to competitive chess as I am climbing toward the highest title on the 64 squares now so far in the first four episodes I've recorded a bunch of different game analysis against very strong players on chess.com taking you through my struggles taking you through my successes as well and I also uploaded a chess lesson that I did with my coach lvan grandmas Ur NX son and you guys loved it you loved it so much that it inspired today's massive announcements if you clicked on this video you are about to get one of the biggest announcements ever on the Gotham chest YouTube channel and then we will get into episode number five and the announcement is that starting today I am launching a patreon page where you can get ridiculous levels of access to all the training that I am doing at the fan level you will get all of the footage of the lessons you will get behind the scenes training footage like training games and homework and I will be doing many many different puzzles from books and from online websites and I will be explaining them to you you can pause here and take a closer look the second tier has all sorts of other things I will be talk I will do Q&A sessions with you guys the fans Vlogs photos of my life you'll get early access to things and so on and so forth and obviously The Grandmaster tier uh is a tier of its own where I will do curated game reviews of games that you send me uh and so on listen people have been asking for stuff like this a lot they've been asking for like Hey how do I get a little bit more chess access how how do I get a little bit more this is the way this is the way uh and I hope a lot of you enjoy the first fulllength chess lesson is up there I have like four more on the way I am going to record a bunch more training sessions uh where I'm playing games where I'm solving puzzles and more so if you've ever wanted to support the channel uh in a in a in this kind of way getting behind the scenes access to myself for check life and so on uh this is the way to do it and I appreciate you all very very much you will be a part of this road to GM Journey uh and without further Ado here is another chess lesson that I did where we went indepth analyzing positions with Grandmaster Ur nans oh and one more thing if you want to support URS or anybody that I work with in the future outside of paying them for hourly chess lessons multiple times a week you should definitely check out our tours courses on chessable for example uh and his YouTube channel so now let's get into the games uh should you retreat with a bishop on E3 or sacrifice on D6 and I suppose the first question I would also ask cuz I do not exactly remember the circumstances I would just say like can I take on E5 so something like Bishop E5 if Queen E5 Queen E5 D E5 unfortunately neither Bishop H3 or Bishop B7 work because of this ridiculous move Bishop D7 and then I guess I have have to trade Rooks and I mean I would have to see if there's anything worth playing in that end game and also on top of that there's also just D5 in the very beginning um I would probably calculate that position for a minute or two like some sort of Queen A4 stuff I don't know even just some like Rook d8 The Rook is protected there's no Discovery anymore now maybe I will have some problems in the future yeah so then CD or something like retreating the bishop you know I feel I I have to add here a bit uh which maybe I should have done at the very beginning how do you evaluate your position because from from this I think it really might depend what you're going to do what you are going to do next I mean yeah first instinct says I should be at I mean at least a little bit better I don't know I feel like I have all the pressure but it could be an illusion I mean yeah black could be like one moment away from just completely holding on and trading some pieces activating opening activating I I think that uh very often um yeah I I I think that next time I'm going to stop with this question how do you evaluate your position because very often our course of action what do we do next it really depends how we feel about the position if we feel we are let's say the position is unclear or we are slightly worse we tend to make different decisions if we feel that we have a much better position we tend to make different kind of uh decisions right so here you saying you feel you are at least slightly better probably slightly better yeah so it's not going to be too too far off uh but the question is what do you think what forms this evaluation and I thought that maybe we could work on this by the way evaluating positions this is one of my absolute favorite topics so we jump between the games every five 10 moves here and there and we give assessment at least try to give an assessment according to an engine because engines obviously were created by people and you have to teach them something about how to evaluate and very often I'm at least in my own games I am thinking in terms of how to evaluate a position like an engine so what I'm seeing here there are several elements that I can immediately say that are in White's favor so first we have far more active pieces yeah so The Rook on B8 is super annoying for black we have some wonderful pieces as the queen on D4 the bishop P F4 the bishop Pawn G2 really awesome pieces his Bishop Pawn C8 E8 are pretty passive on E5 cannot really compensate on top of that the pawn on G5 just weakened the king so he has also multiple weaknesses at the queen side the Queens side pawns A5 A7 C7 maybe let me just mark them yeah yeah I was just gonna yeah so uh this I think accumulates together I mean engines they think like that typically so let let's say one of the small advantages they accumulate to something like 0.5 approximately so let's say we have the active Rook on B8 0.5 we have the Bishops on4 and G2 to 0.5 uh we have multiple weaknesses in our opponent's Camp another 0.5 and it usually Stacks together and I think it's something like in terms of the computer language 1.5 but of course I mean position tends to be very concrete and specifically here maybe this G5 changes something and if we go back a move before you just played I think it was C5 and Rook B8 Rook B8 C5 a mo before and your opponent tries to change something he feels he's in trouble so he tries to change something he plays G5 and I think that this this background here is quite important because uh I have a rule uh the rule is as follows we avoid doing funny business in great position so if I have fantastic position and I I think this is a fantastic position I don't see a forc win but you have all the positional positional pluses I try not to complicate at all right I already think that I I have enough weaknesses at my opponent's Camp I have an open position I have the Bishops the pawn on G5 in the long run also is going to be a weakness so if I could choose then I would choose something which keeps the positional benefits of this position so I don't even think yeah but you know I mean Bishop E3 I think this is the correct move so after Bishop B3 we keep all the positional gains but again you know it's quite interesting how a humans mind works because for example you're coting Bishop E3 and you're like wait I mean there's D on C5 right Queen C5 Knight E7 okay I cannot do that I mean what else is that you know it's so easy that we very quickly cross out the line just because we saw the first difficulties so here after Bishop E3 d takes on C5 now that you look at this position with fresh eyes you see obviously I mean the pawn on C5 is not really that critical and I'm sure you can find some other great moves here yeah also I mean if I really want to I I'm just like this is very hypothetical but the very least I could have some sort of like like I can get the Rook this is it's great that you mentioned this love you know I just want to show you this line so if you look at this line once again I would like to hear announcement from you so Queen uh indeed Queen B5 is a move so what do you think about this line so Queen B5 A6 okay Queen A4 is the move of course but let's say we play uh Rook C8 yeah Rook c x on B5 Rook E8 obviously p7 is Bishop D4 Knight f8 Bishop C5 I'm sorry that I'm moving these pieces on the board but I just want to illustrate this line so Queen takes on C3 a bishop takes an f8 Bishop H6 M idea uh obviously black gives a check on A1 to disconnect the bishop so Bishop F1 yeah H5 now do we go here or do we seek something else like from the original position yeah because this is kind of forced um give an assessment at some point you draw a line because you can't Cate this very unlimited so at some point you need to like stop and I draw a line right here so maybe make a couple of more moves you draw a line and you try to assess the position I mean I I guess I have a choice of whether to win this Pawn this Pawn or Play Bishop D6 King H7 looking for some sort of Checkmate okay I would not be confident this is a win I feel like it still requires a lot of precision that would be my evaluation I mean I I don't know how to deal with like these one one of these two pairs of Pawns and I I feel like an engine might figure out how to win this with white but I don't know if I would be able to figure out how to win this with white or if it's winnable at all that is a very good answer you know maybe somebody's going to disagree uh for example engine here says you have to play Bishop C5 E3 Bishop B4 not even take the PA on G5 but I mean that's an engine black wins the third Pawn so you're essentially racing against the opponent's happen here sorry sorry so what happened uh what happens in this line is that you're essentially entering some sort of a race and I think that at this moment you are again going back to the original thought am I the dominating player here am I having the much better position because I recall the rule no funny business in a great position so even though all of this is so really nicely looking I mean this Rook C8 cool idea sacrifice the queen this is great content you know sometimes I also play myself I'm thinking I'm making very interesting content but is this objectively the best I can do and I think that my first and foremost goal here is to win the game so I just want to win the game I have these great pieces here so maybe instead of uh queex on C5 even this entire line is so tempting actually if you talk about this this this line of course I can still like Queen A4 right that was my original idea but then I saw Rook C8 so I was very I was like oh I'm so smart yeah R yeah so I mean it's uh the lesson here is that you don't fall for a beautiful com beautiful combinations just because they are there so you you remain objective that your position is simply too good at the very beginning and I think that you don't want to enter two beautiful uh fancy conations just because they are there because you are slightly risking and I I did not give you the title of the homework for purpose so that you are solving these like normal puzzles but I didn't tell you that the title of the homework is avoid unnecessary complic complications so so that was the idea yeah I know it it it it makes sense I think it's a it's a very it's a good framework especially because um I I probably spent like 15 20 minutes in that position and if I use this framework of no funny business then I can play Queen A4 or Bishop B3 in 2 minutes and uh yeah just quickly understand that I'm fine and I will win the game slowly rather than winning it right now um should I click on the second sure here the question was will you push H6 here so I'm not going to click it I'm gonna wait okay I'm not going to also move it because it's gonna reveal maybe some information so are you going to push H6 here do something else and the question is why would you even consider a choice between H6 and do something else but again I feel that we have to evaluate so we give proper assessment of the position and it's going to really impact what we are going to do next I it definitely feels like uh a strong Advantage for white how strong yeah that's what I'm trying to decide like plus 1.2 maybe I mean that's nice what that's nice yeah like very very plus 1.2 yeah I just uh I mean no I'm trying to use the our our formula I mean okay kings are yeah I would say might there's less danger for my king but I don't think there's a huge amount of danger for the uh for the for the black king either necessarily I mean okay H6 trade queens and that will be that uh but uh I think in the long run D5 will be weak I can put both Knights on F4 a double on the E file I will probably need to play the move B3 just to stop Rook C4 but maybe I don't even have to do that and um all it's almost a dream position it might yeah it might just be a dream position yeah it is I can't even imagine a better position than this to be honest after the opening I QP bad Bishop on E6 want T at the king side better pieces so this is what I call a dominating position and the same rules apply uh as we pre previously discussed no funny business yeah I'm trying to understand what about H6 could be some funny business I mean obviously uh I I don't have to do that I can well my first idea was to trade the queens and play Knight F4 unfortunately I think that runs into Bishop takes G4 which would be a nice thing to uh to but I don't have to play Knight F4 immediately I mean I can play something you mean you take on C7 yeah I like I just wanted to improve my position but then there is back rank Checkmate but yeah I'm trying to think I mean I want to put my knight on F4 there is no threat in the position do you really think this is such a forcing position where you like have to do something immediately like in two moves if you if you miss your chance in two moves that's it you're never going to win this win this game no no I'm just trying to think like how to improve I'm I'm just uh I'm just thinking I I'm MH okay yeah like if I was to calculate H6 obviously black has to take on F4 I I mean I I think so H6 Queen F4 I guess I could start calculating Knight takes F4 G takes H6 like now I'm down a pawn but I'm just going to stop there because I don't understand why I would do that so H6 Queen F4 HG King G7 Knight takes back on F4 there's maybe I mean no actually Bishop G4 there doesn't work but I don't know I mean I've imbalanced the pawn structure I I kind of maybe black now has some counterplay I don't know if H6 Queen F4 HG calculates as like uh not calculates um constitutes as funny business I I can't I mean I'm kind of creating two weaknesses I'm breaking apart uh Black's structure a little bit okay I mean now I'm going to ask you so you're sitting here with black you're desperate your position is so bad uh you have no counterplay and uh your opponent decides to kill you on the spot and plays H6 so you see that the first rank of white is weakened I think if I'm sitting here with black this is what I want I want some change in the position otherwise my position is sad that any type of counterplay will be like a a fresh breathe for my for my position so here after H6 Queen F4 you said H takes on G7 and you're right indeed after King takes on G7 Knight F4 Bishop G4 that will be like a back Frank mate on B1 but white can just play Rook G1 and and and that's it yeah so white is winning a piece but here's this thing we don't have to take on G7 so black can play King G8 now after Knight F4 Bishop takes on G4 white still keeps the advantage but but the question is why do we need this ah King G8 and then yeah yeah instead of taking on G7 I see yeah this is uh yeah because I guess it's easy to convince yourself that here white is still doing well and you didn't do anything wrong I agree I mean you ruin his point structure he cannot take on G4 but when it when it comes to such a moment where you are weakening the first rank for no good reason I don't think that this H6 is so really groundbreaking in this position that uh we we can't live without it so if I'm playing H6 I'm thinking like if I'm not going to play H6 then um it's going to be very difficult for me to win the game so I'm ruining his point structure and if I'm not doing this then then it's going to be very difficult I I see no need to do this that's what I'm saying so for example this is what happened the game by the way so I saw yeah I but I'm trying to understand uh the difference then between like the best waiting move for white um cuz because waiting moves can be B3 Rook G1 uh I mean I just realized I think Rook E3 is like losing tactically to this this and Bishop G4 no yeah but you don't need to do that obviously right no I know I know I'm just saying like it I I have to be a little careful so then I started thinking of more confrontational waiting moves like A3 to maybe weaken the structure but then I'm still giving black maybe the a file so why are you not considering the queen trade I I don't know I guess it's just I guess I'm not considering it because it seems like black will have to do it himself otherwise I will play H6 and that will be very scary so I I guess for example like now I will go here and this looks actually like a much different story so you're pinning your hopes on H6 after all no no I I I was I was just like my point is that um black is going to have to take my queen at some point regardless because I can't really see a move otherwise I mean if you don't I will play H6 with my queen on F4 and so I kind of figured like black has to go here anyway so I might as well make a waiting move I see yeah I guess it's like uh black is the one that has to trade Queens that's sort of mentally what I assumed because I didn't see any way that black could move the queen to A7 or B6 and create some sort of attack so that's why I would play B3 okay and uh if you think about a bit further so let's say the Queens are off the board where does your game lie approximately what are you going to do so for example black plays H6 himself he stops your G5 I me what do you do what's going to be your focus which rule or okay maybe maybe not the rule what kind of feeling is going to drive you further here what do you have to do here yeah I probably have to Target D5 and the queen side uh really well protected I mean he has the Knight the bishop he can have easily two Rooks the pawn on D5 I think it's going to be very very diff to get them I guess I didn't really mean that I would win it per se but just like I would have a knight on F4 I would have um I would put my not on F4 I would maybe double on the defile like I would always pressure it so that black can't really move away but I guess yeah I mean when you say when you say it like that I mean if black plays just hypothetically H6 then I'm going to really wish that the pawns on the queen side didn't defend each other so I'll probably have to play A3 or B3 uh A3 or C3 to weaken them which brings us to the question why do you play B3 in the first place if you want to play A3 because if you play A3 before B3 then The Rook on D3 still guards it you're creating weaknesses but then I roll back to what you said you said that after A3 you are potentially opening the aile which might benefit for your opponent to organize some counterplay and hence we get to the answer why would you want to take when C7 so that's the point yeah I see are creating a weakness on B4 I think this is um a potential two weakness rule your opponent has one weakness um which is the Pawn on E5 and what you're trying to do you're trying to create a second weakness and your knight on D4 stands really nice I think it's quite difficult for you to win the pawn on E5 so just leave it there he has these easy targets at the queen side that you can Target if he had those pawns for example standing on B7 and A6 we would have a completely different story yeah I would be thinking about how do we create another weakness but we already have it right here his pawns are too far stretched that want to the queen side and I think this Pawn on B4 makes it as a very easy Target and by the way by making this move A3 you are uh killing two birds with one stone you're dealing with the back rank issues you're dealing with Bishop takes on G4 and maybe your move of H6 is still going to work that's why I think that the logic here was that you were a bit too Focus on this move H6 and uh something that was holding you back was this unwillingness to take on C7 just because you know I don't want to take on C7 you take on F4 right because you're going to activate my knight but I don't think that this is really uh such a critical difference he takes it or you take it and uh by the way that Queen takes on C7 move is not even Top Choice of an engine but the difference is really small really small and just trade on C7 to have simpler position so that there's no counterplay for example you don't think about this you play A3 you're correct for example black would just reject perhaps the queen trade and now you suddenly have to deal with a counter play at a queen side yeah I'm I'm I'm studying the position so after like let's say takes takes A3 I I need to change my psychology a bit because I look at a position like this and right away it's very different when I play a move like H6 psychologically although flawed I think I'm so close to a win and it's wrong and then what's funny is that if I take take and play A3 I think how the hell am I going to win this position like I don't know how you know black is just going to consolidate why did I trade Queens so I start looking at this I mean obviously it's bad to take because this is a much easier Pawn to Target and also my you know my my pawns will probably crash through easier but then I start thinking okay like what if black plays H6 right so then I'm thinking okay maybe take take and then right here I start I start doubting myself I you know I don't know how to I don't know how to proceed I don't know how to win this position black is going to put the Rook on C4 where where is my Play you know Black's going to bring the Knight to C5 like I don't know what I would do next after taking on C7 and then playing A3 so it would be useful to kind of like when when you get here what do you what's in your head I mean what are you thinking is next probably the happiest person in the world I mean this is my bread and butter position basically I mean absolute favorite iqp positions with a beautiful Knight on D4 with Bishop on E6 and no counterplay whatsoever I so how would you proceed I'm curious like how would I proceed first I think that uh do I want to take on B4 right away or don't I want to take on B4 but I would improve my pieces because I think there's no need for you to force things I would maybe set up a couple of rules for example I never want to trade my knight for the bishop on E6 unless it's really necessary yeah so I'm going to keep my knight on D4 no matter what possibly I'm ready to trade the knights maybe you you know I don't really mind it and definitely I want to keep at least one pair of Rooks on the board so why one pair of Rooks on the board is necessary so that if we have two Rooks on the board there always might be some sort of a counterplay with a open file some pressure we keep at least one Rook on the board then it's easier to use this Rook to generate targets yeah I think already here we have them so I'm not sure I would be thinking about can I take on B4 immediately or maybe just start by improving the pieces so let's start with Rook G1 there's no need to rush let's have a lot of patience let's say Rook G1 black also tries to improve his pieces he plays I don't know something like Rook B8 maybe I could potentially improve my king as well King C1 go closer to the center it's going to control a lot of squares oh sorry I forgot I could click so King C1 let's say black does the same King G8 I take on B4 not sure Rook B4 a takes on B4 I get the King on D2 he probably takes over the a file then I'm thinking maybe I put my knight on A4 create a weakness this is a weak Pawn uh weak Bishop on E6 this is a weak Pawn on B4 essentially I think it's a two weakness rule so the pawn on B4 is weak the bishop on E6 is weak there are some potential uh threats with G4 G5 in the air and uh when your opponent has to defend two weaknesses at the same time it's uh really difficult and I'll just I'll just be patient I'm I'm not going to rush but I think this is this is the patience that we that we talked about that this is what is necessary that you are inside you are very calm you are not like rushing you don't have to finish this game like in half an hour just enjoy this very nice pleasant uh position you know you are grinding it out with no risk and um in the worst case of scenario you're not going to win it okay then you're not going to win it it's completely fine sometimes we get these positions although of course I know that you like to play more Dynamic no I mean it's very I mean like for example this king walk to D2 is just never absolutely never cross my mind but I I I I was also looking yeah when I after taking on B4 and just this hypothetical conversation I was thinking why do I even I mean I don't have to do that I I because am I correct in saying like ba A3 Rook A3 is a is perfect for white but ab4 is slight is better is is not as perfect like to me it's it's very intuitive at least I think it's very intuitive this is a much better version of what can happen probably because you're going to get the King on D2 I think you need to activate a king okay maybe C3 King C2 I'm not entirely sure of course we keep a close eye on Black's counterplay because you look at the Knight on F6 it's really ridiculous probably which is why I'm scared of this stuff but I guess there's nothing to be scared of it's yeah it's just you always play B3 that's why I don't like this this C3 move because with a Pawn on C2 I think if I play B3 then my queen set is a bit easier to keep together so I would probably try to get the King on D2 Rook G1 Rook A1 and uh try to press the pawn on A5 there's no need to rush yeah just uh maybe this is also where you could greatly improve that uh you are uh more willing to make these patient slow improving moves that uh you you don't have to crush the opponent very quickly all right let's uh select the next game I remember this game too yeah yeah yeah would I would I take on F7 did I take on F7 in the game yeah you did holy crap that is a crazy move you played Knight F7 and Rook Rook E6 this is what you played yeah wow so I played uh I played Knight F7 King F7 yeah okay this is the chess L yeah I was trying to you know play like tall um I think you even won the game by the way yeah I did but remember I was I I was worse for sure but yeah this tournament wasn't wasn't bad I I I won a couple of games um but okay uh yeah the alternative is um finding a a plan for uh for white I mean I mean queen H3 looks pretty nice oh you're still going for this KN of s yeah but that that's like the first candidate move uh alternatively but if I if I may um what do you think of help you to get to the right decision because I think that you need to formulate what are the resources for your potential attack so you have the Knight on E5 Queen on H4 Bishop on D3 Rook on E1 is there something else sorry I I was I was calculating um yeah yeah what I was saying is that are you um are you ready for an attack I mean you're thinking okay I have every single piece basically I have here positioned at the potential King at attack and uh May you are thinking of ways to get even more pieces in the attack for much less cost because when you play Knight F7 and rookie E6 this is a gigantic sacrifice I mean you're sacrificing yeah total of seven it's not even a piece it's it's it's not even a rook it's it's seven yeah it's like I mean there has to be like I don't know I mean something like mindboggling but again I mean it's it's very tempting especially if you have seen some TS games but you got to resist the temptation yeah so I mean I know from experience just vague experience like D5 is always a major idea in these types of positions because you um you yeah okay I guess I spoiled it I was just trying to make it without clicking yeah because you activate your dark squared bishop and you kind of shut out the the other one so I mean I just very quickly I took a look like if Knight D5 there's just Queen H5 I think which is very strong you attack F7 you I think it's just lost for black completely lost actually I mean I don't see any any move um Knight F4 Queen F7 that looks like a mate immediately on G7 I guess the only move I really have to calculate here is ed5 because everything else is probably also losing I don't see I mean I don't see it so ed5 and I mean I can tell you I 100% looked at this in the game but I probably just didn't see what I play here and I probably have to play I mean I can't play D5 in the game so let's say like D5 ed5 and there's just a moment there like um where I have to calculate and and see if I am actually in time with anything but uh I have a question are you looking for a forced win here uh yeah I mean it it's probably like I'm incorrect but like I would never calculate cd5 uh sorry D5 E5 cd5 I would never because I I mean I guess black just plays Bishop takes and I am just a pawn down maybe there's E5 Bishop F5 but then in the best case scenario you are winning an exchange for a pawn yeah and I I don't think this is that great I mean I don't not to mention there's probably just Rook a eight or something but um but no yeah I would just be calculating the forced win but uh okay E5 I mean I guess I would calculate Knight G4 I mean I'm calculating Knight G4 or Knight F7 those are probably my or Bishop F5 those are my but here's the problem and you actually already noted that yourself that after some slower moves black has to move d4 so after D5 e takes D5 let's say n G4 you still have to account for D4 so he's going to close your bishop and you put yourself in a position where you have to like do something right away and again I think this is a very good moment but you could make a second mistake in the row like okay whatever let's burn yeah on H6 yes exact I was calculating that yeah yeah but but I I I didn't see anything I mean I can't get my rook in so I would probably just reject this but and I don't have a mate uh so it's very slow so you can assume yeah that black is going to have something okay I mean I would still try to calculate something but if I don't have like the threat in two moves then probably something is terribly wrong with my position yeah just Queen C6 and here probably right yep that that makes perfect sense yeah so you found it like in 10 seconds immediately um but that's why I would go back back here uh to this moment and um ask yourself why would you discard C on D5 because it's a pawn but it does activate your Bishop on B2 yeah ah it's tough yeah I I maybe knowing somewhere in the preparation or like model games that this is doable would make things easier it just it just feels so tough to lose a Central Pawn Yeah no issues to sacrifice the bishop and The Rook I know the Knight and the Rook the KN the this is I know I know no but but so is the I mean the best move is Bishop D5 right I I guess because Rook D5 seems to walk into I mean at least Bishop C4 but yeah Rook D5 is at least Bishop C4 and then after Rook D1 white can even play Rook D1 so if I may so for example Rook B5 Bishop C4 here maybe there's even no need to rush yeah I just I just take it here and I have such a beautiful activity of my pieces and something like Rook f8 I see 9 G6 I see 97 I see all kinds of ideas for one Pawn yeah it's it's a very little price so you're right indeed uh this is probably not good knight E5 for Bishop D5 probably Bishop D5 and you know my logic just says listen I have two Bishops the Queen the Knight The Rook looking at the king it just feels there could be something here even if I don't see it immediately and I but you you wouldn't stop your calculation here no no no I wouldn't I I would I mean here what I would try to do I think I would like spot D5 immediately just like you did because it's such a thematic move I open up the bishop after D5 uh again I think from my opponent's perspective if I do this I mean what my opponent is going to do KN E5 Queen H5 as you already said if he does something else I don't care right I have a lot of promising moves like d on E6 so I assume he's going to take it then of course like you already said I would be looking for some kill shot like maybe now Knight F7 Works maybe KN G4 works but then I notice my opponent is going to play D5 D4 so I think okay I have to take on E5 it's only a pawn and again I toate some forcing moves like Knight E5 Rook E5 and then eventually I decide probably he's going to play Bishop takes on D5 and from afar I try to get at least some sort of this is what I call my minimal program my minimal move if everything fails I have at least this so what could be this minimal conation here I'm thinking it could be 9 G4 because it makes perfect sense yeah yeah yeah I mean I have seen many games like this I think you you have to say goodbye to this yeah this type of you're you're gifting so many points like this I mean some of the games you win but it's just unnecessary so unnecessary
