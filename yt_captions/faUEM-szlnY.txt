foreign [Music] so this is the Galaxy S10 and this phone is really hot right now obviously and one of the main reasons for that is the display some people love it some people hate it but there's no really arguing that there's not really a lot like it out there so this is a closer look at what makes the Galaxy S10 so special that screen so I've said in videos before this is the best display on any phone there are really three main characteristics that make this such a unique display number one the hole punch camera cutout number two the ultrasonic fingerprint reader and number three just the quality of the panel itself so to start with the hole punch cut out it's pretty straightforward on our way to bezel-less displays we got notches we got smaller notches and then eventually we got things like the fingerprint readers moving behind the display glass so the only thing left is the front facing camera so in Galaxy S10 it's a laser cut hole in Samsung's AMOLED panel a process that's not totally unique and when we saw the cutout in the honor view 20 but that was CD display this is of course an OLED so this being the first in an OLED and Samsung is really proud of that and how precise it is and I can vouch the hole punch is definitely a little tighter around the actual camera than honors also something interesting so the Galaxy S10 has that single cut out while the Galaxy S10 plus has a dual cutout on the top corner I was told that that second spot is for a depth sensor and that this is not a second camera but when you open the camera app on the S10 plus you get these two buttons which looks like a normal and a wide a normal one for one person and you click it and the wide angle for multiple people it seems to be two different camera angles turns out this is literally just cropping in on one wide angle sensor so if you cover the right hand side of the cutout and swap between the cameras they both work and if you cover the left hand side it's blocking both angles so this button is literally just cropping in and out of one camera fun fact the right hand side cutout really is just for a depth sensor for portrait mode anyway I'll have more thoughts on how it it looks with videos and full screen games and just generally getting used to it and things like that in the full review but so far it's actually really not that bad at all I mean despite it being basically a notch I find it a little less obtrusive than an actual Notch also for those wondering this is how screenshots look on the S10 plus when it's drawing that animation around the camera cutout alright so the second distinguishing feature here is the ultrasonic fingerprint reader underneath the display so you remember maybe if you're here the first durability test I did with one of the earliest under glass fingerprint sensors that was an optical sensor now I'm not going to go that far again with sandpaper and everything because this is my only Galaxy S10 but there are still some unique questions now about the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor versus Optical so number one just around the same page about what ultrasonic is that means it's using really high frequency sound waves firing off of your finger to map the depth of The Ridges of your fingerprint in 3D so when you hear it like that that is way more advanced than having the optical sensor which is literally a tiny camera taking a little 2D snapshot of your finger when it lights it up on your fingers on the glass so this is more secure and more difficult to duplicate is it faster sometimes a little bit kinda so from my experience if you just hold your finger down like normal it won't seem that much faster mostly because this is just how we've gotten used to these fingerprint sensors but what you'll really notice is if you don't hold your finger down as long or don't press it nearly as firmly you can basically just touch the screen for a split second and it unlocks this would trigger an optical sensor to ask you to hold it down for longer but with the ultrasonic it really is much faster if you just touch your finger just lightly that is really impressive and of course the fact that you don't have to light up the display to read your finger that is a real advantage and I love that and it's supposed to be better at reading your finger through dirt and water so if your finger is wet or something it'll work better so let's find out all right so I have here uh some water I think in a typical situation where you might need to unlock your fingerprint but it has something on it is maybe you're working out or something and you're sweating so I'm going to use Galaxy S10 and OnePlus 6t as two examples of fingerprint readers that uh need to be unlocked all right so let's start with OnePlus 6t under the glass works perfectly so that's good get some water on my hand unlock it or try to unlock it and I'm getting a good old not recognized and it's asking for that swipe doesn't recognize me just with a little bit of water on my thumb so I guess let's go to the Galaxy S10 straight off the bat if I dry my hand dry hand works perfectly so I'll get some water on my hand and it still worked that works pretty flawlessly let's get another go no problem no problem at all all right another thing that was asked a lot in the community forums uh when I asked you guys what you wanted to know about Galaxy S10 was screen protectors does the screen protector work with the Galaxy s10's ultrasonic fingerprint sensor more importantly what types of screen protectors work so I have a regular screen protector and I have a glass screen protector all right so the first we'll try is this is a regular screen protector it was made for Galaxy S10 and you can already buy this in stores but for right now while the screen protector is not on it works it doesn't even have to be a perfect install for this demo so this may be the messiest screen protector install of all time but as long as I get the bubbles out around the screen protector fingerprint reader which I have then it should work so I'm going to go ahead and yep you can use a fingerprint reader with a screen protector on Galaxy S10 you can try the glass one so a hint that this might not work is you can go into an ATT store or any carrier store right now that's carrying this on and you can buy a Galaxy S10 you can buy a regular screen protector for the Galaxy S10 but they won't sell you a glass screen protector for the Galaxy S10 because they don't make them so this is a glass screen protector for the iPhone there's a couple different types but they're essentially all the same thing they're supposed to be shatter resistant you put this tempered glass over your display to give you that extra durability but the ultrasonic fingerprint reader I'm gonna guess right now probably won't be able to read through his glass so right now no screen protector on unlocks just fine so step one peel this layer of adhesive off and I'm just going to put it straight across the bottom right there and now there's a glass screen protector over the bottom of the phone have you ever seen an installation this bad hopefully not so let's see if this will work through the glass it knows there's a finger there and it's asking me to cover the whole fingerprint sensor but it's not detecting if I take this off so uh that's a no-go on glass screen protector for Galaxy S10 yes to a regular one but uh unless you want to get one of those weird screen protectors with a circular cut out around the fingerprint reader uh I would say no to Glass all right so the last big bullet point for this display and just the panel itself is how good it is period so resolution 3040 by 1440 3K the brightness is 1200 nits at its peak brightness which is brighter than most TVs it's 6.4 inches from corner to corner on the S10 plus it has the curved edges like we talked about the super thin top and bottom bezels physically it's Top Notch well I guess you can't say it's it's not actually Top Notch because the notch is not the you get what I mean so there are two display modes out the box it's on this natural mode which actually to my eye for the first time ever in a Samsung phone actually looks a bit muted out the box and then there's Vivid mode which is very saturated Vivid is a great word for it there's still that adjustable color temperature and all that but that's the Samsung look that you're used to also out the box it's going to be at its 2280 by 1080 resolution instead of Max which is to preserve battery life but if you want that extra bit of crispiness especially when watching video you can go ahead and bump that up in the display settings and enjoy all the pixels in their 3K Glory but as of right now that's pretty much everything you need to know about the Galaxy s10's display it's one of the reasons people like this phone so much and many other Samsung displays as I've said in the past that's why their phones are popular but let me know what you guys think of course this is not the full review that video is in the pipeline as well so feel free to subscribe to see that when it comes out and of course you can share this one with those who are interested in the Galaxy S10 thanks for watching catching out with the next one peace
