today with a match up against a 1300 rated subscriber whose username is Solace of the stream uh and uh here we go I I really enjoy this series actually let me know if you enjoy the series um and we will start right away with the Gotham Scandinavia now a very quick Point all the courses that I have have free samples so at least you can test them out and see for yourself uh I have been really really really enjoying my time playing the Scandinavian defense uh I I have found that it is one of the easiest openings to play even at my level which is 2400 rapid but even at 2700 Blitz like I'm loving life and this is the main line my opponent has played the most popular move one of the reasons I really love the Scandinavian is it's forcing it forces opponents to play into something that right away is on your terms right so the way my opponent has played this this position is going to happen in about 90% of your games and the opponent will develop the Knight and also probably develop this Pawn here so I develop my knight and um yeah Bishop C4 is normal but like at some point they have to play this move uh technically here the the most accurate move is to pin the Knight because white has not really committed this Pawn but I'm just going to show you what happens if you just play this opening the way it's kind of supposed to be played uh my opponent has played the pawn to D3 which is just a touch more passive and probably they're going to go Bishop D2 which is very normal or not and we when the pawn is on D4 really what I like to do is I like to move my Bishop to the B4 Square uh and then I like to capture this Knight that is actually a little bit less powerful right now that is the way my Scandinavian uh generally goes the reason why this is not a particularly good move right now is because when the bishop comes there and ultimately lands on the C3 Square when this trade happens the white Pawn is not here and then that Bishop on on the C3 Square will be a lot more powerful uh on that diagonal is it like the worst thing in the world not really but generally the best way to play if you're not going to play the Scandinavian with a bishop to be4 my opponent is just just rattling off these moves uh is to play C6 E6 and kind of play like this and I and I'm just going to play this very very standard basic Scandinavian uh there is no attack on my knight but this is a very common move that people play in the scandi uh I'm just going to to finish up my development make sure I'm not blundering anything and I'm Rock Solid right and if my queen was ever to put be put in any danger I would slide the queen back to C7 and I would be very happy H3 is nothing wrong with this move I was even thinking to play Bishop G4 I think before we get into a big fight before we do anything else why don't we just finish up our development right we haven't gotten all the pieces out yet Scandinavian is a little bit passive with the Knight and Bishop here not traditionally standing on the most active squares also a little bit passive with these two pawns they're not really on the fifth rank but they are springboard pawns right they support other pawns to advance into the position uh and to potentially cause some problems now I was thinking to play this move H6 a very common question in chess is like is that sacrifice a thing H6 and your opponent can sacrifice the bishop for two pawns it does look a little bit dangerous I have to say it might be not the most Pleasant thing in the world um I mean I I I I don't see anything wrong with this move B5 and I feel like at this level this is a very standard you know natural kind of followup and now the Bishop has to slide back when we put the bishop there I'm looking at two things number one I'm looking to chase it down with pawns and trap it that's the first thing I'm looking for the second thing that I'm looking for is to potentially just trade it off right and so I don't really want to trade it off I feel like that's just relieving white of pressure uh and not to mention the fact that then I'm just going to be attacked here I think my queen has sort of served the purpose so I could just slide back like I could just go back to the C7 Square here or B6 very tough to say or d8 right but let's just you know let's just go back to the C7 square and we're preparing this Advance now I do have to speed up of course I'm I'm trying to be instructive um and uh that's why I'm obviously playing a bit slowly when we move our Queen to a square like this we do have to think about the whole time we're going to be thinking about what does our opponent want okay I mean clearly our opponent wants the bishop one thing you have to realize here is you are protected but there's a rook on the other side of the board and you just got to look you got to look on the other side you got to see what does this Rook see so our options are get out of the way with the bishop or potentially bring the bishop right back here me personally I like the bishop on that square and we're taking toward the center to make sure we're still protected here and we have a rock solid formation near our King that was not a bad trade for white it's completely reasonable trade and now we have to kind of figure out what's next right what is next in this position well we've traded our light squared Bishop so just the rule of friendly friendly piece of advice after that you should probably keep as many pawns on light squares as possible uh remember this was our plan it's not really the best plan but I'm going to just justify it because that's why I did that and now we're trying to just hunt our opponent down with our Queens side pawns probably for white white should Strike Back uh A3 is fine but it's very passive this is a pure strike back kind of a move our options are ignore but that would lose a pawn uh push which makes the knight move uh take which I don't like because it splits our pawns or just protect you know if we if we push we have to be certain that there's a followup and then the knight's going to go to the middle what's the followup a lot of people would play here though but I think at this level it is actually important to kind of learn these little like moments of maybe pushing I don't know let's I feel like for this level pushing is exactly what would happen and now white is going to go here and we're going to take and then our Bishops are going to stare at each other my opponent's actually playing great like this is so far the position is quite equal I I I will need to start uh having to put my foot on the gas a little bit otherwise you know is not going to be I'm going to leave myself with no time at the end um now again here I'm I I am protected it's a very balanced game um I can take I can ignore I can try to bring a rook to the center there a lot of possibilities uh I I I do feel like people would be relieving themselves of of the tension here a bit but there is no you know exact reason to do that so I'm going to put my rook in the center and sometimes people people ask like how do you know which Rook should go to the center or not uh very tough question the truth is like I I wouldn't move that Rook to that square because then I would be weakening my king a bit but maybe maybe that was the right decision you know right now a very curious idea by my opponent is Bishop takes Knight which is generally not what you want to give away but then to try to put the Knight on G5 so for example Bishop takes if I take back with the Knight put the Knight on that square okay Bishop Bishop there is a uh is a fine move uh my original idea here was just simply to slide my queen to the B6 Square uh E5 is okay but it opens up that Bishop it might not be the I mean I could play E5 and then maybe I can take and I can go trade that Bishop like that that that is a possibility um you know what let's just let's let's just show it let's just show it let's just show it the reason why E5 is not the best move you see I'm opening up that Bishop but but I do I do want to play moves I don't want to constantly tell you like what the move I can imagine at that level would be and then not play it right like I I need I need to strike this balance so I'm going to play E5 I could have moved my queen to B6 previously I would have gone there but I can't right now because of this Knight these Knights are having a staring contest okay I could take this with the bishop I would not take it with the pawn because I would open my king although it's not the end of the world uh this safeguards the center so it's definitely not a bad move and my next move is going to be Knight C5 unless my opponent plays Bishop E3 uh in which case I can't play Knight C5 and I would I okay well now I'm I mean I'm I'm really considering Knight C5 and and and if I take take and and split the pawns that's going to be a problem for my opponent I do have to keep this protected like a move like Queen E3 for example does attack my pawn and so what I would probably do is take the bishop and go here but I it's it's a very back and forth game uh and uh it is I mean it is it is not clear at all who has an advantage here you know Queen E2 okay similar concept going after this queen E3 was a little bit more active U um I'm going to take because that was always my plan but it's actually not like a fantastic situation for me because even though I'm weakening my opponent's D3 Pawn Rook C1 is putting a lot of pressure on my Pawn as well so this one's going to go to the end game this one's going to go to the end game I'm going to have to take advantage of my opponent's damage structure and I will have to I will just have to start playing a little bit faster there's no if uh ifans are I I can't speak uh this move actually looks annoying I have to say uh trying to put some pressure here on on the pin and uh I I might have really underestimated that move actually so now I can't take I can't really move if I get taken I'm going to have to make a trade probably uh Bishop takes and then yeah like I I I might just have to make a waiting move here I'm not really sure what I mean maybe I can let me just yeah I'm going to make a waiting move so if my opponent takes I'm going to trade Rooks and one of the pieces is going to have to stop defending that pawn I I couldn't take with the rook and I couldn't take with the pawn and I couldn't move my queen out of the way because then there would be this move so yeah pretty crazy my opponent uh doing a nice job there I mean seriously putting some very meaningful pressure on my position like I'm I'm I'm getting a a little bit a little bit concerned not not a huge amount concerned but enough concerned okay Bishop takes um I mean I don't I mean I I got to take I don't really see right so now they're going to take with the pawn and I have M you know what's what's funny I don't know why they're thinking what are they thinking about they got to take with the pawn I don't what's what's the Thought here okay I can take like this by the way which um it's probably bad I don't know why I would do that but I can take both ways so let's trade remove one of the Defenders of the center pawn and we're going to get our rook in the center and it's it's equal I mean what what what what to say you know uh opponent has played very very well to this point and um it's going to come down to a a potentially crazy Queen end game and my one advantage is that White's pawns are sort of stuck and I can like get in there with a queen and try to win them but you don't have to take I mean you don't have to take and activate my pieces for me I'm expecting a move like Queen D7 but Queen D7 is very desperate like a better move is Queen D2 just just waiting just not getting too hesitant and then I'm going to start kind of Marching In when you're this deep in the end game uh they just blundered a pawn that's very bad yeah Queen D2 would have been a bit better I guess my opponent did play quite well but then panicked a little bit and and and now is just losing because my king is very safe yeah I expected Queen D7 but the problem is I'm taking this and the truth is I'm I'm I mean I'm I'm totally winning actually and and I'm totally winning because I can give a check and I just advance and uh I'm always looking for a queen trade I'm always looking for a queen trade but now my Pawn's too strong so once my Pawn gets to guaranteed queening it's over what you can do here with white is you can try to go for Perpetual check you can try to catch me in a Vortex that's that's the best option option play like Queen C4 and you know I I I do have to be careful not to get Perpetual I would probably get out of that by kind of like hiding my king okay uh yeah but now I have Queen C I'm looking for checks Queen C2 and and and and I've completely secured my Pawn's promotion now and there is no check and not only that you can't even I mean I guess you can play Queen G5 you can play Queen G5 that's maybe what you can do to try to hope for Perpetual very good and and now I'm looking for do I have a check and can I push I need to just make sure that's protected I can give a check myself but then the king hides so my my my logic here was going to be just to play F6 which which I mean it it must work right like I I I I'm just blocking the the checks like I just you know and and and now I can even run my king you know that's that's the the funny part is like I can dance all the way over to the other side of the board just making sure I don't get mated but like if my opponent plays Queen D4 and try oh but Queen d8 I just go right back right so as long as you don't get caught in the vortex you're going to survive and because I have this very nice wall of Pawns uh my king is just going to be able to dance around it constantly and I can't get trapped in a circle so Scandinavian is a listen Scandinavian is a tough opening uh to crack with white I mean you saw my opponent there they got a little bit of pressure but uh okay let me just double check that I'm not doing anything stupid B2 check King here or yeah I mean it looks like it looks like that's it I mean that's one if I get that second Queen it's game over and um white put a little bit of pressure but yeah that's not going to cut it unfortunately and now we can even pre moove we'll pre-move all these moves because I am pretty certain there is no way through I yeah I don't think so I'm pre-moving all the moves there's no way to trick me because you might yeah you might check me but that's not yeah I want to check actually I mean listen my opponent played very well that game I I'm going to have to raise my level today if uh if if I want to have smoother games so that's a check and now you you look for mate you look for mate I think we're going to get a mate we're going to get a mate right there it's mate Queen takes Pawn of course you can just do ladder by far the easiest thing to do with two queens is to just do a ladder mate I don't know why my opponent is thinking right now there we go that's how we'll get that ladder White had a pretty comfortable position I mean I got to and by the way by the way E5 was a bad move so Queen B6 was equal his position was in the balance I allowed my opponent to get a little bit of activity um and uh you know D4 positions equal I mean the position is was in the balance for a while white played very very well you know and and the Scandinavians one of these openings like it forces the issue but if white doesn't want to have fun if white just wants to play an equal solid game it's going to be typical point2 advantage that white gets I think I followed my game plan pretty well like a you know this queenside advancement and I was uh I I thought my game plan was was pretty straightforward uh the best move here is is probably not B4 uh but it's okay like I was going to play Rook B8 or or B4 and I mean you got to give credit to my opponent like I think I think white played quite well in this game and uh and tried tried their best I mean really like that was that that was a very good game of chess and it was balanced for a minute and then it kind of went to the end game and and maybe my opponent needs the end gamees master class because here black is a bit better forever due to these weak pawns and I would have very slowly methodically brought my pieces down uh in a position like this you're always looking to simplify as well you're looking like will the transition to the pawn end game be good or bad that's endgames Master Class use the code spring if you're interested but um I thought that was a a very good start a very very good start and uh yeah I mean if that's indicative of of anything that's going to happen today I am I'm I'm slightly terrified so um 1500 is the next opponent I don't know how to say this person's username I'm playing White I was sitting here like waiting for my opponent to move um let's play uh let's play D4 I don't I maybe I'll go for London maybe I'll go for Queens Gambit we'll see maybe I'll go for chowski maybe I'll go for trosi I think I'm GNA play E4 in my next game I'm G to play E4 against the 1900 today's a very tough episode I don't what's my my opponent doesn't know that it's their move okay D4 C6 fascinating so do they want me to play this this is what people play if they want to go into a caroon um I can play a London or we can play a slav defense like this uh I feel like I play London all the time but I also feel like you know London is one of these openings that's sort of always useful to uh to learn so I'm I'm going to do it I wonder if if this was kind of the backup idea a lot of people play like this as well they they try to immediately go after your B2 Pawn okay they're not doing that so we're just going to play a London and and I'm going to show you why C6 is a very slight inaccuracy against the London when handled correctly everything in the London um is based around these two squares right uh sorry these two squares okay they're trying to reverse London me Annoying let's develop our Knight that's basically never a bad move and now we have to make an executive decision are we going to turn this into a uh Queen's Gambit or we going to we going to trade that bishop and not turn this into a Queen's Gambit um C4 is a move now [Music] um let's do it I I always enjoy against opponents that move their light squared Bishop out to put my queen out on B3 this is this this is simple that's this sort of plays into what we want and and this is not what my opponent this is really not what they should be going for because they have so many pawns on light squares you don't want to put pawns on light squares and then trade this bishop off now there is a trap here the Trap is if I defend this Knight with my Rook there is still a pin and after Rook C1 there is actually Queen A2 which is probably why my opponent is going for this in the first place um but that's why I would start with Queen B3 which is the entire reason we try to play C4 anyway right so now you have a choice you know you can trade the queens or not uh I don't know which one is better I I would never trade the Queens personally because I really like the pressure that I can exert on the position so I think we'll do it that way now black will probably play like this and try to put more pressure on this Pawn but now we can move the Rook okay so the plan here is probably just developing castle like we we don't need to get into a big fight I would feel much more comfortable getting into a big fight after castling but also a move like Bishop D6 is very very annoying and is sort of the punishment for trading off your dark squared bishop and I really want to play this move to kind of you know what I think I will like I I I like I said I think I can't always be nice right it might not be the best move but it's sort of the point this is the point the point is that if you give me the dark squares and another way of of doing this is if the bishop is back here on C1 what you do is you play A4 sometimes and then Bishop A3 and if black plays a triangle defense in the Queen's Pawn in D4 C4 positions you can't trade the dark squared Bishop like this and if you do you have to do it in a way where you trade it for the dark squared Bishop because if you trade oh the dark squ Bishop all right um this is what's going to happen and this is straight out of middle game's master class on on Chesley you know in case you want to check it out like this move prevents castling and what's going to happen now is I mean by the way by the way I think Bishop B4 is winning I was going to go here but this looks devastating where does the queen go because now I have a discovered attack and I'm taking and they're going to lose Pawns in the center which is really bad yeah my opponent's just on the run now the question is do I take this Pawn or do I take this Pawn it's a very tough question or do I shove the pawn in I don't know I feel like pushing the pawn in I it might get a little stuck so I think I'm going to tell you I'm going to take this Pawn to prevent the Knight getting out I don't want to help my opponent I understand the bishop is going to come out but I don't think that's a big deal like I think you can just go back with my queen and it's tough to say which one is better I I don't want to interfere on the dark squares so I think that's what I'm going to do now black is going to go here unquestionably okay or 97 they're trying to Castle um at this point I I don't think I can continue to bully here so maybe it's time we do this and now they're gonna C now I'm just the pawn up with the bishop pair so what you do when you are up a pawn and the middle of the board has not really been determined like who is winning the center of the board take space so I'm thinking E4 C4 Knight G5 to make that advantageous exchange Knight G5 there is this move but that also does look quite promising a nice little attack on the king with Knight G5 and and E4 um feel like a lot of people would play Knight G5 then Bishop F5 then we can trade take take the threat of mate is renewed yeah let's go for this so it's a threat to damage the structure and mate my opponent now very fortunate that Bishop F5 is possible I think oh but that opened up this right and so I I can take both um let's simplify first and now we're going to take on f8 yeah so that's that's just the blunder unfortunately I think my opponent's in a little bit of a panic mode here still instructive though how do we win this position okay so now again we're up three points we're up a lot so how do we win this there's a lot of possibilities advancing with your pawns to make trades is good uh flank Pawn to open up the Rooks is good Bishop here to trade the bishop for the Knight is good a lot is good I think the best move I see a rook and I see a king and I'm like let's just open it up I mean really and if the opponent plays Knight E7 that opens my queen and that's bad to worse right like F5 is a devastating move move for black right now cuz I'm going to shred the position open my queen is getting in my Rook is getting activated and you've got to be sharp with how to activate your pieces without actually moving them and I think this is just really Brute Force just F4 F5 um I mean I can shove the king into the corner but this this just looks so powerful right Queen and rug getting in very powerful stuff uh we've got a we've got a bishop attack on the way um we got a queen attack on the way shoving the king back Black's very lucky Queen f8 is not a Checkmate and by the way by the way if you just want to snap the Knight off just to make it easier you can probably do that um Queen F7 to trade Queens is a good move uh but I'm going to go for it I'm I think what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna I'm going to set a trap I'm gonna play Rook F3 to double my okay my opponent's just playing too fast um the Trap was this but then there would be Queen f8 Checkmate now what's funny is I can still play Rook F1 and I'm still going for a queen sacrifice Checkmate on the back rank but in a real rapid game you would need to play a bit faster cuz three minutes down is uh is really not a good situation I'm sacrificing my Bishop to sacrifice my queen okay and uh now I also have a very fancy tactic by the way um it doesn't quite work so I I I'm going to I'm going to back up for it's actually taking the night it's a very famous Tac I couldn't do it on this move because they would have taken my Bishop unfortunately it's still winning of course but um the tactic is taking the Knight and Black's King is stuck because of my Bishop so Rook H3 is actually mate kind of brutal in fact I am threatening this tactic even if the queen goes there because there are they have to stop mate yes so I can take the Knight this is really brutal look at this ow very very nasty and they can't take BEC okay well they do and yeah unfortunately that is uh I think I think this person was just a bit nervous they they played a bit nervy they played a bit fast and uh we do get the win shout out to the D4 Dynamite course again you like anything you see you can check out the courses and use the code spring um I think that was a pretty smooth game and I and I think I demonstrated the problem of my opponent giving up the dark sored Bishop too early so in the London against these kind of slow positions like with C6 first of all don't play E4 because your opponent obviously wants to play a caroan right so I like to turn the game into a Queen's Gambit in many many different London positions because I like to bring my queen out and put pressure on this Pawn particularly when this bishop leaves it's just kind of my strategy and this is incorrect you see how the advantage goes from2 which is standard in the opening to 6 if I played Knight B 2 KN C3 is4 um and now it's 6 and and now it's it's one it's plus one on move seven so even at 1500 rapid if you don't have the exact knowledge the exact understanding of some of these openings you're going to run into these problems where it it just won't work like you're the way you're playing this opening just doesn't work and now it's 2.5 now it's 2.5 and and and you know it's 2.5 because of Bishop D6 now I got it I got in an accuracy here because I was just trying to Castle but again the best move to prevent your opponent from castling you're going to have these positions sometimes the stronger you are at chess 1500 16 17 depending on how the opening goes you're going to have these moments where you're like I know my opponent wants to Castle but can I not let them and Bishop D6 is how you don't let them Castle because if they Castle they're going to lose the Knight there's no easy way to defend the Knight you see what happened and all of a sudden black is completely lost black is down upon pawn and still has all the problems of the position and we got there because our opponent played in a way where where where the opening didn't make sense it wasn't a cohesive approach to the opening so first of all y'all need something against the London unfortunately that's the reality of the situation um and uh that that's that's sort of how it works in in in modern day and I thought I I did a nice job demonstrating that uh in this game in particular with this kind of queen B3 approach and then once we got the extra Pawn you know Knight G5 is the best move and my idea here was that after this I can sure I can advance and you know I can I can I can play F4 I could just get as aggressive as possible My Simple Plan was just to trade mate is still threatened so black has to weaken their King and then we have a lot of dark squared weaknesses to work with maybe I would play E4 and try to get my queen over there right that that looks very nice if the opponent starts kicking me out they have weak pawns near the king but but a lot of Chess has to be played and there is there is no guarantee at all that we would have won but but uh we did now I think my next opponent is actually challenging me but I don't see it uh the next person I actually have to issue a challenge to uh there we go or I just Auto started the game so yes my opponent didn't develop correctly there and um I think my this opponent is on a mobile device so I will remind them that I started the game I started the game okay sometimes there's uh drama in how to win a chess okay now my opponent is not online that's that's always a bad sign will they go back there we go let's try again this person is 1720 okay okay this time we have a D4 I've played the Dutch uh quite a bit I've played it quite extensively so I'm going to go back to playing the Dutch defense uh again all the stuff is available oh my opponent's playing my course against me that's so funny oh my goodness this is very funny I think my opponent owns the D4 Dynamite course Queen D3 is is is kind of my my idea uh okay I didn't invent it or anything but the point is to put pressure on this pawn and uh and potentially get black into a very very Danger ous position by sacrificing over here so if my opponent is well prepared uh they are going to get themselves into a very good position I'm I'm I'm just going to take the center and now the idea yeah that's that's the point and that's that that that could be very very scary uh to deal with if you've never seen before so my my suggestion would be don't take my suggestion would be uh play a bit more solidly all right I'm going to play E6 I'm gonna I'm going to react as a as a person that that is getting hit with a Gambit right and doesn't kind of want to get bulldozed so we have a trade and now I'm just going to develop right I'm going to I'm going to develop my pieces I'm going to get my knight out get my Bishop out and when you're getting hit with a Gambit early in the game you want to keep calm all right you don't want to panic like I'm I'm seeing this the first thing that comes to mind is just play Pawn to G6 now there are times you can strike back right and so this is kind of funny this is like one of those moments where the the Sensei is having you know their tricks used against them I am basically giving my opponent the optimal setup now my opponent's playing very fast again don't know if this is like nerves or if this is just how people play like they're just really really fast uh I can play Bishop G7 or I can offer a trade of Bishops I do like relieving the pressure here my opponent's just just rattling off moves I mean so quickly it's like unbelievable um I don't want to trade it's a very very normal idea by white to try to get me to trade to open up the The Rook so let me develop my knight normally Knight is bad in front of the C Pawn it's not good to put the knight in front of the C Pawn but I think I want a castle that was really bad um they had the option to do that on the last move and because of that I mean it's basically like white lost a whole turn I mean think about this if my opponent took it would be White's move with my queen out but look at now it's White's move and I have my queen and Knight out so that was bad um that was a big waste of time actually I just got a whole move and I hope that's instructive because yeah that was definitely inaccurate and I can get my Bishop out here I'm going to put the bishop here because I want to keep the E file open it's a little bit instructive we're getting to that level now where every move counts every decision counts I'm going to Castle long I think white is also going to Castle along and now now I'm I'm going straight in right I mean I I'm defending that square very nicely and I'm going to put Rooks on the open file and my opponent did play the Gambit but they didn't play it exactly right and if you don't play this opening exactly right you're you're going to fail to put people under pressure I mean when you play really aggressively in the beginning of the game if you rush it and you a lot of my opponents they playing very fast they got they kind of got to chill out they got to think about their moves if you if you don't put your opponents under meaningful pressure uh they're just going to get out of it and and um I they're going to be have a better position I'm really worried white is going to go here like you really don't want to play a move that's so passive but luckily they they do and they do in fact play that move that was the best move Queen E3 would have run it head first into Pawn to F4 now let's get a couple of things out of the way um what does my opponent want right tough to say because when you look at forward moves in this position there's really not a lot like why can't make a whole bunch of moves you can't go here because that's a fork um so for me you know I don't want to touch this this is Rock Solid I'm thinking just put that Rook on the open file I'm also thinking get my king out of just all of that that's that's that's always a useful move um I don't want to take I don't want to relieve the pressure I want to go on an attack but then I would relieve my control of the center so and then it's a question of which Rook do I put well if I put this Rook here you know on that square what what happens to this Rook like I'm thinking there and then this Rook is free to roam what I'm going to do I'm definitely better like I'm much better um I'm much better because I have very good control of the position right now clearly white is trying to play F3 right now that the Knight left the center it's important in chess to have this concept in your head called continuity that Knight used to control E5 it no longer does which means I can go for my own Journey right I didn't want to go out here and try to come back and try to attack the queen side because this Knight could plop into the E5 Square huh so do I take with the pawn do I take with the Rook do I take with this Pawn to open up the Bishops which will you know trade oh they all look good but you know I I I think Rook takes or D takes is what I think I think Rook takes because you keep applying pressure and you don't open the position D takes cuz Connect Four is nice but also you don't trade pieces the side that wants to attack wants to keep more pieces on the board right I'm not asking I'm I'm I'm telling right like I mean rookie four looks nice but then the Knight could re-enter the battle and do we care about the fact that the Knight can reenter the the battle like are we worried that the Rook can get kicked out of the center of the board I'm going to take like this I think I think this move rejoining my pawns together creating this wall not allowing the bishop in not allowing the Knight out that looks right to me I think Rook takes probably is the best move like at my level I would be playing Rook takes at 1800 level I I I would be okay with this and some of you may be wondering like isn't that Bishop really scary no I would not evaluate things like that I would not evaluate things like the bishop is very scary no you know who's scary my queen and my Bishop like who's going to defend the white position from my pieces right who's going to defend the white position this bishop is is not participating in the game neither is the White Knight I'm the one that's about to call the shots may maybe I should bring my Rook up and over if B3 I might have Queen A3 in the future I don't want to trade Queens by the way never ever ever trading Queens in this position Queen A6 right that's Queen D5 then B3 then maybe I you know maybe I don't have anything there maybe Knight C4 first Maybe Queen A6 first I don't know what's the best move I'm going to go here right cuz I'm I'm already looking at all sorts of different ideas on on on that square now white will probably play B3 and then do I have a sacrifice I don't I don't think so unfortunately I don't think I have a sacrifice I probably need a little bit of help from one of my other pieces if my opponent defends this the right way they they probably should be all right you know I probably should have went Knight C4 first oh they are not respecting my my position here though I mean F3 is a logical move but even if I take and then that just opens up the E file for me now Knight C4 Pawn takes I don't have a queen sacrifice but I do have a fork and then I have Queen A2 and that's just winning I mean that's just yeah Knight C4 this is a I'm dominating I should have went Knight C4 first because it prevented B3 because I would have had a fork very instructive instead of here which allowed the spike to come out I should have went Knight C4 first it's about preventing moves so right now we are setting up a threat that will win the game we're setting up Knight E3 which attacks the queen and attacks this they can't play B3 because I forked the king and the queen but something has to like somebody has to prevent this move so Queen C1 then maybe I just play E3 and plop the knight in right oh that's yeah it's brutal it's a really brutal attack now so that's a fork by the way I mean this is that's a fork I can be patient for a move and play like Queen B5 just just being a menace um but sometimes it's better to just yeah let's just keep it simple I mean it's a fork right like we know we're winning a a rook guaranteed so let's just do it right like we we're getting rewarded for our attack so we're getting in we're going to pick up the rook and then again I would not allow white to take us because it's going to break apart our structure if anything I'm taking or I'm keeping the tension by defending this Pawn so I want to take back here when white takes but not to open my position instead maybe with my Bishop so looking at Bishop D5 I'm looking at Bishop C4 um king would be nice on B8 like if I could just adjust my king to the B8 Square I think I would be very happy um that would be uh that would be great but no I yeah this is very tough for white because um not only are you going to lose material like the attack doesn't stop like my queen is still going to go in on the light squares if I really want I so you you you sacrifice the material to get my knight off the board to kind of relieve the attack temporarily but the attack's not going anywhere and um I'm going to play I'm going to keep it very simple keep it very simple now the option is go in for the Checkmate which probably doesn't work right away um or just build the pressure here uh of course I can take right like I I've talked about it but it's it's this question of do I want to help Act activate my opponent's pieces um I don't know not really like I don't really want to help activate my opponent's night you know what I mean I don't want my opponent's KN in the game so but I do have to play faster I'm not playing fast enough and that's not that's not I'm not being a good role model so let's go for checkmate if takes my backup plan is just to take and then we trade Bishops and as I've said a million times one of the ways to win a winning position is just to trade the pieces like trade the Bishops go to an end game but save yourself enough time that you're not going to blunder okay it's a logical decision um I guess we can trade the Queens I mean this has got to be the best move because you're threatening a bunch of stuff but now I have Queen D1 and this was probably overlooked and this is sort of the problem when you have such passive pieces oh I have a beautiful tactic no I don't Bishop A2 check deflecting the king but there's King up and then if check there's King to the corner so we're just going to dance around but nothing's actually going to happen uh Queen E2 does threaten mate by the way that's a very sneaky Checkmate threat my opponent might go oh nothing's hanging I can take and blunder that that would be really sweet if they took and blundered queen A2 mate uh if they move the Knight I'm going to take the pawn or that pawn and yeah White's position is just disintegrating just disintegrating so um I called it yeah I called it I called it I called it I called it let's uh let's take a quick look at that game that was that was very aggressive that was my opponent playing uh the D4 Dynamite against me it's kind of tough when you play it against me you know um that's uh that's going to be difficult this is a very aggressive Gambit early and again in general if your if your opponent is gambiing all sorts of Pawns against you in the beginning of the game I would say don't open yourself up like it's not the best move sometimes according to the computer to play solid but trust me your king is going to really appreciate it in the long run um this was the Dutch Gotham Dutch of course is clashing uh you already I already told the code to you I'm not going to tell you again and I just developed and offered an exchange and this was an instructive moment this reconsideration lost white all hope in this game it was equal retreating was slightly worse for white but wasting a whole move on that look what happened by the time we castled it's minus 1.3 and it's minus 1.3 because the bishop is stuck the Knight is stuck and that Knight is stuck and I get it look whenever I do this uh series you know if my opponent was playing another 1700 and wasn't playing me nerves would be different quality of moves would be different but I'm just trying to kind of get y'all to understand like if you play aggressively in the beginning of the game you can't just start trading the pieces and wasting time this concept of backing up and then changing your mind you could do that in real life but you just gave me a whole move right now it's White's move and like I said if my opponent had just done that it would have been White's move like this so white lost an entire Tempo and that's what gave them the bad position and then I thought I played in an instructive way planting my knight in the center putting my Rook on the center line and now yeah the best move here for black is to understand that rushing out this way while the Knight can take the center is bad but the second that my opponent backed up I was coming in like this and now let's just check something so this is the best move I played the best move in the game which is minus one keeping my pawns together restricting the enemy knight uh Rook takes C4 is the second best move but the reason why this is not the best move is it still allows white activity it allows White's pieces to have targets whereas the way I played it in the game I created this situation where the Knight is just stuck the bishop is stuck and uh then we just yeah Queen A6 was a mistake it was much better to play Knight C4 to prevent B3 instructive I played it I played too fast and that was definitely the wrong decision ultimately so uh Queen A6 was minus one point uh minus point8 but this was actually a much stronger move but uh this is a totally winning position and we we just swarmed in We we played the simple move which is just to pick up the Rook it's not even the best move move by the way the best move in this position is Bishop D5 just dominance I mean it's just it's just not letting white move so uh instructive but that's uh that's how it goes and that was you know that was my opponent playing a very very aggressive line against me nice game to my opponent listen I appreciate anybody that comes in to try to take my head off um playing somebody from the UK this game going to play E4 and we are going to see we're going to see what they play E4 E5 okay um proud owners of my E4 course the oldest course that I have know that I'm a big fan of the Vienna but of course we can we can play anything under the sun let us in fact go for a Vienna uh we're going to see which which Vienna my opponent goes for do they allow the Gambit do they play Knight C6 uh they do allow the Gambit okay so I will play the Gambit you don't have to play the Gambit I mean you can play the Gambit sometimes you can play something else other time so we're going into a uh into a Vienna Gambit now here's the here's the drawback of of the Vienna Gambit as you go up the rating ladder it's very forcing so if you're playing a 2000 um and they know what they're doing they have prepared right they know what they're doing uh and this is this is all part of the course um they're going to get an okay position it's just going to be equal right so if my opponent plays Knight C6 or F5 they are very well prepared those are the best moves uh Knight takes C3 is what people play when they get into this position okay Knight C6 is normal now we play Bish to B5 and the best line here for black is to trade this Knight give a check and unfortunately my opponent is doing just that um so I can play this Pawn taking on C3 here this is uh this is what we do normally we take like this but now in this particular variation we want to open up our dark squ bishop and uh the best Line is now to give a check and to trade like I said if a person is well prepared and they go for this end game you just got to play chess if you're 2,000 you just got to play chess the way you get better at chess is you say you know what I don't always want to play the Vienna Gambit I can play G3 which is another type of Vienna right I can play Four Knights that's not the best move but it is a move for sure uh it's not the best move because well I know that Queen H4 is the best move so I'm going to take because I don't really know why else my Bishop is out there and now we're going to think right so knowing what we know about Queen H4 I'm thinking that we can develop our Knight quickly and Castle I'm also thinking maybe we put the bishop on F4 to then block that check with a pawn the only reason I would not play this move is because it would weaken my B file but maybe that doesn't matter maybe that doesn't matter at all now I also think black might want to go there which is why I like Bishop E3 but Bishop E3 does not stop the idea of Queen H4 so there's a lot on my mind there's a lot on my mind and and unfortunately in a rapid game you you can't solve chess I can't solve chess period but uh especially in a rapid game so uh let's I'm probably not going to make the best move I mean that's just that's just the reality of life so let's play Knight E2 and let's try to Castle going Castle use our open f file this Pawn could be an asset for us could be a liability could be a liability the reason why I say asset restricts Black's pieces right asset it could be very well protected so now if black does not play energetically in the Vienna black will get a losing position so if black plays Bishop B7 and Castle very slow we're going to get a really good position we're going to Castle Queen here Target the king black has to play energetically against the Vienna that's just the way the one of the major benefits of the Vienna is that if black plays simple solid chess it's actually going to backfire and you'll notice in today's video frequently I'm like I'm just going to play the solid move move you know I'm just going to Castle can't do that against the Vienna so they do play Queen H4 now this is the natural move this was my other idea to stop Queen E4 and I kind of like it like I don't see anything wrong with this I mean I I do kind of want to get the queen out of my territory but what's wrong with just Knight G3 like to prevent Queen e Queen E4 they might go Queen G4 and then like I said said you just got to play yeah okay there there's Queen G4 um we don't have to take that's number one um if we do take we can kick the bishop out it'll probably go to E6 we can avoid a queen trade completely question is is that dumb and I'm saying there because I want to prevent Bishop C5 very like it's a point that I'm not not playing Queen D3 playing Queen F2 really do want to keep Queens on the board I mean it's very much my style then maybe something like Bishop here will happen castle castle and I can show you maybe how to do that attack but Queen F2 and this queen is so active like do we do we want that do we want to live with that burden and also the queen could go there and stop us from casting it's a a lot of potential unpleasantries that can happen if we don't trade Queens got to think about it I'm not convinced that not trading the Queens is the right move it very well could be but I kind of want to do it on my terms let's back up let's see if my opponent spots this move preventing me from castling just like I did to my second round opponent this is a very natural move this is not Queen C4 is very mean because it also I can't go B3 because I lose this Pawn okay that's not a good move because Queen's a bit offside now and I have Moves Like H first I got a castle definitely I don't want to I don't want to risk that again and Bishop B7 is probably going to be played with some you know nefarious ideas over there um Queen C4 is possible but it it definitely lost a little bit of its sting I kind of want to kick the queen out I also kind of want to play Knight F5 and I also kind of want to just speed up uh Queen E3 might trap the queen in some lines no because there's this let's kick out the queen queen H4 is annoying but not dangerous just annoying but not dangerous my throat is scratchy Queen G6 also probably a good move somehow I miss queen G6 and now Bishop H4 could be on the way yeah we might we might need to play a move like Knight to F5 and just sort of play an end game which it's unfortunate but when you're 2,000 sometimes there's nothing better like wait you know playing moves like Bishop F4 is fine but what's next is the major question I can't tell you what's next so I'm going to play Knight F5 and um I'm targeting the bishop and um it's going to be an end game it's going to be an end game and we're going to see who has who has a better position I think the best option for black is something like to trade once and leave my queen alone I don't think trading a second time is great but it could be and I I really desperately want my Bishop on this Square to at least defend my Center PA but it's just equal I mean it's just and this is sort of like if you can't blow an opponent off the board in the Vienna you you got to and it's just chess I mean a 2,000 rated player I'm playing I can't just win in 10 moves okay they trade with the queen which is mildly more forcing but nothing really changes uh King D7 doesn't quite work okay F6 is a normal move uh but I'm really curious if I can go east six I can't cuz I feel like my Pawn will perish but you know what I am kind of relieved I have to tell you uh I'm a little bit relieved that I no longer have to deal with that weakness maybe we play Bishop D2 and B3 I also like Bishop F4 I like Bishop D2 and B3 I mean it's strikes me as very very very natural I could also trade the bishop maybe who has has a better Bishop what a question who has a better Bishop wow maybe we just we we try to play a rook end game let's do it let's try to play a rook end game this is an interesting move black might Castle defending the pawn very interesting and then it's going to come down to who has the better structure and I would argue it's white but it's probably about equal so if Bishop takes I will take with the Rook black can Castle it's probably the best yeah it's probably the best castling now G6 I don't think is great because I feel like the king is going to get stuck in the center somehow I'm going to like maybe zigzag oh this is a nasty looking move to just damage the structure that looks really nasty it's a very instructive move potentially and my opponent is gonna have tripled isolated pawns now the one thing they can do is play Rook B8 they've got to create counterplay and I'm going to try to eat all the pawns so here I'm going to go Rook C I might not even go Rook C5 because these pawns are not going anywhere I might like give a check first deflect the king make it go one way maybe give this maybe give a check on E5 and then a check on D1 and shove the king into C8 maybe that's that doesn't look good to me I mean again I'm looking at Rook E5 forcing the king to the defile and then Rook D1 King D6 Rook e 4 C5 C3 that looks pretty convincing to me like Rook D1 is fine but there might be long Castle so deflecting the king forcing the king to make a decision to walk in to the other Rook when you have the advance of of of striking first in an end game it's very like C5 Cuts all the communication of the black position here but Rook D1 is also very strong the king is going to come try to help but I'm too quick to this Pawn that's the problem I also have other ideas like maybe you know when the pawn comes here I can deflect off the B Pawn but the simplest way is just to go C3 and I'm winning that pawn and black still has all the problems of the other things in this end game and listen at this level end games are so important which is why I made the end gamees master class but right now winning that Tempo on my rook and playing defense is imperative now do I have there something a little more emphatic there like King D6 can I go back to the back Rank and play C3 and Rook E8 maybe maybe take and take on D4 I don't know I don't know this is definitely the best move and then the question is where do I move I kind of want to go there oh that that very well could be the best move just to yeah just to have this threat I got to play a little faster so I'm going to do it that looks menacing just not allowing black to move that rook and now I go here and I'm I think what my opponent has to do is get this Rook into the game but it's too slow it's too slow I'm taking everything I'm too fast Rook B8 might still be the best move but then I take with check oh but maybe I don't cuz King E5 so maybe I play B3 I just wait I just keep my structure intact that you don't want to play you don't want to make moves that are so passive because I can be patient you see my position is so strong I can just wait I don't have to scrap my Rook getting trapped it's not I can take I'm going to take King B6 that just take the pawn that would be a big blunder now they're going to capture and now I'm a pawn up now I'm a pawn up with all the benefits of the position Black's only option is to get in with the Rook I got to be precise I got to be precise I still got to attack I got to hunt a rook trade now was good for me just one though preferably if you're trying to win a rook end game I mean in this case I could trade all the Rooks but and now okay they're cutting off my king could play B4 this still looks very controlled I look very controlled here looking at A4 looking at B5 looking at Rook C5 by the way Rook C5 again forcing the king to the corner been doing that all game I wouldn't go here because there's no infiltration Black's game plan there was to cut my king off but that's not the game plan the game plan should be get in it shouldn't be cut my king off I don't want my king I'm very powerful without my king Black's game plan should be create counterplay and the longer you wait the worst it's going to get cuz I'm going to go Rook C5 right okay I guess they're trying to double but it's it's too slow it's too slow the strategy is too slow because I'm I'm going to get Rook C5 I'm going to get B5 I'm going to slowly make progress like my king is is always safe on H2 from Rooks it's it's never in danger right okay that that move makes definitely makes sense now do can I it all looks so good C5 B5 just to shove it all backwards I mean this looks that might have been bad actually that might have been silly yeah cuz of that move and now I might need to I can't really go B5 cuz King here that's the problem that that's the problem but I got to I got to pretend it was all part of the plan so let's play Rook C4 I mean this is all still frozen over here it's all still frozen and I'm trying to go B5 I also have Rook A6 like I could have tried to this was wrong because I totally blanked that the king could just go right back to where it was I'm still better but I really should be a little bit more precise than that but uh can I run to the back rank yeah Rook C1 and we're still hammering away like if you get a little arrogant here I'm going to punish you very quickly and okay B5 I can I can still play right B5 Pawn takes Pawn takes that's B5 looks very good actually yeah and and once I use my majority of Pawns here don't pre-move cuz they could go here if you pre moove here here and they take you're going to lose your rug you're going to throw your computer out of window um this was once you get a pawn majority of three on two like this what's going to happen is you're going to get them to become full passers so if black doesn't take if Black Goes Rook A7 I'm going B6 and and and that oh am I going B6 my Rook might get trapped oh my goodness that is actually insane I Rook my might get trapped wow I've never seen anything like that if I play B6 my Rook could get locked away that is crazy I have never seen something like that if Rook goes here well the way they're doing it I I mean I can probably take on A6 and play Rook B1 Rook B6 something like that but yeah wow that is actually I've never seen something like that my Rook I can trade The Rook of course but then my opponent will be pretty quick with their counterplay too I might just need to start bringing my king it might be unstoppable Force meets immovable object here that is crazy wow King G3 maybe just bring my king I'm going to play H5 I mean I can play h four I mean this is CRA I've never seen something like this Rook end games are so wild Pawn takes C6 King C6 and then I just try to dance in with my Rook somehow this might be the way and I try to dance in with my Rook try to get Rook B1 or Rook E1 Maybe or Rook D1 fascinating this is this is so wild I've never seen an end game like this one Rook E1 Rook F5 Rook E6 check nuts all right Rook e one I'm going for it I just have to make sure my Rook is safe and then maybe Rook F6 and I and I go to B1 I just try to save my Rook like that H4 is possible but I'm going up I mean I'm going to I'm going to try to take as many pawns as I can I don't want to get my king locked away this is a wild end game when you're down to this low in a rapid game play fast but it's instructive the way my opponent has defended this probably have a check right check and am I winning this Pawn could also win these pawns hello I don't I don't have to just speaking of which Speaking of which those pawns look mighty tasty right now and I'm still going back for this one now King C4 is a very very very tricky move here to try to trap my Rook but it doesn't work because my Rooks will team up on the fifth rank I've been I've been looking for ways to kick the door open for that Rook that was there oh man and I and my opponent did get a bit low on time here uh you see they played it but luckily I have this not lucky I mean you know it's part of the game and now I'm getting out and uh my Rooks defend each other and I'm I'm going to win enough pawns that I'm I'm going to feel comfortable now yeah but now yeah now I just this is winning and this is easy two pawns up and uh yeah what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut my opponent's king off yeah now they're off on the last rank of the board this is a total winning endgame H4 H5 and just don't blunder a rook don't blunder anything preferably that was actually very silly now that's mate that was a very good game of chess by black and it is difficult to be a 2000 I mean I'm telling you right now 2000s are good chess players uh and my opponent was well prepared in the Vienna they got themselves to an equal position and they played very well I mean black was equal for the entirety of the opening um I played like this and we got you know this end game positions 0.10.1 either way uh I personally think here trading my weakness was not a good decision I think black should have tried to get pressure on it like rook f8 and then King D7 and then King on E6 when you traded the weakness and I was able to trade into this end game white is going to be better here because structurally black is struggling black has a um black has a weak structure but black played really really well and I mean look at the 2000 level you've got to find a move like this sacrificing a a pawn in an end game to split the position tripled isolated Pawns in any end game even if temporarily down a pawn can never ever be good ever they just can't be good right and um yeah that uh that's that's where the move C4 came in handy and I thought this was instructive um the best move in this position being Rook E5 check which is funny because game review calls it an inaccuracy and yet the analysis here that I'm looking at sometimes that happens game review calls it an inaccuracy this is 77 and this is 81 so they're basically the same game review sometimes make you makes you feel dumb um I thought everything that I did here was smart getting to this end game I went forward with my pawns and this was a bad move um what I should have done is I should have hunted from the side should have went Rook E4 trying to go Rook E6 if Rook F6 uh then I should have saved the rook and played A5 it's instructive I mean it's instructive I should have gotten both my Rooks out to make them participate this move gets a fat question mark because all of a sudden my Rook is trapped and I'm still I'm still better but it's a headache actually rescuing my rook and here I was really scared of things like uh let's see the position locks up how do I win like how do I rescue my Rook what's what's crazy is that if I play something like Rook D1 after King C4 I have look at this look at this my Rook is trapped I'm straight up losing it's ridiculous um I can save my Rook by like creating tactics on this file but um yeah I should have um I should have been better there I definitely should have been better um in this position you know my opponent could have defended a little bit more resiliently but but I'm always going to have pressure against a bad structure like this um I'm going to try to play Rook E1 and hope my opponent takes and then I'll play like Rook E2 and Rook C5 and it it's just going to be an annoying end game to defend is black going to be fine in the long run yeah of course and I mean stockfish will hold this end game a million times out of a million but that's chess like you you play openings in chess you play certain openings that get you to a more pleasant and comfortable position and um Queen H4 check is uh the best move but there's nothing wrong with A6 and then here I thought I played fine computer likes Queen F2 right away which is actually quite nice stopping Bishop C5 and queen H4 it's a nice move and Knight F3 I'll add that to my toolbox for for the future but it was very good game very very good game and uh we will end with an even tougher matchup of 2300 so this person uh might has a chat GPT icon and um is named I am pasta or although I think I think that's an L now what do I play against E4 um I know a lot of openings I mean I could play the Caro Concourse I could play a lot of different things I haven't played E5 in a while so opponent plays Knight F3 what are they going to play which okay they play this one of my sleeper best courses is called the black gambits and in the black gambits course against the Spanish I recommend F5 which is the yanish or the schan and personally I I really love this opening I I think you get some really really fun positions it's actually a Vienna Gambit reversed you may realize I just had a game where I Gambit my F Pawn uh and here the the line that to me is the easiest to play is just to take Knight F6 and develop the bishop um I don't think there I mean you can play Knight F6 and you can sort of wait I like to just take play Knight F6 my opponent is castling because they are trying to not allow me to to hit this Knight I have I haven't played this in a while so this could backfire but um hopefully not I think the line is just Bishop C5 although it could be D6 it could be to be a little bit more solid but I think it's just Bishop C5 and then D6 taking this is a bit dangerous I think um meaning taking that and then taking this so Knight G5 is a thing but I somehow am not afraid of it like Knight G5 just Queen E7 I don't okay Knight F7 I play Rook f8 they could give me a check just play King d8 like this is scary so I would not play the Black gambits for the faint of heart and I don't want to rush with H6 because that would weaken some of my other light squares so but if they don't play Knight G5 I'm probably going to go Bishop G4 I'll trade the Knight they won't have any of that H3 okay yeah that stops what I want annoying now Queen E7 and Bishop E6 still looks very natural if I play H6 how bad is it on Knight H4 Ian I I really don't want to allow like I don't know why I would allow that so let me go Queen E7 I'm expecting Knight G5 if they don't play Knight G5 and they instead play Knight C3 uh maybe I could have went for Knight A5 by the way I'm not sure Knight A5 to try to get the bishop that also would have been seemingly smart I don't know how smart but so Bishop B6 Knight D5 I can take with the bishop they could take with a bishop they could also take with a pawn then I would bring my knight back wrap around this just strikes me as the best move just getting rid of this really powerful Bishop they could take drop a knight in then I'm going to Castle along they could take attack my Queen yeah they just do that now Queen F7 is losing to Knight G5 don't don't don't hang that Knight takes is losing um Queen D7 is an interesting move but I don't know why I would do that like I think my plan was just pretty straightforward just to take with the bishop Pawn takes blocks the bishop Bishop takes doesn't really threaten anything I'll take or not I don't even have to take I could probably still Castle very complicated position I think Pawn takes is probably best if I had to guess attack my knight make me move probably make me go back put my knight on F7 play some defense but Bishop takes is annoying too I mean it's I'm not out of the woods I'm not out of the woods you know mhm my original intention was just to take um just to take and then put my knight back on d8 or Knight D4 Knight takes I mean if the queen comes in I that's not scary so the real question is is it scary if the pawn comes in and the answer is I have no idea uh but I don't think so so I'm going to take the bishop yeah the queen coming in is not scary because I can trade the queen that was my big idea I also can play H6 now but H6 could be slow trading the queen and playing an end game could be fine but I can play H6 and then it's just a matter of like am I really under attack this might be a bit too bold but I kind of want to go for it because I don't see what my opponent's going to do to me like I can't play H6 okay they just play C3 I mean playing really fast right as always B4 is a thing but do I I just have A5 like obviously they're trying to go before B5 can I just play A5 myself I don't know why I wouldn't I mean A5 looks right stop what your opponent wants they want B4 I don't let them play B4 if they play A3 I play A4 and then they'll never play B4 because I have on pant which is important to remember so A5 kind of removes the possibility of long castle if the Queen stay on because you should understand if you push pawns where you're going to Castle it's going to be dangerous but if we trade if we had no queens I could Castle anywhere I want I could leave my king in the center like I'm not getting mated if uh if no queens are on the board it's a very instructive game actually I think I've neutralized my opponent's Center very well now I don't know what their plan is Bishop E3 is a very interesting move damaging their own structure but opening up The Rook yeah but my plan was A4 and I am not sure you are bouncing back from that what is the follow-up to this move move is the idea to bait me so I really can't Castle cuz this looks really restricting for white this looks really annoying not not being able to really easily play B4 there even if they do play B4 now I was going to say I could play Bishop B6 and leave this here but like of course I will take on pant and I'll split your pawns okay they do play this move they do play this move by the way now I can justify my a a file expansion um I guess the plan there was to not let me get an easy life yeah the the the the whole expansion there [Music] um this plan is strong yeah made me create a weakness and now not letting me easily develop but you know what I could just leave my king in the center I'm going to take because I think I have an advantage in the end game now and I'm going to play Rook f8 and try to play for Queen F7 or do I play Rook A5 first queen B5 is a annoying thing really don't want to go Rook A7 Rook here can I trap the queen if Queen B5 Rook A5 and then I have King D7 is that crazy talk whoa if the queen gets in here I might be trapping the queen oh I'm getting I'm getting really big ideas and that's generally that's really that's really dangerous to give me really big Ideas oh man let's play Rook f8 I'm kind of setting a trap but I could be miscalculating that's always a Poss possibility Queen here Rook A5 Queen here and the queen gets trapped could that be a reality king [Music] D7 Rook goes like the idea is Rook to B8 trapping the queen and the queen can't get out it doesn't have maybe white has to play B4 I would still play Rook B8 oh is my opponent's username impasta that's hilarious but this is a very annoying move the other thing is I don't have to play Rook A5 I could play Rook A7 and that defends everything and then I would you know maybe walk my king over but this is a huge commitment for what whoa uhoh I can't take that because there's an incoming check and then I'm going to to get bulldozed that's a problem that move is a problem I did not see that move I didn't see that move at all okay now we have to adapt to the situation in front of us and it is not a pretty situation I mean my my my first idea is to still play Rook A5 just I I have to seize some control back of the game Rook f8 Queen f8 there's Queen E6 I would play Queen E7 Queen G8 Queen f8 I mean we might make a draw I really don't want to make a draw uh but I don't think I have a choice I mean the alternative is King D7 King D7 Rook f8 I have to be careful of the fork Rook F1 no no no it's just all bad it's all bad it's all bad I mean I can long castle that's basically the only thing I can do take rook and I still can't play Rook f8 yeah I might have to play Rook A5 and we might I mean I'm but I'm it's still a terrible position I mean oh my goodness Knight d8 Rook F1 Queen D7 wow that's crazy all right I'm going for it this way and I think I'm just going to have to Castle the queen side like I'm just going to have to Chuck some material like I probably going to lose that pawn and I have two and a half minutes wow Knight is hanging at least that's and even though I'm going to lose my Pawn on A4 I think in the long run probably these things are pretty weak so that's the only thing that I have going for me Knight F5 I'm going to put my queen on G5 and try to go for G6 and I'm sort of hoping that like yes now I but like even H4 is a good move that everything somehow is just working in White's favor here H4 Queen G4 Queen E6 King B8 but like it looks horrible and I'm down three minutes I mean this is H that first game was was tough against the uh there's even like Rook F3 here yeah Rook F3 I mean if my opponent finds all the best moves I'm going to lose what can what can I say oh boy wait I think they should go here first I only calculated Rook G3 Queen F6 but check here Rook G3 like I said if my opponent finds all the best moves they're going to win the game what can I say oh man I am getting outclassed I'm going to I just have to go for those pawns this is all I can do now all I can do I'm G to have to Chuck the whole side of the board and pick up these two pawns and um I don't know what's happening I might still be okay but it's going to become a race oh boy I wish chat GPT would just start playing and just start like losing all of its pieces this is uh this might become a master class and how to defend a worst position against the talented young player don't hang your rook and now it's just the race I want to say I'm losing the race I just somehow feel like this but I have no idea if I'm being completely honest okay I have to take the more impactful full Pawn then I guess I'll take the next Pawn too I mean I might as well I don't think I have anything better right like running the queen back to help is sort of pointless taking all the pawns is probably the way to go if Queen F7 to try to trade my Rook I have no idea if I want The Rook trade or not like should I run away if my opponent plays Queen F7 and tries to mate me do I do anything about I don't know I I'm completely out of my element but at least I have this Pawn which has survived the game so I don't know oh my my goodness I mean maybe Knight E7 feels like Knight E7 is wrong I think this Knight is stronger than my knight but we we're GNA find out we are G to find out that's that's chess right there we are going to find out who's right okay they do play knight7 I don't know it it seems stupid to allow the Knight to go to D5 I don't have a lot of time so I'm going to take and now I shouldn't hang my Rook I'm going to put it near my king and then we're going to just have a race 1 two 3 four five except maybe there will be Rook here and maybe instead of taking the pawn I play Queen B3 so Rook G8 is not a thing H4 Queen B3 H5 A3 H6 A2 H7 A1 yeah I'm going to try to stop Rook G8 by putting my queen on B3 and promoting my own Pawn I'm not going to take the pawn does that do he but it was never my idea to take the pawn my opponent wanted me not to take the pawn what's going are they just panicking what is happening I think I'm just back in the driver's seat all of a sudden uhoh my opponent just whoa Queen trade what about Queen B2 or queen B1 Queen B1 looks pretty good does The Rook trade work threatening this Pawn now and I'm threatening A2 Rook F2 I can start taking other pawns this is crazy I have no clue what's happening I don't know if I'm winning or losing now I think I might be winning because I'm getting a lot of Pawns with attacks they're trying to still mate me which is not very nice but I guess I get it I was trying to M them too oh man uh Queen C this is stressful they're trying to play Queen A3 C6 I'm making a run for it making a run for it check King D7 do I trade the Queens do I trade the queens and leave my opponent with the pass Pawn is that what I do I don't think so I think I just Tred to make a cocoon here for my king I have no idea still the pawn down should have played faster earlier just got to look for checks I mean if if I don't see a check I just got to go and I'm still trying to win the game myself like I'm looking for a mate Maybe let's try to open up that King I'll go right back I won't repeat I'll go right back maybe E3 get a little advancement going oh it's so tough to decide what to do here let's just go E3 I mean let's I got to advance I'm two squares away from queening right I gotta I got to go for it King D7 Rook B2 Rook C7 probably this is like really ugly I'm really unhappy I have to play this move it's probably not the best move no that's bad this is probably all bad but my Rook is defended which is at least a good thing my Rook is defended and my king might just have to go for a run he might just have to be brave oh this is very big that I'm getting my my my pawn my pawns together like this very very big king here Rook D7 I'm slowly getting out slowly getting out this is very big for me now and I'm always looking at this check and this advancement no checks no checks oh my gosh that is terrifying oh I hung my Rook I hung my Rook I got low on time yeah my opponent's going to win oh they're going to win unless no King H one they win yep well done yep panicked got too low on time well done I always make these Games unrated and uh they should probably be rated games my opponent deserved to uh to get that one uh I hope I lost to a child because if I just lost to an adult I mean congrats very impressive um I definitely made a comeback here and I was uh I was playing for a win but I just didn't leave myself enough time oh it was good yeah and then this was a really nice idea by my opponent right at the end to go for uh to go for this attack and wow that is wow D3 was the move so what should I have played instead ah I should have went Rook d8 I should have went nope not Rook d8 I should should have went here allow a check oh and then block yep yep yep yep you know one thing that's actually interesting from myself is when my opponent played Knight H4 oh it was a brilliant move Knight H4 was the only move to get an advantage huh yeah I mean it's just equal otherwise and what's what's instructive is I should have went G5 had I just played G5 this night is going nowhere if I play G5 I probably go on to win the game just because the Knight doesn't get any activity but this wasn't this was yeah that's brutal that was and then I spent wait I mean two minutes trying not to like lose right away that's tough and uh I played the best way I defended my king and yeah then I ran head first into that and then I mean this is just utter chaos and black is winning here this is but I was so pessimistic wow it's just winning like this position is winning for black but I was just so slow I just this whole time I was I was so negative about my chances like I didn't even take the pawn on C3 for some reason why didn't I take the pawn on C3 yeah just weird weird weird I just did a bad job and um my opponent did a good job I mean they just created counterplay and yeah how to win at chess except sometimes we lose to talented young players so yeah I have to uh I have to stop playing talented Junior players in how to win a chess I just have to beat up adults but it's how to win a chess because at some point someone's some somebody's going to win so um let's put it this way the black gambits got us a very comfortable position and we were doing actually quite decently in the opening but sadly we ran into a very very good opponent and that's what happens the previous game uh the same exact thing happened but we managed to outplay we had that endgame uh this one was uh next episode the entire all the games will be played by I am pasta or imp pasta that's all I have for you for episode 28 wow our first defeat in quite a long time I don't remember the last time that I lost um maybe this uh puts you off and you will literally uh never try an opening course again but I will remind you uh Cod spring 33% off and um can't really blame the opening for the loss got to blame the player in this case I'll see you for episode 29 get out of here
