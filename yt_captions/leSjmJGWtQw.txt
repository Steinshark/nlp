[Music] if you're a software engineer you're probably pretty worried about everything happening around Ai and large language models here's what one of you wrote below my recent video about GPT engineer and there were more comments basically saying well we're all going to be replaced within a couple of years so today I want to cover seven things you can do as a software engineer to help you not only survive this Avalanche of AI tools but maybe even thrive in it and at the same time I'd like to address some of the comments you've made and share some of my own thoughts now nobody knows of course exactly what's going to happen I'm not going to talk about long-term Singularity stuff though that's really fascinating I'll focus on the coming years and what I think will make the most sense for us in the short term you might say hey just another YouTuber trying to push us off the cliff even faster and maybe I am naive for not advocating now for a complete stop on all AI development but the truth is I believe we're way past that point already and I think our only option is to make sure all of these new development are actually channeled into something that helps humanity and I'm convinced that the way to do it is to approach all of these new developments with a positive and optimistic mindset instead of trying to fight it and that's also my first point AI machine learning of course these are very powerful tools we've seen the possibilities over the past months and instead of fighting these tools I think we should embrace them learn about them and try to use them make them part of our workflow this can mean using AI tools as part of your development workflow things like GitHub copilot that's gonna help you work faster but it can also mean integrating AI more directly in the software that you actually write Json made a good point in that he thinks this will replace developers in the same way that standard libraries replace developers it's just going to make our lives easier and it's going to make it easier to create more better higher quality software this is in the same line of thinking as what Tanner is saying and that the ones who leverage all of this new technologies are the ones that are not going to be left behind I totally agree with this we don't want to be ludites and ignore everything that's happening around us because in the end these are tools that are there to serve us to help us so we should use them to do what we do in a better way and in particular I think these tools are now really helpful in creating quickly boilerplate code getting set up quickly and then you do the more engaging creative things with the code that was generated now in order to know what kind of boilerplate setup you need you have to think through the overall design first and I've written a guide to help you do that it's totally free you can get it by going to ion.gold design guide covers everything you need to know to design a new piece of software from scratch hopefully it will help you avoid some of the mistakes that I made in the past Ironwood called slash design guide the link is also in description of this video the second point I want to make is that you can use AI to learn way more quickly so tech industry is of course always evolving so it's really important that we stay updated on happening and this includes understanding capabilities but also limitations of large language models how they can be used ethical practical considerations that surround them I find AI incredibly useful in collecting filtering organizing information for me and I use it a lot in that way by learning faster you'll also be more ready for what's going to change in the job market for example jtn comments that he expects that there will be a slump in junior death hiring but as technology becomes more ubiquitous companies are going to redefine what that job actually means and then code interviews might not be so much about specific coding tricks but more about architectural considerations prawns engineering Etc and if you're able to leverage AI to learn quicker become better quicker then you have much higher chance of Landing a job like that so a third thing you can do is specialize large language models are really good at performing General tasks but they can be the specialized knowledge of an expert yet so you could consider specializing in a particular area of software engineering where you can provide a lot of value that a general purpose AI cannot so this could be a highly specialized areas like cyber security blockchain development or Quantum Computing but of course you could also specialize in creating AI yourself and another thing is that by specializing yourself you're actually putting yourself in a better place of successfully interacting with AIS like personal myths is writing that in order to use AI effectively you're going to need to have basic knowledge and the more knowledgeable you are about a subject the better questions you can ask and the better results you're going to get when you work with AI tools you can also go in the other direction and gain knowledge in other disciplines like business or psychology or one area where AI is not yet very good is understanding subtleties of user experience if you can build skills in ux design and research you're going to be able to create products that will not only function well but also going to create a great experience to the user and overall being interdisciplinary helps you understand broader implications of your work and help you make better informed decisions and that kind of perspective at the moment can be replicated by AI as your Quan rights coding is actually only 10 or 20 percent of an engineer's job you have to interact with the team you're part of a business which has its own processes you may need to interact with customers there's a ton of other things that you might need to do that isn't covered by a coding AI tool what do you think is more important should you specialize and become really good at a particular subject or should you generalize become interdisciplinary and gain a broader perspective let me know in the comments another thing you can do is focus on being Innovative AI is great at optimizing things and Performing routine tasks but it still struggles with Innovation and creative thinking although some of you made the point that AI is going to be better at this than us really soon for example here's a comment writing that there's very little new Solutions in the industry and that AI is going to be able to explore experiment with problem space wider and faster than humans really soon and then it's going to create better Solutions than we can now that might very well be possible I don't know that but I still think that it's a good bet to at least in the short term focus on being able to think outside the box come up with Innovative and Creative Solutions as that matches well with the capabilities of AI today another thing where you can set yourself apart is to become better at understanding security and privacy concerns especially on the business side this is a major concern for example some businesses don't allow their developers to use tools like GitHub gopal because it sends code to GitHub and they don't want that and that makes a lot of sense because currently it's completely unclear what's happening with all that data that we're sending to these proprietary AI models this is also the gist of what not quite him writes in their comments on the other hand what does mystical writes is that columns will move to free or open source models which may be a good solution to all of these security issues in the end though a lot of companies still want to have a real human who's responsible for something so they know who to sue if something goes wrong the final thing that I think is important you should do is to develop soft skills skills like communication leadership empathy and teamwork are still highly valuable and not difficult for AIS to replicate and developing these skills further can set you apart from an AI tool I mean ultimately somebody needs to talk with customers or other stakeholders and part of the value that you bring is by not being a machine and understanding The Human Side of things because in the end businesses serve humans and I don't think that's going to change anytime soon by the way one way to train your soft skills is by joining my free Discord server it's a really nice community that has a lot of knowledgeable people make sure to say hi when you join I always wave back overall my Approach with all of these new new developments is to not try to compete with it but instead find a way to work alongside these Technologies and then use them to enhance your own capabilities your productivity and if you're still watching this means that you're one of the few people who's actually concerned with staying ahead of the game and regardless of what will happen in the long term that's a pretty good place to be if you want to get started building tools and use AI the best way to do that is to watch this video next where I show you exactly how to do that thanks for watching and take care
