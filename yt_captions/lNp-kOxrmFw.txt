we thought 2023 was a big year in Tech but 2024 
is the year that these technologies will literally   change your life 2023 when we look back on the 
impact specifically around AI we can instantly   see that it was warming up to what's to come in 
2024 yes 2023 feels like there were some really   big Tech advancements but it was really setting 
the foundation as to what is going to happen   this year we are going to go through what are 
some of the top technologies that are going to   change your life yes you me everyone's lives this 
year understanding what technologies will have a   huge impact in our life does a few things one it 
keeps us ahead of the curve you know where to put   your focus when it comes to learning new things uh 
reading up or educating yourself on new things and   the other thing as well is it keeps your what is 
it your pulse keeps you having a pul I'm not sure   the saying but it keeps you on the in and ahead 
of what's going on now is more important than   ever to be aware of what technologies are up and 
coming I mean it's moving so quickly that's the   least we can do and we are going to do this all 
in a very short amount of time let's get into it   oh and if you haven't already hit that subscribe 
button leave down in the comments other videos   you want me to make and that's really what 
I make these videos on is what you want to see if you haven't joined takeoff already I link 
down below takeoff it is a place where you can   come learn at your own pace however uh you want 
to spend an hour learning you want to spend a   few minutes a day learning from real industry 
experts these are people who have worked for   years within the tech industry they have faced 
so many challenges that we all face throughout   our careers they also dive into specific roles 
Technologies it's amazing so go join it today   let's get into it all right listen you knew I 
had to include where the future of AI is going   in 2024 mainly because in 2024 we will be unable 
to to escape AI I know some of you i' I've read   comments from some of you saying I don't ever 
want a program using the help of AI I don't want   to learn with AI the reality is though if you 
do not start embracing these Technologies you   will fall behind AI generative AI is now being 
implemented in all almost all businesses almost   all online sectors that if you aren't willing to 
start using some of these tools or exploring with   them I really believe you will fall behind people 
who are using these Technologies to to learn will   learn at a quicker rate quicker pace and also be 
able to build whether it be technically build apps   build websites or so many other things now on the 
flip side with AI do you know what's coming up in   2024 in the United States specifically is the 2024 
election now why do I bring this up well because   even from past elections we've already started 
to see the use of AI to spread disinformation   and now with AI getting scarily good you can't 
even tell tell the difference between a photo   that was generated with AI to a photo that was 
taken by a human this is going to have a huge   impact in play in the 2024 election tons of fake 
news will be spread potentially of course and the   one thing that is key to all this is big Tech 
is really going to have to start putting their   foot down and having regulations in place to 
potentially protect uh this AI space meaning   have something in place where you can see that 
this image is generated by AI different labels   things like that now my one worry with that 
is will it happen quick enough meaning even   if that technology is in place it still takes a 
bit of time for the systems to typically realize   that this is AI generated meaning it can still 
spread a lot of disinformation I don't know I'm   really curious to how this will play out but this 
regardless of of how it plays out is a technology   that will impact our lives in 2024 another piece 
of technology I think will have a huge impact on   our lives in 2024 is actually the metaverse and I 
know some of you are probably like Tiff that is so   2 or 3 years ago what are you even talking about 
but here is why I think this year will be the year   of the metaverse if it's going to happen which I 
think it might have the potential to hear me out   the reason for this is because well Apple's now 
in the game and it seems like whenever Apple gets   in the game with new technologies not saying this 
is new technology but kind of takes an interest   in something they really push it forward with the 
announcement of the Apple Vision Pro back in 2023   we are expected to see it release this coming year 
and I think with the release of that it's going to   be a really big Telltale sign if the metaverse is 
going to become a thing if you will how will it be   used I really Envision as you know remote workers 
I'm a remote worker working from home want to have   a closer or are feeling like they want to have 
a closer connection to their co-workers friends   family I can see it being used in those kind of 
settings you know where it's this virtual kind of   office space for meetings different things like 
that it's still kind of hard for for me to wrap   my head around and maybe we just need to throw up 
our hats for the metaverse and realize it's not a   thing but my prediction is in 2024 if it's going 
to become something it will be this year because   of the backings of Apple behind it another area 
that even if you would have told me a few years   ago would really have an impact on our lives in 
2024 or technology per se is physical convergence   so what exactly do I mean you can see even looking 
back to 2023 our physical and digital worlds are   becoming closer and closer intertwined I mean 
nowadays it is more valuable to have more friends   or that's what we perceive as value I should say 
to have friends online or followers online than   in person we care more about our online image than 
we do about our image in real life which is kind   of a weird feeling and honestly even saying it 
is is kind of depressing when I think about it   I'm trying to be an optimist in this but it will 
continue our physical and digital worlds to become   closer and closer and what I think will happen is 
we will see this emergence of digital twins we've   spoken about digital twins for quite a while in 
theory seen them play out especially in different   Industries uh where digital twins essentially are 
a replica of yourself but in the digital world   we see this kind of happening already even with 
different kind of smart watches or Technologies   for example for those of us who wear our Apple 
watches or smart es and it takes a replica of uh   our health so it knows about our heart health it 
knows about our sleep patterns all of that will   continue to become more advanced that we have 
this ex separate version of ourselves but it's   in digital form and as our digital form or our 
digital self per se has more data about ourselves   especially our you know uh Health patterns our 
sleep patterns all of that stuff it will be able   experts scientists will be able to take take 
that data and then make more informed decisions   on different uh discoveries when it comes to 
Medicine when it comes to really taking the   next step in helping Society that's the positive 
outlook on it anyways another area in Tech that   will have a huge impact on your life this year 
is around data and I know we've been talking   about data for a long time now is data still sexy 
like it used to be well one thing it is for sure   is continuing to be more and more valuable to 
companies Yes you heard that right we thought   it couldn't get any more valuable it can and we've 
seen this over and over again especially I noticed   in 2023 have you ever noticed or maybe this is a 
Canadian and us thing but have you noticed that   everywhere you go now they are starting to collect 
data on you if you input your information you get   to skip the line in airports if you sign up for 
this card you get major savings at grocery stores   this is nothing new but now everywhere you go 
has this put in place why do they put this in   place is it because they really care about you no 
absolutely not they put this in place so they can   gather more information more data about you and in 
turn help their business I believe in 2024 we will   see a lot more of this uh kind of data collection 
almost to the point where we just think it's the   norm now that doesn't mean it's necessarily a 
bad thing but I do think it's something that   will have huge impacts on our lives in 2024 and 
something to really be aware of where are you   giving your data or who are you giving your data 
to and what information what are they doing with   that data these are all questions we really as a 
society need to start asking more of versus just   blindly handing it over to get that discount 
I don't know you all are all technologists you   really know what's going on in the tech world as 
well do you agree with this one do you think data   will have a huge impact on our lives this coming 
year I really believe it's kind of going to be   the Tipping Point all right those are some of 
the top technologies that will impact our lives   in 2024 for good for bad maybe somewhere in the 
middle I think a little bit bit of both at the   end of the day being aware of what's coming 
up and what is trending is so key though to   staying ahead not only in your career but also 
too I believe in your personal life seeing what   trends are coming up and even I hope through this 
video you gained some examples you know with the   US election or with how data is being collected 
that these Technologies impact our everyday lives   and if we are able to educate ourselves on them 
and be more aware of them it's kind of better for   everyone all right make sure to hit that subscribe
