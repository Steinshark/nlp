we will we will take a look at this it is actually hopeless you will never get a job you're looking for you haven't found your passion your computer science degree is worthless there's a chance if you put out a thousand applications per cycle maybe get used to working low-paying jobs getting zero sponses or feedback from your employers on your portfolio SL prospects by the way the longer you go without work experience the lower your chances of finding a job get I don't buy any of this so far meanwhile the job market is becoming more and more inhospitable it is hopeless you are wasting your time all right I'm going to give you a couple things one I'm going to give you a little piece of advice TJ unemployed take coming TJ your take is unemployed too shut up TJ um so one building a pretty react portfolio nobody cares okay if you have a really pretty website and you're like look at what I've made like people aren't they just they just aren't going to Care like you're not that's not how you you win things there you go make something challenging make something amazing make take some time to actually build something that you enjoy and do you know like you sure send out all the applications you want build your nice little pretty portfolio site okay just have it so nice with its blues and it's oranges and and whatever other colors you throw in there but at the end of the day you still can't just simply that's just that's just not going to make you stand out in any sort of way the only way you can really stand out is actually doing something you enjoy right doing something that gets you excited doing something that makes you see it through to the end right and if you find yourself always asking but okay then what should I build it's just like that is the fundamental problem right there you're uninterested you've only ever looked at things as just appear means to an end you never took a moment to just look around for a second and go wait a second wait a second what's this about you've had zero appreciation of the of of the path and purely just looking at it as a means to an end which is fine you can totally like I mean at the end of the day you don't have to love programming there's nothing in there that says you don't have to love programming it's going to affect how you look at things how you approach problems how how far you go how much you're going to be able to do absolutely but you don't have to do that but you still have to have some level of curiosity love doesn't pay rent sure love does not pay rent but love can certainly cause something that makes it pay rent right like it's it's very important people say this phrase as if it's as if it's an unimportant ingredient love can actually pay rent well that's you're you're you're swapping the different word that's AOS that you're talking about and that's not uh it's a little different there um that's a very old profession and that that has paid rent um but anyways so it's just like take like it's not just simply about building a portfolio if you think building like nextjs versel with clerk sign in means You' you you're ready you're not ready you're not ready you're not there okay you got a little bit more time okay you got a little bit more time so maybe invest in your skills maybe invest in building something that's a little bit more difficult uh also anytime there's a local Meetup anytime there's anything you can do to meet up with people do it okay this is this is called This is called social networking I know networking is a really important part of things and if you get to learn who people are and and you talk to them often you can get a job just by knowing people I know I know this might sound crazy but you can you can do that talking to humans yeah touching grass yeah yeah touching grass hauling ass and touching grass okay I would definitely recommend knowing people you will you will get more jobs by knowing PE people nepotism exists like everywhere yes you know why you know why it's not crazy okay would you want to make a bunch of bets on people you've never met or that one person that keeps going to uh the same event that you go to and you're like hey this person I like you you should go we have an open spot come work with us meetups are cheat coats of course they are like you got to look around right it's just it it makes perfect sense right like why spend countless hours searching for someone when you have the person you already like right in front of you right yeah it's just called security it's called good betting right but but real talk like you got to do something find something that interests you about the process of getting your portfolio up and go and do that right every single time something interests you go and invest in that go look and you know you have to take that time you just have to and at some point you're going to find something you want to build and when you find something you want to build you build it you build it well and you put it out there and you do all that and it's exciting is the job market in the US really that terrible I don't think it's this terrible I think people think it's this terrible but I think a lot of people we have uh if if Uncle Bob Martin if if what he said was actually correct which I don't know if it's actually correct I didn't challenge him on because it's that's like I never you know it's annoying trying to challenge people on uh statistics whenever someone says just some random statistic you know it's just like what what what am I going to say like yeah well you know what I think you're wrong and then it just turns into it I think you're wrong Festival so we're not going to do that all right hold on when Uncle Bob was on the on the show last week he said the following that every five years effectively the the the amount of new candidates doubles right so that means if you take all the people you pretty much have this many new people in right you like within 5 years it's almost all exclusive ly half of it's new people and so now there's like a Slowdown which means that the chunk of unemployed are just are growing like really really fast you can no longer just get employed as easily and so I think this is just causing this huge kind of like wave of this because you know what if you went on Twitter and you read Twitter you would honestly think all you have to do is take react build like a cool site and boom you're hired right that I mean this is like what tech Twitter has told you you need to do and you're finding out that's just not true it's not that true not that easy it's not going to be that easy when I was younger it wasn't that easy right building a nicel looking website was cool but people weren't like they weren't all that they weren't all that like impressed with it right you need to do something a little bit more also real talk you're looking for a job go learn Java literally Infinity jobs there oh you want you or or C tons of job there uh there's this whole thing called Mobile in which is a vastly underserved Market react native uh cotlin de nuts I mean there's plenty of stuff in that whole like you don't have like the web is not everything in the universe there's an entire embedded World c/ rust SL Zig probably has a lot of Life inside of the embedded world like you don't just simply have to like you don't have to live inside of this just like little bubble you know what I mean there's an entire data science area that's just like python python all the days you think someone that knows C really well and python really well isn't pretty employable if you know and those two things together like you like that's a pretty valuable skill set you can go fast you can go smooth you can make the python things fast plus you know all that other stuff all the data scientists and all the uh uh AI Engineers are going to just going to love your ass right so there's there's a lot there's like a whole bunch that's available that's just not like you don't the web is not the end all right it's not going to be an end all how hard is it to get hired without a degree these days I can't answer that question because that is a very um local specific problem right there you go there you go okay it's not just the web like JavaScript isn't the only thing that exists
