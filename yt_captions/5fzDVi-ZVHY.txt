is buying a 2 000 or 10 000 course the way to uh become an entrepreneur it's it's definitely not it's definitely not like all the people i know or successful entrepreneurs are not selling courses on entrepreneurship successful entrepreneurs because they have some business that's working and they're mostly just doing that if the if they're selling courses then you are the business justin obviously everyone wants to know what happened to dr disrespect everyone's dying to know ladies and gentlemen welcome to coffeezilla another edition of sunday special where we talk about whatever the hell i want today we have a very very special guest we have justin khan he's the founder of twitch.justin.tv which eventually became twitch.tv which he co-founded with emmett shearer michael siebel and kyle vogt you eventually sold twitch for almost a billion dollars to amazon you've started several companies since like a socialcam atrium and you've been an investor in a y combinator and you now have your own seed company called goat capital so all of this is to say justin sincerely i have no idea why you decided to come on the show today to my little channel but i really appreciate you taking the time thanks for having me i came on because i watched the interview you did with my friend jason calcionis and i thought it was funny i loved it so and plus i i respect the mission which is to expose all this you know the internet fraudsters and uh and flush them out that's the main reason i wanted to bring you on because there are just this huge influx of entrepreneurs selling success on the internet and i think everyone knows the type they're doing stuff you know you probably never heard of any companies they built but they're talking like you know they're god's gift to entrepreneurs and they're selling success overnight success in a 2 000 course i've been ranting about what a scam this is for a long time but getting jason on was so great getting you on so great because i want to talk to real entrepreneurs who have really done it because um you guys are the people that people need to be listening to as far as um getting advice and you're not gonna you're not gonna try to sell them success because you guys know that's ridiculous but let me just ask for the sake of it is buying a 2 000 or thousand dollar course the way to uh beca become an entrepreneur i mean it's it's definitely not it's definitely not like the thing that always strikes me if these people are successful all the people i know who are successful are entrepreneurs are not selling courses on entrepreneurship they're they're successful entrepreneurs because they have some business that's working and they're mostly just doing that like if if they're selling courses then you are the business like you are the you're you're the one who's getting farmed here and so i just like white combinator being a great example you know i spent years at y combinator yc was the investor in twitch or justin tv the company that triggered twitch wesley's also first investor in airbnb dropbox reddit coinbase instacart and tons and tons of other startups thousands of other startups now for the last 15 years and yc does all of its content for free right all of the content out there on youtube on podcasts it's all free all the essays that paul graham started writing and then all the other white supporters write and that i wrote when i was at yc are free why why does it that's a cost center right like why do people spend their time doing doing that because it's the funnel for the actual business the actual business is investing in companies right some of those companies become airbnb and then everybody makes a [ __ ] a ton of money like that's how the business works not monetizing the audience of hopeful entrepreneurs which not only would be a much worse business than you know actually what yc does today but it's also we view it as like much less ethical right like the the point of it's almost anti-encouraging people if you're if you're monetizing them in a way that's exploited yeah because it seems like when you're early stage i mean you are working on limited funds and so if you're all of a sudden going to give ten thousand dollars away to some business coach there's there's almost no way they're going to provide that much value as it they could take like a percent a point a few points of your company and then advise you that's what a lot of legitimate entrepreneurs do or you know you have companies like y combinator instead they go no we want an upfront fee and that's i think the most telling thing is you take people who are like hopefuls and you do it but um i don't think people understand how big the industry is i've been railing about it for like a year year and a half and uh it's it's a billion dollar industry all these guys basically selling success um what would you say to someone who's like sort of stuck in that loop and doesn't know how to differentiate some real advice because a lot of these guys give a lot of like kind of a boilerplate advice they say like work really hard you know uh save your money all that kind of stuff how would you differentiate it's all well so i i think there's a question of like the the source which the source is coming from actually i want to give you one more example from y combinator unlike what somebody who you know an organization that's pro founder looks like versus one that's maybe kind of anti-founder anti-entrepreneur and so with yc one of our biggest expenses when i was at y company i don't know if this is still true especially during the pandemic but we used to fly in entrepreneurs to interview with us for a 10-minute interview to see who we would find would they would come in from all over the world all over the country and all over the world and we would pay for it because we didn't want people to go out of pocket to do an interview for us so yc's biggest expense was to pay for hundreds of people every six months to fly in from like sometimes it was like from africa or india or whatever so they could meet us so we could decide whether we wanted to fund them or not and that you know we didn't have to do that people would have gladly paid themselves but it wasn't the ethos who were saying we don't entrepreneurs who are starting off don't have a lot of money so it's our duty our you know ethical duty to try to be as supportive as possible and since we are in this position of relative power and are making very decent money like we should pay for this and so you know that we would throw events we threw like conferences for thousands of people and they would entirely be free it wouldn't be you don't even have to pay you know any amount it would be like completely free and we would you know do it entirely from an application basis you know and so i think there there's that's the difference between a firm that's really trying to organize around helping entrepreneurs versus somebody who's trying to monetize and exploit potential entrepreneurs sorry that wasn't answering your question but your your actual question was how do you determine fake you know or like good advice from from maybe more generic advice i mean i would look at who is giving this advice right i think that's really important and what i mean by that is like the people i know who are like the best entrepreneurs are not that flashy they're not out there on social media posting pictures of their you know lamborghini like they're they're just not like i don't know a single entrepreneur who's like a successful tech entrepreneur in silicon valley they might own a life like a lot of them own a lamborghini but almost none of them are posting pictures of it saying they're going to teach you how to be wealthy enough to buy that whenever none of them are it's so it's so unbelievable unbelievably tacky um and it's become that way sort of because so many of these sort of lifestyle people who you know don't really have it have been renting them and they've sort of i think i honestly think they've devalued a lot of the brand of um lamborghini and it's sort of made it like oh if you want to sort of show you have wealth you don't get a lamborghini you get something maybe a little more exotic that it's sort of like if you know you know kind of cars there's a lot of that um yeah yeah to go back to your point about you know even like why commenter would pay out of pocket to find good talent i mean that you can find the same thing in a lot of um you know trading is another big thing where they sell a lot of courses but there's also legitimate like you know institutional funds where they'll pay you it's called an internship to learn they know you're not like qualified to go make them a ton of money right now but they want to invest knowing that maybe 10 of those interns will turn into future traders of theirs right and so i think that is a great rule of thumb is like where are they taking their value in the lifespan of you as you know as a customer are they taking their or an employee are they taking their value at the beginning of the value chain you know before you've done anything or are they taking it sort of in the future when you've proven yourself and that shows whether they're really betting on you right or they're betting on just like a huge number of people coming in um and just sort of making money money at the top of the funnel it seems like that's exactly right you know it's kind of like angel investors who are there's some angel investors that are paid a pitch you know and that's like a [ __ ] scam like when people make you pay to pitch like they're they're if you're a real investor your business is on finding amazing investments and a pay to pitch is an adverse selection right because like someone who's good is not going to do that and so you know it's just that's an example have you figured out about the clubhouse grift yet i mean that's a whole thing that's going on right now there's so many of these me and jason have been going off about it at him more than i i mean he's like he like really sees it as you know his worst enemy are some of these guys on clubhouse having people pitch to them and then they'll take these investors sometimes it won't be paid a pitch but it'll be like hey yeah give us 30 of your company for coaching and it's like what 30 30 and no value like it's a revenue generating company they'll give us 30 percent it's just absolutely insane but i think part of the problem is so um silicon valley captures the best talent in the world but then you sort of have like you have people that y combinator accepts and then you have people sort of who are able to get into y combinator but they still want uh sort of what you might call entrepreneur help which is a really valuable thing what would you tell companies who aren't lucky enough or fortunate enough to get into y combinator who were looking for that kind of helping hand and now they have a bunch of grifters promising them you know come with me i'll give you success how can those people get that help that they want without falling for these yeah so i think that's really tough right because the best like there's there's like a little bit of a like kind of global network effect where the best talent like the best advisors investors etc are like looking for the best companies because they want that facebook or uber airbnb like return and so it makes sense but i mean but the access to that mentorship is like very limited right like i probably look at a thousands like a thousand companies a year and like i might find fund 20 of them right or 30 of them so that's like two percent or three percent and so you know i just don't have the time right like i'm just one guy of course and so you know that's kind of the way it is for for all of the you know successful entrepreneurs and investors in silicon valley and understandably other people want mentorship and they want to figure out how they um can find people you know mentors and and i think that then they get fooled i guess by these these kind of people who look they come in like the clothing of a mentor right but they're like not you know or like yeah what people think they should look like with the with the lambo and uh you know a million instagram followers or whatever and then you get fooled by it but you know that doesn't exist i guess like part of i mean this is not a very maybe this isn't like easiest message to hear but it's like part of what you have to do as an entrepreneur is you know kind of get to the stage prove yourself to get to a stage where people who are successful want to help you and want to like work with you and usually that requires some level of evidence on your part so why see it might be like you know you don't have to be a successful company yet but you have to be able to build a product right you have to demonstrate that you can build a product and that that's hard because like a lot of people are like well i don't know how to build a product and i don't know how to you know successfully find a technical co-founder you know if they're not technical or and so you know we couldn't really help those people and a lot of them still wanted something but like you know it was just kind of like burns on you to go and get to that proof point and then once you get funded by yc there's another milestone which okay you want to raise a series a from like real investors you need to really prove some set of milestones in terms of growing that product and trying to get there and you know that's just kind of the way the world works it's like if you want people to help you the best way to do that is to help yourself and to get to kind of show that you're worth helping and um all the information the positive thing i can probably is that all the information to to figure that out is out there for free like all the most successful people in the world not just silicon valley have put this information out there like how to raise money how to build a product how to find product product market fit it's all free yeah out there you could read it like i put a video out on youtube on my channel that's like how to pitch investors and how to raise money from investors how to create a narrative around that right put that out there for free because i just want to get that information out there it's like people helped me when i with the same type of stuff when i was coming up and so it's my joy to help entrepreneurs in that way it's not i don't need to like lock it behind a paywall because i know if i put enough good karma out there with my content then i'm gonna get a lot of entrepreneurs who are like oh i want to work with you and you know my job is to select the best of those who will provide the best returns 100 there are no secrets this is what i keep trying to tell people and um it's so great to hear it from somebody who's you know been there done that and it seems like it's all execution then right because if the information's out there then what ch what changes the variable the x is execution and learning how to nail that execution how to like meet the right people at the right time um something that strikes me is that you and your co-founders i mean you guys are all like crushing it your co-founders are now like emmitt shears i think the ceo of twitch right michael siebel managing director of y combinator kyle vogt is the uh ceo of cruz um so you know and you guys were like hanging around steve huffman at the time co-founder of reddit it seems to me like okay there's no coincidence that all these people sort of surrounding each other hanging around all ended up doing great things it seems like network you guys just had a great network how do how much of your success do you contribute to your network and how do you build a great network yeah that's a great question and it applies to everybody right that's why i love that question it's like the interesting thing is the success didn't really come from the like you might see the later stage network and be like oh he's friends with the ceos of reddit and coinbase and you know all these other companies and you know that may be why he was able to become successful but it was actually like in the beginning we were all just nobodies that's what i'm saying no no that's what i'm saying it's like these people who seem to be hanging out early on all went and like started a lot of the companies we all know today but it's just funny to me because i was watching some of your videos about like you were like out partying with steve huffman and i'm like how funny is it that the guy like who co-founded twitch is also hanging out with the guy who co-founded reddit i mean it doesn't to me that doesn't seem like coincidence there's a lot of smart people out in the world but there's a there's obviously something happening here if two people so close together co-founded some of the like biggest companies or internet companies ever yeah it's not a coincidence right because people group together like if you want to be there's this old adage that's like you're the average of your five best friends so if you want to be an actor then you should go make friends with people who are trying to be an actor actors or or are actors if you want to be an entrepreneur you want to make friends with people who want to be entrepreneurs or are entrepreneurs and surround yourself with that and that's one of the really powerful things about y combinators it's a community of entrepreneurs where entrepreneurship was previously a very solo journey right like it's something that's very isolated kind of like you're figuring out by yourself and so what i come into this community of entrepreneurs and it brought together a lot of these early founders of internet companies in this kind of 2005 starting a 2005 wave and uh you know it was just self-selecting like people like i wouldn't be wanted to be an entrepreneur so i kind of became in this community i joined this community and i got funded by ycn and i became friends with all these people in ycn that was my friend group and you know today those people have become successful because it turns out like any form of success you know you start working on it and then 10 years later or 15 years later like that's when it really pays off and so um you know all these people were just kind of smart you know relatively smart but but mostly people would opted in to working on internet startups and were working hard 10 years ago and then became something now you know because because of that hard work they put in how do you find that network if you don't have something sort of ready made like y combinator you know is such a um cool thing for so many entrepreneurs what would you say to somebody who's living in like illinois or the uk or india maybe they don't have such like a startup scene right in their local area or a scene for whatever they want um is it possible to create your own scene what would you tell people yeah that's a great question because it is like a lot of these networks now have moved online and are much more accessible to people who are anywhere in the world yeah so some examples like why combinatories itself anyone can apply to y commander from anywhere in the world there's companies that are like african solar companies that have been funded by yc or like indonesian you know delivery companies like companies like everywhere in the world really and so um that community is online and we can apply for free right like so you can just apply for free now not everyone can get in because yc only funds a limited number of companies but you can you know you can apply but then there's all these other digital communities of people who are building things um like for example i'm i'm in this one called gen z mafia although probably shouldn't tell them because i'm definitely not gen z i'm old as [ __ ] but like these what i love about this it's it's all these gen z kids who are building stuff it's kind of like startup uh gen z and they're on the discord server and that as far as i know is free i think maybe anyone can join it or there's maybe an application process but um that's a great community where where all these people are trading tips about startups and talking about startup news and doing doing fireside chats with people from silicon valley and like it's a great network you know i've hired people out of that server then i you know they asked me to come in for a chat and then i've hired people out of server not funding companies from that server so you know that's an easy way to get access to somebody like me and i know there's many other successful entrepreneurs and with you know investors who have talked spoken on that server it is and i want to dive deep i didn't know we were going to talk about this but it just sparks such an interesting conversation for me about like networking and i find it so fascinating so many times you get in these communities and you might like feel like a bit of an outsider or the conversations you're having with people are purely um sort of transactional how do you turn what is just sort of we just hang out in the same discord server into something that's like hey we're actually maybe interested in helping each other um maybe with a business venture or whatever how do you break down that wall of like hey justin khan's in this discord server obviously that's like cool but he doesn't know me i don't know him um you know the internet has democratized you know talking to like celebrities to interesting people but so often they have like sort of that walled garden how do you break past who's how do how have people in the past broken past with you yeah so so i think there's a couple questions in there one is like specific to me and then the other one i hear is how do you build these relationships in general like so starting with the generalized case like people do business with people right and if you just build a real relationship with with somebody then you have their they become a resource to you right it's like they're like a social resource right it's like social capital and it's interesting because people don't think about that as that much but it's just like you just need to build work on your relationships and that's what ultimately is going to pay off in business like for me it's like i have i've been someone who loves connecting with people and i've always wanted to connect with people and i connect with people try to meet them and know them long before that there's ever some useful thing that i want from them or want to do with them business-wise you know i'm an investor in reddit you know i let him participate in investment in reddit and that was years ago i knew steve for for over you know 12 years before even that that was on the table and it just happened because you know we were friends and he was commiserating on how he wanted to raise some money and i was like okay you know maybe i can help you with that and so you know that kind of came out of a friendship right and so i think there's there's an example of there's a lot of examples for me in my life about you know really just worrying about developing relationships first and then eventually something economic can can grow from that um and then you know in terms of like the general question of like well sorry that was the general answer the specific question of like how do you how do you get in touch with me well you know i've answered dms from people on that discord server where they're like oh how do i think about you know this approaching this that start a problem or you know and i i'm pretty accessible like people i read my twitter and instagram dms largely and people will send me messages and the things that work are it's the same as cold email it's like someone like me i think i'm a little bit more accessible maybe than most people who are maybe have done you know start a billion dollar company but um i like to help people and i generally talk to people who are i'm willing to respond when things are made easy for me so it's like it's there's a concrete ask it's not too long like you're not sending like a 10 paragraph email it's like here's the context for why you might want to be interested in me like what i'm working on etc here's like my specific question or ask and then thank you that's it boom like you know five sentences and that's like this you know it's kind of table stakes and then there's you know people it helps when you're asking something that's like i get something out of it right like yeah and what i mean by it's not i'm getting something like i'm getting money or status or something like that but like maybe i'm learning something right like you can teach me something that's really interesting if you ask me like someone was i was chatting with someone random today and he was asking like this conversation kind of started with like you know i'm kind of struggling with with a bunch of things and like i just wanted your advice on these things i'm struggling with and that's like interesting it's like oh by helping you i actually feel good about myself i'm getting something right then there was like it pivoted to like can you give me advice on my y combinator application then i'm like no longer really getting anything because it's like well you could read that i think i've written about it there's a lot of stuff online it's like so i'm like not i'm you know i'm doing probably i probably i'm going to be on zoom today for like 11 hours so like that became the prior to this right like i would like to help everyone if i could but i just that was no longer super interesting to me and so you know it's just think about that like put yourself in the like so many people who come and reach out if don't put themselves in the context yeah the person they're reaching out to yes correct so so just imagine you're me and i get probably like 50 100 dms or message emails or whatever a day that's not even including pick doc and youtube comments or whatever right so like again there's a ton of reach out today how can you contextualize the thing that you want in a way that is giving me something back even if it's just learning oh i totally get it no i don't think you're being it doesn't come across as like selfish at all that's just how people are they want to contextualize in a way that fits fits into their life fits into their goals it could be even like you have a mission to help xyz contextualize it within what you you care about as well i do find that people who have been successful um very non-pretentious and a lot of them want to give back they feel like a debt to you know to to give back to people i find that all the time which is why it's so funny to me that you know you have people charging twenty thousand dollars for an hour coaching call and it's like they're nobo i mean they're just a nobody and it's like they're charging so much money for this thing and it's it's just um crazy now i want to pivot a little bit and talk about some of the paradoxes in entrepreneurship um which is something that we talked about like general advice and how it's sometimes useful but sometimes it's not the right use case so persistence is a common trait for entrepreneurs that they need to have it to get through sort of the valley of non-adoption that nobody cares about your product yet right um but on the other hand most ideas will not work and if you can kind of cut your losses early if you can find out your idea is not going to work it kind of it's good in a certain kind of way you even said this in a recent ama you're like i don't remember exactly i said it you said like learn to how to quit early it only gets harder how do you know the difference that seems like it's paradoxical on the one hand entrepreneurs should persist on the other hand they should learn to quit early when they realize their idea is not going to work and they can start something else it's i think it's really hard to to tell because there's no real formula you know for it's kind of like when people get give up people give up when they run out of ideas on how to make it work and so the way that you want to you know if you have some mission of like something you want to bring into the world the key is that you like continually have new ideas on how to make it how you could bring that about right and usually what happens is entrepreneurs run out of ideas they run off things that that that they could try and then they give up from there i don't have a formula i'm like when you should give up you know it's it's with twitch we pivoted multiple times we had this show that was called justin tv you know where we were trying to create a live video stream and then that didn't work so we turned it into a platform for live video which worked for a while which and then eventually pivoted to twitch so it's a very secure route um but one thing i i can say is if you don't want to give up if you have this mission and you don't want to give up then you know the thing to do is surround yourself with co-workers and co-founders who can really support you on you know and when you're feeling down they're like maybe charging ahead it's to like constantly put yourself in positions where you can think of new ideas for how to how to kind of innovate and like iterate to towards something that works and the last thing is really work on something you really intrinsically care about if you don't work on if you're not you don't care about something then when you it stops working outside it gets tough that that's when you're most likely to give up that's such a great answer i you know something i think about when i you know as i'm talking to you is that um you're someone who sort of climbed the mountain achieved whether you would say so or not you've achieved the silicon valley dream of the huge exit you have this even this company co-founded also went on to do great things like it didn't bomb it's like it's doing incredible things um what i mean no literally you're like like one of the fathers of modern gaming and that being a legitimate career i mean say that with like no exaggeration seriously you've enabled and empowered so many people who you know never thought they'd have a career in this it is amazing and that is like the dream of you know social like being able to change things but i kind of am so interested in you know people like yourself because the question is like what now what inspires you what inspires justin today is it to build another you know billion dollar company what gets you out of bed and gets you excited for like keep pushing keep pursuing yeah that's a great question there's one i wrestled with for a very long time so for me i wanted to create a bigger company you know i had friends who were i had you know a billion dollar exit with twitch but then we looked at guys who were friends of mine who were like brian chesky from airbnb or drew from dropbox that they were like doing way better so for a long time i was highly motivated to you know because i was pursuing these extrinsic goals right these egoic goals to like be more successful and so i tried uh started this other company long story short didn't work you know raised a lot of money for it had high expectations and then you know somewhere along the way i realized like actually you could never have lasting satisfaction from pursuing external goals right and people always say when i say that they're like oh it's easy for you to say you already had you already made it it's like well okay i've been there yes but i've also looked at my friends who were more successful and thought oh i want to be there you know i want to be there and they're probably pushing because they want they're looking up too they're like there's somebody above me with a bigger more zeros by their name or whatever by their net worth or doing more that's the human condition right this is to always be looking it's i did a post on this on my podcast the quest but i'm going to put it on youtube as well it's called hedonic adaptation right or the hedonic treadmill where we get to a new place and then we're like oh but what about this place it becomes we could get adapted to it and then it's just business as usual when i was you know i could i i uh some good examples of that like of like of like hedonic adaptation in your life yeah yeah exactly i'll give you the example because it was interesting as an entrepreneur i went through the entire like every step so when we started off in 2006 we paid ourselves like 1700 a month or this is in 2005 with my first company seventeen hundred dollars a month every other month i skipped salary so we paid ourselves basically like eight hundred dollars a month and then when we raised our first venture round for justin tv we got seventy five thousand dollar a month a year salary and then from there when we raised the next round i think we boosted it to a hundred thousand and then we became profitable at some point so it was like 150 and then we got to some profitability and we raised it to 200 000. this was over the course of like five years yeah and then we spun out a company first and we sold it for 60 million dollars and so everybody got like a pretty big taste you know like and we became millionaires and then we sold we sold twitch for 790 we started off i thought i said if we could just make a million dollars each in this business that would be crazy you may be insane you've made it yeah we would have made it yeah and we blew by that obviously and so the funny thing was like i never got any happier like every i every time i made more money i was like oh this is nice for like one week and then that was like my new normal now i'm the type of guy who makes two hundred thousand dollars a year you know now i'm the type of guy who has millions of dollars in spain that's it and and so you know i can see that with all my friends they could be worth it's funny i just had a friend he raised money in a billion dollar evaluation that was his dream life stream right and then he's like looking he was telling me he's like i'm looking at he's like i'm friends with brian from coinbase right they're going to ipo for like whatever they're they're kind of so he's like he's like yeah so he's he is upset he's being upset yeah right and so people don't believe it but hedonic adaptation is is that the truth of the human condition right and so i think that that is that's something that that people really don't realize and so for me you know what what kept me going at first was just like i want more more more more and then today to get back to the original question i really try to think about like what is my intrinsic motivation like what gives me joy like what do i like to do what would i do for no no money and if nobody was watching it's this is it it's the same it's like yeah yeah yeah sorry go ahead yeah what do you love so it's like it's like yeah and it was like i love helping people and so i like to be an investor because it's an opportunity to learn about new things like learn new businesses and new ideas and then also help people entrepreneurs with my pretty much my only skill set which is like entrepreneurship and then i love creating and i love the creative process of creating so that's why i'm on youtube and tick tock and whatever i'm it's like it's fun for me it's it's messing around with being creative and i that's how i've tried to design my jobs like can i get out of bed and do those things that's if i can that's a successful day if not then you know maybe i need to iterate and adapt some things i do sense that that's the beating heart of you know um of what you like to do because even if you go back to the origins of justin.tv it's like hey let me livestream my life which is such a that's like a pretty artsy idea like especially at the time before you know before this was a normal thing um that's a real out-there art house idea that you wanted to do um which is why like i love your story is because you found a way to you know turn into this awesome thing which uh ended up empowering other people to pursue their art which i think is so cool um justin you you have a youtube channel right and i that's something huge i want to shout out is that you have a youtube channel where you talk about entrepreneurship you talk about angel investing you talk about how you got drunk with steve huffman and got arrested i mean like incredible honestly when i saw your youtube channel i was like this guy should have millions and millions and millions of subscribers i highly encourage everyone to check it out what can people expect in the future of the the man who started live streaming what's the future of that youtube channel i'm having so much fun with it it's uh it's kind of crazy i did not think it would be this fun um originally i started because i wanted to promote my podcast but like actually i love my youtube channel in like a completely different way so it's content like i tell a lot of silicon valley war stories like the story of selling to google or almost only to google twitch could have been owned by google and then walking away from the mega monopoly would have been would have been realized if you had sold to google it would have all been real trouble yep so stuff like that i've been i tell the story of um you know like how we pivoted to twitch from justin tv i just like a long list of early entrepreneurship stories and then uh like a lot of how to's i'm gonna be you know i did one on fundraising that's like kind of the most hyped how-to fundraising video ever but like if you're an entrepreneur you want to raise money um i want to do i think i'm going to start making like vlog content just like people are interested about you know what's my day-to-day and um so you know doing videos on like just the random stuff that i get up to and i don't know i'm just having fun with it that is awesome man i want to um go ahead go ahead i want to give people like an authentic view into what my life is like because i just i think i have a pretty fun time trying to be helpful really focused on meditation and wellness or some things that are like really important to me so my goal is really just to give people a view into my life and what silicon valley is like but then also maybe teach some skills that might be helpful to people for themselves down the road that is awesome man um people can go check it out i want people to buy my course yeah yeah yeah you're you're uh your six thousand dollar life coaching justin khan course uh to to get invited to pitch at y combinator guys you gotta pay your way in i'm just kidding um then uh justin obviously everyone wants to know what happened to doctor disrespect everyone's dying to know getting um you know what's so funny it's like i made a tick tock about the act where i was like yeah every like i made this tick tock and the tick tock someone every time i post on tick tock or whatever or youtube people are like what about doctor just what happened to doctors respect what happened to this stream what happened to the streamer why is this streamer still unbanned so it's either why did you ban this person why did you unban this person yeah and then the funny thing is so i uh i posted i was like okay finally like you got me like if you comment a streamer on this tick tock video in the next 24 hours then i will unban them and then i'm like nah i can't do that i don't work at the company anymore which is true like i literally have no idea what happened to dr disrespect or any survivor worked there in seven years it's the biggest conspiracy theory on the internet ever because everyone knows the internet can't keep a secret and the fact that it has been kept kept a secret is hilarious um and of course i was just joking with you uh obviously you know you don't know but um yeah you just i just had to ask uh finally okay sorry one last question then we're good i swear okay one thing i really am curious about as someone who's been in the trenches of silicon valley this is a real like trench question which is we live in a time now where it has become the norm for new startups to get like copied by the big boys and we have these market leaders um that you like google uh amazon facebook who they see it seems to kind of be like oh if you make a successful product you either get acquired or copied overnight and so you see that with clubhouse right where twitter spaces came out um you know it seemed like it seemed like overnight and they may completely take over the space looking at that do you think that discourages entrepreneurship not talking about that case specifically because we know it's happened a million times to a million different companies of just getting scooped do you think that's hurting entrepreneurship and what can entrepreneurs know and do to prevent that well it's definitely not good for entrepreneurship right like having huge incumbents that copy and clone entrepreneurs is not good for entrepreneurship i think the best thing you can do the problem is like the internet economy in the internet industry is now 30 years old right and yeah 25 years old and so you know there are incumbents that are very powerful it's like much more mature and this is it's not unique to the internet like you know this happens in every industry so if you really want to be a startup that's like not clonable you have to kind of go you know skate to where the puck is going and go somewhere where other people aren't and so you know i thought that we were doing that with justin tv that's a good example where we had this company called kiko which is a web calendar uh before we started justin tv and kiko like google google released their calendar like right after we did right so i was like the next company i want to do something so different that will never be in competition with google and so we did justin tv and we were like okay you know what it's like me streaming my life to the internet 24 7. this cannot be a couple google could not copy this yeah criteria right and they're never going to copy this it's so insane and then eventually we pivoted it's funny because we pivoted to i know you know platform for live gaming if a platform for live and then pop up live gaming and then youtube eventually goes coffee they add live and then they add all the same stuff and they add like the subscription features they tell yeah i know man um it is it is really crazy but now it's giant versus giant it's like it's like amazon versus youtube um anyway yeah thanks for answering that question because i it's a question kind of question in the back of my mind as i look at you know the modern entrepreneurship landscape i kind of feel bad for new founders or i just think i think it's a new problem right there are really good things about having a mature internet ecosystem they're amazing platforms to build apps now to make it so much easier but there's also downsides and thanks for addressing that um i think that's basically it guys thank you so much for coming on justin answering these burning questions i hope people learned a lot how to be a better entrepreneur don't fall for the scammers guys look a lot of great guys like justin they're not selling a course listen you can get into white combinator for free you just have to have a great idea thank you so much uh for sharing your knowledge justin appreciate it absolutely this is awesome thank you great go check out his
