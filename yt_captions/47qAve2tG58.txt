I recently stumbled across some of the coolest AI apps or AI tools to help you build apps and websites and I'm going to give a spoiler alert SPO spoiler I haven't had enough coffee yet alert that the reality is these apps are not here these tools are not here to replace you they are though a great way if you are someone who is either technical or even non-technical but wants to start building you have an idea a business idea or maybe just something you want to start exploring for a project you can now do that at a quicker Pace it's not as though you have to take so many steps back and learn everything from scratch I mean if you want to be a software developer definitely learn everything from scratch but if you are someone who is really interested in building apps and building websites or at least concepts for your business these tools are for you well they're kind of for everyone because they're super helpful and this video really came on as I was going through you know actually was LinkedIn I was going through and I saw this post and it was called I have it here Rose Ai and I I'll share it with you later in this video but it essentially is marketing itself as a AI data analyst and now obviously that's just marketing hype but it is such a cool tool so I'm going to show you that one I'm going to show you a bunch about how you can take generate UI ux turn it into code then modify the code we're didn't go through it all all right let's get into it oh also if you're like Tiff you're not in your usual desk setup where are you I'm in Montreal this weekend so I'm in my hotel room uh it's kind of messy you know we're very close you and I so I I'm just bearing it all I I kind of Tidy it up but we're keeping it real here I'll insert a photo of the the view is okay I mean it's no New York but I'll I'll insert a photo the [Music] view all right the first one I want to share with you about is to create UI and ux Designs so mockups that you can then use in figma and then turn into code now none of these are sponsored just as an FYI I'm just a huge fan of well pretty much all of them that we're going to speak about today and the first one that I've spoken about before to you but I just I was like okay Tiff should I include it should I not include it I'm like I I have to include it is wizard wizard uard definitely Wizard and they are well you tell me how to pronounce it here it is now they promote themselves as the world's first AI UI generator and honestly it's pretty incredible what they do so you can insert a prompt and then they will either generate a wireframe for you ux for you UI for you whatever you want and the UI for Wizard itself and the way you can build with it is so intuitive and user friendly now I thought it was still good to include them because they did just launch a new feature this feature let me pull it up on screen here it's called autod designer 1.5 so this will allow you to generate multiple design screens so no longer are you stuck to designing you know just the one homepage or anything like that you can really design your entire project which is pretty cool and you can do so just by prompting now I've been playing around with it and the prompting you can be pretty flexible with it I thought okay you have to be a really good at prompting or prompted in a specific way but it's really intuitive so this is the tool if I was to use it I would use it in the scenario where you have a business idea or you are a developer either or so a technical or non-technical person and you want to show you know whether it be investors whether it be uh yourself if you're building a project the basic of it the wireframes what it will look like so other people can really start to envisioning this or visioning it envisioning it visioning also you know where this tool would be really useful is for anyone who is doing freelance work so if you are a freelancer especially in the developer space or even a designer space what you can do is as a developer start by because I think a lot of times as developers one of the for me anyways one of the hardest things to do is actually come up with good UI I it just it's the worst so having this tool to really start with a foundation and then you can add on to it it's pretty cool all right next on the list is localy AI I think I'm pronouncing this one right localy Ai and this one's really cool because it's more so a plugin that you can plug into different design system so for example it works really well with figma you can go in figma and create your beautiful UI or if you want to do these tools step by step you can use wizard to create the UI then export it into figma then in figma take this tool localy plug it in and it will generate it will take your UI design your uiux design and generate it into code that you can export so it takes design to code which is pretty cool now here is some of the code settings that you can choose from first is is mobile app framework so they really specialize in react native so right now you can export to react native but other languages and other Frameworks are coming very soon so this is a platform a business in itself that's growing really quickly and I've seen a lot of designers or developers use this tool all right the next one is the one that inspired me to start this video which is Rose Ai and as I mentioned I just stumbled across this on LinkedIn and I was like this is so cool how useful it is for someone like me who's not a data analyst but loves data and I mean is studying machine learning it's just brilliant so what it does is it will allow you to analyze data faster so you can literally qu have say well let me show you a video of it I'll show you their video of it so you can start with a title start with a little bit of information and then from there what would usually be SQL queries that you are generating you can then use in in more automated ways you can select what you want to do it will analyze the data and give you some beautiful reports of where the data is at it's so cool and I think this is a great way a great tool to use if you are so many different roles within the tech industry even thinking now how it makes for marketers having this data readily accessible is huge but then on the technical side of things using this as more of a tool when you are building out other websites or apps to really understand to make data driven decisions it's I don't know I think it's amazing I'll play more of the video on screen here uh because it's really cool okay the next one I want to share with you is for any WordPress developers or users out there and this is called called code WP code WP and honestly code WP is something that I recently discovered I heard about it through a few other developers and they use it and I was like what is this tool so you can see on screen here they label it or Market it as a better AI for word pressors and this is really cool because this tool this plug-in um one of the things I think is really good about it is it has support for all the main languages used within WordPress so PHP JavaScript CSS of course and SQL so really SQL SQL SQL that is the debate well it is SQL right yeah but I like to call it SQL but I want to hear what do you call it SQL SQL are you right are you wrong let me know anyways regardless of what you call it though code WP is super super interesting you can literally as you can see in this video here prompt it with what you would like it to do and it will generate code for you within WordPress so this you can think of more so as like your assistant when you're building within WordPress I mean so many companies still use WordPress it's it's one of the most popular uh platforms to use so having this tool to use is so helpful also I know a lot of freelance developers work within WordPress so this is another way to kind of have this code assistant no is not taking over your job but you can utilize it to build faster and hopefully better okay the next one the last one is called framer and I wanted to say this one for last because if you haven't heard of framer you maybe have been living under a rock I'm just kidding I only recently heard about it but but I was blown away by when I looked into it so this one I saved for last because it really is taking an idea and then deploying it and then everything in between you can do within framer now this isn't just for uh individual projects they also work with Enterprises so it's pretty cool you can build very scalable long-term projects with framer and the really cool thing is here too is you can start here they have their feature section so layout they have their own CMS localization AI different tooling for AI through it SEO so you literally can come in with an idea that you're like this is going to blow up I know it's going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg social media whatever the case is and start scaling it out through there now it's not as simple as just that of course but it is a great way for anyone who maybe is technical but doesn't want to spend a lot of time on you know building the foundations that they already know but having that skeleton to build upon or someone who's not Tech as technical but wants to get something in the market wants to build something framer seems like a really great option now I'm not sure I know there is pricing involved with framer let's see what it is so there are you can have a free site which includes some hobby sites um a domain and whatnot and then it does it's not that expensive you can have a mini site for $5 then of course it does go up from there but I definitely think it is worth looking into if you are someone who has a business idea or uh is building for a client and wants to see its scale AI is moving quickly these tools are moving quickly how are you all feeling about it are you excited I mean the reason I made this video is because I thought these tools are out there people are using them so we have two choices we can either adapt and grow and learn with these tools or we can just resist them but in turn we will feel left behind a little bit it's not saying you need to use these tools in your every day or for every single project but being open to what is out there understanding what is out there and even trying some of them and seeing how they help you all right on that note I need to go get more coffee I need to go find coffee I feel like I still have a a coffee coffeeless voice thank you all for watching please hit that subscribe button for more Tech coding and uh career all all the things under Tech related videos leave in the comments what other videos you want me to make that is how I make these videos and thank you all for being here I love you all you mean the world to me and I'll see you soon [Music]
