ladies and gentlemen right now in early March 2023 we will be experiencing a very tragic moment in chess history as Magnus Carlson best player arguably of all time will be playing his last few classical games of chess as the world champion you see on April 7th 2023 the next World Chess Championship will begin and Magnus Carlson has declined his participation and so the throne will be contested by yanya pomnushi and dingly Ren and so Magnus is playing in What's called the Norwegian League which is a team format event and he's going to be playing a few games in today's video I will be covering his first game and then I will cover the last two games that Magnus Carlson plays as the reigning world chess champion and in today's video Magnus Carlson played against Levi some of you think my name is Levi that may or may not be true let's take a look at this game that Magnus played against Levi Levi hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly and the Norwegians don't have that you know crazy name uh his full name is Levi Andre uh taloxone and he is a uh 20 something year old feeder Mouse I think he might even be 30 he's a 30 year old feeder Master uh from uh Norway obviously Norwegian league and this is going to be a really interesting game obviously it's a lopsided matchup but I'm always really interested to see how Magnus defeats really damn good players like Levi's better than all of you he's better than me but how does Magnus beat these guys how does he make it look so simple I literally made a separate video about that a long time ago called Magnus Carlson beating Chess Masters E4 and what would you do if you had to sit for three hours across from Magnus Carlsen I mean would you even last that long E5 all right so already very professional he's not going for the Cairo some stupid opening you know Scandinavian Sicilian some stupid opening they're all good openings Lazy Five night F3 Knight C6 already big by the way huge mistake by Magnus I mean Vienna I don't think this guy would have expected a Vienna game but but you know uh and a Spanish right like if you're gonna sit down and buckle up and and play three four hours of Chess you might as well uh go to the Spanish opening uh Levi plays A6 Bishop A4 and now Knight F6 Main Line castles Bishop E7 and now we have already uh the first wrinkle you see Magnus really likes to take players Hand by like he likes to hold their hand and then cross the street and then push them in front of a car um it doesn't do that to old ladies with the old ladies he crosses the street Magnus will go hand in hand with you to the land of Chess Theory and then he will just like drop you off at a random bus station and leave you on your own uh the main line here is just rookie one rookie one is a very simple move it defends this Pawn black often times will go B5 And Delay the movement of this Pawn uh and this is what Magnus actually plays with black in order to play what's known as the Marshall Gambit uh after and sacrifice this Pawn which we're not going to get into but Magnus plays D3 D3 is not as popular as the move Rook to E1 and the reason is rookie one is much more flexible white wants to play C3 and D4 that is what you want to play in the Spanish but when you play the move D3 you are completely 100 admitting that at least for the time being you you're not gonna play D4 you're going to play a completely different type of Spanish here's the problem Magnus probably can recite about 50 if not 100 games historically that have gone D3 like modern games by karawana Anand himself this is the thing about these top guys do you know how much Theory I know after D3 and like just how many historical games zero I can name a grand total of zero and I'm an international Master okay I don't know who the hell gave me that title uh but uh again the idea is to go back to B3 and normally If You're Gonna Play like this there's a very trendy modern way to play the Spanish which is to play A3 and then Knight C3 and a good friend of mine Mr International Master uh Alexander ostrovsky used to play uh like this he is also the manager of the Gotham Knights protestly by our merch Gotham knights.com and he used to uh Gotham that is not our website that is not our website gothammerch.com there's I don't know what the heck you're gonna get on gothamnights.com for legal reasons if you go there you get a virus not my fault uh A4 though from Magnus so he doesn't play this a39c3 plays A4 A4 is already asking a couple of unpleasant questions to the black position taking is silly because white will just recapture look at the size of the evaluation I mean you gain two just from a pawn trade that's insane point is you're gonna go here and here it's very tough to actually stop that and what black just has a very bad position uh you can play B4 uh B4 is fine but white is going to win a lot of light squared Equity with Knight D2 you can play Rook B8 and if you play Rook B8 then after this this white is going to control the a file so instead of all that black goes here thus far he is playing all the best moves um but if at this point Levi was like well look at this I'm equal with Magnus after eight moves you know what he would he would actually be Max Deutsch I guess remember that video oh it was actually doing really well against Magnus in the first eight moves yeah um it's through Lopez like if you're losing an eight moves in the Roy Lopez you should probably take up Checkers or majung Bishop B7 uh intends to defend the rook and obviously uh fight for the center in the future and in this position Magnus officially drops off Levi at the bus station in the bad part of town and drives away in his Ferrari and plays Knight bd2 no one on planet Earth has ever played Knight bd2 before that is an exaggeration but it is significantly more rare than any other move in this position the Knight goes here that is just normally what happens like 90 something percent of the games the night is going there or you start with rookie one Knight bd2 is definitely a sideline and like I said Magnus will happily go with you there but now you're gonna be on your own Knight bd2 by the way you'll notice that Magnus spent five minutes so he didn't spend five minutes because he didn't know what to do he knew absolutely what to do all right he knows all those games but guess what in 2023 even at the rating of 2300 your chess openings rating can be like 2 600. like if you're very well prepared you spend you know five six hours a day on openings opening prep is great what happens when you get out of theory why is the night going to D2 right why is the Knight going to D2 and not C3 like is he not interested in fighting for the D5 square if tonight is going to D2 it's not going to come out there maybe he's gonna rotate it around this way but then what right still like white can get no real Advantage if he doesn't play the move d4 I mean it's not the whole point of the Spanish so what is Magnus going for all right the guy plays D6 now Magnus plays C3 so he doesn't even play rookie one he plays C3 wow okay the idea of C3 is twofold number one you want to prepare D4 but number two you want to bring this bishop back to C2 that's another very important idea and again this might look really stupid but why would white Play Bishop B5 Bishop A4 Bishop B3 Bishop C2 this is why I tell people not to play the Spanish it's not because I mean you can play whatever you want for I don't care all right I I do not care about that stuff whatsoever the same way I don't care about what uh what you what what you wear uh What uh you know religious beliefs and so on I grew up in a very uh tolerant uh household and uh City and so on like just be a good person at the end of the day your actions you know dictate my judgment of you so I don't care if you play the Spanish I don't care if you play the Vienna but it's just why four of your first 11 moves are moving a bishop like like you don't even understand how to play chess but you do it's all meta strategy so Bishop C2 right now you're gonna go here and now black plays this move C5 Knight A5 and C5 is a very well known idea in the Spanish don't worry if you don't know it uh and the point is that you're just kind of fighting against this and maybe you want to play B4 now we see this move rookie one and the idea will be to rotate the Knight to F1 and G3 by the way what type of position is this open or closed it's a closed position how do you know that both sides have eight Pawns you know if a position is closed they're open by buying my middle games master class no just kidding by the amount of Pawns there are because think of Pawns like a fence if both sides have two fences up you're not going to see your neighbor's yard if you have holes in your friends you're going to see plenty of the neighbor's yard right so uh close position Knight F1 and now black has multiple moves uh the move H6 here has been played although it's a very vague move and not really clear why you would play this move but it's actually kind of important to prevent White's Bishop from going to G5 why because it can't really go much much else the bishop on D2 is like not scaring anybody and on E3 the bishop can just be a target for the Knight so I mean also you cannot really play D4 because you significantly destabilize the E4 pawn and also Knight C4 so the bishop doesn't really have a great home anywhere which is why the computer after some thought deliberates and thinks H6 is pretty reasonable uh Levi plays Queen C7 now we have Knight G3 bishop f8 and now we have Bishop G5 and uh the move Bishop f8 the computer did not fully bless uh again it wanted white to I wanted black to go here but it's very difficult to play that move considering Magnus has a couple of very aggressive and just unpleasant ideas coming your way so we have Bishop f8 Bishop G5 and now white is on the verge of actually just straight up winning the game you may say what what are you talking about wait where's the win for white this winning for white on the spot why you shouldn't trade Bishops for nights right more often than not in this case though the opening of the king is Devastation and oops I jumped backwards the opening of the king is Devastation and the light squares are game over Knight H4 you can move your king out of the way I'll play Queen H5 I'll put my knight here I'll bring my Rook nobody can stop mate I've isolated the king I've sealed off the rest of the castle the queen my horses and my tower are now going to beat the king up okay that's what we're gonna do so uh seeing that that is coming uh Levi plays Knight to D7 and Magnus here plays a move none of you could predict uh now if this was classical in like Tata steel I don't know if Magnus would play this move but he plays the move H4 that's that that is a spicy move all right H4 plate I already played it very quickly too computer not blessing it wants him to come back Target that night black can come back black is gonna play D5 H4 and I Gotta Give It Up For My Man Levi here who plays D5 now notice how Magnus played this move H4 in like a minute time he gets 30 seconds when he makes a move but H4 my man Levi got hit with H4 and thought for 13 minutes he was like holy because you just got to make sure you know H4 is not just gonna teleport and take your king like Chad GPT D5 there is a saying in chess okay uh when you are faced with an attack on the edge of the board Strike Back in the center it's almost always a good idea open up that center right start to fight back if Pawn takes D5 we're going Bishop takes life is going to be good Magnus just plays H5 H5 now what would I do here if I was playing Black I'll play H6 I got no plan my plan is you gotta move your bishop and now you can't play H6 I don't know what my plan is after that but I would probably play H6 Levi not sure though uh for the for the folks not uh in that age uh demographic to understand what not shook means a shook means afraid so now you know he's not shook all right so he plays Pawn takes E4 Pawn takes E4 and plays F6 now F6 I can't bless uh and he didn't spend a whole lot of time on that move I mean again it was not too late to go here I don't know why he played F6 and not H6 I think he was just like nah there's no attack also it's the Magnus effect you're playing Magnus I so he plays F6 what's wrong with F6 is that the light squares right it's a massive commitment you now cannot go back here and White's Bishop can just Retreat you don't really have to attack anymore so I'm not really sure what Levi didn't like about this move H6 I haven't had a chance to ask him uh it happens right it's just like a bit of a I get I don't know what my plan is after I'm not saying I would have figured it out but C4 Knight C5 like you have but it's scary listen this is not easy to deal with the engine just goes here like losing a pawn all right and then apparently black is doing well I but F6 is a big commitment right F6 Magnus drops back to E3 now what's juicy that's juicy that's juicy that's juicy that's juicy a lot of Juicy I can already see that being a clip someone's gonna cut out what I just and they're gonna put it out and be like what does levy think about and then that's juicy I mean listen it was all juicy C4 all right black is trying to attack like this here's the problem not only does white now have this Knight H4 Knight F5 uh he also has H6 anytime he wants it now this is again the reason why black had to go here because this move you now do not have Knight H4 and if you play Bishop E3 and try to play Knight H4 I can get to your bishop and the thing is if I can just trade a few of your pieces you ain't attacking anybody all right so that is why it was very important to force the bishop here because when it wasn't forced to go there Here Comes Magnus right literally you just gotta move one Pawn wrong against Magnus and like the whole thing's done he's like a really mean mafioso boss all right you do one small thing you're dead you're you're excluded from the movie they just kill you off Knight C5 and now Queen G4 I told you the queen and the horses right Bishop's got good pressure on everything he would love it if the bishop had x-ray vision uh Knight ab3 and he's like well let's trade Rooks either your Rook goes away or your Bishop slides back in his passive all right you go here terrific let's keep it moving Knight gf5 um the computer here says Bishop takes which what why would you give away the bishop for no reason I it's such a scumbag I I don't even understand Knight gf5 now why would Magnus move this night or not this night if he moves this night this Knight now has no role literally white is stuck so by playing this Knight and getting pinned you still have movement this Knight could potentially go there and that's why you can play moves like H6 if G6 you can always consider sacrificing in fact I'm fairly certain this is going to win you the game I just don't see it yet check you got at least three pawns you're probably gonna win so Bishop C8 Rook D1 yes now activated his Rook on the entire file the Knight the Queen the night this bishop the H Pawn this bishop sucks but whatever I mean can't have everything uh right like that Rook has an open file I hope when we compare the two it's like not similar um Knight E6 back and now now Magnus takes the night now he takes the Knight um what's funny is he thought for 20 minutes here and actually Rook D1 may have been a little bit too slow after 96. I think that's what he realized I mean he's got tons of pressure make no mistake his position's absolutely fantastic but maybe he could have just gone H6 maybe he just could have gone for it of course if G6 you sacrifice right but maybe black is going to take the Knight and if you play Knight takes F5 now suddenly you actually don't have anything to sacrifice so if you can't do that you're gonna go here then I might play G5 and kick you out and I trade your queen maybe I get in here it's right so Magnus decides to do it this way now he gets rid of this and if this gets to an end game he's really screwed because he's gonna lose his pawn and then black is going to promote so he has to win like he has to win by mate so what does the world champion do when he's about to Checkmate somebody he moves his King what King H2 is a crazy move I would never play that my my wildest dreams I would never play that ah yeah I mean of course you know there the engine here shows this I just and and not even Pawn takes not even Pawn takes uh Queen takes with this idea Magnus goes here because he's a human Rook A2 and listen my boy Levi was firing away I mean the machine was saying the position was maybe balanced this is crazy like look at look at my man Levi here I told you if this goes to an end game Magnus is in trouble if the Queens vanish if you even Take Your Eye Off the ball for a moment all right black is getting this that pawn is two squares away from queening this is an incredibly complicated game B4 Magnus plays C4 to make sure the bishop doesn't activate and The Rook still stays defending the pawn now that can be taken it can be taken but black has better moves Queen C4 is a very risky decision and if you do it you kind of take your Queen off of the key defensive squares and you might go down I think the best move here was something like Rook A6 which is just a ridiculous move uh or I think the engine had another idea uh Knight D4 trying to activate the bishop but then white slides out of the PIN and if you take uh I'm gonna you know take with my Pawn or even my knight can consider still jumping in here with Knight G6 very very tense position but again the pawns are stuck if Magnus does not allow black in VIA that b-pawn everything's gonna be fine so we have Queen C4 by Levi who's just like what I'm up a pawn prom up a pawn against Magnus let's go trash that's why he's losing the world championship title Magnus goes Knight H6 Knight G6 and it's plus seven yeah um to be honest with you I'm not exactly sure like Queen C4 I don't know what exactly was missed maybe he just thought he was lost like maybe he was like ah I'm gonna lose it happens I mean he definitely didn't overlook this move he probably just overlooked maybe how powerful it is like maybe he was like oh Knight G6 I just you know I take and then if he but it the game is actually over here Magnus sacrifices a full night uh he's not even got any pawns for it he's just straight up down three points of material but he has calculated successfully that he is completely winning this position because you know what's Unstoppable here H6 H7 mate that is so disgusting because you think you're getting mated with the Knight and the Queen no it's the pawn that walks up and you just cannot move you are sealed off your queen has no access crazy and this is maybe one of the reasons that King H2 needed to be played because imagine a few moves back right like here instead of King H2 uh we got like something I don't know I'm I'm just arbitrarily such just something like this okay do you know why the king had to be on H2 this man Magnus is a is a genius why does the king have to be on H2 because after a check I'm actually getting to your king H6 check here and uh you're never mating me and uh yeah ridiculous right so he had to move his King out of the way because he anticipated all of that that's so St I mean that's so scummy I mean are you kidding me so he sacrifices the night and that's it there is just no way for black to deal with this without catastrophic material loss so he plays Rook A7 he sacrifices The Rook I'm not gonna yell it because it's a defensive measure Magnus comes back with the Knight would check and just slides in the queen and uh he doesn't have to do this he could have uh kept his foot on the gas could have played Queen E8 tried to beat things up but he just goes here and with the Queen's off Knight D6 and um it's it's smooth sailing the only reason this is smooth sailing is because Black's b-pawns are totally stuck so Bishop C5 Knight B7 a very nice idea Rook d8 coming in this is gonna come back and he's gonna win these two pawns this Knight is stranded from the game Rook check Bishop takes B4 and uh Rook D1 and Rook D1 is a very nice idea simultaneously attacking the bishop on C1 and threatening Knight d8 a gorgeous move uh Rook d8 King here there were some other cool ideas like getting the Rook out of the way and Knight d8 would have been a mate like uh here here 98 that would have been cool knight d8 checkmate uh but Rook D1 and unfortunately as good of a fight as Levi put up he was unable to preserve uh the uh though they wasn't unable to secure the victory against arguably the goat so both Levy and Levi are now unsuccessful in their campaigns against Magnus Carlson but a very interesting game listen this guy should uh should be very very happy with this game uh of course it's maybe no consolation of you when you lose but 20 28 29 moves it was a very complex fight very complex fight and when Magnus has to show this type of you know creativity and Excellence to mate you with a pawn while sacrificing material and preparing a king move I mean this whole attack started with the King evacuating like come on this is some genius stuff really really spectacular um and yeah that's Magnus versus Levi and uh maybe tomorrow or the next day I will make a recap of magnus's two final games of being the world champion after that he's just gonna be the highest rated player in the world So speaking of uh there being Champions that might not be Champions you have seized tonight so I will be watching Jones gun don't know who's gonna win obviously Jones a very controversial individual uh not the best individual uh I'm gonna watch that fight speaking of Champions that stepped away from the sport so you didn't have to know that but now you do get out of here
