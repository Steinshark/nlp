there is absolutely no mechanical connection between this steering wheel and the front wheels of this car this is something basically unheard of in the production car World steer by wire hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be deep diving into Lexus new steering system and we're going to focus on five major questions how does it work why no seriously why is it safe answering all of your what ifs why is Lexis yoke okay but Tesla's was a bad idea and finally what are the disadvantages of this system because I did notice some flaws so let's start at the very beginning when you steer a car today there is a direct mechanical linkage which passes from the steering wheel to the steering rack when you rotate the steering wheel this rotates the steering shaft which rotates a pinion which forces the steering rack to move left to right which pulls on tie rods ultimately pivoting your wheels in the vast majority of modern car hours this process is electronically assisted with an electric motor either mounted in line with the steering column or mounted separately to the rack providing assist so it's easy to turn the wheels which is especially important at low speeds like parking with steer by wire as seen here with the Lexus rz450e that steering shaft does not exist when you turn the steering wheel a sensor sees how much you've turned the wheel and a controller then tells a motor on the steering rack how much to turn the front wheels this is all done electronically now I can already hear the sound of a thousand keyboards typing how unsafe this is so chill out for a second as we'll get to that you might wonder how does the driver feel anything well in many ways it's a lot like a driving simulator except your feedback is a response to real forces that are influencing the front wheels the electric motor on the steering rack is called the steering control actuator which senses the forces coming from the road surface to the tires this information is then sent to an electric motor mounted in the steering column called the steering torque actuator this motor is what provides feedback to the driver whether that's a varying Force as you navigate a corner or the vibrations from a rough road surface or a lightened feel if the front end loses grip like on snow or ice it can mimic the real feedback of a traditional steering system because it can send whatever forces are felt by the steering rack right to the steering wheel so now that we understand how it works the big question is why what's the point well I was able to chat with one of the lead Engineers responsible for the Lexus rz450e and his response to this question delighted me he explained to me the logic as follows as the automotive World transitions to electrified Vehicles response has increased and not only with throttle but braking as well it's well established that electric motors are much quicker to react than combustion engines when you press the go pedal the torque can be instant something that's essential really impossible for combustion engines to do so with electrified Vehicles we have better throttle response with regen braking in other words using electric motors to slow the car we also have improved response and braking as it happens as soon as you lift your foot on the accelerator pedal a small amount instead of after you've transferred to the brake pedal so with responsive braking and with an insanely responsive accelerator pedal the only lacking element here is steering steering response is ultimately limited by the steering ratio a high steering ratio means you have to turn the wheel a lot in order to get the car to turn a low steering ratio means you turn the steering wheel less corresponding to the front wheels turning a lot so the shorter your steering ratio the more responsive your steering is because it takes less hand movement to rotate the front wheels it's a simple fact that less hand movement is faster so the response of short ratio steering systems is quicker well there's two big problems here first if you use a short steering ratio steering is difficult and requires a lot of effort but this can be overcome with steering assist systems the second problem though which can't be overcome with traditional steering systems is that if you have a short steering ratio at highway speeds the car is super Twitchy and it creates a stability problem for drivers with the drive by wire system the steering ratio can be whatever you want whenever you want under whatever conditions you want this gives an incredible amount of design flexibility for engineers at low speeds you can make the steering really responsive with a short ratio at highway speeds you can dull the response using a higher ratio allowing for better stability and you can create a smooth transition in the steering ratio from low to high vehicle speeds so that's the response story but there are other advantages of steer by wire as well from a packaging standpoint the steering wheel location is much more flexible it can be raised and legroom is freed up because you don't have a steering shaft going from the wheel to the steering rack tall folks will find this welcome the design also allows for a steering yoke rather than a traditional wheel since the steering ratio is adjustable this means you never have to use hand over hand motion and never have to take either hand off the wheel to maneuver an idea that's popular in racing this differs greatly from Tesla's design which we'll touch on later the Yoke also frees up visibility as it obstructs much less of your view again for the tall folks often the top of the steering wheel can block important Dash information even at the highest height adjustment not the case here it also allows for cool camera shots though I'm not suggesting we start designing Interiors for the purposes of YouTubers finally steerby wire offers a more comfortable steering experience enthusiasts plug your ears as I'm aware you prefer any and all feedback not everyone drives their car for fun most don't and most just want a pleasant experience steer by wire means you can choose what feedback you want the steering wheel to convey and what you don't Lexis says lower frequency Road inputs aren't necessary for example going over a pothole the steering wheel would typically Lurch with harsh feedback now it's mellowed out but let's say you're on a wet Road or snowy Road frictional information how much grip you have still passes through if the front tires lose grip in the snow there's a drop in the force at the steering rack this immediately translates to the steering actuator so the driver feels the loss of Tire grip the key Advantage here is Engineers can choose what feedback passes through which opens up huge possibilities for different steering modes so we understand the why but is it actually safe I think there are two main what-ifs that cover most of the scenarios you're likely to be curious about first what if the car loses power second what if a critical steering component fails so let's start with a loss of power you might be surprised to learn there are essentially three power sources for the system you have the main battery which Powers the onboard 12 volt battery and then you have an additional backup battery in case the original 12 volt battery fails so in the event that the vehicle's main battery were to lose power you have two power sources that can continue to provide steering even if as you're going down the road the vehicle appears to be off okay so redundancy minimizes the concern with the loss of power but what if the steering control actuator were to fail if that motor doesn't work you lose steering right once again much like in the aviation World redundancy is the solution while it looks like a single motor inside the housing are two Motors in fact all of the critical components are redundant sensors controllers yes there are even two motors used to provide feedback for the driver inside a single housing in the event that a component fails you get a warning so that you can stop them vehicle safely and get it serviced in addition while this technology may sound new and scary it really isn't we already have throttle by wire essentially every modern engine uses an electronic throttle a technology that goes back to the 1980s in production cars we also already have brake by wire and in fact we already have steerby wire used for rear wheel steering in cars so while this particular application is pretty new the tech is well established speed speaking of tech Tesla they put a yoke in the model S and it made a lot of noise in the car World there was a lot of disapproval and thankfully it wasn't too long until Tesla went back to offering normal steering wheels as an option worth mentioning Lexus will initially sell the rz-450e with a traditional mechanically linked steering system and later offered the Yoke with steer by wire as an option the reason why folks didn't like what Tesla did was very simple hand over hand turning doesn't make any sense with a yoke parking in sharp low-speed Corners are unnecessarily complicated there's a reason why wheels are circular okay but they get away with yoke steering wheels in Formula One so what's the deal well these steering wheels have much shorter steering ratios the Lexus yoke rotates 150 degrees in either direction until you reach a hard stop so you have 300 degrees of total steering wheel rotation versus about 840 degrees of rotation in the Tesla or 2.33 three turns lock to lock hand over hand makes no sense on a yoke and Lexus eliminates the need to do it by using a very low steering ratio at low vehicle speeds okay so why can't Tesla just eliminate hand over hand movement with a low steering ratio steering rack as you reach higher vehicle speeds like driving on the highway a very short ratio steering rack means a super Twitchy vehicle the steering would feel far too sensitive to most drivers and you'd end up with unstable Maneuvers as a result posing a safety concern now modern variable steering ratio cars can try to address this but ultimately you're mechanically Limited in design since the steering wheel is directly connected to the steering rack Lexis design avoids this problem entirely and enables responsive steering at low speeds while increasing the ratio at higher speeds in very small increments as you increase in vehicle speed so that it feels natural and you don't run into unstable steering at highway speeds Formula One driver first get away with these super short purely mechanical steering ratios because unlike the rest of us they're actually good drivers and they can handle the increased steering sensitivity also props to Lexus for still including so many physical controls and stocks on the steering wheel turn signals wipers lights cruise control not everything needs to be a touch screen finally let's talk bad news overall the system is very well thought out but a few things stick out to me as flaws First Response and I have to give Lexis credit here because they absolutely have the right approach it's just the execution is a little off you see if you happen to be on the highway and wildly jerk the wheel One Direction or the other it's completely possible for a steer by wire system to have a controller that says Nope your input was too aggressive we're not going to allow it think of it like traction control but instead of preventing wheel spin from acceleration they prevent you from steering inputs that ruin your stability of course stability control will do it's best to help prevent you from spinning but Lexus will absolutely allow for idiotic steering inputs you want to flail away on the highway go ahead you're in control you get to decide whether you crash or not Lexis isn't going to interfere but and it's a big but the response actually isn't as perfect as Lexis States remember how they said they wanted steering response to match that of electronic throttle and braking well it's worth mentioning this car does have a noticeable throttle delay and it doesn't have true one pedal driving but the bigger issue as you can tell from this video there's actually a small delay between the steering wheel position and the front wheels there are two ways you can verify this first once my hands stop rotating the steering wheel to the left you can see the front wheels continue to rotate second you can see that if I screen grab the frame from a quick rotation from left to right versus when the steering wheel is just held straight ahead steering wheels both have the same orientation but the front wheel is still slightly to the left from my quick turn this proves there is a delay between the commanded request and that request being executed now there's a point worth mentioning this is a pre-production prototype I can't tell you how it will be in production because that card doesn't exist yet Perhaps the response will improve which I hope is the case as it stands currently a mechanical steering system has less Delay from steering input to execution and the other thing is I'm pretty convinced folks will either really like or really dislike this kind of steering it's super sensitive at low speeds to be honest I liked it but I also like highly sensitive accelerator pedals and brake pedals with little travel I got used to it very quickly but in the hands of a different driver it could feel very Twitchy as an analogy if you're the kind of person who cranks your mouse or video game controller sensitivity all the way up you'll probably like it if you're messing around on the other end it's probably not for you there's one more brain stretch you'll encounter as well a completely variable steering ratio means the same steering wheel angle doesn't always correlate to the same wheel rotation there's a curve with sensitive steering at low speeds and more dulled steering at high speeds again I found it easy and intuitive but I also love things like one pedal driving where regen varies depending on vehicle speed battery temperature and battery state of charge a lot of people don't want all of this complexity they want everything to feel the same always and here it simply doesn't to sum this all up I think the technology is cool I like that it exists as an option and I don't see any reason to doubt its reliability from an engineering standpoint from a driving standpoint I really think it's going to come down to the individual on whether or not you like it how do you feel questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
