[Music] all right jimmy so we're both creators yeah both make videos i think we have a lot in common but i also think there are a lot of big differences between our channels and our workflows and how we do things you don't bury yourself alive so i got 20 questions for you let's do it all right first one what's the first app you open on your phone in the morning i love how we just jumped right into this um definitely twitter twitter yeah okay i wouldn't recommend but that's what i do if you're ever at like a i don't know barber shop or in the back of an uber or something like that and somebody asks you what you do how do you answer that question oh well if i'm in the back of an uber i lie i just said work at mcdonald's because i you know i don't want to drop me off in my house and be like yo i know where a youtuber lives right true do you have like like there's usually follow-up questions you ever like say what you do and then have to sort of explain it yeah so i guess i typically just describe it as i like to give away money while torturing myself and occasionally torturing my friends and then just doing whatever random weird things pop in my head that's gonna get some follow-up questions yeah for sure i just say i'm a video producer and usually that sort of cafe you're basically no you're the video producer that decides what tech everyone in america buys that's what you are i mean you're too humble to say that but like half the time i watch his videos and i just leave and go buy stuff so we're sitting here in uh part of the semi deconstructed squid game set from the video you did on top of a bunch of money you're sitting on about two hundred thousand dollars we haven't sent it to them yet it's casual um you said before in a video that you you didn't tell your parents when you started making your channel and then you found it at like 10 000 subscribers same i didn't tell my parents about it they found it when they did find it how do they react and like what's the difference between then when they found it and yeah when all this is going on well my mom was like oh my gosh she's not crazy because she would always think i was just talking to random people in my room or just like talking to myself when i was like recording videos so she she kind of had a hunch and then she's like but why and she's like your your grades suck can we like start spend more time on school less on videos and i was like no i want to spend less time on school and more time on videos so my mom just wanted what was best for me but it was pretty brutal at the start because i was doing bad in school and i literally would just stay up all night making youtube videos but then i think there was a moment where we did a brand deal that was basically more than her entire salary and that was kind of when it switched and she was like you know what you keep doing you actually how about can i join you yeah mom come join us now she loves it obviously you know not because she's money hungry she just didn't want me to end up you know working at a fast food restaurant which you know i mean if this didn't work out i don't i don't know what else i would have ended up doing was that the money comfy sitting on 200 i've never sat on 200 grand so i didn't have like here put your feet over there now you'll be on there okay 400 grand is that more comfy that is more confident don't rob us we have security okay so you've counted to a hundred thousand yes you said pewdiepie a hundred thousand times i did it and logan paul a hundred thousand times you uh completed a mile in the world's largest shoes yep what's the hardest challenge you've ever done physically speaking the hardest challenge uh surprisingly none of those is actually when i buried myself alive that was yeah i buried myself live for 50 hours i'm sure footage on screen it was it was brutal because i'll be honest coffins aren't comfortable and my back was hurting and like 30 hours in i was like i almost got out like even just thinking about it makes me almost tear up it was so painful on my back i feel like you should collaborate with david blaine at some point because all of his stunts are somewhere on the borderline of like how much can you actually physically tolerate yeah that spectacle is just as weirdly enough when i did that we were in contact and then since then we haven't talked but david if you see this please let's do something okay so if you had to guess how many cameras are on the entire campus for all of the channels oh god you run ballpark you have to put in a number well so there's videos like last take handoff lamborghini where we put 50 people's hands on a lamborghini and in that video we had to get like 50 of these so we could zoom in and monitor every hand and then if you turn the camera there's uh videos where we do hide and see sometimes with dozens of people and so they each need a handheld and then other videos we need like 50 gopros i mean we're probably up to like 250 300 cameras but i was going to guess it was higher i think i guess like i'm trying to be conservative but yeah yeah it's uh it's crazy but it's not like we're just buying them to buy them it's just like certain videos literally need like 50 to 60 cameras at certain times i just like we just buy cameras and they sit here and then when we need them we just grab them that's the way to go that's the way to go yeah i personally i don't like like super high quality cameras i prefer to look a little more amateur so i've been using like these g7xs and like average stuff for like a very long time 24 or 30 fps a 30. okay yeah there it is yeah 24 is like your your career is fading like you're you know you're you're trying to get into movies and some of that that never works kidding i hope you don't do 24. i do 30. okay okay so i read somewhere i think you said you've gone through a dictionary and would just like pick random words to see if you can find good video ideas in there it works actually better than you would think you still do that yeah yeah so basically it's not just a dictionary it's you you want to take in inspiration and then see what pops in your head so say a random word anywhere something you don't think i will think you're gonna say mannequins okay we'll just make his pipes okay so can can a million mannequins stop a car can uh ten thousand mannequins stop a tank right or uh what happened i hate to make them all the same but what if you put a million mannequins on train tracks and try to hit it with the train what happens yeah it seems like something you could pull off i the hard part is like what makes it a good like compelling video because exactly people will be curious but what makes it really good is a challenge well and that's the thing but the point is you you take in random inspiration you see what pops in your head you write them down and then usually one out of every 100 is good and so that's why i like to flip to the dictionary all right so you know how spotify does that rap thing every year where they'll show you like all the artists and yeah you listen to the most yeah if youtube did a wrapped for you oh my gosh who would be the most viewed channels that you watch marquez bradley marquez brown oh that's nice but who else hmm i'm gonna need like 10 seconds to think take your time you have to build your own raft this is something i think they should actually do by the way i agree i mean it's obvious i don't know why they don't youtube are screwing up i mean 90 of people watch this won't even know these channels but i love wendover production polymatter like people that just make videos like it sounds dumb but like why uh global shipping is easier than manufacturing domestically or or like things like that or like um what sort of edu splainer type yeah exactly or like mark rover veritasium i love learning things because it's you know i'm not helping myself here but i i don't like when i spend a couple hours on youtube and i don't really walk away with much so i try to like really watch and click on videos that teach me stuff so when i do go on youtube it's like all videos that i learned all right so i remember when the first youtube channel hit a million subscribers fred right it was a huge deal it was for it i was gonna ask you if you knew but of course you knew yeah and then i remember the first one to hit 10 million i don't know that one ray ray william johnson smosh oh that's right yeah 10 million and then obviously pewdiepie got to 100 million and it's just crazy scale and just keeps getting bigger and bigger yeah you've said before your goal is to hit 100 million subscribers yeah i feel like you have a pretty good shot at making that happen we're basically there yeah on the way what how do you set goals for yourself as a creator for your channel yeah assuming you do hit 100 million do you set another goal what exactly i got it i love this question so back in the day my goals used to be very subscriber based or view based but one thing i've learned and i think you've probably learned this as well it's like everything you want as a youtube creator every freaking goal you want to hit whether it be subscribers you want to hit a million or 10 million or whatever will come if you just make the best videos possible so my goal and this is what it will be until the day i die is to make the best youtube videos possible and so if my hypothetical goal was 300 million subscribers in 10 years that will happen if i just make the best videos possible my goal is to get 50 million views of video that will happen if i just make the best whatever it is you know just focus on making the best videos possible and all these other vanity arbitrary metrics will just fall into play i don't mean that in an arrogant way but that's just kind of like the mindset you have to have like go hard and believe in yourself you know okay so you've had a lot of interesting ideas for videos yes i wonder how many of them you've probably said this before but how many of them do you scrap after you started them before they're done oh gosh um so probably one out of every four videos being a filming end up getting scrapped because like i'll give you an example right climbing a wall with plungers seems like a cool idea yeah and then you get hundreds of plungers you get the strongest plungers in the world you hire engineers and you realize you can't climb a wall with plungers and so then it gets scrapped or you know we made the world's largest cookie and we were going to try to eat it but then you know you get in the weeds and you're like wait a minute eating that much sugar is probably not good for you yeah and so then it's like ops kill it um and so it's one of those things where you know i'm 23 i haven't done a lot of these things and so while i'm doing it i learn stuff and i'm like oh that's not what i thought okay this is a quick one why do you have the world's largest iphone and i don't um i don't know i just saw it on ebay look cool is it it does it works it works i'm so glad this isn't my town i thought you just docked me comment down below if you think he should switch his normal phone to the world's largest iphone for a month and vlog it i think that would be such a good video a month a month give him give me a week i'll do a week two weeks take her or leave it right if he doesn't so here's one how do you decide what to say yes to because that's what you have the ability if you want to pick up the phone and make any video you want happen i mean there's yeah that's being built for the most insane ideas i've ever seen yeah how do you set because most of it is how you decide on the guess yeah well so video specifically it's uh it's pretty simple what what makes the best video possible i mean like i hate to keep coming back to this point but that's all that matters what makes the best video possible what will people enjoy the most what's something original unique blah blah you know that they've never seen before and that's that's kind of really yeah yeah i mean like it's not money i don't care to make money i literally look at this you think this is profitable on a youtube channel it's not money it's not really time or effort it's really just whatever's the best video that's what i want to do and i think as long as that's your standard like everything else just falls into place as a youtuber so i feel like the squid games video was sort of a a long time in the making or almost like a master which by the way if you hear background noises because they're tearing down the sets of squid game so we're literally in the middle of it i don't know that's we're in one of the squid game rooms as they're tearing down the other ones i wanted to move around it's my fault but uh do you have a new grail video that you want to make sure i do some like super high-end production that you've been dreaming of making that you can't wait to yeah so i basically i want to take everything i learned from squid game and apply it to this other idea but if i told you i legit would have to kill you okay tell me i'll bleep it out okay so basically i want to do do you think it could be bigger than squid game though i think it could yeah it depends on when you do it but yes yeah i mean it's gonna take like six months yeah bet okay make sure he blurs that it'll be a really long bleep all right i'm a reviewer but i gotta ask you yeah for a little review can you review youtube give me a rating of the whole platform on a scale from one attempt uh i mean i'm incredibly biased uh a hundred out of ten because it changed my life and gave me everything i ever wanted well see that's dangerous because youtube needs a little bit of competition needs a little bit of like reasoning i don't know i'm pretty happy i think things are fine youtube gets rid of the dislike counter on all videos yeah they make decisions sometimes are a little bit head scratchers do you feel like well first of all what do you think of the dislike counter disappearing i see that's where it's one of those things where i don't know if there's a right answer because i do know that people were you know targeting certain groups of people or races of people and bombing them with dislikes or using it to abuse people and there were services where you could buy a bunch so in a way it was being used to silence people and harassment but they're also good ways it's a good signal to show videos crappy or there's mention of information and so i don't know i i lean towards i think dislikes aren't that good overall but i also see why they had to get rid of it because you know it's one of those tough things where i think no matter what there's not really a right answer here's one what do you miss about old youtube old youtube there's a lot of relics a lot of throwbacks and stuff i do miss that back in the day you can be a little bit more edgier i do yeah i think like you know it would be cool to see someone see if like um i don't know like um a million legos could like stop a bear for the gal or something like that like whereas i feel like videos like that like that aren't necessarily bad but just because it has a gun like i don't feel like the times have changed yeah for sure exactly i kind of there's also like ui things like i look at a screenshot of old youtube and i immediately like think of the videos i was watching back then i don't know if you have that like oh this was the era of the ray william johnson same yeah ray william johnson call of duty commentaries like woody's camera tag and all those guys we're running out of places we're uh we're in front of a dumpster yeah for this next one uh we're joined by this dumpster here so uh there's a lot of space inside and outside for a lot of people working on a lot of different things yep how many people are on the team currently do you have to ballpark something like that i mean that's top secret information we'll just say that it's been going up quite a bit i mean obviously we went from videos back in the day where it was just me and chris and we would just react to stuff to now you know with squid game we had to build eight full hollywood level production sets and yeah i mean on that video alone we probably had 300 different people working on it like at least 150 just contractors alone building stuff you know 20 editors 20 plus camera people stuff like that so um i mean they're getting pretty huge yeah there's a lot that goes into it but thankfully we have this dumpster to film in front of all right in 30 seconds or less we've had team trees yeah it was an incredible success yeah it's still going why should the internet care about team c's well i mean if you care about the ocean you should care about team seas because basically for every dollar we raise the ocean conservancy and ocean cleanup have agreed to remove one pound of trash or plastic from the ocean and we're trying to remove 30 million pounds of trash or plastic from the ocean before the end of the year and i know i sound like a salesman but like i mean i don't know why would you not care it's a pretty great pitch though yeah exactly but also at the same time like it's not the end-all be-all it's not going to fix all our issues i think it's just a way to show that you know the younger generation cares and we want to make a change and like you know these little things add up right yes this one thing might not you know make a huge dent but if 100 of them happen and inspires people to build new technology or to use you know metal whatever water bottles and stuff plastic water bowls it all adds up so it's really just about you know making a little dent and inspiring the younger generation to do good perfect it's not necessarily about the 30 million pounds it's about the inspiration it's about the positive net influence of people coming together and demonstrating something powerful so yeah and just showing that people care honestly honest thoughts on youtube rewind should they bring it back is it retired forever yeah how do you feel about real definitely retired forever should not bring back the thing is youtube's massive right like dude there's a giant community that speaks spanish there's a giant community and even like southeast asia and like there's so many different communities on youtube that you have never heard of none of them have ever heard of because we speak english we don't speak their language like i think back in the day it was perfect because it was there you know when smosh did 10 million there wasn't many channels with 10 million right it was a different era but i think youtube's gotten so ginormous that it is impossible that i think you should do a rewind for tech i think whatever like someone in the beauty community should do a rewind for the beauty community and i think like that's what should happen it should it should definitely just get passed down to the creators to represent their own communities because they know it better than anyone all right jimmy last question oh boy what's the best advice you've ever gotten the best advice he just hit me i thought we were gonna switch places um i think one thing that i like that helped me is uh you're you're crazy until you're successful then you're a genius and i think for a lot of people when you know you're grinding as a small channel people think you're too obsessed you're a weirdo stop only making videos like get alive be realistic you're you know i mean people will convince you you're out of your mind for wanting to to do this but then once you're successful they're like yo your drive your tenacity was great but it's like yeah well where was that back then you know i didn't get that when i was a small channel and so i think you're crazy until you're successful then you're a genius and with it keep it up if you're if you're a creator watching this which i feel like there's going to be some of them out there like if you want to take any inspiration from this video that's kind of part of it number one make videos that you'd want to watch that's for me number two make the best videos you possibly can and eventually that's a great thing to aspire to anyway and then keep at it thanks for watching catch you guys later can we do this peace oh i beat them
