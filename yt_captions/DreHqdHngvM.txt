ladies and gentlemen it's currently late March 2024 and Magnus Carlson is no longer the world chess champion now he is kind of he's the world champion in Rapid chess and Blitz chess which are fast time controls he's also the number one ranked player in the world but he's not the world champion you see in classical chess and we got a little weird thing going on here um is not the world champion dingly Ren won the World Chess Championship against yanon machine the year 2023 and the interesting thing is Magnus and ding have not played a regular chess game against each other since ding took magnus's title until now in today's video I'm not just going to be sharing one game I'm going to be sharing two games that Magnus and ding played at the granka chess classic being held in caros that I think that's how you pronounce it in Germany and also for being such amazing people and clicking on this video I'm going to include another bonus game so you didn't know that now you clicked and then here you are uh you know clickbait has multiple forms but this one's going to be a positive one cuz I will be throwing one in like a buy one get one free except you don't have to buy anything uh yeah these two are playing what's called Fast classical uh classical chess is generally 90-minute chess or 2hour chess this is fast classical just add a fast to anything and that's what you're going to get uh so they're playing 45-minute chess which is pretty rare at the elite level and they played two games against each other and I'm going to show them to you Magnus opens up with the revenge tour against ding L Ren by playing the move d4 I mean ding has his title it must be really weird for these two to be sitting across each other and ding's like I'm the World Champ now cuz you didn't play and Magnus is like but I'm you know what's funny if you go to Magnus Carlson's Twitter like twitter.com Magnus Carlson or however you would do it uh for like a year after his world championship His Banner said World chess champion he finally changed it to him and uh Pep Guardiola but uh yeah for a long time it still said World chess champion so this game opens with a completely standard Queen's Gambit uh it did not exactly start as a Queen's Gambit it started with these two mov mov but Knight F6 is a very popular choice and then you make a decision on the second move and it gets weird really early cuz Magnus doesn't play E3 he doesn't play Knight C3 he actually takes the pawn on D5 and the reason for that is I think after Knight C3 there are a lot of forcing lines for black one of which being this move C5 which nowadays really kills all the fun uh so Magnus takes on D5 himself clarifies the structure now we're playing what's known as The Exchange Queen's Gambit declined because you played a Queen's Gambit declined and then you exchange pawns chess is not really rocket science or particularly all that difficult we have Knight C3 and now Bishop F4 so not Bishop to G5 generally this is the more active Square for the bishop because it pins the Knight to the queen but both guys move their Bishops out and actually if you look at not just the database but you look at you know everything Bishop F5 is a is a perfectly reasonable move but it has one small drawback it's very very very minuscule but this is the way Magnus Carlson plays chess frequently by move seven and eight he has taken both players out of their comfort zone he's taken both players out of known Theory uh he doesn't play the main lines and he does that on purpose he does that to hit people with moves like Knight to H4 you'll notice he's he's above 45 minutes that's not cuz he's a Time Lord hacker or Doctor Strange uh you get bonus time every time you make a move and he's not thinking basically he kind of lull dingly ran into playing symmetrically and now he's going to go after his Bishop this this is the way he creates imbalances so players at that level don't have an internal mental database that they can parse through ding plays Bishop E4 you'll notice he does it after two minutes of thought Bishop E4 is a provocation you either want white to go here which would in the future open up this and actually is a losing mistake uh or you want white to play F3 and then the signs are having a silent debate and that's really all chess is I've said this before chess is simply a silent de debate of who's the bigger idiot you know will white get an advancement here with the pawns or is white weakening his King both things could be true G4 right now both guys have started thinking ding plays Bishop E7 and Magnus takes he did in fact secure the bishop ding has a bunch of Pawns on light squares and Magnus has a little bit of a space Advantage now a very big question will D Castle or will he try to Castle the other way if he castles short Magnus next move is Pawn to H4 his next move after that is long castle and then he's going to go H5 and the gloves are off uh the world champion and the not world champion but kind of still world champion who didn't lose his title he's still the world champion in two formats and technically the world number one he's just not the world champion because the world champion is the guy who wins the classical World Championship in chess even though you could win the classical World Championship in Chess By winning the rapid tiebreak of the classical World Championship but then you would I think we might need a system overhaul in chess anyway this doesn't happen and instead of that Ding instead of castling long and getting into a fight decides I'm going to put my knight on E6 and I'm going to make all the necessary preparations to Castle that way I'm going to Castle on the same side as Magnus so that we do not attack each other on opposite flanks that was expertly done by ding I mean honestly his position was kind of passive and not massive he rotates the Knight to the middle he tries to trade tries to trade again and this would just simply be bad for white I mean you're just allowing black to activate pieces so Magnus goes Bishop E1 and both guys Castle now Magnus still plays H4 because well actually the pawn was attack three times and there it's not and now King B8 and now it's a really big question of like what is white going to do well he plays Rook G1 okay uh Rook G1 both pawns are protected so G4 and H4 both protected maybe you're going to advance maybe you'll play F4 in the future uh but it's still very very like dink just plays A6 and like I said dink doesn't have a light squared Bishop he has six out of seven pawns on light squares so his light squares have been weakened by the non-existence of a light squared Bishop but he's very strong and on the light squares because he replaced a bunch of the BS and he's just he's kind of going to sit here he's going to be like come and get me and here what the computer wants what the computer wants not what Magnus did is to play Bishop D3 once's Bishop D3 so that if black ever plays this move C5 you go G5 C takes D4 e takes D4 if Knight takes D4 attacking the queen both Knights are hanging so you can't quite do that and after Knight H5 you take on D5 so it's really difficult for black to play a move like C5 because G5 destabilizes the center and if black just plays something like King here the computer wants F4 and to go like this Magnus plays Rook G2 this move is mysterious I guess it's trying to rotate over maybe it's trying to go here and push maybe it's I I not exactly sure but ding now doesn't wait anymore he realizes that if Magnus himself can play the moves G5 or F4 he's going to have a very good position so he strikes he doesn't allow Magnus to take advantage and the second Magnus locks things up he plays C5 it's a daring way for ding to play it really is because Magnus is quite strong in the center and you would think you're always taunt the person with the two Bishops wants the open position so why would black open the position for white well the truth is the more moves that black makes that don't do anything white is just going to very slowly methodically like improve his position play Knight A4 and at some point make a breakthrough like either with his pawns or his Knight or somebody so ding doesn't wait he plays G5 C5 world champion not world champion world number one doesn't really matter Pawn takes C5 Bishop takes C5 and now a big moment and Magnus goes here losing the pawn in the center of his position choosing not to protect it instead choosing Queen B3 with an attack on the bishop a pin on the pawn a threat on the A6 pawn and the opportunity to rotate the Rook so a lot of ideas here flowing in the white position ding plays the best move Pawn to D4 well timed anchoring in the bishop just disallowing white from targeting the center pawn and anchoring in that defensive piece knight C5 possible Knight D5 on the heels of that move this Knight will come to F4 the Rooks can still double up and help and uh Magnus plays Rook C2 Queen D6 and I mean I got to tell you visually this does look very menacing I mean white has a lot of pieces but here ding plays a gangster move and you got to give respect where it's due if ding here played a move like Rook C8 that loses because you take the Rook then you take the bishop they can't take because of this okay but that's simple right that's fair enough so you can't you know what about Rook D7 then I would have went Knight B6 so you can't go here or here so you're going to go there no because then I still take the bishop so what do you looks like you're just losing right no no the best move in this position dingly Ren sacrifices you guessed it The Rook I'm not going to yell it because it's a defensive sacrifice but he just gives up The Rook completely and he realizes something called relative value his Bishop is so good and when Magnus has to give away his dark sored Bishop all he has to show at the end of this attack is a queenless position ding throws in the zishan Zug they're in Germany of course right you got to throw in the zishan Zug on the autoban while you eat some bradfor okay I'm going to stop uh and now black has a dark squared bishop and a very strong Pawn he has six pawns and Magnus does have a very active position but black is so strong on these dark squares you can't break through in a position with no Pawn Mobility which white does not have he's not going to be doing very well and all of a sudden I mean my man ding look at this Anchorage Alaska look at this position he completely switched the complex I mean it was a position of light squared pawns we go back to the opening six out of seven pawns on the light squares we go forward like 105 moves the whole thing changed ding's position morphs into a full dark squared blockade Magnus keeps trying ding puts another Pawn on a dark Square it's now it went from six out of seven light to five out of six dark fascinating I mean seriously all of them on dark squares six for six a full complex change and guess what Magnus has to sacrifice his Rook back he gives up the rook and they go straight to a opposite colored Bishop endgame but this is simply a draw the only way that white can win this is by winning that pawn and then promoting and that's not going to happen because of Bishop C1 so King C4 King C7 King D5 King D7 very important by the way because now after you take this I will take this and then I will never lose either of my pawns King E7 very well timed uh important that Bishop takes B2 actually does more harm than good because after Bishop F6 you lose because I play H6 so you have to be very very very careful with these outside passers but uh dingl Ren is the world champion and that is not you know that is not a reference to he just defends both his pawns and if Magnus gives away his H Pawn he will absolutely never accomplish anything so instructed the way ding did that completely seamlessly effortlessly ran his King it was very important that he ran his King some of you may be wondering why he didn't go here that's because he would lose the race and I told you the only way to lose the game is to lose this pawn and that is why ding had to bring his King very accurate defensive technique put the King on the f8 Square doesn't matter if your opponent is the best in game player of all time what a what a game by Ding and they drew they drew a rook sacrifice completely neutralizing magnus's initiative yeah very nice I mean that that that that's what we're talking about and um listen like 5 years ago Magnus did say that one of the biggest threats and only threats to him was was Ding and those were the days those were the days when 37 people watched chess and all of us sat in a dark room somewhere saying nobody should play this game and now the entire world is playing so thank you be for being a part of the Chess World I'm not saying that time was better I'm just saying that's how it was like 46 people watch the world championship yeah and there's like 198 countries or something I mean seriously I'm kidding but they played again that I'm not kidding about and this game Magnus went for an opening called The Bozo Indian it's called the BOGO Indian but I really like to call it the bozo Indian because if you don't know what a bozo is great word most of you qualify for that status um normally in this move order black plays D5 we just saw that I don't know if you were paying attention but same opening right potentially uh but if you don't go D5 you can play the Queen's Indian you can also play the Boni you can play the you know the the delayed Bon Cloud whatever you want to do Bishop B4 The Bozo Indian uh dingl Ren plays Bishop D2 not the most common way to play but you just trade the bishop also important to say taking the bishop is not the most common way to play like sometimes black defends the bishop so Magnus decides to play it like this like I said Magnus likes to take people out of their comfort zone ding playing in a relatively passive way he's playing in a relatively uneventful fashion and we have a we have another exchange Queen's pawn and probably ding expected Eed Knight C3 C5 Maybe by Magnus and putting the knights and this is a very standard position Magnus doesn't do that c takes D5 he takes with the Knight that's interesting so he wants the bishop open he wants to move the Knight out of the way and then he wants the bishop to open up because if he took with the pawn he wouldn't have been able to get that Knight three what ding wants is he wants Magnus to take so he could either take with the queen to apply pressure to this pawn and disallow it to move forward I mean even BC is interesting to have a strong Center to play A4 A5 potentially but Queen C3 is better so Knight takes D5 Knight C3 right Knight D7 okay very interesting position maybe not to the untrained eye but this is the position that we have both guys try to attack the other with a queen's pawn and uh Rook C1 B4 A4 A5 this is what we're going for in this position I think the Rooks are going to pressure the queen side the Knight might jump to the center the bishop will go to the F3 Square something like that Knight takes D5 okay again Magnus did all of this so his Bishop would stay open so this is obviously not the time he's going to take with the pawn and closes Bishop not what he wants Bishop takes and now ding plays B4 B4 the idea of before very simple ding has three pawns on the queen side Magnus also has three pawns on the queen side so what he's going to do is he's going to play B5 and that is going to control the entire Queen side and basically then you will play A5 and these two pawns will make a lot of problems for black Rook C1 with pressure A6 with potential endgame problems then you will try to get a knight in there or there or like somewhere here and win the game so B4 Magnus has to do something right now he plays A5 and Magnus doesn't do that lightly he doesn't really like to push pawns he allows this but he one of his pawns gets out right so this Pawn is now under control Magnus I got to get rid of that right away he plays Rook C8 and C5 right away he deals with the problem he really didn't like that Ding takes aant because it's forced Rook takes C6 Rook C6 Bishop C6 now it's a one-on two and really the question is who's got the weaker pawns right two onone you would think is an advantage because if you simplify it you'll promote but I mean we're far from that okay Rook C1 and now Magnus plays Queen A8 going to the other side of the board and ding plays Knight to E1 to transfer the Knight over here and do do a little damage Rook C8 now here the game could proceed for a little while I mean ding could continue to ask questions and things like that but this was the ninth round out of 10 in this tournament and I think ding lost the previous game so I think he kind of wanted a mental reset so he offered an exchange and that's going to get the Bishops off the board that's going to get the Rooks off the board and all in all it will probably kill the winning chances it happens Bishop takes Knight takes both guys make sure not to get back rank checkmated showing the audience that it's good to you know play like this we have Rook C6 but the game still finds a way to get spicy because Magnus doesn't want it to end Magnus doesn't want it to end like that you know for example okay let me just kind of very you know basic show you like these pawns become very meaningful in the end game uh if you're not careful and you allow B4 you could be in for some serious trouble I guess there is Knight C3 here so let's say King E1 but it's a it's you got to be a little careful so Queen E7 F6 and now ding's Knight goes for a little walk but Magnus gets in and is targeting a lot of things he's literally eyeing five things at the same time Knight C6 a pawn near ding's King has fallen Queen E8 another Pawn near ding's King has fallen but is ding checkmating Magnus what is going on over there Queen G8 is mate the game is over Queen F4 a well-timed calculation a smart calculation and the point is that if you play King G1 in this position I'm going to take this and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you checks until the end of time I'm going to play Queen A1 I can take on A2 you're going to go over here I'm going to give you this check so by the time you're done you're down a bunch of these pawns and I got to keep checking you cuz the second I don't it's like mate you're going to lose so King H1 and the player Shuffle this one unfortunately not a whole lot going on in this one though attends battle for quite a long time and one that ultimately ends in uh uh a draws as well so one tough fight one a little bit boring such as top level chess but I told you for clicking on the video I'm going to give you a bonus Magnus game so so far the world champion has not managed to defeat the world champion of the other formats and the guy that's number one chess is so weird Magnus versus rard report report originally Hungarian now represent presenting Romania C4 E6 by the way seeing this again but this time instead of D5 we have C5 this is known as the Bon this is known as the Bon this is known as the bloomenfeld Gambit but this is known as the Bon and what's funny about this game is that in the previous game not against report but just against another player Carlson played this opening so report has a sense of humor and uh he says well Magnus played this opening so now I'm going to play this opening against Magnus and they take G6 Magnus plays H3 very common move covering the G4 square and then plays E4 and in general the ideas for black in this opening are an attack on the E file a flank attack with the F Pawn by moving the Knight out of the way uh the counterplay on the queen side with A6 B5 B4 and every now and then you push the C Pawn so Magnus plays Bishop E3 the idea of Bishop E3 is to play Knight D2 and go over here and control this while also defending the center But first you go here so that your Bishop doesn't get blocked and you go here so that this is not a move which is why you had to play the move H3 so everything makes sense Bishop B3 Knight D2 there's A6 trying to play B5 there's A4 and now in this position report play something that might shock you he takes on e4 which does not look possible but it is and I told you that black has counterplay here black has counterplay with the F Pawn and the idea is to sacrifice a knight and then put play this move F5 to Target this Knight to get the Knight back and if you go here there's Central counterplay F4 is vicious you do not want to lose that because this is losing for white you don't want the dark squares this week okay so Bishop B2 Magnus gives up the Knight says you could take it I'm going to play Knight C4 I'm a pawn down just gives away a pawn but black can't play B5 right so black plays A5 we which has been played before the idea he's switching the plan he's now going to put the Knight on B4 where it will live forever it's going to be such a beautiful useful piece it's going to play an integral role in pressuring the white position the Knight on B4 is going to be really nice Magnus doesn't Castle plays Bishop F4 Bishop F4 has two ideas one of them is to attack the pawn on D6 I bet you cannot guess the other idea of Bishop to F4 you you just simply can't it's just not possible you're not good enough that's why you got to keep watching chess videos Bishop F4 activates a piece without moving it you ever play chess Jeopardy that's what we're doing right now which piece is activated by Bishop 2 F4 this one not that one this one Rook A3 Rook G3 through the E3 Square so you open up the schlag bom also a German word and The Rook is going to G3 I think it's a German word Knight a six castles and as you can see Magnus has very bad intentions for the black position this Rook is playing zero role in the game on A1 and over here I mean my God it is useful I mean my my goodness it that is a beautiful maneuver and he's still doing this upon down but Black's pawns are hardly felt I mean Black's pawns are no different than bricks in the wall shout out to Pink Floyd like there is nothing here but you you know you're going to play Rook A7 just like he did and now you're going to bring the Rook over here and Magnus just plays H4 wait what isn't that just the Free Pawn no no no no no no no it's not first of all there is this which the queen used to protect second of all Bishop G5 almost traps the queen there is this move and then it's chaos but no uh report plays Rook F7 Magnus plays Bishop G5 and here he does something which shocked me he traded an attacking piece like a move ago this bishop is pressuring the anchor of the black position the bishop on f8 sucks it's on a home Square it it shouldn't be traded but Magnus Breaks the Rules he says you know what I actually can trade that because what that does is it removes a king Defender and now H5 who's going to guard the pawn not to mention the fact this Pawn no longer has a guard not to mention the fact that when the queen went there B6 lost the guard super lowkey but let's not forget about that Bishop F5 and now again a move that removes a defensive piece Bishop takes Rook takes Rook G7 okay report is defending himself but guess what report has too many weaknesses the E4 Pawn is a weakness for the whole game the B6 Pawn is completely weak D6 falling would lose the game for black because the pawn would walk through and the King side is weak the king is weak generally these are tangibly weak and now G takes H5 and that move was the one that Black's position fell apart but it was already very very bad taking the bishop was the very bad mistake uh report should have went G5 apparently trying to seal the position a little bit tough move to play very ugly not very positional so Rook G4 and Magnus just gets that and he loses both Rooks for the queen but that's it D6 Falls and uh report's going to win The Pawn on D5 but look at look at this look at that look at that move that is so vicious do do you get it the Knight is completely on its own but Queen 2 E8 is literally mate it's just mate somehow the king his Rooks are like not protecting him at all in the right way and this is a huge threat and this this is a huge so you can't stop both H6 Queen E6 say wait a minute and by the way that means that report resign in this position you say why' he resign that's protected I don't understand well after King H7 the knight's going to come alive again it's going to go right here and it's threatening The Rook Queen's trying to get in there Knight's trying to get he just can't he can't defend everything you go Rook A7 I play Knight F6 and I win The Rook uh you go Rook G6 I play Queen F7 it's going to get even worse what a game from Magnus and can I just draw your attention to this guy on the 20th on the 17th move of the game the Knight went there can I tell you something else on the 14th move of the game this was move 14 report went A5 his mind was made up his Knight was going to B4 he was going to transfer the horse to the B4 Square he locked the position and that's what he went for and he resigned the game on move 32 18 moves later the Knight did literally nothing and it's very impressive and actually Magnus gave an interview after this game and literally said in the bon in this opening it is quite frequent that the Black Knight wanders over there to that side of the board sometimes it's very useful sometimes you can put the Knight on D3 like for example in this position maybe you could try to get the Knight over here but frequently it gets lost in the position and that fascinated me that might not Fascinate some of you because you might be a little bit beginner at chess or you're young so you're not you know you know you're like 13 so you're watching this like I don't care about the subtle detail but that is so crazy that in certain structures Magnus can just know that that Knight will just not be useful imagine just having that knowledge of Chess just in this type of a position that Knight just isn't useful fascinating anyway Magnus and ding made two draws Magnus is currently leading the granka chess classic uh and I will probably cover uh the last couple of days of it and if you're watching this in March of 2024 the candidates begin in five days so candidates tournament to determine who will play against dingly Ren the current defending World chess champion in a match later this year that's all I have for you today get out of here
