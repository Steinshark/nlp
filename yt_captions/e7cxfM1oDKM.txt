[Music] the Sony Xperia Arc s was actually my third smartphone ever but trying to use one in 2019 I run into one major problem and plenty of minor ones that doesn't change the fact that initially this was nothing but a pleasant surprise the hardware on this phone is aesthetically awesome and it took me no time at all to get used to the size and how it feels in hand in fact I miss this it's barely 100 grams of mass makes it so manageable and to be honest if Sony remastered this device with an edge-to-edge Foley display and 2019 components I'd buy it day one materially it is made of plastic like every phone back then and a few things are decidedly different for worse but also in some ways for better I'm glad that more modern phones have ditched the terrible notion of a power button on top but I also love the fact that this has a dedicated camera shutter an HDMI port and a removable battery these aren't the best hardware buttons but it is still refreshing to have something tactile here not to mention the long forgotten menu button it's also interesting how Sony's position has changed in the market and I think a big part of this is because of how they present themselves this was one of the most beautiful phones you could get at the time but since then Sony has slowly but surely gone from curving their smartphones in words to curving them outwards with an intermediate pitstop where they were kind of just flat even with its sophisticated glass body their most recent exit 3 lacks the elegance of this concave shape and almost looks alien as opposed to classy while still not the biggest problem the software skin combined with Android 4.0 is honestly even more inhibited than the ancient hardware it's running on it still scrolled through the UI just as well as it did on day one but it's the fact that almost every command is cumbersome like changing the brightness or quickly toggling Bluetooth Android is now gotten so good at presenting you with what you need that it's easy to forget it wasn't always like that it's almost comedic how unrefined the software looks on this phone not a single icon on the homepage lines up in terms of size and the bloatware is real this is the first time in a while bought a phone that actually has games pre-installed on it and much much worse than that McAfee security it's almost hard to imagine that the Arc s was actually one of the fastest phones in the world when it came out with an overclocked 1.4 gigahertz single core snapdragon s2 chip I remember being really jealous though because while this was one of the first smartphones I ever owned and I was super excited about it at the same time my brother had just got his Galaxy s2 the first mainstream phone with a dual-core chip either way though let's just say 2019 applications have a real problem with 2011 hardware because we're talking about phones here that people upgrade every two years or so rather than a PC which might be more like five years things get obsolete fast and eight years in the world of smartphones genuinely feels like a generation on the flip side though it is kind of cool to think that even a $100 off-the-shelf smartphone now could blitz this in almost every aspect especially when it comes to battery and this brings me onto the main problem you might know that batteries degrade over time as you use them but what a lot of people forget is that batteries degrade over time even when you don't use them and what I've experienced with this phone as a demonstration of just a severe this effect is even though the battery that came with this was sealed and never used this our cast has about 40 minutes worth of screen on time down from over 4 hours if I'd bought it at launch because that battery has been slowly becoming less and less chemically reactive so on one hand this won't apply to most of you because you're probably not using an 8-year old phone but on the other hand even after 2 years this effect is still noticeable so if you've bought an older device recently even if it was brand new it is worth considering a battery change to one manufactured this year also if you are going to be storing a battery for a period of time try to find a cool place to keep it room temperature and above will accelerate the deterioration okay going back to an older phone is always a bit of an exercise in appreciation and this was no different whether it's the 4.2 inch LCD display the single muffled speaker on the back or the complete lack of a fingerprint scanner phones are way better now that not even up for debate and yet somehow I've really enjoyed using the arcus and I'm calling an owl compact smartphones are about to make a return every single person I handed this to said either while it's so cute or I'm surprised I can still type easily on it or I love that I can reach the top corner with one hand people found that this small and light form factor was a pleasant change as opposed to something that constrained productivity if you haven't seen the recent video on foldable smartphones that's been a long time in the making so I'll leave that linked somewhere from this video and it's got a special cameo in it thanks a lot for watching and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
