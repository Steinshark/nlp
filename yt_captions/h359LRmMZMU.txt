we're about to test the most viral gadgets on Tick Tock to find out if lots of views actually mean something is good okay let's watch some tick tocks starting with 120 000 views to go onto Amazon you get a piece of acrylic and stick it on your exercise bike I have some doubts about the stability I can't believe how much this thing costed I thought it was gonna be ten dollars it's 60. so we've got two very satisfying looking peels to pull off here ah that was better than any phone peel I've ever experienced very appealing I was appalling okay it's on it's actually scraped a little bit of the material away it's not a great start so to be fair it does allow me to accomplish the core task of using my laptop while I'm exercising it's just a little bit wobbly and also it doesn't quite come out close enough to be comfortable for me to perch on but I'd say this is a 5 out of 10 for the price so moving all the way up to 300 000 views right now it's a bin for your smartphone so it's saying that this right here whoosh is the official screen cleaning fluid that Apple uses to keep their store models as shiny as possible I'm not gonna lie the side by side is a little bit sus well it looks nice and premium and it does come with a microfiber cloth in the box which is always nice all right so let's just say you have a dirty phone like a very very dirty phone I really like the fact that this is proper industrial sized equipment like this is a 500 mL bottle of fluid okay all right let's do the honors oh it takes a second to get warmed up oh yeah that's the stuff not actually colorless like I was expecting the fluid itself already kind of looks a bit dirty the sacred swipe [Music] that's very good actually so literally within two strokes of the cloth that is what it looks like wow I think I have to give this a 9 out of ten the only real downside being that it does kind of cause a bit of a mess so apparently this gadget solves your wardrobe space problems so it's like two hooks that can actually support six different pieces of clothing does that actually save space this is definitely one of the stranger products that's arrived on my doorstep okay so this is what five shirts would normally look like using traditional hangers but then with this contraption it gives you a slot to hang each of these shirts individually into so far it actually takes up about three times the space the only reason this exists though is for you to then be able to take that hook off oh that saves you a ton of horizontal space let me explain so when you unhook the storage solution the compression of the hanging device reduces the cubic volume of air between each shirt by a factor of 3.5 the garments do now rest 20 lower so they take up more vertical space but it means that the overall volume of the shirts in storage is scaled down to less than a half of what they originally began with or in other words nine out of ten some of my favorite home finds lately oh that's cool it's like a vertical waffle maker that's quite a good idea so this is like a cocktail glass that constantly stirs your drinks and then keeps telling you the next thing you have to put in it does seem like a cool way to make a cocktail does the fact that it's constantly mixing actually help you with something oh this is really doing it for me anything involving brightly colored cocktails Sonia to get a glass you get a base it feels a little bit cheap and cheerful but I'm enjoying it and then here's what the tick tock was really excited about it comes with an app that tells you exactly what to put in to make the drinks you want to make so you find a drink you like the look of and you click Craft of course Bluetooth connection issues to my glass this is how you know it's 20 23. so it says Place Glass it's spinning so it's telling me poor lemonade until the coaster turns green it's filling up on the side that is actually so cool and that's changed to add ginger ale it is a little sad looking it's not like you actually need to stir lemonade on it so if we will follow the recipe pouring complete remove glass and enjoy tastes like lemonade and ginger ale caressed with a stirrer is probably how I describe it to be fair it is mixed well there's no sign of Separation but I just don't see myself using this okay 500 000 views so look what you're doing with that flower buddy soda can pump are you pumping air back into it I swear that's not how it works looks like he's giving the can CPR and I have to say nothing about the packaging or the appearance of this thing inspires confidence right so this is not what I thought it was it's not designed to be able to pump Fizz back into your flat drink it's just designed to stop your drink going flat in the first place so we all know that as soon as you've opened a can or a bottle of fizzy drink you just need to leave it for like a couple of days and all the fizziness just disappears so the base ring snaps onto the can you close the pump cap it's actually created a proper seal last and then the idea is that by pressing this pump down we're drawing all the last bits of air that are in the can out of the can it's basically created a tiny vacuum at the top which stops further carbon dioxide from inside the drink from leaving we will come back to this in three days to see if it's worked okay it's been exactly three days since I put this in the fridge I was a reassuring pop and it's still completely fizzy congratulations Tick Tock is it some kind of slicer you stick whatever you're slicing inside and you just bring the blade down wow and it's sliced I'm cautiously optimistic about this one I think the perfectionist inside of me is relishing the idea of perfectly sliced veggies every single time it's very exciting so we Chuck some small vegetables in I guess this is just going to go down and slice them because it feels like some sort of medieval torture device [Music] I definitely slice uh um so the way this is going to work is if you manage to get a vegetable that perfectly fills the inner chamber then this will completely cut it right down the middle but because in reality that's never really going to happen most of the time you're going to end up with slices that look a bit more like that potentially saves you a little bit of time though so six out of 10. wait it says milk dispenser why is your milk green whoa so this gadget converts apparently AAA batteries into double a batteries okay I mean they come in a bag okay genuine real life situation here I wanted to boot up my Game Boy Color but I could not find any double a batteries at all in the house but in theory these cases should allow me to use privilege oh they feel really nice and high quality flat under the battery goes into flat end of the case and likewise for the top that could not be simpler to understand time to slip it in okay so they perfectly fit in the space made four double a batteries and yes it really does work so I guess makes that the first 10 out of 10 does everything you want it to do right we're past the one million view Mark now so it's like a Bluetooth speaker but it attaches to your shower head and then when water comes through it spins a turbine which charges the speaker it can track water usage tell you the temperature I mean if that lives up to what the video is saying that would be an instant recommend Now videos like this really make you realize the variety of stuff that exists now thanks to the internet well this is cool it's something that actually does look like a capable piece of equipment which I guess you'd expect it's 120 this thing is such a beast but to be fair it does still leave space to hold your handle let's see if it's affected the shower pressure so we are having a little bit of drip edge down here at the bottom but to be fair most of the water pressure is preserved check this out it shows you the temperature of the water at any given time and I don't know what I'm going to do with this information but it does also tell you your estimated flow rate what does party mode do it's not the crispiest most accurate sound ever but it's very very Punchy makes you want to dance in the Shell but the reason to use something like this is the simple fact that you just don't have to think about it you would just walk into the bathroom your phone would auto connect via Bluetooth and it will always be charged bubbles Spa mat that looks like a lot of options oh he's having the time of his life yeah I'm not going to pretend like I'm not incredibly excited by this okay so the mat is set up it does span the entire bath which is very nice one thing I don't like is the fact that it does create almost like an industrial piping situation he's got this massive pipe which then has to plug into the bubble generating machine over here which in itself has to plug into the minions oh my God it is so loud I mean imagine you're having just like a nice romantic night in and then you just got that thing roaring in your corner see if it's worth it oh it's actually really really nice oh I kind of like it I feel relaxed just standing in it oh if it wasn't for this noise I would genuinely give this like a 9 out of ten but you're just not going to be able to relax with the sound of someone vacuuming right next to your face believing this one is the best Amazon purchase of my life okay massive onion can't contact with a normal knife so the veggie chop comes in right okay so you load up the onions oh you crank it by hand that looks like a nightmare to clean I do love automating tasks why does it seem like such an as seen on daytime TV kind of product I felt slightly let down by the slicer from earlier I'm hoping this is the solution and then the top of this slicer basically connects to the lid of the container like an allen key another feeling when you feel like you're about to get satisfaction time is now oh my God that actually works so well I didn't want to believe but easy nine out of ten we have just destroyed that Apple but apple is currently destroying Us in subscriber count so I set it as a mission for us to overtake them and if we do I will personally build the largest most powerful iPhone myself so sub to the channel would be it's optimal over 3 million views for the nasal irrigation system so this is meant to flush your sinuses I guess well he does not look happy I feel like I'm watching like an exorcism you got his kids hand on his shoulder like they're there it's okay dad poor guy it's like a concerned dog in the corner as well is this meant to make me want to do this I mean after that demo this is about the least excited I've ever been to test a product I really can't express how unexcited I am for this is nasal rinse mix oh to be fair it says content sodium chloride so basically this is salt I can't believe all of this is going up my nose oh oh so the salt is there as an antiseptic to clear the insides of your sinuses then I guess the idea is that this is going to spray water at high pressure to clear everything out oh that feels horrible wow that's the initial surprise it's uh starting to feel quite Pleasant my nose feels so clear I have allergies all the time so my nose is constantly half blocked but feels like my first clear breath in a very long time I might actually voluntarily use this again eight out of ten oh it's like a self-heating cooking pots you can cook while in bed watching Netflix I can't tell if this is genius or really really dumb I guess they're trying to frame this as the no need to leave your bed anymore cooking solution which I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated to experience being able to film videos in bed is great so one very immediate red flag this is not even long enough to reach your floor Bombay bad boy what a flavor I feel like I'm back at University again had some hot sauce and I guess just water okay so the heater is really powerful but if anything that actually concerns me slightly more the outside is all plastic though so you don't feel how hot it actually is okay here's the thing this product does do exactly what it says on the tip but why would you want to do that why do you want to cook something at 200 degrees C on your lap you still need to leave your bed to go get Cutlery you still need to go get water from the tap at that point why not just go cook it downstairs and then bring it up like it's definitely getting really hot this will cook whatever you put inside of it oh it smells so good especially after the nasal irrigation I mean look at me right now this is not a scene that should exist three out of ten we're at five million views now wait this person's putting some sort of like very puree into the tunnel that then gets released into the face mask that can't be it there's got to be a next step here what does that do it looks very cursed man I feel like I need to get this the bath jacuzzi and the cocktail mixer all together that is one hell of a night in all right let's pretend this isn't something straight out of your worst nightmare so that slips under the air so I spent the last five minutes pureeing an old fruit salad into this there's so many instructions so the water logo is flashing which means 60 mL of water in there if it actually beeps to tell you when to stop okay 20 ml of juice and now I meant to add [Music] it what I'm actually about to experience pills off Tick Tock oh it does actually say warning do not eat this is not food very satisfying you can see that it's in the process of making the mask so let's come back to it when it's done right the laziest thing I've ever ordered from Amazon it definitely is a trend here short video remote controller I know what this is gonna do if you wear it as a ring for the entire purpose of this device is just being able to wirelessly scroll your feeds I kind of hate that this exists but we are where we are you know with this thing what scares me a lot more than potentially finding out that I don't like it is finding out that I actually really do okay so I guess the situation here is I've just finished my in-bed pot noodles I'm very satisfied and now it's time to get into bed and to watch some tech talks you're watching tick tocks like this you want to go to the next Tick Tock just tap the next button and it's the next Tick Tock hey it's a very slight delay because it's Bluetooth but there's no swipe transition at all it's just you click and it goes but then also when you want to pause you tap the middle button oh it's definitely one of those gadgets that's really well executed I would actually tell myself not to use this is that guy cleaning the outside from the inside that's not right I am a bit confused oh it's like a specific magnetic double-sided window cleaner that we have to try well this thing is really heavy and the magnet that connects the two separate parts of it incredibly strong like you actually have to be very careful not to get your fingers in between these but I guess it makes sense because the magnets have got to be strong enough to attach from the other side of the glass I just wipe and it does both sides at once I mean it's incredibly cool but can you see how tenuous the magnetic connection is like the other one is ready to fall any second oh oh my God I mean that's just broken so this is a great idea but only if you have single glazing I can't give it more than like a four totally on 6 million views this device stops you from using your mobile phone why is this a thing you can still take emergency calls good I find it so funny that one of the the top cool Amazon gadgets is a gadget that stops you using your gadgets this is actually a little more advanced than I was expecting I assume this will just be a one-time use fun gimmick but it does seem surprisingly well thought out okay so you open it up you stick your phone inside you close the door you click the lock button and then this allows you to set the time that you want to lock it for so there is a screen protector that you can take off here it allows you to touch your phone in very specific places so I guess that would either be to tap some notifications or to answer a call it's still allowing you to use your phone it's just making it wildly inconvenient to do so at this point it's literally just world's dumbest case I can literally just fully play a game while it's in this case there's ever a bit of a screen you can't reach now you can it's like a two [Music] what are you doing to this banana this looks like a horrific form of surgery poor thing it's like coring the inside of the banana to be able to fill it with something else spotting God's name why does it look so inappropriate oh God I think innocent things think innocent things this is absolutely the most sauce Gadget so far oh yeah oh this is fun I am a massive banana man and I do actually eat banana with Nutella anyways right so it says start by cutting off the tip a lot of banana straightening in the instructions there straight in the Banana by putting the cut end into the holder oh okay and then you straighten the banana like this no way I don't think I've ever seen a straightened banana in my life so then you've got the quora so this is going to go through the middle of the banana and hopefully take out the inside here we go [Music] Ching pushing pushing pushing oh I don't want to break it and now at that point I'm going to twist to break the core on the inside of the banana put my thumb over and pull out or to use suction to hopefully pull it out I think it worked this is what we pulled out have you ever seen that before so now we load up the hopper this is going to get messy I can just tell okay so now we Slide the banana in slowly and carefully as soon as I do this it's going to fill it right up [Music] and this is the funniest thing I've ever seen oh my god oh wow okay so it doesn't quite fill it up to the very very end so it's a little messy on this side but I'm assuming if we now open it from here still have a clean full looking banana that once you slice come on come on come on beautiful and the proportion is just right it's a hassle to get there and I'm so glad we got that POV you're in a rush and you want to bring breakfast with you you're just about to show us some sort of alternative way of doing it a crunch cup it's got a separate compartment for the milk and the cereal but it allows you to have both at the same time while keeping the cereal crunchy I mean this guy looks happy okay we all know that cereal is just an elite tier snack and so a tool that's claiming it can perfect the cereal eating experience you know this thing has a very high ceiling okay so we get some milk into here doesn't feel like a large amount of cereal I have to say it's the cereal connects straight into the lid I'm slightly scared this is going to spill everywhere but then I think you just lower that that is a weirdly perfect fit so I've got a full access now to both my cereal on the inside and my milk with this little slit here I'm just now realizing this is for all those people who put the cereal in last I'm just drinking milk I got my first chocolate pop and we are probably 60 done with the milk it's just easier for the milk to come out than the cereal to come out cereal was designed to be eaten a certain way for a reason spiral candles are my new thing I am actually Loki a bit of a candle sucker also the wick is spiraling all the way around the outside and then once that's completely burned the wax melts into the middle which then allows it to be reused as a normal candle almost every single product that comes to me I usually have like a gut instinct to whether it's going to be good or not I have absolutely no clue here so apparently this is linen fresh oh and you can see the wick going all the way around on the inside it's so much better use of the space inside a candle as opposed to just having one in the middle that goes down so the wax in a candle is used as a fuel to keep the wick burning there's actually less wax here than in a normal candle but the shape of it allows it to use the wax it does have more efficiently you can already see the melted wax trickling down into the center okay so it's only actually burned for a toe for six hours which is much less Long than I was expecting however it's reached a very nice looking stage too so I would say this is a really nice novelty but it doesn't completely change the game for candles or anything so eight out of ten okay so we're in the 10 million view plus category now a Smart Lock for your door that allows you to set a combination passcode ah it's pretty interesting okay this is right up our alley we have to test this can you believe this thing was over a hundred dollars that is not cheap for a door handle okay okay it's finally installed this is one fiddly piece of equipment and I will say straight off the bat there's a couple of things I don't like about it when you pull the handle down it doesn't automatically snap up I would quite like it to just return to that position the LEDs on the inside feel pretty cheap like they don't fully light up each of the numbers but it does at least quite well serve the function it's intended for of being able to password lock your door or hey even fingerprint unlock like that why did I set it up in the bathroom there I'll give it a six I'm never buying from a small Tick Tock business ever again it's with some sort of box it has a bit of 3M tape on the back take that off you stick it on your wall next to your door and it can apparently turn your door into an automatic closing door to save you the vast effort of having to close the door yourself little optimization say that was a 20 million view Tick Tock if this actually works it could be a really powerful combo when paired with the fingerprint door handle okay so through here and you essentially want to attach this box just next to the door and then the hook that it latches onto is going to go at the same height but on the door itself and then all being well once this is latched onto this it's going to create a strong enough pulling Force but this door will now automatically close oh my goodness gotta say the mechanism does make me slightly uneasy in case at any point this say flies off the wall and Sparks you in the face but it does seem like they've thought about and this is stuck on very very securely and my favorite part of this is that it closes with enough force to be able to actually latch the handle of the door on its way out this has over 65 million views looks like I'm watching an alien abduction so it's a robot that secures itself onto a jar and unscrews it for you I'd be interested to see if it's powerful enough to unscrew ones that even I get stuck on twenty dollars is what this was probably one of the cheapest robots you can get okay I have a jar which uh conventional means May struggle to open so if I'm not mistaken you place the robot on top and then press this button I guess I hold it there on it's uh tightening its grip and the secondary hands are coming in to hold the glass itself straight this is wild oh man Tech is cool sometimes it's a little niche to give it a 10 but it does do exactly what it says on the jar nine out of ten okay I think we're done there's a little suction button here which is meant to pick up any excess liquid if you've tried so many questionable things this video it's really hard to know especially on Tick Tock what's actually legitimate and what's not speaking of which I don't know if you've noticed this as well but the number of spam phishing emails I've been getting has literally gone through the roof recently I've literally been getting over 200 emails every single day and only like 20 are actually from legitimate sources and it's not like if you click the links in these you waste five seconds of your life and you can just carry on with your day some of these links can very literally gain access to your entire machine into your accounts every bit of data you own by
