hello everyone and welcome according to the industry that has made a ton of money selling combustion engines the combustion engine is going nowhere and of course they'd say that but here's the thing they're right so in this video i want to discuss why the combustion engine still has a long life ahead of it and some of the challenges facing electric cars and i want to be clear about my goal i'm not saying that you shouldn't buy an electric car i bought an electric car and i think they're great my goal with this video is to provide you with evidence that there are still many good reasons to continue improving combustion engines so a common comment i get on this channel whenever i'm talking about a new piece of internal combustion engine technology is why would the manufacturer continue to develop the combustion engine when we know the future is electric and when they could be investing that money in electric cars so a big part of this video is for selfish reasons so the next time that someone in the comments is bashing combustion engines i can say hey you know there still are good reasons why they exist here's the link because i'm certainly going to continue making videos about cool and interesting combustion technology as well as technology involving electric cars so we're going to divide the video into four categories the science the environment the cost and the consumer in each category we'll discuss the associated challenges okay so let's start off with science from a physics standpoint the biggest challenge currently facing electric cars is energy density in other words how much energy can you put into a certain space so here i have a gallon of water now according to the epa if this was a gallon of gasoline it would have the equivalent of 33.7 kilowatt hours of energy in it so in just this one gallon of gasoline there is more energy than in the entire battery of the first generation nissan leaf now times have changed batteries have improved since the first generation nissan leaf so i found a study in 2018 that was looking at eight different lithium ion battery manufacturers and of them i looked at what was the best energy density they found in a lithium-ion battery cell that number was 684 watt hours per liter so i want to provide a visual demonstration of what that means so here we have a gallon of gas and now what i want to see is how much space do we need in order to have that same amount of energy but in the form of lithium ion batteries we're going to do that using cans of lecroy not because i'm sponsored this isn't sponsored i'm just basic and so if you do the math which of course i did the equivalent energy by volume of one gallon of gasoline you would need 139 cans of lacroix representing our lithium ion batteries now this is more than just an elaborate plan to make my groceries tax deductible this is wild to look at by volume gasoline is 13 times more energy dense than the best of lithium-ion batteries in 2018. and you might be saying to yourself well this isn't really that fair of a comparison visually because all of the gasoline is tucked away in one nice little convenient spot whereas the lithium ion is spread out in all these individual cells but that's kind of the point because gasoline just goes into a tank and it just sits in one spot batteries are made up of thousands of individual cells which aren't that space efficient so keep in mind what we're looking at here is the volume required for just the cells this doesn't take into any consideration cell connections wiring cooling routing that's going through these batteries and the overall structure that's holding these all together so the space is actually going to be much larger than what you see here and on top of that remember we're looking at the best example from a study in 2018. if we were to look at the worst example the energy density was less than half and that would mean we would double what you see here just to have the same amount of energy as one gallon of gasoline by volume now so far we've just talked about volume and of course volume is important for packaging within a car so if previously you only needed this much space but now you need this much space well then obviously you have a bit of a problem because you either have to take away from existing space within the vehicle or your vehicle has to be larger to fit all of that energy but we haven't yet touched on weight and this is where gasoline has an even larger advantage so one gallon of gasoline weighs about six pounds and it has the equivalent energy of 33.7 kilowatt hours now from that same study i looked at previously the best battery's energy density was about 240 watt hours per kilogram what does that mean well if this can were to be gasoline represented here by lacroix's best flavor pamplemousie then it would weigh 50 times less than the equivalent amount of energy in lithium-ion form and remember this is just talking about the battery cells the battery pack itself would be even heavier so if you're to look at a gallon of gasoline that weighs six pounds this has more energy in it than the original leaf's battery pack which weighed over 600 pounds over a hundred times heavier for less energy so why is this a problem well it depends on what you're trying to do with that battery if you have a lithium ion battery pack at your house as a backup energy source for when the power goes out it's not really a problem you don't care how much space it takes up you don't care how heavy it is it's just sitting somewhere and it's able to help you out if you then stick it in a car however it means that car is significantly heavier and the larger the item that gets kind of the more detrimental it becomes to that object so think about a plane or a train or you know big freight trucks or when you're towing so these are scenarios where it becomes challenging to because of how much a lithium ion battery pack weighs so if you were to think about a plane for example you know it's trying to fly it needs to be as light and as compact as possible so if you were to have enough batteries on board the thing that the thing could actually fly somewhere it would take up all the space within it and you wouldn't have any additional weight allowed for passengers the thing would just be full of batteries it'd be really heavy and sure it would fly somewhere but it wouldn't take anybody with it and it wouldn't go very far so right now we're really in the sweet spot where passenger cars make sense but things larger than that don't quite yet the good news is battery technology continues to improve so as that battery technology continues to improve the battery itself will take up less space and it will weigh less and eventually we'll get closer and closer towards what we have with gasoline we're not going to get here but we can reduce it and it can improve significantly we're just not there yet so what does that mean well if there are applications today that currently require combustion engines we might as well make those combustion engines as clean and as good and as efficient as possible while we still need them okay so now let's talk about cost and there are two issues here so first of all electric cars are expensive according to this automotive engineering magazine from sae electric cars are about 12 000 more for the initial purchase price so yes the maintenance cost and the operating costs are going to end up being lower but that initial purchase price is significantly higher and so because of that a lot of people avoid buying them now part of this is a chicken and egg scenario because because not many people are buying electric cars not many electric cars are produced and because not many electric cars are produced they're very expensive economies of scale the more you make the cheaper they become so in this scenario if more people bought electric cars they'd be cheaper but more people can't buy electric cars because they're too expensive now i want to be very clear and that i don't think the initial purchase price is the big deterrent from electric cars i don't think that's the big reason why we don't see mass adoption and reason being is that if the only thing people were concerned about when buying a new car was total cost of ownership we'd all just be driving old 90s honda civics and we're not we buy new toys car buying is a very emotional experience it's not a logical experience and because of that all of the luxury brands exist if all of us only thought about total cost of ownership no luxury brand period would exist no fun cars would exist we just have all the boring simple machines that could get us from point a to point b that cost us the least amount but people buy things that they enjoy and so because of that reason i don't think it's that strong of an argument that cost alone is what is keeping people out of electric cars however where cost does get involved and where i think this does play a role is in terms of profit for the manufacturers according to a study by alex partners in order for an electric car to be profitable today it needs to cost forty eight thousand dollars quite a bit and the power train cost for that electric car is about sixteen thousand dollars for a long range ev versus about sixty five hundred dollars for a combustion car so think about this if you're a manufacturer and you wanna sell a car to a customer for thirty thousand dollars you can make significantly more profit if you sell that 30 000 car as a combustion car versus an electric car and for better or worse manufacturers are going to follow what makes them profitable and in this case it's combustion engines all right so let's move on to the environment and talk about why we should be improving internal combustion engines so according to this reading there's going to be about two to three billion internal combustion engines sold between now and 2045. that alone sounds like a pretty good reason to improve them and make them better if we're gonna sell that many anyways they might as well be as clean as possible but let's look at it from a manufacturer's point of view you knew i was gonna work a whiteboard into this video so let's say you're a small car manufacturer with a hypothetical name something like mazda and your goal for your company is to improve your overall emissions and so you're a small company you don't have a ton of money and so you have to make a decision of what do you want to do with that research and development money do you want to put it into an electric car or do you want to improve your combustion cars so let's say you choose to create an electric car and that ends up accounting for about 10 of your sales which is actually an optimistic number based on today's sales data and those 10 percent thankfully these electric cars are twice as emissions friendly life cycle versus the combustion course great you've improved them but it's only 10 of your sales so your overall emissions are only reduced by 5 because you still have 90 of your cars unchanged well then you could also choose to instead of spending that money on developing an electric car to develop a better internal combustion engine and create a new technology that reduces emissions by let's say 10 percent 10 isn't a crazy number to improve emissions by now because all of your vehicles are combustion engines that 10 applies across the board and that means you have an overall emission savings of 10 so it was actually cleaner and likely much more profitable for your business to develop a new internal combustion engine technology than to go the eevee route and part of this yes is due to consumer choice which brings us to our last point finally let's talk about consumers so a large part of selling a car is knowing that there exists a market out there to purchase that car in 2018 and in 2019 the global market share for electric cars was about two percent so if you owned a car dealership and a hundred people came to your car dealership and bought cars only two of them walked out with an electric car now marketing is the business of teaching you what you want to buy and so part of this is that we've been marketed combustion engine cars more often unless you've been watching recent super bowl commercials but it also does come down to consumer choice and that plays a massive role lots of people still want combustion cars it's easy to think why doesn't everyone have an electric car if you have a garage and you have a way to fast charge that vehicle however something i've always said and will continue to say is that people are lazy so if you want to convince people to buy something it needs to be more convenient than what they already have now if you have a garage and again a way to charge it often electric cars will be more convenient than a combustion car however if you live in an apartment or if you street park your vehicle which hello a lot of people do then a combustion car is easily going to be more convenient and so a lot of people are going to choose that people also often buy cars that they rarely need for their intended purpose say five percent of the time that's why you see a ton of pickup trucks because one day they might need to buy mulch but along that five percent mentality people buy gasoline cars because they know they can road trip anywhere and everywhere i've experienced this with my tesla there are trips in it that i have intentionally taken my crosstrek instead because the charging infrastructure doesn't exist where i want to go so if you only have one car it's often very logical for it to be a combustion car if you're a family with multiple cars in a garage it makes complete sense to have at least one of those vehicles as electric for everything around town but that's not everyone's case and then if we take back into consideration that currently two percent of buyers are buying electric cars and let's say again you're mazda you're trying to clean up your fleet and so you invest everything into an electric car that only two percent of the people buying your cars are buying then you're not really cleaning up your fleet because not enough people are buying that car in order for it to actually make a difference so again none of this is to say that electric cars are dumb or that you shouldn't buy one i love them i love mine but there are still many good reasons why combustion engines still exist and why they should continue to be improved so ultimately i'm going to keep making videos about pre-chamber ignition or gasoline compression ignition engines or whatever else automakers think up mostly because i think it's cool but also because it's actually logical based on today's circumstances so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
