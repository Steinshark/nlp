ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Chess World Cup 2023 this is a knockout tournament featuring some of the greatest names in the world of Chess like Magnus Carlson Hikaru Nakamura Fabiano caruana yanyuponushi you name it they are playing we are currently in the round of 16 in the open we're currently in the quarterfinal on the women's side and most of the top seeds in the open are still there Magnus Fabiano Yan Hikaru tragically knocked out in the last round but storylines are circling and one of them is the story of Magnus Carlson and he gave an interview which I'm going to play for you right now and then I will show you today's recap four games uh and I will tell you who Advance uh this was a this was a little bit of a troubling interview it was a bit of a concerning interview let me play the clip we'll talk about it and then we're gonna we're gonna talk about uh the games honestly like almost since day one I've been wondering like what am I what am I doing here like why am I spending all this time playing classical jazz which I just find you know stressful and boring but yeah so Magnus gave an interview uh and this was after uh the kymer match where he says since the beginning of the event he's been thinking about why he's even playing in the event the World Cup is of course Very prestigious and he went on to say that he really does want to win it and he wants to avoid a humiliating exit but this is a big deal for him uh and uh we could be seeing the end of Magnus Carlson playing classical chess classical chess has always been the uh form of Chess associated with perfection the highest quality of the game uh the highest level of prestige but it's very hard to Market games go five six hours and even Magnus himself who has dominated for so long is saying I don't I find it stressful and boring and he's found it stressful and boring but he he he's still well on his way to a quarterfinal uh in this world cup so a fascinating storyline uh and we very well could be seeing the end of Magnus uh In classical chess hopefully he plays rapid and Blitz but that yeah I mean time is ticking we should really enjoy him while he's here so uh he's playing against vasile Evancho today and Magnus yesterday one with the white pieces friendly reminder this is a knockout tournament so uh they play a best of two and uh well Evancho now has to beat him so here we go uh Ivanka plays E4 Magnus just like he did in the World Chess Championship against yanyupomy she plays E5 by the way the last World Chess Championship that he participated in uh in the most recent one he was a spectator so Knight F3 Knight C6 and Evancho plays a Spanish which is exactly what nepo did Magnus plays uh just very classical A6 morphe defense Knight to F6 Bishop to E7 and now it's up to White to choose what to play Yvonne Chuck plays the traditional Rook to E1 this has been played thousands of times millions of times actually uh castles and now Magnus hasn't moved his deep on so if you've ever watched any of my videos of uh the Recaps of the World Chess Championship Magnus played against nepo uh or the most recent one nepo versus ding you know that if they don't play the move D6 they want to play D5 and Magnus in case you don't know plays the Marshall because one of his uh former training coaches training Partners friends uh colleagues uh paddle Partners not not like the one you hit the butt with like the sport uh it was Jan Gustafson from Germany and Gustafson loves this opening and this opening basically just sacrifices uh you know the pawn and then and then and then you do all this wild stuff so ivanchuk knows this which is why he plays A4 uh nepo played A4 against Magnus as well uh and here the moves Bishop B7 Pawn to B4 have all been played uh and uh and and and Magnus actually plays something from the World Chess Championship which is Rook to B8 so he voluntarily does this and gives up the entire a file which looks like it should be bad but the thing is when you prepare for a World Chess Championship you don't just prepare for that you change your entire life you change your entire career uh it's like preparing for for a fight Camp you know in boxing or mixed martial arts if you have 10 weeks to train for a fight like you're just getting better anyway right you're learning new things anyway so Magnus played this all the time Jan couldn't beat him so if he couldn't get beaten in a World Chess Championship why not play it in a World Cup right so Rook to B8 is played uh and now C3 and uh ivanchuk is trying to play D4 Magnus plays D6 strong approach ready to develop this Pawn to D4 played Magnus captures on D4 C takes D4 and now Magnus plays D5 which is the entire idea uh because if let's say you just lazily develop uh White will go here stop that and now completely control the center and have a better position so D5 inducing the movie 5 and putting the knight in the center with Knight to E4 and Evancho plays Knight C3 ivanka's thought by the way at all uh he probably by the way uh knows uh the line um and by the way I'm just gonna say this right now I know you're watching the Magnus game uh I want to thank all of you just real quick uh normally I see the analytics of my videos right and normally uh the Magnus game happens and then there's a bit of a drop off some people just literally only care about Magnus um y'all have been watching like 50 60 60 65 of the World Cup recap which is great uh that that is a monster uh number of attention span and caring about the event uh and I try to provide like the most exciting games of the round so I just want to say thank you because I've made like 15 like 10 12 I don't know how many Recaps anyway take take uh so thank you you're great most of you some of you are terrible but it's up to you to determine whether you're terrible or not this position looks really good for white because white can go here and here and Checkmate uh which is why black now has to play Bishop F5 neither one of them neither one of them has spent much time um Magnus spent a little bit of time uh he spent a little bit of time right here just remembering I guess the move D6 uh because maybe he could also play D5 uh but uh other than that you know Magnus really hasn't spent maybe he was in the bathroom so H3 you'll notice that finally ivanchuk spends a little bit of time he could develop his Bishop he could also play Rook A6 attacking the knight uh but he plays H3 and uh Magnus plays Queen D7 connects the Rooks ready to fight on the queen side we have Bishop E3 developing and now we see kind of another idea Magnus plays Knight d8 uh he could have already fought back on the a file for some reason he chooses not to do that uh maybe he didn't like the weakening of the B Pawn in in various lines so he plays knight d8 uh with the intention of a few things number one you can play C6 or C5 if necessary C6 is solid C5 is aggressive then I could always go to E6 uh the pawn could go to B4 right so now there's like assistance with the pawn a little bit so Evancho plays Knight D2 and by the way he's really not thinking much and Magnus plays B4 and remember Magnus just needs to not lose that's the most important thing uh but right around here I you know I I saw the position I went Magnus is in a worse position and he's down 30 minutes on the clock that's really bad you know um and all it's gonna take is one setback in this event and that interview comes to mind and I'm like is Magnus done with chess hopefully not all of Chess classical chess Pawn to C6 right and now Avanti plays Queen A4 again not even thinking doesn't even think Queen A4 instant Evancho could even play rookie again he could play Rook here uh computer really likes this move it also likes F4 just taking space Maybe G4 F5 like again if black just plays lazy which I'm not saying he's going to do but because black is this dude from Norway um but if Andrew plays Queen A4 he like no thought just blitzes out the move Magnus plays Rook B7 stabilizing the seventh rank uh uh Knight F1 played after definitely some thought uh you but but again this this still seems to be the the best plan F4 and trying to play for G4 eventually plays Knight F1 rerouting his Knight Magnus plays 96 was always part of the plan so when Magnus like several moves ago played the move Queen D7 and freed up the square for the he knew all of this was going to happen he was going to go here he was gonna go here he was gonna go here and he's completely implemented a neutralizing game plan there we go Evancho plays Knight G3 Magnus goes here ivankuk plays this instantly Magnus goes Knight C7 the Knight dances to cover the light squares and then centralizes itself in the middle of the board and and black is just doing great um you will notice the pawns supported by The Rook I know this is going to sound insane but on move eight when white played A4 and Magnus played Rook to B8 giving up the entire file this is one of the ideas magnus's deep idea in the Rue Lopez to play B5 to play uh Rook B8 in response to A4 to have the Rook behind the pawn is that when white tries to naturally expand you are going to have a chance to use that b-pawn which is crazy like maybe he didn't know that but he discovered that in this game that is one of the deep ideas of the of the of the game of chess that you could play a setup that has not been played before and later after watching hundreds of simulated games maybe played by computers you're gonna go oh I could use that b-pawn and look at what's happening he's using the B Pawn Rook A5 over K7 because his other rook and code to B8 look at this the pawn is gonna survive right Ivan shook now blitzes out look at adventure's time staying at 109 he's his time is not moving rookie ain't he Chomps down he Chomps plays Knight E2 instantly not spending any time at all he could have won a pawn he could have won a full Pawn here he chose not to because I guess he didn't like the fact that you know this bee Pawn is passing he could have just been a full Pawn up like Magnus gave up the pawn right but Knight E2 played instantly Queen A3 Bishop C1 no no thinking just he's not even he's not spending any time at all take take Bishop D3 moves again instantly every move instant trading all the pieces what's going on take take C5 Avon took every move look from it's move 35 move 25 he had the same amount of time he has 110 minutes on sorry he has 70 minutes on the clock I saw one one zero 110. uh he has one hour and 10 minutes 70 minutes on the clock he's not spending any time every single movie's playing instantly Magnus is thinking five seven minutes he's just bulldozing toward this end game but but that's it he he had to win he had to keep pieces on the board he was playing for a win but that's it it's gonna make a drawn out now ivanku plays E6 Magnus goes here gives up the pawn because he's gonna win it back and now Bishop F7 my friends that beep on I told you that beep on supported by The Rook it's gonna be an asset in the end game take take now it's three pawns three pawns but white has drawing chances but this is what we call an outside pass Pawn you should get my endgame's master class do you know I have an endgame's Master Class there's a link in the description there's a free sample chapter you should definitely check it out it's completely completely free seriously watch it maybe go now check the cloak go how wait click the description expand it maybe I'll put in the top line free sample of the endgame's masterclass this is what we call an outside pass Pawn outside pass pawns win end games because you have Kings over here this Pawn is a decoy and the king is going to come Feast on these pawns but King E2 and now my friend look at evanchook's time 20 moves ago he had to see at the same time he's he doesn't he proceeds to literally speedrun this game into a losing end game potentially and then he loses a pawn what he loses upon he did not have to do that he could have I don't know maybe maybe there was there was some way he could have avoided this maybe maybe not but he loses upon I guess thinking that he's gonna win the pawn back he resigns he resigns in this position do you know why because he can't win the pawn back he must have thought he could win the pawn like this he can't because there's take take and the black king runs runs oh but so what I defend myself this the king is now in the house and the white King has to stay on these squares but the pawns will come down and take the squares away and if you go here very simple I'll just win your pawn and my friends it's simple math two on one is the winning end game it's just the winning end game there is nothing to be done unbelievable ivanchuk blitzes out the entire game and resigns in an end game that stockfish on low depth doesn't even understand the point is that black will run the king to H2 and then just take away the squares and white is lost white has no moves white plays King F2 and then you play G4 this is this is otherworldly look at this and you run out this is insanity he resigns up 50 minutes on the clock an hour an hour on the clock what so Magnus has qualified to the quarterfinals in what are the strangest ways hopefully he's not done with classical chess because because this was fun and he will play gukesh remember gukesh from the previous round he drew today so gukesh secures the spot Magnus Carlson versus gukesh in the round of eight quarterfinals coming up um now remember how I said that the retention has been high after the magnus games we have we have excellent games coming up uh we have a uh we have Prague another Indian youngster we also have it battling nepo there 1-1 they're gonna play a rapid tiebreaker tomorrow vidit might also qualify they might have uh even yet another Indian player entering the quarterfinals this is Prague versus uh ference uh uh I would pronounce his name as French burkesh but uh Hungarian folks please let me know if I'm completely wrong uh we have a French defense on the board we have an Indian playing a Hungarian and it's a French isn't chess a beautiful Global game uh Knight F3 Knight C6 A3 B4 taking space take take and uh White goes for the bind variation that's not a real name I just named it that uh Knight A5 very interesting move you can't take because you would lose this which is bad so the bishop comes and prog says Nope can't have my Bishop you'll notice that by their time spent they obviously know what they're doing Rook B1 pins the pawn to the queen and now we have a very locked position on that side of the board uh so Prague does what all good players on the white side of a French do they play H4 uh they play H4 because you kind of know that black really can only ever expand over here and you're gonna take their Square their squares away you also stabilize your Center you play rookie two and you rotate over there so Prague trying to fight on this side fight on this side nobody's gonna be fighting in the center because it's completely locked Bishop B7 Rook a five Bishop six looks like a completely deadlocked position right black just kind of does this nice and now it's time there there we go all right prog down to eight minutes he has eight minutes to make 16 moves or he will lose on time here we go and you will also notice that is hanging so Prague is giving up a pawn now he's gonna start bulldozing why is he gonna start bulldozing because four of Black's seven pieces are on the back rank you can't play chess like that you just can't play just like that it's not like Jiu Jitsu okay you're laying on your back you're in some sort of position you could still submit somebody yeah the only way you lose to a setup on the back rank is if you hang your piece or get it trapped otherwise you're just going to win uh White does have to protect the king but that's about it so we take this now black has even less active pieces and we take this but where's the Breakthrough okay because this looks really good but Bishop B7 and this looks really good but suddenly here comes the Haymaker oh oh that's bad well that's easy let me just keep the position shut then I defend and I will keep hunting your king and your Center so in this position Prague sacrifices Rook take C6 and black is down to basically no pieces remaining and the king is getting hunted the king walks up Queen to F3 hitting the nice and softened up Pawn on F7 black plays F5 now you can take on passion but that would be gluttonous because black can now play Bishop D6 in many lines not right away but it's there so proc continues Pawn to B5 hammering away at The Rook the rook's gotta move it does my friends what Square would white love to just smash through the wall where do you see it square piece Black's defense here is an illusion yes white has a move like Rook to A7 but black will simply play Rook C7 or King 8 you're not going to win a game with just one Rook but you know who you do need to bring in the queen how do you activate the queen without moving the queen chess riddle you do this Knight takes D5 bulldozing in on a square that looked absolutely protected first of all if they ignore you Queen G4 something like this you trade the queens and then you have Knight to B6 and you pick up the Rook so they can't ignore you they can't ignore you that's actually what happened in the game which is fine but the point is if you take look at that eval bar up to M if King to C7 you have a rook a seven and wherever the king moves the queen will follow and the king gets obliterated as these pieces never even got a chance to get off their home squares so Knight takes D5 the bulldozer of a move and this is how you activate certain pieces like the queen without actually moving the queen queen takes G4 Knight here Knight C8 and Prague is up a piece he's not up a piece anymore but he's up enough pawns that all of these pawns fall my friends it is move 36 it is moved 36 in this game and it took black 38 moves to move the bishop 39 moves to move the Rook and it's too late white just has three pass pawns Rook C5 Rook D5 Rook d8 the game is over Prague qualifies to the quarterfinal and he will play against Arjun eragisi heartbreak heartbreaking matchup because one of the Indian youngsters has to knock out the other to emerge and one moves on to the next round uh but it also guarantees there will be an Indian in the semi-final and the odds of an Indian player now making the candidates tournament which would involve a semi-finals matchup is 87 or something like that I saw on Twitter there's an encounter called chess numbers that does a lot of statistics and things like that so we are all but guaranteed one and maybe two Indian players in the next eight player tournament to determine who plays against World chess champion Matt nope it's not Magnus dingly Ren in the next World Chess Championship match this is incredible stuff here's another matchup for you Fabiano caruana versus Duda this was a banger of a game youngstoff invited him into the house of nimto it was E3 it was a main line D5 pawns flew off the center of the board and we had a symmetrical structure and youngstoff went after Fabi with the move G4 super aggressive stuff then he played Knight to E5 and Fabi said take my Bishop go ahead take take Bishop pair okay so we have a symmetrical position we have uh pawns meaning we have F G H we have this cluster here with more symmetrical a moment ago we have Central pawns white has uh which are symmetrical and a b two Bishops versus Bishop Knight Knight uh White is very very very slightly better but it's probably objectively closer to equal Queen to B3 played and Fabiano gives up the second Bishop too so now it is horses versus pointed hats um and uh White has you know white would actually love this Pawn here because the king is safer that way Bobby plays Knight to E4 uh Queen B3 hits both Pawns Knight B6 Shields one attack and protects the center Pawn King G2 bit of a weird move uh I don't know why he didn't develop a bishop but I guess he's stabilizing some squares maybe he wants to play F3 uh and he does play that move right here you'll notice that Fabi is creating a same side attack because his King is actually much safer I mean this is absolutely horrifying now ponzer F3 and here Fabi finds a really nice move uh Fabi obviously is a Gotham chess subscriber he will obviously watch his this recap and if he doesn't somebody should bring it to his attention Bobby knows that um there was something in chess called danger levels uh where a piece can a threat can be ignored if you can create a threat of equal or exceeding danger danger levels Knight C4 which threatens a bishop which is equal but a fork which is exceeding and if Bishop takes Knight then you would take with the pawn because a queen is worth more than a knight and if something like this black people play Rook B8 which would attack the queen and by extension it would attack the king so all of those things matter that's why Fabi spent four minutes and found the move Knight C4 now we have take this way we have take we have take we have take we have take we have take and now we have Queen Bishop and Rook versus queen Knight and rook and Five Pawns each both sides have exchanged a passing Pawn why is black a little bit better all right how do you even evaluate a chest position why does the computer say the black is a little bit better Black's a little bit better for a couple of reasons number one the king is still much safer like you have a pin but that's not exploitable because the queen will go here this king is much weaker these pawns they ain't going backwards anytime soon so the dark squares and the light squares are all very very weak uh this Knight is better than this bishop it's it's actually putting meaningful pressure on something and I and just in general this Pawn is closer to promotion so black has certain advantages the king is completely safe King just stands behind a wall of Pawns also very nice bind on the light squares Rook f8 higher quality pieces Rook F7 everything stable Black's position you'll notice the evaluation is only growing and when your evaluation is growing you have an opportunity to demonstrate G5 just how good your position is it's not just Optics it goes 0 to 60 in three seconds Queen takes C4 Pawn takes F4 and my friends we are in an end game but it's real bad when you're in an end game and your two opponents pawns are walking hand in hand to the finish line white tries to fight back with Pawn to D5 Bobby centralizes wins the pawn and it's just a matter of time the king is gonna get brutally smacked around until Rook D1 and those pawns aren't stopping anytime soon Ponta F2 threatening all sorts of nasty things The Rook is hanging but it has to guard the queen so in this position if Queen takes D3 would have would have been played I think Fabiano would have promoted to a bishop for maximum disrespect and then would have picked up the queen Fabiano caruana yet another quarterfinalist he is the third seat of the event he is still in this is very very big stuff and he will uh he doesn't play Magnus but he will in the semis I think they are they are on the same side of the bracket I think one plays three and two plays Four unless I am completely wrong in which case I'm an idiot my friends I have saved one of the most exciting games I have ever seen in my life for last this game one this game was ridiculous this is on the women's side uh if you click off the video now you hate women you're a misogynist watch this game this game is absurd both of these players are astronomically strong players uh keep in mind nurgal Saleem of a won yesterday they have been keeping the women's bracket uh red hot because they've made a lot of draws in in the round of uh in their in their quarterfinals so Paulina shuvalova has to win this game and oh my God the stuff that she did in this game was was this was like a heavyweight boxing fight it was like a wild or Fury the third one not the first or the second those were uh so E4 for some reason nirgil salimava does not play a normal opening and plays C6 which is which is fine it's not a bad opening because you're trying to play D5 but after D4 white is just better like why why you can't play Knight C6 so she plays B5 now you will notice she spent eight minutes on that move so one of two things happened she got locked in the toilet like I always say you know some of the players something or she's trying to improvise trying to improvise something you will also notice she's thinking on every move this is not a good sign she's thinking on every move she's improvising at the board and from the opening stage uh black is you know black is just worse and now she tries to win White's piece so she hits the queen and she's going to play C4 and she does she does win White's piece the bishop is trapped so this is a crazy game white has to win but White's gonna lose a bishop why is it equal it's equal because you have Bishop takes F6 because of danger levels Bishop takes F6 now the best move here is Queen D5 because the Rook is trap what the take take the Rook is trapped and then apparently it's still equal if if a white is slightly better instead of that Paulina plays Knight takes B5 loses the bishop wins upon with check black loses the right to Castle a takes B3 black has made 12 moves look at this I mean it looks like it's 500 ELO chess what is happening but black is better because black is up a piece black plays Bishop E6 but now F4 white is threatening to attack with both of these pawns because the king is right here the king never got to Castle so now A5 the only thing that neurogul can do is fire back she has 17 minutes on the clock she has spent 73 minutes to make 14 moves that is not sustainable she now has 17 minutes to make the last 26 moves of this game that means this game is going to be chaos Knight F3 A4 she's doing what she can all her pieces are still in the back rank B4 the Knight comes out but now that Pawn's a passer B4 was a mistake apparently now A3 was winning I don't know why black did not play that I mean obviously it's it's everything is easier in hindsight Knight C6 White NOW plays E5 sealing out the dark squared Bishop but black ignores it because if you take A2 and I sneak so A3 B E3 the bishop goes back the king now goes over to stop the pawn black takes on D6 because black is winning so any end game is better for black any end game White NOW inexplicably trades the Queens I don't understand that why would you not keep the Queens on probably because you were afraid of this but Knight E5 if take take and take of course this is made yes but maybe you can play C3 and D7 but it's probably still losing probably still losing maybe now you trade the Queens because you have four pass bonds I've never seen something like this so Queen D6 take take night before I was looking at this like the game is over it doesn't matter if you have six minutes you're up a full Bishop you are up a bishop for two pawns and you have a Pawn on A3 this is unusable but Paulina would not go down Knight to D4 C3 to kick out the Knight now the king blocks and Knight C2 Stomps Knights 94 stops Knight C2 C4 I told you white has passing pawns the this is ridiculous stuff G3 everything is stable Knight F5 take take and now not the ingredient in this move Rook D7 cutting all of the coordination of the black position black tries to kick the Rook Out The Rook slides over Rook G8 to try to play Rook G7 and trade off King B2 stepping out to play Rook A1 trading off the Rooks G4 Now new Guild plays H5 H3 and in this position one of the most disgusting tactics I have ever seen in my life was possible black is winning but how black can't move any pieces black can't play A1 because you take black can't move the Knight because literally anything you do it gets taken so Black's got to move the king and bring the Knight around this way but who's gonna stop the pawns and the pawns on this side it's all an illusion in this position black can play A1 what what happens after this Knight to H5 is the winning idea the point is that it's an illusion because the pawn promotes so Knight H5 is threatening to win this there's nothing white can do white has to go here but that also loses oh well actually if this than this so you have to take like this F5 also so you would have to do this and just lose this and then I don't know pray literally pray but black misses it and tries to do it the slow Way by taking all the pawns but Network A7 and C5 and all of a sudden it's the pawns that are running they get into a pawn race but now from from absolutely nowhere it is white who gets to the pawns and advances to B7 and the Black Knight is a non-factor it had this ridiculous winning idea in that H5 but she misses it and this game ends with Paulina advancing her pawns and winning the game this is a massive blow for nurgul it is now one to one they will have to decide this and the tie breaks nuts absolutely nuts is Magnus Carlsen done with classical chess are we gonna have 25 Indian participation in the next candidates tournament Fabiano caruana yanyuponu she's still in will Fabi make another run at the world title if Magnus Carlson is not interested what is going on in the women's side of things oh my God tournament resumes tomorrow get out of here
