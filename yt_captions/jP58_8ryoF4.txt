with the launch of the iPhone 10's Apple has once again promised us the most durable glass on a smartphone but as you're about to find out very soon invincible it is not fortunately today we're working with a company called case Tafoya who have sent over something which might just help what we're about cer the impact cases the idea being to strike a balance between fashion and impact resistance because no doubt there is a market of people who want protection without their phone and looking like this so before we start dropping stuff let's take a quick look at how this case works on the company's website you can find this little chart which shows that the case lies in the ultimate category for protection but somehow only the light category for weight so obviously I was super skeptical and we have to try it ourselves anyway the case has two main elements the hardshell which is pretty standard stuff but then you've got the shockproof material the hard shell protects from surface damage putting your phone in the same pocket as keys or pulling it across a table and it is scratch resistant it allows wireless charging to still work and you've got a textured finish which keeps it mapped stops are picking up fingerprints and also adds a little bit of grip these ridges around the sides though use something the company calls Qi Tech which is essentially a shock absorbing plastic but unlike other materials that become hard upon impact this is meant to stay soft which should result in less than 5 percent bounce rate compared to 25 percent or 50 percent of other materials also as you can probably tell there are a lot of options I picked for different looking ones here to demonstrate this point but online there are four different colors for the ridges but then over a million different finishes for the back pretty ridiculous okay time to drop things but just before we do that I'm gonna put a tempered glass screen protector on the front of the phone the impact case does already somewhat protect the screen because it's got ridges that come in front of it but I suppose if you wanted to make your iPhone a more or less invincible this would be the best way of going about it outside it's 9:00 in the morning and we've got a bit of a setup going on here we've got a primary camera to record each drop in slow motion but also some lighting and a secondary camera to record the bigger picture the first drop is from a height of just over a meter and we're going to start with you on case Typhon and then move to the cased one this is about the height where most people would be dropping their phones either out of jacket pockets or trouser pockets so far the uncased phone is in pretty good Nick but it does have a couple of dents on the bottom where the impact was with the case as you'd probably expect from a height like this no damage try again at just under a meter and a half I tried again with the case phone and almost looks like it was trying to dodge the impact by landing on my foot but the primary point of contact was still solid and yet the case is unscathed I've got to say I'm pretty impressed with the bear phone - it's in a similar condition - after the first drop just with a couple more Nicks and now is where things start to get pretty serious this is a straight up two meter drop and you can see how much faster the firm is traveling when I hit the floor okay so after two meters things aren't looking good for the uncased phone we've got a noticeable crack on the top and the edges generally they're looking pretty rough at this stage not to mention if you look closely you'll be able to see a hairline crack under the screen now it's time for the main event we've got the camera pointing at the floor and then a window five meters above ground level so we're going to drop from that window and record the whole thing if you have a look at my face that is a face of a man who is terrified this could have gone wrong in a thousand different ways but thankfully this test actually turned up pretty good gotta say that impact did not sound good it was almost like a crunching sound to it now to see if this case Typhon tennis is actually invincible from any semi realistic scenario okay time to assess the damage so we've got both iPhones lying here on the floor let's start by taking a look at the uncased 100k so the top left is pretty smashed up but as is the bottom right and oh when you turn off the screen you can see pretty much the entire display has been obliterated there's a little bit of damage on the camera module on the back but generally speaking the backs okay the one I was more worried about because I wasn't actually planning on breaking this phone is the cased one and initial inspection shows a bit of damage on the screen but the back looks pretty much unscathed if you look at the screen we've got similar lines across that we had with the uncased phone but we used a tempered glass screen protector so if we take that off you realize that is what has the cracks on it and the actual display and not even a mark just to check the rest of the phone I took the case off as well and I couldn't find a single scratch on the phone not on the camera module not on the screen the military just a few smudges which you wipe away with your finger I'm very very impressed all right I'm gonna drop a link to the case d√©fi website in the description below so feel free to check that out and if you haven't seen our iPhone 10s camera test or the face I detest I would recommend them both I think we've got some very interesting results alright guys I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
