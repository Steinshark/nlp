I have made a model of a cube out of well like 
paper tubes that are adequately stuck together   so I might be talking about something in a video 
like oh you know if you line it actually can I   line that up if I line it up it becomes a hexagon 
look at that hexagon ah the projection of a cube   corner to corner hexagon so let's say I want 
to build a model to demonstrate that and so I   put this together I'm like oh it's good just a bit 
difficult to transport if only I could reduce this   down have you know less cube while still having 
all of the cube and allow me to demonstrate what   I mean with a second cube so this in theory is 
exactly the same bar manufacturing imperfections   as the first cube we're going to keep that there 
as our whole cube and this one I'm going to cut in   half by just snipping four of these parallel edges 
like that okay so so now instead of traveling with   the whole cube I can just take this with me 
but Matt you think that doesn't look like the   original cube well I've got a mirror here so in 
the mirror first of all you can see Alex who is   filming me where are you Alex there they are hey 
all right so what I'm going to do is take half a   cube put it on the mirror suddenly if I hold it 
like that it's a whole cube again look at that   so there I've now got an entire cube made from 
half a cube and all I have to do is carry the   mirror with me but could we do better before we 
do do better a reminder if you want the physical   Stand-up Maths Christmas card this year with the 
Christmas tree net that folds into two different   cuboids you have until the end of today the 6th of 
December to sign up on Patreon to the appropriate   level if you just want to be emailed a copy of 
the card that goes out to all Patreons and sign   up by like the 15th of December to get that thank 
you so much for all of your support right back to   past Matt and their planes of reflection I'm only 
using one of the planes of reflection of the cube   so if you cut all the way through here it's 
perfectly symmetric but there's not just that   direction we could do this direction as well but 
for that we'll need two pieces of mirror foreign we have two pieces of acrylic very badly cut 
in half with a jigsaw and it means I can now   cut this in half again there and there 
now I just need to stick these together   we can now take a quarter of a cube pop it between 
these two perpendicular mirrors and there it is   we have an entire cube again check it out a whole 
cube but is that our only option well so far we're   only using the orthogonal planes of symmetry in 
a cube so like there's one that way there's one   that way there's one that way down each of the 
three um different axes however there's more   there's the diagonal ones so there's actually two 
diagonals every single direction there's a total   of nine planes of reflection for a cube so what 
if we wanted to combine some of those so I ran the   numbers on if we took the four diagonal planes 
of symmetry coming in for each of these four   edges at the top they all meet in the middle so 
I thought I could cut four triangles out to make   that little kind of inverted pyramid at the top 
and I cut them earlier today here are the bits I   just need to peel off the protective plastic 
stick them together see if it works foreign I think that's it so I've stuck together the 
four triangles to form like if you go down that   way it's a pyramid it's actually that bit there 
from the top so I've actually I've designed it   a little bigger than this right so that means 
if I get a single one of the faces so just one   square I should in theory be able to pop that in 
there there it is and now I've got an entire Cube okay I don't know how well that works from over 
there looks pretty amazing from where I'm sitting   that's a cube okay I will admit 
it's not perfect it's not bad   has a few flaws so first are all the edges are 
kind of double edges because each of the paper   tubes is itself reflected in the mirror so I could 
have you know meticulously cut them all in half   but technically they're you know infinitely 
thin lines if you ignore the double edges and   the alignment's a little wonky because uh look 
I just cut it I have a piece of acrylic with a   jigsaw which is not the most accurate way to do 
this you could get it laser cut you could get   it cut by someone who's not me but I wanted to 
work out if it could just be done at home just   give it a go buy some acrylic off the internet get 
a jigsaw see what happens and I think oh running   the numbers was fun so I started with a unit Edge 
on the cube and they did all the calculations how   far away is the center from the corner and all 
that jazz reasonably straightforward and you   end up with this very simple design I think it 
works pretty well however we're still only using   a single type of plane of reflection so you've 
got this is four of the kind of diagonal ones   that come across all merge together the one we had 
before this was two of the right angled ones put   together but now could we be even more efficient 
by combining the two and it turns out we can yes okay so I worked it out so this when I originally 
designed it I have made the mirror image of what   I designed that's fine still works it's all 
very symmetric so that should sit there so   that's touching the center of this Cube and 
then it's going up three different planes of   symmetry it's a bit hard to see but the one that's 
contacting an edge is this one over here that's   what's leaning against an edge so I need to do is 
get a tiny it's all I need imagine traveling with   that piece of cake you could take that and you're 
carrying on right so I'm going to put that lining   up with the same Edge in there like that and now 
when I look in there oh my goodness it's a cube   you're gonna have to trust me 
uh wait that's a bit I think   I've made it a bit smaller I'm gonna 
make it bigger so it sits higher up there it is okay so you're gonna have to 
believe me totally looking at a cube right   now uh I thought that moves over the lineman 
oh my goodness that moves really easy okay I   gave up with the straw and I've got a little bit 
of Post-It note that I stuck to the mirror so it   doesn't move around you can see there's one Edge 
which you got there and then it continues up over   there so there's two two half Post-it notes make 
one Edge and then you can see a right angle in   the background there and then it goes across that 
way and then there's a right angle way back there   there's the next Edge over to there oops just 
have a shot is that there another right angle   comes over there right angle back to where we 
started so that's like the top face of the cube if   you as you look below that in the you can just see 
in the background there okay there you can kind   of see the other face going down from where it is 
there's that side on the side and it comes up over   there and you know it's the ones in the background 
are a little disjoint because technically you've   got like what's this this is 1 8 of a face oh my 
goodness so you've got a eight times six you've   got 48 of these that make up the whole Cube 
that's ridiculous and so yeah there it goes   that's around there around there oh my goodness 
but I think we can all agree uh on reflection   big success I've been casually interested in what 
I call kaleidoscopic geometry because it's a bit   like those old children kaleidoscope toys but 
I better say but much more precise give or take   I've been casually interested in these for a very 
long time actually five years ago oh my goodness   I was at the Museum of math Mo math in New York 
I was there for a meeting and at the back they   had some of these sorts of things set up and I put 
like a four second video up on my at the time very   new second Channel on YouTube showing how to 
flat pack a cube where I just comically pulled   the square out of the kaleidoscope and the whole 
Cube packed down into a square I was reminded how   amazing these mathematical kaleidoscopes are 
recently when I was at the bridges conference   in Finland that's a combined math art conference 
so much fun there were people there for from the   Museum of mathematics of Catalonia that's 
a maths Museum in Spain and they had taken   this in a whole new Direction so instead of 
something like this where you kind of get one   shape inefficiently or something like this where 
it's a bit more efficient they decided to see how   many different shapes could you get from the same 
mathematical Kaleidoscope with a priority placed   on the platonic solids those are the shapes where 
every single face is a regular 2D shape and every   single face is identical also all the vertices 
are identical and the Archimedean shapes that's   the same idea that you can mix and match different 
regular faces so instead of just having squares or   just having equilateral triangles you could have 
squares and equilateral triangles and they wanted   to see how many they could get into a single one 
and you can get more than one shape so when I was   messing around before when I put the straw in 
I put it in the wrong way and it looked like a   rhombic dodecahedron and I've messed around with 
it a bit more and where is it if I put it in this   way so I put it in a different direction on 
a different angle like this there it is I'm   now looking at a rhombic dodecahedron which oh 
here we go I happen to have totally by accident   I swear in the background you get one of these 
same symmetries as a cube isn't that amazing   because the symmetries are the same you can get 
it from the same Kaleidoscope in fact you can get   noctahedron if you're careful because it's the 
same symmetries as a cube and you don't have to   use every symmetry every time so you could have 
an abundance of symmetries and just use different   ones each time to get different shapes and that's 
what these folks did and they released a paper   I'll link to it below if you want to check it out 
it's called deltoid kaleidoscopes where they're   trying to work out what's the most like reflective 
shape bang for your back in a mathematical   kaleidoscope and they came across two very 
interesting ones there's the deltoidal I oh I get   this one wrong I Costa tetrahedral kaleidoscope 
and then there's the absolute winner where is it   the deltoid hexacontehedral Kaleidoscope that's 
one with 60 faces and when they built it it is   absolutely amazing here is the Kaleidoscope on 
display in the Art Gallery at Bridges 2022 and I   filmed myself looking inside of it and you can see 
that is an icosidodecahedra and regular pentagons   regular triangles check it out pretty amazing 
and it's all from that one kaleidoscope and you   can see next to it loads of other wooden pieces 
you can put them in and get different shapes   they've done an amazing job with this but only 
wanted one so I downloaded the paper looked at the   mass realized the geometry was quite difficult 
emailed my friend Sam heartburn and she said   she would render a lot for me and give me the 
Nets and here they are this is the one for the   hexachondrahedron and its four faces to make that 
Kaleidoscope uh two identical faces but you need   to do one reflection of each huh reflection it's 
a mirror and because she said do you also want the   other one I'm like yeah why not so she gave me the 
other one I cut these templates out drew them onto   more mirrored acrylic here are all the bits and so 
in theory I can stick these together and have two   more of these mathematical kaleidoscopes um now 
mine have not been as accurate as the other one   so I'm going to mix it up this time I'm going to 
peel off the protective film and then I'm going to   try taping because the tape is clear the inside of 
the mirrors which will make the alignment easier   but might mess up the reflections a bit but I 
think it's worth the risk let's give it a go okay so what's great about these is as long as you 
print each one and its Mirror Image they only   go together one way it's the way where all the 
sides line up so that's the same length as that   so that has to go there it is that's the same 
length as that that's the same length as that   that's the same length as that okay so in theory 
the whole thing just kind of folds up now so I'm   going to stick them all like this fold them up 
stick them together to better explain what Sam   actually did I can recap what I did with a cube 
using the orthogonal plane of symmetry one of the   diagonal ones and then another diagonal one like 
a slopey down one on a different orientation and I   took the section that the three of them bound and 
that's what I made out of mirrors so I calculated   those three triangles built that gave me the 
rest of the cube Sam did the same thing with   this a tria contehedra which just means 60 faces I 
think of it as a dodecahedron where each face has   been split into five kites but there's other ways 
to look at it in fact as well as the decahedral   symmetries you get a bunch of other symmetries 
and so Sam took this kind of equator-ish line   of symmetry around there another one over here 
another one over there fourth one over there and   they bound this kind of wedge this pyramid going 
right into the center but instead of making this   one right to that final Apex Sam truncated it so 
we're just building the frost roomy bit of that or   rather that's what I'm trying to build oh good 
that one comes with a free fingerprint from me   all right oh well it's stuck there now isn't it 
I'm peeling that off again okay now in my version   I haven't got like a frame holding it in the rigid 
correct position so you just gotta flap it around   until it works I'm going to drop this Sharpie 
in I'm gonna see an amazing shape and you are   gonna believe me ah oh my goodness it works that's 
incredible oh if only you could see this somehow I'm so happy right now I'm gonna make the other 
one actually I've realized because of the angles   that's to him very kindly designed if you put it 
down it naturally sits I mean you put it this way   flat packs that's handy there's a theme 
for the day if you put it this way and   you sit flat it automatically sits 
in the correct arrangement with all   the right angles you can then 
drop something in there it is   snub Cube rhombic dodecahedron although it's 
a bit of a shame like because the pens this is   boring colors if only I think this would be 
a lot easier to see you know it glow sticks yes come on ah okay here we go ready I'm so happy right now and in the middle the wood the table of the 
wood makes the original Acosta tetrahedron shape so what am I bringing to this field of making 
shapes in kaleidoscopes other than showing   that anyone can do it which If we're honest is 
frequently what I bring to the table but it's   important you can just grab the the plans I'll put 
a link to the files that Sam sent me print out all   four of each one put them on some acrylic cut them 
out stick them together you're in business anyone   can give it a go but on top of that I was thinking 
well now I've shown that you can tape these   together and you don't need external supports 
right it's literally just the mirrors and clear   tape I thought well it's a real shame you can only 
really see the shape in there if you look down   into the Kaleidoscope which I know sounds obvious 
but wouldn't it be great if the shape was a bit   more real and I thought hang on a second what if 
you could see through the side so I've also cut a   whole bunch of two-way mirror acrylic I'm going to 
peel off the protective film stick these together   put a glow stick in them and in theory I mean 
I've never tried this I don't think anyone has   in theory I'm imagining glow stick goes in turn 
the lights off Mass Rave right you should better   see the whole shape lit up because it's emitting 
like oh come on we're going to give it a go that's   how we're going to end the video little thing I've 
learned even though these are double-sided mirrors   and you think they can go either way only one face 
is technically mirrored and if you put that on the   inside the tape wraps it off so I mean because I 
thought it would mathematically be more precise   to have the reflective surface in the middle just 
practically it's not nearly as good so the second   one here I've put the reflective surface on the 
outside and the holes together a lot better but   anyway they're both built they both work let's 
turn the lights down awesome glow sticks in them oh slow stick maths here it goes by shape ah it's there it's like a 
hologram floating in the air   it's not quite bright enough to go through the 
sides we're hanging closer oh it's coming up like a gateway to another world oops and put that one on top of it the 
different sizes put that one at the bottom yep that one's the snub cue foreign
