Reddit debacle all right so I actually I I don't know anything about this Reddit thing I know that people are all up in arms about the whole Reddit and apparently a great increase in the cost in their API apparently this is the post that started it all and then on top of that we have the CEO coming out addressing the community changes uh API so we're gonna read through this look at it and try to understand what's happening um yeah let's do this so I guess I start here right dear redditors for those who do not know me I am Steve AKA you spez I am one of the founders of Reddit is that how you name it spez am I saying that correctly uh and I've been CEO since 2015 on Wednesday I celebrated my 18th cake day uh which is about 17 years and nine months longer than I expected it this project would last to be with you here today on Reddit even in a heated Moment Like This is an honor I wanted to talk to you let's see I love these kind of these kind of opening statements you know like what what a company makes their entire user base super angry and then just like what a joy head's fault this is Ben and shall be ever more it sounds just like twitch when twitch comes out and it's like you know me and you were in this together okay that is why twitch will have the worst possible terms out of any streaming platform We're In It Together okay okay Dr Bezos um anyways I wanted to talk with you today about what's happening within the community and frustration stemming from the changes we are making to access our API I spoke to a number of moderators on Wednesday and yesterday afternoon in our product and Community teams have had further conversation with mods as well first let me share the background on this topic as well as some clarifying details on 418 we shared that we would update access to our API including premium access for third-party uh third parties who require additional capabilities and higher use limits limits uh reddit reddit needs to be self-sustaining business and to do that we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use okay I mean that's a perfectly fine statement in of itself I think everyone can agree you can't you shouldn't as a company just give out all your information for free because it costs you to store cost you to serve it cost you to do all those things uh cost you to have teams you know actually maintain these data apis all that I get that personally get that okay so where does it get all screwed up at what point does that statement become bad I have no idea all right there has been a lot of confusion over what the CH what these changes mean and I want to highlight these changes it means for moderators and developers okay effectively June 19th well right around the corner our updated API terms together with our developer terms replace the existing API terms free data effective July 1st the rate limits to use free data uh or data API free of charges are 100 queries per minute per oauth client ID if you're using oauth authentication 10 queries per minute if you are not using it I mean I can see why this is kind of a pain just saying like that's a pretty generous amount of data it's like I don't know so I guess what I don't understand is what is a query constitute um just so I understand what is the query constitute here um like is a query a singular article or is it like a list of articles uh an end point yeah yeah I hit to the end point I would assume it's like a list of Articles or the individual like comments maybe I'm not exactly sure like when does a query be a query like if I was perusing comments on a third-party site is that is that also a query but either way 100 queries per minute okay that's pretty good you know that's more than one a second practically two a second and then you could even do 10 uh 10 non-authenticated queries to kind of really bump you up to close to two queries a second okay uh reason why that sucks obviously is if you're you know like all Sites you don't just like get a nice even distribution of data coming in you have like nobody nobody a hundred people nobody nobody right so I can see this being you know the whole a minute thing I can see that being difficult but anyways whatever that's the free date it's here okay premium Enterprise API effective July 1st 2023 the rate for apps that require higher usage limits between is 24 cents per 1000 API calls less than one dollar per user per month for a typical Reddit third party app okay uh some apps such as Apollo reddit is fun and sync have decided that this pricing doesn't work for their business and will close before pricing goes into effect okay for other apps we will continue talking we acknowledge that the timelines we have given uh was tight and we are happy to engage folk who want to work with us yeah I feel like I mean obviously the first faux pas is that probably reach out to people before you know if you're making a big change you should you know just like common courtesy you should reach out like one thing that twitch did I know I'm sorry I'm relating this to Twitch multiple times but one thing twitch did that I think really was bad is that they laid out all their new terms then they went and talked you know like the twitch ambassadors and you know the ambassadors are supposed to be like the the heart of the people right maybe go to them first and then kind of gauge the reaction to what you're about to do publicly you know just so you can understand so I guess since I don't really understand what this means 24 cents per 1000 API calls um what is that that is 2.4 cents per 100.2 cents per 10.02 0.024 cents per call uh Apollo said they use about let's see uh Apollo devs uh said his users are about 370 requests per day per user that could get expensive so let's just do a quick calculation just so we can tell uh 370 times 30 divided by uh let's see 370 yeah that seems about right divided by a thousand so that's he'd have about 11.1 dollars right did I do that about right oh no no times 0.24 so it costs about 2.66 per user yeah yeah I could see that 2 million a month okay so that's a lot of requests that's a lot of requests and so I guess then the question becomes uh per user per day yeah exactly so we're talking about 2.66 per user so I don't know what they're with their stuff that's like 1 million for a bullet okay interesting I guess okay so I have some hard things I don't understand I think one thing that I'm really like losing ability to understand here is that what is what is the average app requesting what did I said in the past that they make about 12 cents per user per day okay so hold on hold on hold on let me actually let it hold on before I laugh at that let me do a little bit of math so if they make 12 cents per user per day that means Apollo would get 24 cents times uh 0.37 right 370 so it cost them about 8.8 cents okay thank you Google thank you for the house plans um okay how about can you just bring up a cat where the hell is my calendar or my calculator what the hell is a calculator all right well uh 24 times uh that was so weird 0.37 so yeah about eight dollars and or eight eight point eight eight cents per user per day so if you if reddit's only making 0.370 I have 0.37 um I'm doing X how how that that seems way worse it should be star what kind of weird world are we living in in which this isn't something here oh my goodness uh calculator I hate I hate I hate Google sometimes uh just doing a spreadsheet we're not doing anything in a spreadsheet I don't want to open up my spreadsheets uh anyways you get the idea 8.88 cents per user per day so if Reddit itself can maximize the profits with AI is going to solve everything absolutely uh if they have 12 cents a day per user and they're going to be charging Apollo effectively nine cents per day per user that means Apollo has to be 75 minimum as profitable as Reddit look at the other link yeah I'm gonna look at the other link now okay so let's check out what the Apollo dev has to say Apollo will close down on June 30th reddit's recent decision and actions have unfortunately made it impossible for Apollo to continue thank you so much for all the support over the years okay hey y'all it's been amazing uh run thanks to all of you eight years ago I posted in the Apple subreddit uh about a Reddit app I was starting uh I was looking for beta testers oh that's kind of fun you guys see that right there in my life completely changed that day I just finished University with an internship at Apple and I wanted to build a red Reddit client for my own a premium customizable well-designed Reddit app for iPhone this unfortunately resonated with people immediately and have been my full-time job ever since today uh a much sadder post than initial than the initial one eight years ago June 30th will be Apollo's last day yeah I mean that I mean that hurts okay so help me help me understand something why doesn't Reddit buy Apollo right was there any idea I mean I wonder if there's ever talks about being bought you know because like it seems interesting anyways let's keep going uh let's just let's see I've talked with a lot of people and come to the terms with this over the last weeks as talks with Reddit have deteriorated to an ugly point and in the interest of transparency with the community I wanted to talk about how I arrived to this decision and if you have any questions uh at the end I'm more than happy to answer this post will be long as I have lots of topics to cover oh it is long oh this is a girth this is a girth post um all right please note that I've recorded all my calls with Reddit so my statements are not based on memory but the recorded statements by Reddit uh over the course of a year one party consent recording is legal in my country Canada also I won't be naming names uh not that's not important and I let's see I don't want to dox people you know what the good news is also if you live in South Dakota where I live it's single party constant uh consent State you know you know what I mean so I can just record anybody at any time uh also weird that you had you know in California where which is where Netflix is out of every single time we have to record a meeting they have to first announce it and if you don't want to be recorded you have to mute yourself and turn off your camera we're all recording you yeah you record us absolutely do you think that where do you think this goes this is going to be on YouTube everyone say hi YouTube right now say hi YouTube say hi YouTube and YouTube hit that like button okay you know what to do all right what initially happened well on April 18th uh Reddit announces changes that would be coming to their API uh namely uh that the API is moving uh moving to a paid model for third-party apps shortly thereafter we received phone calls however the price the key element in this announcement uh to move to a paid API was notably missing uh with the intent to follow up within two to four weeks okay okay interesting interesting the information they did provide us however we will be moving to a paid API as it's not tenable for Reddit to pay for third-party apps indefinitely understandable and agree yep I think we all agree with that so they are looking to do uh Equitable pricing based in reality they mentioned that they are not looking to be like Twitter which has an API so high it was publicly ridiculed uh I was excited to hear these statements and as I agree that long-term Reddit uh footing the bill for third-party apps is not tenable and with a paid Arrangement there is a great possibility for developers uh developing a more concrete relationship with Reddit with better API support for its users I think this optimism came across my first post about the calls with Reddit okay very interesting um is it like before I read on I'm just curious as chat if Reddit okay so as chat with with us knowing exceptionally little details right now okay exceptionally little details if you get 12 cents a day per user what do you think is a reasonable amount to charge for the same API now remember you make your money via ads just to be completely clear right you make your money via ads so when they don't use your application you are giving away your app for free to somebody else to make money off of so what is a reasonable amount of price per day to charge for a user two cents tops why two cents so if you can't make more 69 cents like it lithium nine hundred dollar news hell yeah 10 of their revenue 10 percent of the revenue that doesn't make any sense it depends on the cost uh on their cost per user project no no TJ you would never you don't that's not how that works TJ if you have an application that you've created that brings you in X cents per user and you can have someone else completely remake it and get the entire thing itself you would charge some C of X you wouldn't charge based on how much it costs you would charge based on how much you're losing in Revenue right because everyone that uses Apollo is not using Reddit therefore every user on Apollo is a 12 cents per day hit to Reddit right that's just I'm just guessing you wouldn't you wouldn't charge the inverse of that that's all I'm saying is so what is a fair price just so I understand yeah that's how I look at it that's all I'm saying is for reddit's Point what is a fair price I redact my two cents yeah 14 cents pays to maintain in future updates but that's even more expensive than they make right so their entire platform is is good off of 12 cents 69 is a fair price just no units just six nine if Apollo has a crappy requesting it could be made let's see it could be making a thousand X requests of what Reddit does this is true then you literally can't do it based on well you I mean you have to get them I mean yeah okay so that's fair so TJ I think okay so I think a fair way to do this TJ is that you go okay an average Reddit user makes x amount of requests therefore we say that an average user is x amount of requests that's doing cost but it's based on wins so this is how I personally would charge it if I make 12 cents and the average person makes uh you know 300 requests per day you could make it that way I think what would probably be easier could you make it easier what would be an easier way to do this because you'd want to just align this right so you'd want to go like this okay so if that's the thing if an average user is 12 cents and they make 300 requests a day therefore I should be charging effectively 38 I don't think I could play this song I'm gonna get in trouble with that that's a little too I gotta go back to that I mean to me that would be like the more reasonable 38 cents per thousand or whatever it is I don't know that's why I'm curious five dollars right money loss plus potential extra cost incurred yeah I do ten dollars for one million okay I don't know is the 12 cents gross or net though that's a good question we don't know that okay anyways let's just keep on going uh I don't think you do it based on cost I think you do it based on missing Revenue right right I think I think that's the only thing that makes any sense uh but we'll see what happens here if I write a different app that makes a thousand X requests uh per user uh because I'm let's see yeah uh then how can you do it per user no I'm just saying that's if I was Reddit that's how I would pick the price if an average Reddit user makes X requests and they make me 12 cents and then I wanted to make it to a thousand to make it simple I would just do that little bit of math and be like it costs X right and then you do some sort of coefficient since they're not using your UI arguably maybe that's a little less distribution maybe I mean do you want to make as much money do you want to make less money on third-party applications so a third-party application makes you makes less money per user do you want to make more money per user right that's all I'm saying I have no idea I actually have genuinely no idea how you do it other than that uh Apollo Dev uh already disproved the bad API spamming myth yeah there you go so that's how I would personally charge it uh all right on April 18th hey no problem uh Reddit announced changes that would be cut let's see on let's see on okay here we go namely the apis let's see okay perfect perfect perfect I already I already did this okay so when did they announce pricing six weeks later they called us to discuss pricing I quickly put together a small app uh app where I could input the prices so it would output monthly uh output monthly slash yearly costs cost for free users paid users Etc and so I'd be able to process that information the price they gave me was 24 cents per thousand API calls I quickly input it into my app and saw that it was not far off of Twitter's outstandingly high prices at twelve thousand dollars and with my current usage it would cost me about two million dollars per month or 20 million a year cheese and that is not exaggerated that's just uh simply multiplying the seven billion uh Apollo requests made last month by the price per request holy cow uh I could potentially get that number down absolutely given some time but it's uh illustrative of the large cost at Apollo which uh be charged wow it's a lot of requests I wonder how much Apollo makes does he does he talk about that uh why do you what let's see why do you say a reddit's pricing is too high by what metric reddit's promise was that the pricing would be Equity let's see Equitable and based in reality the reality is that they themselves have posted data about over the years is the following copy pasta okay less than two years ago they said they crossed a hundred million in quarterly revenue for the first time ever if we assume despite the economic downturn that they have managed to do that every single quarter till now for the let's see for your best quarter you've doubled to 200 million let's let's see let's also be generous and go far far above industry estimates and say you've made another 50 million in Reddit premium subscriptions that's 550 Revenue per year uh let's say about 600 million in 2019. they said they had about 430 million active users and so to be generous let's say they haven't added a single active user since then if we do a per user calculation the more users the less Revenue each user would contribute so at a generous 600 million and this many monthly active users that's about a dollar forty per user per year or 12 cents monthly hmm 12 cents monthly is a lot different than than whatever lots of averaging up there's a lot of averaging going on here okay so let's see Apollo's a price would be approximately 2.50 per month per user yeah interesting so if he uses Apollo effectively using Apollos I mean you are doing some sort of selection bias using Apollos because it's an iPhone right it's Apollo iPhone only or is it now Android I would not know hypertext I I have I have alerts disabled I'm sorry I'll thank you and thank you uh iOS only okay so you you do have a you do have selection bias then so what is a what is an iPhone's usage is it different than an Android phone usage I don't know right I have no idea uh but either way you could use Apollo's average monthly or average monthly requests no of course it's different it's absolutely different um interesting uh 20x does not seem yeah yeah so if his request if his like alignment makes sense then this makes total sense 20x is not in reality and I would totally agree with that that is it's impossible to do something interesting oh you Char oh interesting charging the user instead of the application you know that's not crazy you know no no hey real talk time out time taxi not crazy at all right here so there is that there is that Reddit premium right you have to have Reddit premium to be able to have uh a third-party application or something like that right right there's there's things you could do you know to quote unquote get around it interesting uh okay so let's see after 24 hours uh call I received an uh an odd message on Mastodon well yeah you're on Mastodon what the hell is Mastodon can you please comment publicly about the internal Reddit claim that you tried to Blackmail them for a 10 million dollars payout to stay quiet um well there's again Mastodon cool uh oh did I miss oh did I miss something oh sorry yes it was very let's see let's see this was a very uh common comment across uh the topics if Apollo has an apparent opportunity cost of 20 million per year why not just buy them and the other third apps as they did with alien blue I believe it's a fair question if these apps apparently cost so much it's an easy solution that they would likely make everyone happy would be to Simply buy the apps out so I bought that up or so I brought that up during a call on May 31st where I suggested a variety of potential Solutions okay interesting I wish you would have expanded a little bit on that one bizarre allegations okay weird the blackmailing thing then yesterday moderators told me uh they were on a call CEO Steve uh and he said the following uh per their transcripts Apollo threatened us they said they'll make it easy if Reddit gives them 10 million this guy behind the scenes is coercing us he is threatening us wow well he does have all the phone calls in full recording right so he should just be able to release all the phone calls right so if that's the case and you don't want to be you know in trouble just release all the all the phone calls uh let's see wow because my memory is that you didn't take it as a threat and you even apologize profusely when you admitted uh you misheard it it is very easy to take a single line and make it look badly by removing all the rest of the contacts so let's take a look at the full context I can only assume you didn't realize I was recording the call because there is no way you'd be uh so blatantly lying oh nice here it goes here it goes people uh as said uh common suggestion across the many threads on this topic is if third party apps are blah blah blah blah uh what let's see that was the point I brought up if running Apollo as it stands now would cost you 20 million a year as you quote I suggest you can cut the check oh it's you can cut a check to me and end Apollo I said I'd even do it for half that or six months of the uh worth 10 million what a deal I mean it's really not a bad deal that's really in the in the in the in the grand scheme of charging things for software that's not a bad deal you know people usually don't buy things out for less than a year of what a potential Revenue if I'm reading this correctly is so that would be a decent thing the bizarre thing is initially on the call if you interpret that as a threat each giving you the benefit of the doubt that maybe uh see that maybe my phrasing was confusing I ask you to elaborate on how you found what I said to be a threat because I was incredibly incredibly confused at how you interpret it that way you responded that I said hey if you want to do this to go away if you want this to go away which is not at all what I said so I reiterate if you want uh if you want to Apollo to oh whoa if you want to Apollo to go quiet as it's quiet loud in terms of wait what I can't even read that sentence um what did you say then me as I said if you want Apollo to go quiet like in terms of I would say it's quiet quite loud in terms of its API usage oh God go quiet as in that okay I got it got it sorry that's a complete misinterpretation on my end I apologize I apologize immediate immediately I know about to die from a stroke I have literally am I having a stroke am I reading this wrong if you want to Apollo to go quiet as in it's quite loud in terms of API usage okay anyways the admission that you mistook me and the four subsequent apologies led me to believe that you acknowledged you mistook me and you are quite apologetic the fact this is actually wild that a company would go out and like they wouldn't reach out to him or even like instead just start talking about it and to the point where someone on a bizarre social network messaged him I'm gonna get so many Master mastodons angry is that is that is that a mastodon user is a mastodon is that what it is I assume they're called mastodons mastodons right okay just making sure I I don't want to offend anybody because I know very how sensitive mastodons are I mean they're they could get quite angry easily don't want that to happen don't want that to happen Okay the bizarre thing is uh initially on the call you interpreted that as threat oh whoopsies we already read this all right but again I've recorded all my calls with you just in case uh you tried something like this transcript of the part of the call right here okay audio part of this call is right here damn he got the receipts if you take uh if you take issue with the call being recorded please remember that I'm in Canada and so long as one participant in the call me consents to being recorded it's legal if anyone would like the recording of the full call I'm happy to provide I bring uh this up for two reasons I don't want Reddit uh slandering me to internal employees or public people by saying I threatened them with the reality uh is that they immediately apologize for misunderstanding me it shows why I finally come to the conclusion that I don't think this situation is recoverable if Reddit is willing to stoop to such deep lows to slander individuals who with blatant lies to try to get back Community favor back I no longer have any faith they want this to work or ever did holy cow this thing is long oh my goodness this is crazy honestly I don't think I have time in the universe to read all of this hey this is a great call this is a great this is great or I'm sorry for you um you think okay so you think he is lying interesting hold on hold on I got I gotta know this maybe I'm misunderstanding here I want to actually see this new poll who is in trouble Reddit or uh Apollo oopsies I have too many too many double letters because I feel like someone's saying that Apollo is the one that's actually trying to cover his ass versus red it's the one trying to cover their ass I want to find out what do people think here I'll read for a little bit long longer what about mastodons um well mastodons you know they do their own thing they have that mind of their own really they're like a second brain if you think about it you know if you like really think about it you're the one in trouble I am yeah I guess I forgot the needs more info wow so there is about 10 percent of the people on Reddit side and about the other 90 on uh on Reddit side interesting always in trouble ban the 10 10 of weirdos space can suck on sakandis and master dogs is the mastodons yeah you got to be careful about the master not only Apollo but the other boss as well interesting I voted wrong [Laughter] I didn't understand what it meant um yeah I haven't listened to the audio completely Fair haven't listened oh that's fine let's see 10 misunderstand just like uh just like speeds okay I'm calling him spies I'm not gonna lie to you if you're going so far off topic I cannot help you okay let's We're not gonna listen to the audio but I let's let's try to Let's I want to look at is is there like a speed one we can look at someone sent me a link to something is there some like speed is my balls oh no it just like goes on I analyze this post and here's what I see insultment towards a man with a brain the size of his net worth this comment was made by a bot I have full analysis I just don't know how to send them [ __ ] you insert my calendar [Music] okay interesting by the way I can impersonate Minecraft villagers I know you're impressed right now wow it just keeps on going wow okay very impressive uh let's okay I'll also read just a touch more of this whole Apollo will close down business because this is crazy all right hold on addressing the community okay okay okay okay what is this uh what were you thinking with your attempt to discredit Apollo by claiming that Christian threatened and blackmailed you the confusion was sorted out during Christian's call with Reddit yet you proceeded to claim that he blackmailed Reddit for the following week to me and the rest of Reddit it comes across as a blatant attempt to pit us against him edit typo this joke is the least of our issues his behavior and Communications with us has been all over the place saying one thing to us while saying something completely different externally recording and leaking a private phone call to the point where I don't know how we could do business with him up 2 000 down 5 000. wait no wait yeah okay for a quick question why does this one get 2.3 K and why does this one get negative five three five seven right all right read the third one uh please feel free to give us examples where I said something differently in public versus what you said I give you full permission upvoted via Apollo got him uh careful Steve might edit your comment to say upvoted via official Reddit app edit thanks for the Platinum but please stop buying Reddit Awards oh that's hilarious let's see space uh you can gargle my nuts oh my goodness is there any more is there any more any more of this any more talks with him I mean I've never seen a Reddit post get this many downvotes what is these sparkles third comment is Apollo Devi I know that I know he gives him the full he gives him the full monty allows him to do whatever he needs to do sorry I don't know how to use Reddit it's extremely difficult comments they should charge themselves for such a shitty user experience uh all right let's see we will continue okay well I mean I don't like this idea of uh you know if if Reddit isn't profitable I don't care that they want to uh you know improve speed that's fine I don't care about that uh is there anything in here that looks important okay well this is a year ago this doesn't seem right so uh there we go uh yeah I think uh and no it's all just PR responses yeah Reddit isn't profitable speed is uh is uh is such a fraud um yeah I'll do one more look at something we already did this right we already looked at this we already looked at all this right accessibility old Reddit isn't going anywhere our explicit content still allows for Reddit as long as uh it abides yeah okay um interesting okay well here here's the thing right is gonna take here's the deal is that we we do live in a world where I so I'm just gonna I'm gonna do a brief defense of Corporations and then I'm gonna do a brief defensive users okay because I like to try to think about things from multiple angles here so brief defense of Corporations uh take twitch take Reddit um they're constantly driven by their shareholders by everybody around them by people in the public buying stock by all this right that are consistently trying to get profits higher make more money I get that is it good well it can be good but it can also be bad right it kind of sucks and so I understand that you know it can make you make dumb decisions Reddit if it truly isn't profitable they need to get to the point of being profitable I get that I'm on the team become profitable uh but on the side of the user making an application that expensive seems kind of crazy right just just full on right there's there's no like if you're gonna do it you have to make it so that effectively you replace your profit and then some some coefficient now I don't know what that coefficient is right so when you go to a grocery store you're getting like a 50 60 70 markup on everything you buy would that have been Fair right like do you do grocery store models what model do you do does like Reddit take to say this is how much we would have made if we would have done it here is how much we're going to make coefficient called it exactly let's go right and so like to what percent do you take um it's a it's a very difficult it's two percent it's not two percent yeah in Germany it may be two percent but uh talking about here in America right uh hey hey Dax is two dollars per user per month really crazy uh yes it is crazy when you're talking about millions of users right it's hard to make a lot of money off of a user so just to put it into perspective on YouTube typically ads they charge people something like ten dollars per thousand ads shown so can one use that's a video ad remember that's a video ad so can one user how many ads can they see one user right and how much does it cost for a text ad that someone can scroll past versus a video ad that they have to minimally wait for some amount right um ad revenues Jack said no it's actually quite a bit uh right uh so with a zero with ad block yes so Adblock is part of the problem in all this right um so it's kind of like an interesting question right which is what is how much does Reddit make per ad probably not a lot and so how do they become how do they become profitable how much do they charge users I don't know I'm not I'm not an expert I forgot where I was even going with this all I know is that uh Reddit has always sucked Reddit has always sucked so guess what guess who guess who don't care guess who don't care I don't I don't care honestly real talk I don't care I've always hated Reddit I just think it's just the worst place on Earth uh they need to dissolve yeah um Reddit is best social platform okay cool um anyways that's my personal feeling about it I don't really care about Reddit I feel bad for this Apollo guy uh I feel bad I feel bad for the countless Reddit employees that are probably getting [ __ ] on right now that had nothing to do with it right I don't I've literally never been to 4chan um so I don't know right I have no idea I have no I have no strong opinions on this one sorry hey the name the name because I will literally never use Reddit a gin by the way you can go use my subreddit my subreddit is still open so if you if you go here my Reddit is still open you can go here and you can post things for me to react to right here see look at that look at all this look at all these things there's tons of them my last day at Google oh I want to look at that one the name you know what the name is wife's name out of your mouth
