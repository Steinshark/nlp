this is the nascom2 this is a computer that's uh not the computer but the same kind of computer that is the first machine i actually saw um and had the opportunity to to play with um slightly different the one i had or had access to had it was in the main in the box and you can see the boards inside and you can see the leds blinking as as the different operations occur but this one's been made in a proper plastic case and looks a little bit more professional than i was using um but the thing is you never see two nascams really looking the same we've got i don't know how many half a dozen machines nascom's uh and no none of them look the same some of them are in wooden boxes uh we really clutch together with some dodgy keyboard other ones are in nice cases others are just the bear boards they were just made to you know get them working and that was about it this one was working we had it on display and jeremy was doing a talk about this particular line of machines and how things progressed and said that people sort of made these machines themselves they were kit-4 machines um and some of them didn't work and just after he said it didn't work because he'd taken the dead off and shut it closed it down again walked on and it went bang and uh and didn't work um and the reason for that is we've got quite a clutch of things in here so again this is a little bit like the outer this is something a machine that you sort of built and then you modified you made it better so underneath the hood here we've got a whole mess of stuff and what happened was where we had it connected out to the monitor of our composite video when the case come down again we managed to shorten the supply out um so the power supply over here has got a nice little burn mark where it took it out so just got to fix that and that will be okay but yeah so you've got the original board which is under there um it has a 48k memory expansion on it um and then on here uh we've got some a color video adapter on it to actually give an escrow color which is quite amazing um so yeah that's how and that's gone too z80 based and they were actually again pretty pretty impressive machines for the time i used to play a game on it called keys of crowl um kind of this uh sword and sorcery game you go around the maze and collect the elixirs and kill the monsters and stuff but just to have this stuff on this little tiny black and white screen a little bit like this one here um was amazing you know i was like eight at the time hadn't really seen anything else like very shortly after i managed my dad bought us a grandstand pong thing and that was brilliant but that was the first i saw and it was seeing computers controlling tvs or screens it sounds crazy it's really hard to get this across to anybody that didn't experience at the time but it was like a new thing a completely revolutionary um so to have this computer screen controlled by me my character was moving where i wanted to go and then you know he showed me a little bit about how to uh load the operating systems and things like this was just mind-blowing so what what era would this have been then is this seven were talking 70s yeah this was about 77 um i think i got access to it in about 78 maybe 79 something like that um and um yeah and again it was sort of the domain of enthusiasts electronics engineers people that had the ability to put this stuff together um quite a few people tried that didn't have those skills and failed you know you end up paying quite a lot of money for these machines you know these these were several hundred pound to buy in kit form um and uh yeah and end up with a big box of nothing uh and and that's trying to find somebody else i could try and repair it from but um these things were for me the very dawn of it all and you know set me on a trajectory that ends up in the computer museum at the end of it i'm sure kind of trajectory that is it's not that great the other thing that strikes me i certainly remember back in the late 70s really only have one tv in the house yeah so of course you'd be sitting there in the lounge in front of your parents big telly getting in their way yeah that's what i did with my vic-20 later on yeah and they hated me for it because it was getting in the way of whatever it was poldark at the time or whatever it was you know and and and i was getting grumpy because i couldn't use my computer when they were watching the things they wanted to watch uh yeah it was it was one tv um my uncle had their tv downstairs and he had this in his own room with his monitor this was big time stuff it was great most people at that time didn't have that kind of luxury it was dallas or the computer yeah basically i mean she finds out that her daddy you know i'll go for the computer every time but but the rest of the family didn't quite see it that way um but uh but yeah i mean you end up getting those little black and white portable tvs yeah that become your monitor so for things like this x81 here we've got the black and white portable on that and it's kind of a bit fuzzy and ragging around the edges but it was usable they were the monitors of choice i suppose for most people in their home computers so quite a few of us had home computers of color really only saw black and white for most of the time because we were relegated to the dining room and a little black and white telly but uh but hey at least you still had your computer and you could do what you wanted to do he thought he might sell a few of them but ended up selling huge numbers of them to a bunch of computer enthusiasts basically and actually not so much computer enthusiasts they weren't at that time they were electronics enthusiasts they didn't know they were computers enthusiasts until this thing had hit so beginners all-purpose symbolic instruction code i've got a feeling that was kind of retrofitted to the word basic run the other way
