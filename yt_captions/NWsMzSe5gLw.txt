oh my god i love it we got there but we're blurring all these shots because damn it if we're gonna have to go through what it took to get here then you're gonna have to go through it with us yes watch this damn video oh yes stress oh my god we're not out of the woods yet no i still need this to actually light up right and then i'll feel yes no that's just the monitor powering on but he was trolling premature yeah i'm a pretty big tick tocker myself actually no no i've seen your stuff yeah it's pretty good yeah yeah i don't even know what i'm doing on that platform so it's fine oh more than me i knew nothing about this he just like comes into my office oh it's a filter oh my god i thought you were actually doing that and so i just look at this later and it's oh that's good oh thanks honestly that's good though i actually do not know what i am uploading sometimes that's the best all our storage is showing up our two m.2 is our two satas all of our ram is showing up that's good yay uh no keyboard detected press f1 to run setup i just wanted to know if this thing would post it does it's beautiful yeah these are going to glow too once we get into windows oh we got the drivers installed this thing is going to be like it is decked out do they still say lit i think so do you think so yeah okay sure but are you out of touch it's gonna be lit yeah 100 okay where's your main monitor going to be in your perfect magical fantasy world where does the big one go up i mean probably over there here yeah and then this is where you're going to stream from them right okay so what we're going to do is we're just going to placeholder these for now okay part of the idea here chris is like rather than picking things up and putting them down 100 times i want to pick things up and put them kind of approximately where they're going to go which leads me to where on earth are these speakers going to go like what is the plan here these are enormous they are i know where did the big monitor go where does it keep it's right here okay perfect yeah let's mount a thing to it i think you guys broke it i did nothing i didn't touch this monitor until just now this was working yesterday asus sponsored this video mini led backlight you got your dolby vision amd freesync premium pro thunderbolt inputs true 10 bit color accuracy delta e of less than one this is god king of monitors where the hell are all these monitors supposed to go though originally these were supposed to be hanging from the wall that's their original mount uh-huh hanging from the wall directed in and chris yo yo yo do you hate that do i hate you should i not say that no you can say anything you want i'm sorry it wasn't no i'm just would you are you more of a horizontal monitor kind of lady or more of a vertical side monitor kind of lady um for reading chat i like it okay uh and then you've got two of those i know so are we going horizontal and two flanking vertical monitors that would be cool okay let's do that this has got to go so here i'm just gonna i'm gonna lift this up can you give it a little shove the love for me please tell me why are you pushing oh my gosh okay that's why i'm scared go ahead go ahead yeah okay i love that your setup is gonna be so much nicer than mine not just mine now really this is nicer than what i have planned at my new place i'm really so much better oh my god does that seem like i'm going to hit the stud right about there oh it's up here i think i'll hit it hold on we got this okay [Music] i get it i missed more holes in the wall where's the stud take the drill away from the sky yeah there is water on the other side of the wall i'm sorry oh there's water on the other side of the wall oh terrific i am the tool [Music] you ready for fun yeah i'm just don't poke a hole in my pipes joan was quizzical like be careful science good good he's losing it i think you need water food anything do you know the song yeah i do you're gonna get any copyright it was so good i'm gonna be like yvonne i got something to tell you i got lucky today and she should be like what and i would be like we managed to put the correct arms on all of the monitors without knowing that there was any kind of difference and that's very exciting this is a not insignificant amount of weight that we are hanging off these toggles ladies and gentlemen wow wow wow that could have been bad but it wasn't look at this mess okay they're not going to stay like that there's a lot of interesting gaming this is not ergonomically friendly okay now that's ergonomic baby i get that beanbag yeah right honestly though that'd be a vibe it looks so good right yeah it i'm it's yeah bringing tears to my eyes all right cala ann you did good you did done you did good like we still got to replace your telus diaper genie does it look like that it does look like a little like diaper trash i heard that from a telus installer no way yeah yeah that's what they call it internally the diaper genie kalanin yep how

pads on our store look it's been a long day i'm just going to get a mouse pad i'm sorry it's the one thing i can get okay but you'll use one of ours right yes 100 obviously okay yeah it's a nice nice description i bet it is all right no doubt in my mind do you have anything that could qualify as decorative that we could put on shelves or like you got anything i have like one thing right now that's it okay this is the only thing that i have so we can like put it up there or you can put it over there why do you own that don't ask questions have you seen your wireless access point yet no oh my god
