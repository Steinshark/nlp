a good way to understand the history of Modern Art is to a lens of desacralization that is a movement away from the sacred art and let's say at least an art that pointed towards the sacred in the Middle Ages you know in the Byzantine era as well and how this this art moved towards secularization uh towards desacralization sometimes implicitly sometimes explicitly in the art and at the same time it feels like that movement has come to an end and so we're going to look at some of the history of some of the artists uh and uh see what that means why do I think that in some ways we've reached the end of desacralization in art and how there is an opening even within the very Narrative of Fine Art and contemporary art that there is a narrative for re-sacralization possible in the moment this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so the first thing to understand when we're looking at this question is to to understand how Ancient Art worked you know not just in the Middle Ages but I would say art in many of the traditional cultures that you know art was integrative and in some ways that is the meaning of art itself the word art means to gather together things and the way that the Ancients understood art was in this way that's why they could talk about the art of rhetoric or the art of of uh you know the art of painting or the art of poetry you know or we could even say the art of making cheese or making wine that is Art was in some ways Gathering multiple elements together towards one purpose one you know One Vision and and so that is that is what it means to be that is what it meant to be an artist someone who had the skill and the capacity to take a bunch of stuff a bunch of materials and gather them together towards a common meaning of course you know but materials in terms of physical materials but also in terms of ideas in terms of words all of that together and so the way to understand the ancient art is that it was integrative not just in its constituent that is not just in the things that made up the object of art but the way in which art function in the world that is Art was participating in society you know if you think of sacred art and it was used in service of God and service of of church functions you know a reliquary was there to hold relics paintings were there to both to decorate important places but then also to remind us of what is important in the images of the Sacred but then also you know if you think of how castles or the houses of of nobles were decorated was there to of course decorate but also to celebrate the things that were important to people the hunt you know the the the jousting if someone you know commissioned a poet to come and give an elegy to the king to a wedding or something music was used for for dancing music was used for celebrating God and so there was a sense in which there was this integrative aspect and so this integrative aspect you know comes you know as in this basic idea in the middle ages of the great chain of being that is the way in which God manifests himself in the world and how things participate in that you know and uh you can see art becomes a means of embodiment of skill or craft and there is a desire to find unity in the multiplicity and this hierarchy is both in the means and the expression that is in the in the very style of the images there was this desire but then also you know in the use of materials and towards the the direction that the direction towards the sacred and so there wasn't only Sacred Heart but in some ways sacred art informed the profane that is church architecture church music Church Art became the model the thing to look to to know where to get the the influences for everything else and so of course a church building would be the most um beautiful and and the most ornate and you know the the most complete building in a city but it would inform the forms and the structures of the rest of the the building the same goes for art if you look at Byzantine art for example you'll notice that if you made a you know um a book that Illustrated the life of Alexander the Great you would use the same tropes that you would use in icons and in sacred art because in some ways sacred art was the highest and it informed the lowest as well this was true both in the East and in the west and it was true really up to you know I would say up to the 13th 14th century if we look at uh for example in Florence the baptistry in Florence you will find you know late in late versions of this type of art where the the baptistry is there to baptize people and then in the baptistry you will find a type of imagery which is looking to let's say integrate the the way the image is made into a deep Theology and it wasn't as concerned with certain questions which would come later in in the art it was concerned with really showing the meaning and and also having us understand the part participation and so the way that it's often phrased by historians you know maybe a little less today but at least for a very long time the way it was framed by Art historians was that there was a shift at the end of this period into now wanting to show the natural world you know the Ancients didn't show the natural world uh they showed this type of iconology this type of uh the way you know focus on theological meaning and not so focused on representing reality the way that it looks and that then in the late 14th century um I would say you know then 15th century especially is when you start to see this kind of stuff of course this is Van Ike um and Raphael and so van Ike is an early example used by Art historians to show the shift that happened where now there's a desire to represent the textures of reality represent the folds in a more realistic way um and that this is a major shift in in art making and then you have examples like Raphael um you know Leonardo da Vinci as people who are now focused on the the material world and trying to represent things in a material world in a different way now it's very important to pause even here and to to question some of the assumptions that we have about the Renaissance and so what's interesting about the Renaissance is that in the Renaissance there's a little microcosm you could call it which is that although it is true that if you look at the beginning of the Renaissance there seems to be a desire to show visual the way in which we experience visual reality to kind of emphasize that emphasize the the momentary emphasize the the capturing the the moment you know because in in the ancient images they tended to represent figures from the front faces that you could see you know that's how you encounter a person so if I'm going to show a person then I show them face first I show them you know in a way that I can see their face their expression that's clear and so that of course in the everyday life you know if you're walking down the street then that's not the experience you have you know although uh you know you could argue that this way of representing is more real because it takes you know it takes into account the fact that this is a representation of a person and what's the best way to represent a person then this is the way that it is but of course when you see a Raphael then all of a sudden you see people uh you know from behind people that you don't see their faces people that you can see the the backs of their heads here you know all of that is going on um and then you can see the bottom of people's feet this kind of stuff that you would never see in a uh in a traditional an ancient image and there's this kind of atmospheric desire to show the sunset and to show you know these kind of natural details of course in Van Nike you see that especially and so the the way that it's often framed is that okay so this is the major shift and then from then on there is kind of this desire to to show natural reality and a a desire to um to show the visual world but I would say that it's not completely true and like I said there is a interesting microcosm that happens in the Renaissance is that it starts this way that it ends with this and so this is what we call mannerism and so mannerism is a part of the Renaissance that people don't like to talk so much about because they don't quite know how to fit it into their narrative and so immediately after the artists start to try to represent let's say what you could call Visual or physical reality they immediately start to deform it they immediately start to stretch it out and to create uh let's say expressive deformations in the art so this is par parmigiano uh who shows excessive proportions here in the body of the Virgin extremely long neck everything is ridiculous in terms of of natural proportions I'm not trying to mock it because of that and then the the body of the baby is completely stretched out these are not natural uh proportions and then you look at someone like archimboldo which goes even further and you know paints figure with flowers and with different vegetables and different types of different types of details and so you could say interestingly enough that these artists here they are these are contemporary artists that is that their concerns are very much the concerns of a contemporary artist today you know archimboldo the things that he's dealing with the questions that he's dealing with are questions that are completely akin to what you would see in a modern installation or or in in much of Modern Art so there's a little microcosm in the Renaissance of the transformation that is going to happen and the transformation is a movement you could say away from the the representation of the Sacred a representation of the visual but the way to understand the visual to understand why it leads to mannerism is that you have to understand that in even in Van Ike is a desire to show the little hairs on the dog and you know the little folds in this clothing and so because there's a desire to show idiosyncrasy a desire to show you know the little details rather than the patterns of the world although it's not of course this is still all very patterned then this will lead to what will lead to idiosyncrasy and so there are many types of idiosyncrasies and this kind of idiosyncrasy the kind of idiosyncrasy that shows exception and shows strangeness and chose a a kind of uh you know especially in archimboldo you know a kind of Fantastical impossibility is of course the end of what we could call idiosyncrasy you know and so the idea that the movement from this to this if that surprises you then you're missing out on what is going on and you can understand now for example why something like the Scientific Revolution or why the enlightenment all leads to post-modernism and leads to idiosyncrasy because the desire to show the the the world in its details it's a rationally in its details and to kind of explore the the textures of of reality uh and looking down at the Earth and trying to explore phenomena will ultimately lead to something like idiosyncrasy because you're not looking above you're not looking at the patterns you're not trying to say embody the patterns you're rather trying to to disconnect yourself a little bit it's not yet completely clear that that's going on disconnect yourself from the patterns and look uh let's say down below and so down below is is of course detail and all of this stuff and then all also you know it's a uh moments that are not captured for the reason of their meaning and so showing someone the back of someone's head you know looking at the at the uh at the uh Transfiguration is is to show like an idiosyncratic moment in that in that Mo in what happened you know because okay maybe someone had their head you know you could not see their face but you know what is the purpose of showing that except to John to just show an idiosyncrasy of the moment um and you also always need to compare it to the way in which the traditional image would tend to show things in a manner that was more uh that 10 tended to be more ordered and tended to show the pattern of reality and this this movement this transformation you know it's there even in the great artists they're in their lives and so if you look at someone like Michelangelo uh you know the pieta has this very powerful image you know in terms of emotion in terms of realism in terms of showing you know you know the the virgin's fingers kind of uh you know in on the skin of Christ you know these little details like the the um the finger of Christ that is caught in her in her clothing like these these little beautiful little details uh have nonetheless something to do with this kind of movement towards idiosyncrasy and the this movement towards idiosyncrasy appears in the the pieta already as something like uh a beginning of that you see it in the way in which her clothing the virgin's clothing is represented so if you look at an ancient image you know here's an image of the Virgin here there was a way in which although it wasn't completely ordered the clothing was showed with a certain uh restraint and so there was there were patterns of fold and everything and so it's not like it was just completely uh straight but there was a certain restraint to avoid you know to show something that is completely chaotic especially in her veil you know especially in the Veil on her head that would have been the case but of course here you see you know her clothing completely frumped and completely mixed and this is of course to show her emotion in this in this crucial moment uh which like I said is very effective but when you get to the end of the life of Michelangelo he is really taking this mannerism to the extreme so if you look at the Florentine pieta which is here you can see you know how twisted and how strange the proportions are look at the proportions of this woman compared to The Man Behind Christ who is who is holding him you know look at how his body is Twisted how his arm is completely Twisted how his leg is folded in ways that are no longer even have the subtlety of what is of what is in this image but really push the deformation of the body to to to extremes this has many corollaries it has many things that it involved um and what I want especially want to show you is of course uh El Greco and so El Greco is a great example of what's going on in terms of art as something like desacralization um because El Greco in his own story moved from being a traditional icon painter to being a Renaissance painter and you can see in his art very strange things going on uh that that we can look at so of course this image here on the left is a version of a traditional icon it's a it has a western flavor to it it shows the Ascension of the Virgin and her dormition down here foreign the clothing of the of the Apostles is done in the traditional style this kind of gathering the way in which the architecture is shown from the outside you know with the gold background all of this represents uh um all this represents a at least a ordering on the pattern so what I want to suggest in this move towards mannerism is really a kind of inversion and the inversion appears visually you can see it visually it appears in you know you could say something like it is in some ways the perspective of the earth you know or the Earth kind of moving up uh and taking the place of Heaven this of course appears in the showing of idiosyncrasy the the the um the emphasis in idiosyncrasy but it can be shown in many ways so if van Nike shows it as showing the little details of the you know the fold and all this kind of luscious uh beautiful stuff then in El Greco you find stranger things now and so if you find what I call Angel upskirts which is one of the strangest thing in medieval patterns so what is happening here in this image why are we seeing up this person's uh skirt of this person's clothing why is this this vision of kind of seeing up and there's a sense in which you really do get a strange inversion that's going on you know and it's the same with some of the positioning for example of these these little this little cherub babies uh you know with the with the leg up and kind of that being very careful of showing here you know what's going on with the legs up and kind of seeing in there it's very disturbing what is happening and so why is this happening you know and it really is a kind of inversion and it kind of a movement From Below all up into the sacred now I know that some people might think that I'm exaggerating but I'm going to show you a few more images of uh of El Greco and you'll start to see that this starts to be a pattern you know and so you can see again this kind of weird stuff here you know these seeing right into underneath the the the the skirts of the Angels like this one is a little is even more egregious over here uh and seeing these these uh these kind of chairs from behind with their legs up uh it's very disturbing in terms of what it is suggesting in terms of you know in terms of focus and in terms of what is important um now there are more egregious examples in El Greco I'm going to show you some more even more egregious examples now these are the most egregious now in terms of what exactly is going on in El Greco and why are we seeing this mannerism what is involved in the mannerism in terms of a kind of inversion now the inversion here appears many ways you know and so you of course you have Christ resurrecting here uh and you know this is a despite the fact that Christ is naked you know there is a kind of you know there is a kind of uh uh you know a centralization the the character is in the middle he's putting his hand out there's something about it which has a Regal quality which isn't completely weird but then what's going on over here why is this character that is upside down you know naked with his head from behind and then you think oh that's strange but then you realize something's even strangers going on what is going on with this person's foot why is this leg going down in between the legs of this upside down character that is there on the ground you know and you might think well okay Jonathan you're just seeing things obviously you're just seeing things you know but obviously this is happening but if if it was just this you would think maybe it's not that big a deal but then why is this man's sword going up here so why is it the same guy has this sword going up into this area and then at the same time has his foot going down into the between the legs of this upside down character now these this is more than than just a coincidence and it rep it shows you this strange kind of upside down thing which seems to be happening already in in late Renaissance art you know whether it is in terms of uh archim bulldoze showing of the human face made of of uh of natural things but here you also have a a strange sexual element to it as well now if you look at this image here of course at the outset you you know I mean this is military scene and you have uh you have the angel upskirts a little bit not as bad as in some of the others we've seen it's when you look down here the things start to get strange they're very strange things going going on down here it's supposed to be a a kind of martyrdom where you know people are being killed but look at here down here what's going on here and so um so if you look at what's going on down here in the image you have these upside down decapitated people and so this is already something I mean to have the person upside down and decapitated is already something but it's not it's not it becomes a lot weirder when you realize that this uh decapitated person El Greco put his head in his crotch which is like why did he put that person's head in his crotch uh and so it's like probably for the same reason similar reasons is why he did as why he was doing this uh I can't imagine anything else and then when you look at El Greco's image of Sinai this is when things really kind of really kind of uh start to appear even more you really see something like the let's say the the winning of the phallic you could say right the the Sexual Energy kind of becoming taking over the sacred image uh you know in the representation in the way that it's done it's it's it's difficult to ignore what it is that's happening in this particular image and so the way to see it you know and so if you still don't believe me like in terms of what I'm trying to show you about these images you have to understand then what happens in the story of Art and in the history of Art and how art no longer appears as integrative no longer appears as something which is trying to unite opposites but rather starts to appear as a form of opposition and this grows of course not right away it starts to it starts to take momentum in culture when you start to see things like Opera appear when then you start to see things uh you know in the the the great painters that are very legendary in the musicians you start to see culture as opposition you know as dialectic rather than culture as unitive and as bringing opposites together and so these are opposites of course that you you will recognize if you're attentive to to culture and that grows and grows until in the 20th century you really reach almost like a a kind of uh it reaches ahead where all of a sudden the you know the the culture becomes dialectic to a point where it it's almost a caricature and so of course in these oppositions or in this dialectic you find the coming about of high art and low art you know this idea of the difference between art and craft or art and folk art uh the difference between something which is meant to be purely aesthetic and then something which is meant to be functional think of how how boring the industrial objects are and then think of how at the same time as this development of the industrial object there is the fetishization of the art object which is supposed to be purely aesthetic without any function in the world and then you know the industrially made object which is purely functional and doesn't try to have beauty or to try have any aesthetic uh a purpose and so of course we have the opposition of Art and Industry the difference between the pure expression the pure artist and the commercial artist uh and and realizing you have to realize that these all these opposites didn't exist before didn't exist before the acceleration of The Narrative of the Renaissance you could say into romanticism um and then into modernism art and advertisement the difference between man-made and machine made etc etc you can look at these opposites for yourself and then this of course becomes a there's a kind of pendulum which starts to swing in culture between what you could call neoclassical uh movements and then romantic movements and so if you look at the Renaissance and the mannerism then you can kind of understand that uh that bet that movement there's a movement towards a kind of Purity and a kind of excessive um let's say explicit X excessive uh order like a kind of weird tyranny and then in it you also have this desire to show expressiveness and and transformation and you see that in the Arts themselves so if you look at baroque art for example if you look at a Rubens you'll notice that it is it looks chaotic but underneath is this Iron Fist of geometry and control which wasn't as much there in the medieval art there was geometry in medieval art but it wasn't as as radical as what you end up finding even in the Roman in even in the Baroque where the Baroque also looks uh let's say also looks like it's chaotic so it's interesting to see those two extremes appearing even sometimes in the art itself um so this now sets up a kind of dialectic where now you have a revolutionary movement in art so you can understand now when I tried to show you when I showed you the El Greco ad you can understand the movement as revolutionary so here's kind of idiosyncrasy trying to take the place the the here's desire this the uh there are different ways to show the bottom of the pyramid you could say but always trying to kind of rise up and take the place of the the tradition of the tradition and the patterning this will then kind of appear in the history of what we could call avant-gardes and so this idea that now there are these these new artists that come about and try to take the The Narrative from the artist before this is what we consider to be avant-garde thinking uh this of course expresses itself so much in the the impressionist the Impressionists appear as these revolutionary figures who are trying to take the narrative from the the kind of more uh classically looking you know academic artists that are there in on the spot um and it's and it's important to understand the themes of the uh of the art the art becomes more and more about the common it comes more and more about everyday life it comes more and more about uh explicit uh sex sexuality and sexual encounters and then it also becomes more and more about the mechanistic this is one aspect which we forget about the impressionist is that they were obsessed with progress and technology and so you know manes show this is uh Monet sorry Monet showing of the the the trains and the smoke coming out of the trains with this celebration of technology and of of technification of society that this can we often think of the impressionist as being more you know kind of dreamy and uh you know and almost opposed to industrialization and technification but they go hand in hand and they saw themselves as going hand in hand um in this but the in this kind of separation of high art and low art but what you see is that in some ways the low art what is considered low is constantly trying to be lifted up into the high despite the opposition that's the Revolutionary move and so as soon as you set up this opposition then you see the the the the the ones below try to take the top and so the the Impressionists were on purpose trying to make paintings that were bothersome to the elites that didn't have the kind of smoothness and finesse that you would see in the uh in the academic painting uh and all of this in this kind of desire to create this revolution you can see of course in Manet you know uh this image which was so scandalous at the time and you can understand why with scandalous you know we're so blase that we don't realize that to show a woman the naked in a in a park with two men is extremely scandalous it's it's a it's vulgar it's trying to imply all kinds of uh of sexual things you know and so the idea that now this is supposed to be high culture you can understand why it was resisted but you can also understand why Manet did it because the very movement of the art is is revolutionary the movement of the art is to bring up the the stuff below bring it up into the elite and so there's this strange relationship which continues to have to happen this of course goes into absolute extremes when we come to Modern Art you know I'm going to look up at a few add a few images of course was a genius at this was a genius at at inverting Art completely and so if you think think of the the art already of El Greco as a kind of inversion you know as this showing of The Angel upskirt and you know this this this kind of turning upside down of the figures this these um these suggestions of sodomy the suggestion of of whatever Auto aerotic whatever that happened in El Greco then become more and more explicit as the works progress and when you get to message then of course this becomes extremely explicit uh you have um you have of course the urinal is the most known of his Works where he just takes something common but not just common but something that is there to receive our our you know our waste and then prize to bring it up into the gallery now doing that is no different than what Monet did or what Mane did and it honestly I don't think it's different than what was happening at the time of the manner is it's just that this wheel of extreme Revolution always has to get let's say move faster and faster and so by the time you get to to Duchamp then you have you have these radical moves which is taking of course the the taking something that's there to receive waste and putting it in a gallery to be uh to be exposed but then also you know the way that he uses graffiti on what for them would have been the traditional art so you have a Leonardo painting which is considered the height of Art and the Heart of the height of of traditional culture even though even at the time it was it was it's meant to be kind of disruptive and and a new type of art now the graffiti on it right then putting an accident on top you know of marking of the figuring of desacralizing that art uh by making the Mona Lisa into a a kind of transgender character and then of course in this inscription below l h o o q it's a French play on words which is relating to sodomy and so it's like a joke on sodomy that is being suggested in in uh duchamp's work you know and like I said this was this was in some ways that is the ultimate move right that's the ultimate uh idea of Revolution you could say uh and the same with DeShawn was also obsessed with the mechanic with mechanical Works showing this um the granjat which is supposed to show uh whatever several sexual encounters between a woman and and different men but then that is broken down into mechanical processes and so this obsession with the the the the sexuality but also the mechanics of it the idea of showing the this stuff down below right the way that things work and the way that things work like a bunch of levers and a bunch of of uh of of biological processes that are represented as just mechanics and Industrial mechanics all right and so this continues there are many examples Francis piccabia is a great example because piccabia he he he was also obsessed with the machine you know you can see here it says it says woman man so this is the woman this is the man and so this is supposed to represent a sexual encounter that is mechanized and that is reduced to it to that kind of mechanistic uh relationship but piccabia was also really good because he he had a he had a really good sense of integrating bad art into the Fine Art and so he took kitschy art you know like bad clown art stuff that was popular culture stuff that wasn't at all considered to lead and then he tried to integrate that into high art um you see this of course he was painting badly on purpose and was doing you know these kind of bad faces and these kind of really bad compositions it was like bad art but he was trying to make bad art in order to to bring about this this revolutionary movement so think about we know you know and if you can see it in that line you can see that there's a coherence in the Transformations that start in the Renaissance as a kind of revolutionary move a move towards idiosyncrasy and towards showing the lower things and then those accelerate and accelerate until you get to this which is in the very means of art there is a desire to be crass and to show uh things that aren't well painted things that are that are not well composed but then try to bring that into the the high art and this of course is just this movement towards desacralization I think that it reaches uh an interesting peak in terms of Andy Warhol and so Andy Warhol was a Byzantine Catholic interestingly enough and so Andy Warhol knew very much about icon there's there's legends that he went to church every day which which maybe I don't know it's possible uh but nonetheless in his art he he is inspired by by icons but what he does and so this is his this was uh Andy warhol's Church foreign in New York that he supposedly went to and so what he does is almost like the a and a return to iconography or ultimate de-sacralization is that he kind of understands in some ways the language of the icon he in a way that that the Renaissance artists didn't totally understand he understands this idea of of a centralized image of something which is just framed simply you know presented to you as something to look at and then in some ways something to venerate of course that in icons but then what he tries to do is he tries to one bring into the space of the icon the common and the you know the glitzy and the the celebrity and then brings that into the in the way that he would paint these these celebrities this kind of simple iconic structure but then he also makes it reproducible indefinitely and so at this at the same time he is kind of has this mechanical process that he's using and so of course here they're Campbell soups they're all different right they're all different flavors but they they they have this kind of mechanical reproduction aspect to them so he's trying to bring in mechanical reproduction itself into the art that's why he was using screen printing he was using these different mechanical processes to kind of bring that into the into the art and so you can see it as a continuation of the revolution but what starts to happen in pop art is very interesting it's very interesting because what happens in papart is that they reach into the opposition of high culture low culture Elite you know High art low art uh Gallery Art popular art and they try of course again to invert the relationship you know until then popular art was still seen as emanating from high art it was still seen as in this opposition it was seen as being influenced from that which is above and now all of a sudden there's a very interesting idea which is that the low art starts to become the influence of the high art and so there's a desire to completely invert the relationship of art which is you know by making popular industrial things it was already there right and it was already there in piccabia and in but then in Warhol it becomes very explicit and and becomes a a technique that he uses over and over um and so but then this is where it starts to get even funnier and where I think there is a surprising there is a surprising shift that happens you know and so the the common object the the this can of soup is an object of participation that is eating food is still something that we can claim is participative you know there is something uh So when you buy a can of soup and you open it and then you eat the contents it is not that that contemplative thing that high art had been from kind of accelerating from the mo time of the Renaissance because one of the oppositions that happens is to make things that are useless right these paintings don't have uses in the world they are they are just objects of contemplation they're not like the ancient images that were there to celebrate God they're not like the ancient objects that were there to participate in the life of an aristocrat or in the life of a you know to celebrate the hunt or to celebrate things that that that the people participated in or a dance music or whatever it is that was there these are these are dogs become useless and this is of course the the thing that dusha is doing himself which is taking a useful object and making it useless uh you know but then that's the weird thing that happens when you get to there so as if you're getting to the bottom you're at the bottom of the process and now you're basically trying to take the lowest thing you can and try to put it at the top uh and then I think a flip happens and I think it happens in in Warhol interestingly enough interestingly enough and so uh like I said you know a urinal is an object of participation it's a low object of participation but it is and so it's like trying to take that which is still low and participative and make it useless uh Warhol is doing the same trying to take that which is low and participative uh and try to bring it up into Elite culture and then also making it useless making it more valuable at least in the elitist eyes then something weird happens which is that Campbell starts to make cans of soup that are based on warhol's designs and so what's just happened what just happened all of a sudden there's this strange reintegration because in some ways what Warhol is trying to do is to praise the soup can praise the common make it bring it up into into the the elite space but he's also denaturing it while he's doing it but then all of a sudden there's this flip where now warhol's designs of the Soup cans get put on the actual cans and so you can go to the store and then you can buy an Andy Warhol soup can and you can eat the food inside the soup can and there it starts to happen weirdly in in other artists as well another pop artist especially so Keith Herring is a good example where Keith Herring is still a gallery artist he's still making art for um you know that have a kind of elitist thing but because he wants to fully invert the process because in some ways he he wants to be the punk rocker who is you know who is with the people and you know elevating the people into this High cultural space he starts to enter into the space of participation and then does you know a lot of these artists even up to Warhol uh would have been cautious at making like t-shirts and and and selling selling objects that had their images on them because in some ways it's a dangerous thing if you want to stay up in the elite but of course it hap it happens anyways with this strange flip of of Campbell's soup using his designs but then it keeps hearing he was doing it himself which is that he was selling T-shirts with his art he was putting it on skateboards on different different objects and so he was kind of bringing the the the low art itself was starting to be revalued a participative art or a more a low art and the the relationship of the inversion started to become messy and you see this thing happened in Liechtenstein so Liechtenstein is this artist here who would copy um comic book panels and would would make them into paintings you know um and so he was trying to take papart and elevate it into the cultural space still maintaining the opposition which is something that happens all the time but then at some point that opposition just collapses and then you have pieces for example this this um this one page of Spider-Man sold for what like two million dollars which is just a page from a comic book that is not high art that is actually low art but now is being treated like high art itself uh and so it collapses the it collapses the opposite ultimately in terms of let's say the flip actually happens the inversion completely happens because these other inversions they they constantly need the duality in order to function and so then the collapse of the invert of The Duality and things like this you know Point towards what we could call a reintegration it's not totally yet a reintegration um and you see something strange of course in Warhol happening in in the in some of his work you know here you could say something that like this is the ultimate de-sacralization Warhol did quite a bit of religious art but then his art is of course to manifest the reproducibility you know the mechanical reproduction of the art object you know very much in line with some of the early theorists talked about this Walter Benjamin who is a who was a a German uh I think I think he was Jewish uh thinker you know that's considered kind of like post-war thinker or during World War II and post-war thinker he really called he was a communist he really called to the um the the movement towards mechanical art and reproducible art in order to destroy the sacred he really understood that this would destroy the very idea of the Sacred but but then in in Warhol you have this weird thing where he brings that to it's extreme but then it's like it's just so weird it's so weird then they make last year there was a show I think in Brooklyn of Andy warhol's religious art they call it Andy were all Revelation and so it's just fascinating to realize that it's like why are you making a show about Andy warhol's religious art because his art is about this kind of leveling you can see it in the work right it's like here is you know a Renaissance image of the Virgin and child you know that next to it has just a kind of you know grocery store price tag which is kind of glued next to it but there's something strange going on in terms of the collapse of the opposite and then a kind of desire to reaffirm the sacred in the very collapse and this is something you know you know I've talked about this weird idea how this kind of double inversion you see that like in the The Soup cans especially but something happened recently interestingly enough uh at uh at my house I got a letter from um I got a letter from the local church you know and I don't know how ironic this was or how conscious it was but nonetheless it happened you know and I got a letter from the church and it was a letter to ask people to tithe you know because there are still a lot of uh Catholics in Quebec and so they kind of send a letter out in the city to ask people to give their tithe and then on the letter was was Buddy Jesus I swear on the letter was Buddy Jesus and uh you know this image is of course used was used to kind of mock the the Catholic church for trying to be cool for trying to to to make its art accessible to people uh and then this priest uses the very image that was used to mock them and then uses it as an image for asking people to die for the church now like I said I don't totally know how conscious the priest was of whether or not you know maybe he is so like Vatican to guitar mass that he thinks this is okay which is hilarious uh or he's a little conscious of what's going on and he's using the imagery of mockery in order to kind of reappeal to participation now I don't I the the the the jury is out on that but I think that the fact that it happened is still pointing towards a a notion of this kind of flip now you know it's important to understand that this is there in Christianity itself that this is in some ways part of the Christian story we have to understand that there is a great desacralization in the Christian story you know and that desirilization is of course the the crucifix itself uh and and the the way in which the modern world move towards desacralization is in some ways a parody of this You Know parody of the crucifixion maybe there might be something more mysterious going on but we have to understand that there is of course this movement in the Christian in the Christian tradition it's kind of move towards idiosyncrasy you know and then like I've mentioned many times before this the surprising aspect of how Christ in the fact that he's derided in the fact that there is this mocking of him as a king the fact that he's given a crown of thorns gets ultimately transformed by Christ into Glory so I think that that's an interesting thing that happens and I think that it's the the very process of trying to revolutionize constantly there is a moment where where we get to the bottom of that and there's a there's a switch that happened and I think this switch um opens up some interesting possibilities to deal with questions of the whole history of Art and how it can be reintegrated in the proper way and so if you want to understand what I'm doing you can you can understand it like that you can understand that in some ways I feel like my work and it's not just me there's several artists out there I think of father siluana justiniano and other iconographers that have come out of Contemporary Art and now see the possibility at the end of Contemporary Art to in some ways reintegrate uh reintegrate art into life and reintegrate and understand how this is what art calls us what art is calling at this moment to become and so if you look at my work through that lens you'll understand a lot of the things that I'm doing and a lot of the different things that I'm doing and so I do think that there is a possibility of reintegrating art into life and to do it at different levels and to do it in a kind of hierarchy you know a hierarchy which even takes into account the developments of of pop art the developments of uh of Contemporary Art um but I do think that there is now a possibility to reformulate a reintegration of the hierarchy of of values and that of course has to do with something like appropriate Beauty for the appropriate thing it has to do with the message but also the function that's why of course I'm making sacred art uh that's very important and so if I make a reliquary you know this is being used in a church you know this is not this is not um and in and what I'm doing is I'm also taking the ancient art and I'm reintegrating it in a way that is that is also never seen before this of course no one has ever made a relic query that looks that has this together it's a reintegration of these ancient things towards a purpose towards participation in the world uh and considering a certain hierarchy you know and so depending on what it is you're making the materials the the vision that you're trying to bring to it will be appropriate to it and if you think of you know here are here's a funerary monument and an altar um I can estas this cross across that goes at the top of the acostasis that tries to integrate materiality and and the Christian Vision into something which is going to participate in reality but there's also a kind of possibility of reintegrating hierarchy so when you make when you make a soup can you have to consider the materials you're making based on the purpose that it has and so if Andy Warhol can make a screen print of a soup can and it's kind of arbitrary maybe not completely but kind of then once they take Andy Warhols um design and they make it a soup can out of it then they have to make the soup can out of aluminum or tin they have to make the paper out of of paper you know they have to put the soup inside the can the soup can be made of paint or else people won't buy it people won't eat it and so there is a there's a possibility and the same with Keith Herring like if Keith Herring made a skateboard with his print designs on it he couldn't make the skateboard out of something ridiculous he has to make the skateboard out of something that can be written if you make a t-shirt you have to make the T-shirt out of something that can be worn you can't make a t-shirt you know out of some imaginary artistic creative thing or else people won't buy the t-shirt and so that's what I mean by this kind of reintegration so there's a kind of new hierarchy possible which takes into account the the the function of materiality you know the symbolism of materials themselves what their purposes are and what they can be used for and so you have this this great thing and then you you have the possibility of creating a kind of hierarchy again between handmade to Mechanical objects all the way down into digital objects so you make and if you're going to make a unique piece for a church that is that that is going to go into the altar you know if you make uh you make a a precious image using semi-precious stones using uh gold using all these these techniques that are unique and they're kind of pointing up towards uh participation in worship um but then also uniqueness then you're not afraid to also kind of devolve that into into other things and so you know if you make if you make a T-shirt If you make a print you can use some of the same images you can use some of this similar similar tropes um but then they get applied differently depending on the purpose that you're trying to apply them and so and then you can also use so here I wanted to show how I use similar images similar structures as my iconography to make a secular image of a siren and then if I apply this type of thinking to prints and to t-shirts then I applied appropriately to that level and the same goes for here's another example where I made a kind of semi-precious image in terms of the angel and then the same on a t-shirt gets applied appropriately and mechanically and that's okay because it's not it's not meant this object is not meant to be liturgical and it doesn't have enough to be liturgical in its in its uh in its structure here's another example of course that helps you show the shift between purposes and how they get integrated and people you know and then even in terms of imagery the the let's say the imagery that I use is different and so when I make an image for a church I will of course let's say use sacred imagery very clearly have inscriptions there are kind of rules that you use in order to make um images for churches and then as you move down towards let's say more popular art and and clothing for example I would make what I could call Semi icons they're not icons in the sense that you know these figures are not people that are represented they are they are kind of they are allegorical or they're analogical representations of the Evangelist um and then angels are also not this is not a representation of a person say Michael say Michael doesn't wear an armor and he doesn't he doesn't uh have wings this way you know this is the way that we represent Angels is analogical and so that's why in my t-shirts I tend to have things that are semi icons that are not icons in the traditional sense you'll never see me making a t-shirt of Christ you know just with his Halo uh it'll always be something that is mitigated you know and so if I make an image of the when I made the image of the um an image of the the of everything you know the the faces they're not completely done I try to I leave some elements out of the face in order to not to not for people not to mistake this with an icon to be venerated um there are different techniques that I use in order to try to make something like semi-sacred images that are lower on the hierarchy but still participate and still remember you know and then of course going all the way down into pop art uh then of course the you know as you know the um the the making of of God's dog was about that was about you know can we get all the way down into very popular um popular art that is remembering its connection to the sacred that is participating in it but at its level it isn't you know it isn't uh it isn't these aren't icons these aren't meant to be liturgical and that's why they're also printed mechanically that's why um they're drawn in a way that is more sensuous that is closer to the Renaissance tradition further from the further from the iconographic tradition but that's the idea that's the interesting possibility is that in some ways we have the the the the possibility of kind of moving away from the irony that came about through this whole history this revolutionary aspect and tried to reintegrate things at the proper level where where where they belong or where they should be and of course there could be discussion about where things should be and I know some people think that I'm going too far with my um with my popular art in terms of the images I use but I think that that's a discussion that will happen and there'll be some play um but the thrust I think is important the thrust of thinking about this of re of understanding how we can reappropriate participative art in different ways um I think it's very important and I think in some ways the state of Contemporary Art almost calls to that right we're at that level where the irony is so strong the inversion is so strong uh but then there's also a weird moment of of double inversion that's happening that's kind of calling towards new participation so hope this was helpful and interesting in order to kind of understand you know why I'm doing the things I'm doing but also how the history of Western Art has a coherence when you start to think about it in terms of this simple revolutionary move which started I think somewhere around the time of the Renaissance and continued until today so thanks everybody for your attention I'll talk to you very soon
