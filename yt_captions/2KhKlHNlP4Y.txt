this episode is brought to you by brilliant in 2022 over 2.3 million tons of synthetic foam was produced globally by volume this is roughly 76 million cubic M or about the volumetric equivalent of 29 Great Pyramids of Giza foam is a key component in a broad range of manufacturing processes it can be found in Furniture thermal insulation acoustic products impact protection components seating and packaging materials as well as numerous other mass-produced products that we frequently use and like many of the common materials we use daily the story of foam is far more complex than it seems evolving from A Century of research that iteratively enhanced its physical properties this natural phenomenon has become a critical material to the modern industrial World Foams are a type of material known as dispersed media these materials consist of a dispersed phase substance that that is distributed in another continuous phase substance this concept is commonly encountered in colloids where fine particles are dispersed in a film medium such as droplets of oil in a water-based Emulsion and solid particles in a fluid suspension in a foam gas bubbles are the dispersed phase substance and they are trapped within the continuous phase of either a liquid or solid substance giving foam its unique structure and characteristics in most Foams the volume of the dispersed gas is far larger than the liquid or solid material separating the regions of gas foam formation is a common process in nature seaf foam for example forms from the organic breakdown in oceans and wave agitation tree sap can also foam in certain species as a response to bark damage whipped egg whites in mering represent culinary Foams while the froth in fermented drinks like beer arises from carbon dioxide release during fermentation soaps are forming from the trapping of air by agitation in surface tension reduced water is also another common foaming action to form a foam three conditions are essential mechanical action surfactant to lower surface tension and Rapid foam generation compared to its rate of breakdown essentially work is required to expand the surface area Foams are considered multiscale systems as they possess various levels of structural hierarchy spanning from the molecular to the macroscopic scale the scale begins with the individual surfactant molecules that form the stabilized gas pockets and pans backwards up to the interconnected network of cells that form the bul ofoam at the intermediate level of the scale is where the equilibrium of the continuous film creates a foam's structure in this structure where the liquid film Junctions with three or more other bubbles are called Plateau borders while the face of the film between two bubbles is known as as lameli when four Plateau borders meet a Vertex is formed foam bubble shapes depend on the relative volume of liquid and gas they contain typically the gas volume in foam ranges from 50% to 95% by proportion foam films tend to minimize their surface area given a boundary leading to a spherical shape with lower proportions of gas when this volume exceeds 75% the bubbles begin to deform each other as liquid drains bubbles merge and the foam takes on a polyhedral shape at the edges this polyhedral form arises from fluid moving from the bubble walls to the vertex driven by pressure differences caused by the curvature of the bubbles a foam bubble's stability is determined by two counteracting forces acting upon it its film surface tension and the excess pressure or the pressure difference between inside the bubble and outside the bubble surface tension drives to minimize the surface area of the bubble however the excess pressure counteracts it and equilibrium bubble size is reached the stability of foam depends on multiple components that affect its film surface energy film elasticity is an example of a key property that is the result of this Dynamic film elasticity creates a self-repairing behavior known as the marangoni effect that contributes to Bow stability in soapy water for example the surfactants or molecules that have water attracted and water repelling ends position themselves based on their attraction to water if a force thins AP part of the bubble walls it increases both its surface area and tension this change reduces the surfactant concentration at that spot to balance this the surfactants move towards the thin area dragging with them some liquid this movement effectively repairs the weakened spot for a liquid to foam it needs surfactant p pure liquids will not foam the amount of solute in a solution influences its ability to stabilize a foam at low concentrations there's minimal impact on foam stability however at very high concentrations the foam might destabilize due to overly fast diffusion optimal elasticity is reached just before the critical myel concentration Beyond this point adding more surfactant does not affect the foam's elasticity but leads to more myol formation or clusters of surfact molecules within the solution an ionic surfactant will add stability to the film because of the repulsion of the two films surfaces as they thin however these vanderwal forces only contribute to foam stability only at thicknesses of 200 NM or less the presence of absorbed surfactant at the surface interfaces can also increase intermolecular forces within the foam bulk by making the surface layer more viscous and rigid a practical example example of this effect is cappuccino froth in which milk proteins stabilize the foam ensuring it lasts after steaming milk contains water fat globules and proteins when heated these proteins break and the molecules unravel reinforcing the bubble walls and stabilizing the foam The increased viscosity slows down drainage and collapse though if the viscosity becomes too high the self-healing surface transport mechanism diminishes as the foam becomes more rigid in a forming foam bubbles with smaller radi have higher internal pressures as the bubbles merge larger bubbles grow by absorbing smaller ones because of this pressure difference gas from High Press bubbles tend to move to these bubbles with lower pressure when surfactants are present they pack closely to the bubble walls reducing this gas movement typically lighter surfactants are more effective at this because they can pack more tightly onto the surface preventing foaming is also a highly desired property in many processes anti- foaming agents attempt to create failure points in the foam stabilization mechanism in order to accomplish this the common rupture mechanisms to collapse Foams are spreading and lens formation in spreading A disruption to the filam surface tension gradients is created forming a region with low surface tension the antifoam agent produces this area and instead of self-healing the changed tension pulls fluid away thinning and eventually breaking the bubble in lens formation the antifoam agent creates a lens between interfaces due to capillary pressure fluid flows from the antifoam area to a lower pressure region over time the film will sufficiently thin and form a hole causing the bubble to rupture a foam in which the continuous phase medium becomes rigid through various stiffening processes is known as a solid foam these Foams are typically classified into two types based on their pore structure open celled structured Foams or reticulated foam and closed celled Foams open cell Foams have interconnected pores resulting in a softer texture these Foams can absorb any surrounding gases in contrast closed cell Foams possess isolated pores contributing to their greater compressive strength they're typically denser and more costly due to their composition these Foams can be enhanced with specific gases for Superior insulation they stand out for their robust dimensional stability minimal moisture uptake and greater strength than their open cell counterparts when viewed from a macroscopic level solid Foams can be treated as a continuous material that are referred to as cellular solids with predictable mechanical properties the mechanical qualities of foam are gauged using compressive stress strain curves initially when foam is compressed it responds elastically due to the bending of its cell walls following this as these walls Buckle the the material weakens and starts to give away ultimately when cell walls press against each other too intensely the foam breaks from early in human history Natural Cellular solids such as cork wood bone and sponges have been an integral part of tool and structure construction however it would not be until the late 1800s for manufactured foam to come into use the first manufactured foam products were created from natural rubber latex and were a direct result of the process of Volcan ization pioneered by Charles goodar in 1839 vulcanization revolutionized rubber's properties making it more durable and elastic this laid the groundwork for the development of various Rubber products including foams foam latex is made by blending a liquid latex base with additives whipping it to introduce air and then setting it in a mold to vulcanize and solidify the Main Ingredients include the latex base a foaming agent for frothiness a jell agent to thicken it and a curing agent to ensure it vulcanize and hardens when baked depending on the final use other special ingredients might be added known as the Dunlop process this method for creating foam latex created a continuous uniform batch in a staged operation that was inexpensive and efficient while natural latex Foams had many commercial possibilities such as energy absorption and thermal and acoustic insulation it would not be until the late 1920s for synthetic Blended variants of the product to begin to grow in popularity particularly for film makeup and prosthetic use the mid1 1850s also saw the discovery of urethanes by French chemist Charles Adolph warts these first reactions between an isocyanate and a hydroxy compound would form the basis for the synthetic foam development boom that would occur almost a century later the beginning of the 20th century would also see the emergence of other new synthetic polymers that would soon become the foundation for a new class of Foams known as polymeric Foams the first successful polymeric foam product was based on polystyrene a resin that was first synthesized in 1839 by Edward Simon initially called styro Simon did not realize the potential of his Discovery as the substance was more of a thick oily product than a usable plastic over the decades more efficient techniques for synthesizing polystyrene were developed this would lead to McIntyre and his team at Dow's chemical physics lab developing a method to produce foam polystyrene in the 1940s building upon a technique originally discovered by Swedish inventor Carl George mters da secured an exclusive us license for monter patent and by 1947 filed a patent of their own enhanced method to mass-produce moisture resistant extruded polystyrene foam branded styrofoam it should be noted that the trademark styrofoam foam by dowo Chemical Company is informally used in the US for all foamed polystyrene products although it technically only applies to extruded Clos cell polystyrene Foams made by Dow chemicals extruded polystyrene or XPS production starts by mixing polystyrene pallets with additiv including colorant and Flame retardants this mixture is heated in an extruder until it melts as the molten mixtures push through a shaping tool a blowing agent within it vaporized causing the material to expand into a foam once it exits it cools down solidifying with a smooth surface the solid foam is then trimmed to the desired size and if necessary given additional treatments for specific applications another common form of polystyrene foam is known as expanded polystyrene or EPS EPS production starts with raw polystyrene beads that are mixed with a blowing agent usually penting in a pre-expander machine steam is introduced causing the the beads to swell up to 40 times their original size as the pantan inside them heats up and expands after this initial expansion the beads are set aside in large bins for several hours to days allowing the pantan to distribute evenly a process called maturation once mature these beads are placed into specific molds and steam is applied again making them expand further and bond together to take the shape of the mold the resultant structure is cooled solidifying the foam after cooling the foam is precisely cut or sh shaped based on its intended purpose polystyrene Foams are 95 to 98% a by composition and are ideal for building insulation use packaging in food containers they are however not waterproof due to the interstitial gaps between the expanded closed cell pallets in which moisture can become trapped extruded polystyrene typically has higher compressive strength and a lower moisture absorption rate than expanded polystyrene as a result it offers better long-term insulation performance when exposed to moisture expanded polystyrene generally has Better insulative Properties though this can be decreased slightly with moisture absorption however expanded polystyrene is often more cost-effective than extruded polystyrene and can be custom molded into various shapes and sizes for specific applications in 1937 German chemist Frederick beer would expand upon the discoveries of Charles Adolf warts with the development of the earliest prototype of polyurethane fibers known as pearon U by 1940 the first polyurethane elastomers would be successfully developed this class of polyure materials whose physical characteristics are similar to that of rubber quickly became a cheaper alternative to rubber during World War II at the time when natural rubber was becoming rare and expensive from this World War II also saw the first attempts to create polyurethane elastomer based Foams though this proved to be difficult due to the highly exothermic nature of the urethane rea action and quality issues this sparked extensive research and development especially in the United States Germany and Britain alternative hydroxy compounds were experimented with and the process staged to manage Heat by 1954 the first commercial production of polyurethane foam based on polyester began in Europe and soon expanded to the United States in 1956 Dupont introduced a new kind of foam material based on polyether polyols which outperformed the existing polyester B Foams these modern Foams were easier and more efficient to produced on a large scale their Superior physical properties also made them more popular by 1957 the introduction of silicone surfactants in foam production would allow for smoother more stabilized Foams making them more versatile in its applications and leading to Surge in its popularity to manufacture polyurethane foam two components are required polyols and isocyanates both of these components are Li liquids that when mixed react to form a solid before the reaction to form the foam begins a blowing agent is introduced initially chlorofluorocarbons were used but due to environmental concerns they've been replaced with more eco-friendly options like water or hydrofluorocarbons when the blowing agent is heated it turns to gas creating the foam's bubbles additionally catalysts flame retardant and surfactants can be added to achieve specific foam properties once the components are mixed the re action starts quickly producing carbon dioxide gas this causes the mixture to expand or rise as the foam Rises it begins to set the entire process can happen within minutes depending on the formulation and the desired foam properties once cured large blocks of polyurethane foam are often cut into desired shapes and sizes using special saws or hot wire depending on its intended use the foam might undergo additional treatments for example memory foam a type of polyurethane foam under goes additional chemical treatments to give it visco elastic properties similarly a foam for specific use might be treated for added flame resistance or antimicrobial properties with modifications to the constituent chemical ratios and additives a variant known as rigid polyurethane foam can also be produced rigid polyurethane Foams are effective insulators due to its low thermal conductivity and boasts a low density making it lightweight compared to Metals additionally it maintains its shape well even under temperature changes unlike Metals which expand with heat its strong yet lightweight structure lends itself well for use in vehicles aircraft and building structures memory foam is another polyurethane based foam with unique properties developed in 1966 by NASA's ases Research Center it's created by irating a proprietary additive blend by introducing gases this process creates the open cell structure that makes memory foam breathable and allows it to temporarily retain the shape of an object pressing into it in the 1960s around 100 companies produced foam in the United States leading to the creation of foam plants Nationwide to reduce shipping costs by the 1970s the foam industry witnessed significant changes first the number of producers shrunk from 100 to approximately 20 due to Industry consolidation later concerns about foam's flammability prompted the establishment of an industry Association to address fire safety by April 1980 the association officially formed as the polyurethane foam Association during the 1980s the polymeric foam industry grew dramatically as new technologies such as injection molding twin screw and several other Extrusion and molding techniques were developed one example of this are self skinning Foams a type of foam with high density skin and a low density core that are formed through molding new polymeric products began to appear on the market offering a wider range of material properties ethylene vinyl acetate or EV VA lowdensity polyethylene or ldpe and polyvinyl chloride or PVC Foams began to appear on the market in a wide range of packaging insulating and cushioning products while synthetic rubber Foams made from nitr neoprene and silicone foam would be developed for sealing products he applied elastomeric membranes and Specialty clothing and protective gear around this time concerns began to grow over the emissions created by foam products particularly long exposure products such as mattresses because most polymeric Foams are combustible newly adopted regulations had required them to be flame resistant historically the fire retardant polybrominated dienol ethers or pbde was used in these products additionally methylene chloride and ingredients in foam production had been highlighted by the US Environmental Protection Agency to cause central nervous system effects like headaches and memory loss sustainability also became an issue postc consumer fate of polymeric foam is highly dependent on the product that contains it for example a significant amount of furniture and mattresses are still being landfilled or incinerated many polymeric Foams cannot just be melted at the end of its useful life to make new products a massive effort by both the US and EU is currently being undertaken to make polymeric Foams more sustainable this includes constant Research into new raw materials as well as the development of recycling Technologies and infrastructure to allow recycling of polyurethanes to be done at its full potential Beyond traditional polymeric foam products various exotic foam compositions have been explored over the decades for extreme environment use syntactic Foams or composite materials synthesized by filling a metal polymer cementitious or ceramic Matrix with holospheres called micr balloons have been used in both Aviation and deep sea exploration metal Foams such as aluminum foam have even been explored for use in blast and ballistics protection nanofoams a class of nanostructured Foams containing pores with diameters less than 100 nanometers such as aerogels are currently in active development foam is undergone incredible advancements throughout its history with its Superior properties it has come so integral to numerous everyday items that it's difficult to envision our daily lives without the benefits of while producing a foam is a relatively simple natural process creating engineered foam products with
