it's the drag race of the century on the left we've got the apple mac studio and on the right the apple mac studio but with a sick custom water cooling setup like other modern chips apple silicon processors will dynamically scale their clock speeds depending on how much or how little cooling you throw at them so did apple compromise on horsepower for looks again or does the mac studio already unlock the full potential of their fastest socs just how much performance can we squeeze out of apple's m1 max max it's time to start the test while i start this segway to our sponsor g-core g-core provides powerful public and private cloud services for content delivery hosting and security learn more about gcore and their new graphcore ipu artificial intelligence cloud servers at the link down below [Music] normally the problem that you run into when you try and water cool something that isn't supposed to be water cooled is simply space for all of your water cooling bits in the mac studio that's actually not the issue their heatsink assembly is just friggin massive we can very easily fit one of these alpha cool radiators in there not a problem what is a problem though is apple's random proprietary bolt so as you can see these fans right here have a little ribbon cable with six pins on it i don't know what those six pins do but with any luck as long as we can just disconnect these then we can hook up our water cooling everything will be cool it is very fortunate that we have two of the exact same mac studio we did that so that we could swap the ssds and well we didn't swap the ssds because again apple propriety but it does allow us to very easily you know drag race them later one fan lead two fan leads this turns on i will be very happy oh yay okay it works fine we can just disconnect the fans and it does not care at all that's actually kind of concerning i thought there would be a fan error that would come up and be like your fans don't work like literally every other computer that checks if your fans are working but uh it doesn't do that which is great for us but also what the this is the main board for the mac studio and the primary thing that we have to be concerned about is cooling this apple logo right here there are memory chips on either side of it but those i'm a bit less concerned about they don't use excellent like thermal paste on it in the stock configuration i imagine it's fine the main reason we don't want to have a whole lot of stuff over top of these guys because it's going to interfere with our radiator the radiator is going to be in here something like this our fans that will be attached there and we will have several millimeters between these fans and these memory chips right here so our actual water cooling bit needs to go over top of it and then you know there'll just be a little bit of copper here it's gonna get nice and cool anyways it'll be totally fine now instead of just totally reinvent the wheel we're going to be using this m.2 heatsink from bear well we won't actually be using it this bottom bit is going to get just put in the trash but this piece of acrylic will make our lives way easier and we don't have to worry about you know making our own acrylic piece instead this can attach to a piece of copper that we machine that will fit here and mount to those holes it goes over it something like that to make our lives even more easier what we might do this is extra dirty this is our heatsink and it already has the proper mounting holes and depth for everything in it maybe we can just get rid of this completely eliminate these fins get rid of these heat pipes face this off on the tormach and then our lives are a lot easier and we don't have to worry about you know custom making this piece that apple already kindly made for us or maybe we'll just completely screw this up and have to do the whole thing ourselves here's plan number one take a heat gun point it towards the heatsink and hopefully we can just chisel off all of these fins failing that uh we have a backup plan we're gonna wait until it's around like 220 250 something like that and then we might actually be able to get this off i don't think this is gonna work but if it does that would be fantastic yeah i'm just mangling the fins well plan b we say this every time we've cut aluminum but i'm just gonna go over it again the dust is very bad to breathe in so make sure you have a mask a good face shield in case something explodes no you don't want that going in your face also make sure that you have an aluminum cutting disc it has lubricating stuff in here to help prevent the gumming up and exploding but not entirely yeah it just uh kind of sucks to do [Music] and definitely hearing protection this is pretty brutal the angle grinding was just making a mess so instead we're just gonna simply get it off exactly like that i'm pretty sure tynan just sharpened this chisel my sincerest apologies tim cook next thing we have to do these copper heat pipes that are right here they are very soldered down they are not coming off instead we're going to go over to the tormach and just face off this area right here so we're able to attach a water block to it there's almost definitely a better way to do this but uh i'm youtuber not a machinist so this is what i've come up with we have this nice little plate from saunders machine works that has a bunch of stuff clamped down to it this is going to go into our vise because there's not enough space anywhere for this just mount to our table and this is going to be kind of scary although it should be totally fine if the tool just decides to do anything that it shouldn't it's going to hit something all right i have checked and double checked everything i believe we are good to go as long as this doesn't decide to do something random our part on the tormach turned out great although we've actually totally changed the plan having everything internal was going to technically work in order to have these fans clear the water block that was going to be on here it would have to be smaller than the one that i put in the red camera i was just very concerned that it would not cool as well as the excellent solution that apple has from the factory so we have completely redone our plan this is what's going to happen see this wonderful corsair block right here bam turns out thread ripper mounting holes almost line up perfectly with the ones that apple has from the factory so a cpu taken care of now you might be thinking with this big old cpu block where's all your stuff going to go right on the top radiator pump amazing it is going to be without a doubt the coolest mac studio in existence now one of our biggest problems was rgb and fans 12 volts we can very easily get from right here off the power supply all other voltages not so simple now it is very crucial on something like this to have just a bunch of rgb because i want to just annoy apple people as much as possible which means loads of rgb and that is quite difficult so we went with corsair stuff because they are the only ones that have rgb software for mac os this controller is going to work really really well because i'm able to have it in hardware mode so it just runs all of our rgb off of it and we have a temperature probe in our loop that goes into our controller here that controls our fan and pump speeds so we don't have to worry about you know grabbing it off of this and then hopefully everything just works really really well one more thing though uh this is gonna be pretty stupid for five volts we will be using this buck converter 12 volts in right here adjust this potentiometer until 5 volts comes out of there we are happy yeah i guess at this point we have uh not many hours to get this done let's do it [Music] there we go there's your cold plate and now we're left with this which will hold our main board to well it'll just hold it getting this thing in here was not very simple we are about two and a half millimeters away from the full travel of the y-axis of this machine it's really close but we should be able to do it look at that so precise everything's roughly in place at the moment including our nice tubes so the main board can go in and out we don't have though is power going to our rgb and fan controller we know that we're going to be getting it off of the power supply right here we do not know which way this voltage goes fortunately apple doesn't tell us the polarity of this power supply so i have attached some leads now it's either going to just say plus 12 volts or minus 12 volts on here and then we know which way to wire all of our stuff yeah don't do this at home please just don't so not only does this tell us that we have minus 12 volts right now also lets us know that we have 12 volts always on a lot of power supplies you need to like press the power button on the motherboard before it starts giving you 12 volts this one just gives it to you right away for some reason oh wait it's dropping maybe that was just it gave 12 volts while it was charging um i don't know doesn't matter that is good to know though because i was kind of concerned about the mac being off and our fans and pumps still just running indefinitely getting everything to fit in this mac studio has been quite a challenge by getting everything to fit inside of it i mean on top even our corsair controller it would not fit inside it technically could it was going to be very difficult so instead we have denuded it it's going on the top we've redone our radiator mount it's this nice black 3d printed piece now that has space for our rgb hub down below because the spirit of this is really you know pcifying the mac pro i have used juego lever nuts to add expandability to this loop in the future and as you can see our buck converters right down in there attach it to a power supply it now spits out five volts one more thing if you look really closely in here we have two 40 millimeter noctua fans and the rest of the holes all blocked off this is for the power supply actually so it draws air in from the bottom shoots it at the back and hopefully your power supply does not overheat probably be fine without it but this is just some good insurance i've added a little bit of vhb tape to the bottom of the pump this isn't to hold it down the screws are going to do that just fine is to try and stop vibrations going from the pump onto this top plate here and just turning into a little drum one thing i feel is under utilized in pc making is hot glue we have a connector right here for our noctua fans that just keeps on wanting to come off it's gonna stay on now as you can see corsair clearly knows this they have a bunch of hot glue on here from the factory for string relief here's the power for our fan hub and rgb controller just simply probed it while it was connected into one of these figured out what's 5 volt ground you get it needs to go in which means this molex connector needs to leave getting a radiator mount on with the corsair controller underneath it is not very simple we've pulled all of the excess wires up through the top so we can hopefully get it down we'll get it bolted on and then we can stuff all of this back down in and hopefully it'll be fine there we go we've got our little fan shroud piece that's just printing this easier and way faster on the inside we're using alphacool's server grade fittings and tubing it's just way better at not coming out and we really given how much this is going to be stuffed inside do not want a tube popping off the tubing runs for this are a bit on the unfortunate side if we were smart we would have taken our time and planned it out so that this hole was directly underneath this and you could just have a little tube there or a little run we didn't do that because we were rushing instead we have a run that goes like that another one that goes back and around and the most biggest dumbest of all look at how close these are there's no way to get a tube in here so the solution the big ol loop-de-loop it's kind of gross i don't love it but at the same time it's gonna be able to show off our nice fire orange well this is why you leak test i figured it was fine but if we have a look at the needle it's dropping quite rapidly i really hope that the leak is somewhere up here because if it's on the inside putting in a bunch of the io down here huge pain in the air and uh looks like i might need to do it all over again found where it's leaking seems like it's the other side of this right here the through holes are honestly pretty trash so i'm not super surprised you do things out of order for filming sake i'm blaming this on you brandon for the record it's not my fault so i'm going to use the good old soapy water trick i think this might be our spot i just have soaked water all over the place problem is just this connection right here look at that not moving at all leak tested working great gotta stitch it all back together and we should be good to go we're doing it smarter this time i want to make sure that everything up here works before we stitch it all back together and i have to take it all back apart again because that would just be terrible we have mr nick heavy he's going to fill it up i have a bench power supply that's going to the leads that will be attached to the mac studio's power supply and this is going to be beautiful this is not sketchy at all how did that happen the tube screwed us oh no we're professionals here i spilled water before oh oh that looks good that rgb is working this rgb is working pump's working van's running are these fans we have rgb internally thank you that's what i was going for let's stitch it back together i think we've done it she's absolutely stogged like you can see right here that doesn't want to go all the way in because the power leads the whole thing he just kind of was like get it back but it's so stupid i absolutely love it i really hope it works oh i really don't want to take this thing apart again but it's kind of looking like i might it's below 60 degrees and it's very similar to the air-cooled version which is not what i was hoping for but i was just kind of like ah maybe they have a bad ihs spreader or something like that and that's the bottleneck but no we put the dye in there and it just very slowly meanders way through there's definitely a kink in there so now i get to just to spend the next hour taking it apart and reassembling it the benefit of this is that uh the fire orange looks more like tang so i think we're just gonna get rid of that otherwise hopefully it all works 45 minutes later whole thing's been disassembled and reassembled that might be a record i don't know if anyone's ever done it that fast before for the coolant we're going to go with the go chiller premix has a bunch of carbon particles in it apparently it reduces your temps a bit mostly it just looks really freaking cool so we're going to use that instead of the tang juice oh there we go it looks freaking sick let's start here cinebench we're looking for it to be under 60 degrees that's about as hot as the other one gets looking at what 55 54. yeah the hottest that i'm seeing is 55 degrees seems like we're not getting as good of cooling performance as i would have liked kind of like guess before it probably has to do with apple's ihs just not being able to get the heat away fast enough but at the same time this thing's really well cooled so glad i bought two of these yeah otherwise how would we do an apples to apples comparison ah you guys did a surprisingly professional job of this is this our new standard of quality now i guess so there's a whole uh corsair rgb and fan hub in here that's controlling everything based off of like the temperature of the water uh hello okay we're good yeah i'm sorry holy crap we dropped the temps by 30 degrees not only is it 30 degrees lower but this fan is barely spinning i mean i guess that's what happens when you put a giant water cooling radiator on like how many watts is this chip even like 45 watts and it's near silent okay here we go let's go let's go water cooled back come on i don't want it to do better that's fair 12056 12016 40 points did we think there was going to be a performance uplift i mean it's not exactly a macbook air it's not known to thermal throttle right apparently the m1's like turbo boost is really terrible oh but also it doesn't matter because they sip power and are well cooled we did a thing you have to admit it looks great no one else has a mac studio that looks like this this is hot rotted out i love it it's 20 degrees cooler and it looks like that i think we can call it a win here we go 12 104 i got another 48 points 12 0 28 so both times the water water-cooled one was technically faster the best kind of faster just like this is
