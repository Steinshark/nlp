okay this is a camera comparison that I've been very excited to make we've got Google's brand new pixel 3 XL here on the Left Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and then the iPhone tennis max so you can probably see we've got these indicators on the screen annual entitlement that is showing you from which device you're hearing the audio from so after hearing all freely let me know which one you think has the better microphones also the video you're seeing here is 1080p footage from the front cameras of each phones we're going to do front camera rear camera pretty much every test you can possibly think of but so far which one is better the other thing is that Google's new camera can do something the other two can't this is group selfie mode this is a wider angle and the software actually corrects for that weird fisheye effect you normally get on wide-angle cameras again let me know what you think I think this is actually putting out a lot more in the frame than the other two having said that you've probably noticed that both Android phones here they aren't doing a very good job at keeping a consistent vibrant color profile whilst you've probably heard about the iPhone 10s and it's Beauty gate problems making the skin tone look almost a little bit too even I would definitely take that over having a really washed out sky in the background with both the pixel 3xl and the Galaxy Note nines front facing cameras I couldn't strike a balance between having my face reasonably well lit but also the background still visible it was either face really bright and background blown out or face really dark with some background visible okay flicking to the rear cameras where some things do change quite a bit all phones record at 4k obviously but surprisingly Google's pixel free Excel doesn't record at 4k 60 frames per second compared to the front cameras there isn't as much disparity between them the kinds of differences that really only come to the forefront when you make a side-by-side comparison like this I like the deeper color of the sky on the iPhone and I quite like the high contrast look of the dark areas on the note 9 but pretty much for standard video color and contrast is personal preference in terms of slow motion all three phones can shoot 240 frames per second at a 1080p but what you're saying here from the note 9 is Samsung's super slow motion footage which is a short clip of 960 frame per second footage at 720p this is a real luxury while you can only record a short clip and at a lower resolution things look very different at this super slow speed now video stabilization with the Google pixel 3 the company introduced something called fused video stabilization and it plays more of a role at 1080p but even at 4k you can really see it in action it's even more stable than the note 9 and the 10s max and there's already two of the best phones for this also notice how the light areas at the sky have kind of disappeared on the note 9 okay 1080p resolution and the stabilization is nuts the Google pixel 3 blew me away in terms of this again one of those situations where all three phones are pretty good but you will notice that the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 soas is a little too aggressive it almost swings from side to side to constantly try and correct itself low-light video is where things start to get really interesting you can see looking at the highlights all the bright shining lights in this image that the Galaxy Note 9 starts to lose control of these areas a little bit and to be honest that's even after having dialed down its exposure to make the blacks so dark so not a particularly impressive result from Samsung looking at the detail on the road here I'd say the pixel just about edges out the iPhone here but at the same time the iPhone has better control of the highlights for example look at the blue neon lighting on the right-hand side of the image moving forward you can see the note 9 looks consistently dark and soft while the pixel 3 probably has the sharpest of the three images you can probably also tell in this one that the pixel actually pulls ahead of the iPhone in terms of grain apples insistence on trying to make an even well-lit image has made the phone tried too bright in the dark areas of the sky which has resulted in visual noise okay back to the front camera now looking up photos and for selfies each device has quite a unique way of going about them samsung has a wider lens which means you can fit more into your image and the pixel 3 in terms of all types of photos has a very dark grungy kind of aesthetic to it Samsung is then slightly brighter slightly more flattering and then you've got the iPhone which almost looks like you've got a beauty filter on it which I can understand some people don't like personally I don't mind it I don't think it's too intrusive and it does do a good job of keeping the sky well-lit when it comes to selfies though the Google pixel 3 has introduced a couple of things which I think are amazing top shot means if you shake or blink your head at the last minute you can swipe up after having taken the photo and then pick a different face and almost always you'll find one that's better as you saw at the beginning Google also has a group selfie mode and that's not restricted to video after opening up the front camera you just pinch out on your display and all of a sudden you've got a dramatically wider field of vision then you've got selfie focus mode which is basically portrait mode on your front camera and out of the three phones here the pixel definitely has the sharpest output out of these three phones the note 9 is definitely the weakest link liked parts of the background disappear and even your face looks a little soft not particularly InFocus what's so confusing then is that when it comes to low-light samsung's selfie camera catches up it looks just as sharp as the pixels and while the iPhone does a much better job at retaining that same flat image with control of highlights as the rear camera to do this it has had to dramatically increase the shutter time which has made it more likely to blur Google pixel 3 also has playground mode where you can drag and drop a are emojis into your frame but for some reason image processing seems to turn off in these situations which means you're left with a pretty grainy looking photo to test the portrait mode I tried to pick a really challenging scenario with a really difficult background to differentiate from and yeah we're still at a stage where all three phones are struggling here all three have the ability to adjust the level of background blur but with the iPhone when you do this you almost all the time lose focus on your body as well having said that the iPhone does let you get much more background blur than the other two phones but the pixel can refocus after you've taken the shot so if you accidentally focus on the background while clicking one tap and you'll be back in shot also notice how the lighter areas of my shirt on the note line have almost completely disappeared you lose a lot of detail in the highlights okay Google's pixel - really earned its title as one of the best cameras on a smartphone because of this day time at landscape photos so it wasn't much of a surprise that the pixel 3xl aced this category like the pixel to last year photos of a real character you can almost tell even without a label which one was taken on the pixel this phone overcompensates in terms of saturation and contrast which isn't for everyone and some people might prefer images from the other two phones but I would say eight times out of ten I would stick with the pixel photos from the pixel three feel every bit as good as the pixel to last year but just bear in mind not significantly better what actually helped the pixel to leapfrog its competition was the way it processed images and there hasn't really changed here when it comes to low-light photos it seems like only the iPhone really has a consistent color profile between photos and videos you might remember the note 9 had the darkest videos of the bunch in low light well it's photos are the lightest because of that F 1.5 aperture I prefer the darker higher contrast feel of the pixels images in low light but the note 9 as you would expect given this wide aperture is capturing more detail Google did announce that they're working on a night shot mode for their pixel phones which obviously isn't out yet so I didn't get a chance to test but I think will dramatically change things think what Huawei does with the p20 pro's night mode something I found really interesting was Google's super res zoom while both the note 9 and the iPhone have telephoto lenses which means they can get much closer to objects without loss of detail Google doesn't have this as a single lens but the way they've tried to get around this is fascinating when you zoom in on the pixel 3 and take a photo your phone takes a whole series of shots which are all slightly different because of the natural movement of your hand and then it pieces them all together to form a higher res picture I'd say details are slightly clearer on the Samsung but I was shocked with how close the pixel was when it comes to pure detail both the note 9 and the 10s have 12 megapixel sensors whereas the pixel 3 has a 12 point - in actuality this doesn't translate to necessarily higher detail images but the only thing I would say is that the pixel 3 and the iPhone have slightly smoother pictures when you zoom all the way in I've also spent a fair bit of time with Google's new motion autofocus mode which has meant to track objects to maintain focus on them to be honest from my testing it's not really added anything to the video recording experience if anything the pixel 3 actually had more times when it failed to recognize the Apple was close to the phone and focus on it than the other two it's definitely one of those features that might improve down the line I can definitely see the need for it and how good it could potentially be but right now it's not that impressive all right guys that was my most detailed camera comparison so far let me know which phone you think won and if you stuck around this far into the video I would really appreciate it if you could smash our subscribe
