all right what's up guys mkbhd here and this is an updated what's in my tech bag 2019 the everyday carry the daily driver whatever you want to call it this is that so i've been pretty picky about backpacks i've had maybe three in the last nine years of being a student and carrying books and things like that that was always the same type of backpack but then this one got recommended to me it's easily the most expensive backpack i've ever bought but it's very different and that's kind of what inspired this update so this is by peak design it's called it's the everyday backpack that's the 20 liter version there's a bigger 30 liter one um but this is my everyday carry i don't need that much space yes i know there's a matte black version of this but i got this charcoal one because of the red accents so i know so with my previous bags it was kind of like a big empty space which is great as a student-minded person with you know carrying books and stuff like that but this is divided up it has a ton of features it's very different so this is everything that i carry now in it this is what's in my tech bag 2019. so i still don't know if this qualifies as a tech backpack because i mean it doesn't have any you know battery banks in it or any solar panels built in but it has so many features i didn't realize a backpack could have this many features it has more than i'll ever use but it's got all kinds of magnets and compartments and and latches and it kind of starts right here at the top actually you know i'll start with the smartphones that i carry every day since people will be asking that um it's still the oneplus 7 pro as the daily and the iphone 10s max space gray nebula blue those are the smartphone daily drivers of choice when i'm not testing other stuff all right so into the bag it's got this metal latch as you can see and you pull it down and it sort of unhooks from any one of these levels on the inside so if you have a lot of stuff in the bag you can hook it up to a higher angle or lower or lower like that it's kind of great there's magnets i really like it and that just exposes the top of what's in the bag which is just my everyday carry thing of the day for me that's the headphones and they are still the sony's that i've had for the past couple months i did really like the bose but these are still my go-to's and then it's kind of empty you can see like in there it's it's a good amount of space for that top third of the bag but if i had more stuff in there like you know extra shirt or a jacket or things like that then i would just sort of latch it up there it's weather resistant so water just kind of falls right off the top of it if i'm in the rain it's pretty sweet okay so getting another side this bag is kind of designed so as you're carrying it you can take it off and it's got handles on the side and it's also fully accessible via zippers on the side so if you want to like extend it and just kind of have it like a messenger bag style for a bit you can do that and then you get to what's inside the bag which for me is a good amount more than i could put in my previous backpack so you can see the top third is empty now that the headphones aren't in there and then in this middle third this is a camera that i'd carry every day this used to be the hasselblad if i'd carried this in my old backpack it would just kind of be like loose in the backpack which was kind of weird so it's great that this is a bag made for camera stuff and it's more secure and the camera of choice is no longer the hasselblad at least for now i've been really enjoying the canon eos r and this is the gigantic 28 to 70 f2 lens that they've made for it attached it's obviously with this lens bigger than the hasselblad and there's some things it does better some things it does worse it's not a medium format 50 megapixel camera but it's much faster it takes great photos with i mean it's 30 megapixels still it's not like it's soft and then of course there's all the advantages of canon they're color science dual pixel autofocus is very fast they do a lot of things well i don't shoot much video at least right now on the canon eos r i have another camera in mind actually testing for that but that's the camera and the one lens i do carry in the middle third of the bag then the bottom third of the bag i have just kind of the charging accessories if i was carrying a laptop i would have the laptop charger down here too but spoiler alert i'm not either way i have a battery bank it's more of in case of emergency because i usually keep things pretty well charged but this is anker's 26 800 milliamp hour battery which replaced the 20 000 milliamp hour one i carried before but all the same features 18 watt charging usb c in uh and it still has that little sweet charging indicator and it's wrapped in a dbrand skin so you can actually skin your anker batteries now and uh i have the mclaren edition oneplus 30 watt charger it's the same as uh the current 30 watt that comes with the oneplus 7 pro but it's a little more fancy orange with this braided cable and that pretty much takes cares of the actual insides of the bag you can access it from either side so if i swap over here to the other side so you kind of get used to having the handle of the camera that you want to get to quickly always on one side so you always know where to open it to pull out the camera and start using it which is pretty cool and then inside there's actually these little wings they have zippers in there and there's stuff that you can put in these compartments too now like i said i don't carry a whole ton in the bags so there you have the uh the one pen i carry and i think uh have some contact lenses in there then on the other side there you go business cards another pen and a sharpie up here and again like i got so picky about backpacks but there's just so many things little things about this bag that are sweet uh one thing is the anti-theft zipper so it has a zipper both at the top at the bottom but if you want to go ahead and pop this off and latch it around this here then when someone tries to yank the zipper down it won't come off and then these pockets over here on the side which have magnets in them to close them they expand and they're great for an umbrella or something like that and just to show you how little of the features i use in this bag there are so many latches and things to like attach like if you want to put a tripod on this bag you can wrap it around and buckle it in like that there's also more latches down here clothes with magnets if you ever want to do that i'm probably never going to do that with this bag because it's my everyday carry but it's that modular if you want it to be now you're probably wondering where's like the computer and all that main stuff because i haven't gotten to the top yet which is the other main compartment so on the top here there's actually multiple compartments to fit different types of computers in the back is the deepest one for like a 15 inch laptop in the inside here which is a little shorter that's the 11 inch ipad pro i've been carrying that i've been running that ipad os 13 on that i kind of still feel like is doing a job for everything i need it to and then in the very top there's this little pouch that's a little more shallow it's microfiber it has a bunch of small things in it in there i have a canon eos r battery i have a mkbhd edition microfiber which is pretty sweet then a couple other small things i have the matte black everything air pods i have my vanja uh little flash or sd card reader i have my apple pencil here and i have a sd card reader and at this point the bag is now empty so it's uh pretty lightweight and that's the charcoal and the red and black and that's what i've been carrying every day i'm getting on a plane tonight i'll have my noise cancelling headphones and things like that with me but other than that it's not too crazy of a tech bag i kind of mentioned last time that's like why i wanted to share it is there's so many like super high-end very expensive tech bags out there and this is a little bit more of a minimal setup so maybe it'll give you some ideas for your own or if you want to give me some ideas for things i do in the future for my tech everyday carry feel free to leave them in the comments section below either way that's been it thank you for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace
