this time last year I made a video comparing nuke to Fusion from the perspective of a professional compositor that video was very well received and it reached audiences outside of my normal demographic including a lot of people that actually use fusion and as a result of this the comments of that video were filled with people leaving very constructive feedback on how I could have improve the video many of the things that I pointed out as issues that I had with Fusion people suggested solutions for which was really cool so ever since then it's been in the back of my head that I'd like to do a follow-up of that video that's slightly more well informed in the background for the last few weeks I've been learning how to use Fusion properly and this video is the result of that this is the plate that I'm going to be working on and the aim of this video is to tackle all of the tasks that I would normally do in Nuke and replicate every single one of those infusion that's going to include using St maps to undistort the footage doing a 3D camera track and exporting some geometry and the camera to blender for use in CG preparing the hdri for use in blender by doing some paint work to remove the sun color balancing the plates using a McBeth chart and then once the renders are done obviously compositing all the CG so let's see how it goes just before we start if you'd like to get your hands on the project files from this video video they're available on my patreon you can get access to the blender scene with the textured model and all the lighting set up the nuk script exactly how I've comped the shot in this video as well as the footage if you'd like to download it for yourself on practice okay back to the video so the very first step is importing my footage and then I'm using an st map that I generated from a lens grid to undistort the footage once the footage has the Distortion removed I write that out as a secondary plate from nuke and then I bring it back in and start doing a camera track of the scene I'm really used to nuke's 3D tracker I think it works really well and you don't have to press many buttons to get a good result here I'm just punching in my camera parameters like my focal length and the film back size which is the size of your sensor and then set off the camera track once it's done I set up the ground plane and the origin of my 3D scene and then just improve the track slightly by removing some of The Trackers with higher errors then from there I can export a camera and some geometry for the floor and just check if the track is actually working in Nuke I normally do this by putting a checkerboard on the card on the floor and then I overlay this on my footage and turn the mix down the straight lines on the checkerboard make it really obvious if the card is slipping at all on the floor in this case it stuck really well and the track was very usable once I'm happy I add the card and the camera to a scene node and then I used the right Geo node to export an almic from nuke to blender then just before hopping into blender I prepared the hdri in Nuke as well there's loads of different ways to do this one of my favorites is to use a node called pxf filler you can draw a mask around something and then the colors on the edge of your mask will be draged inwards and fill the hole so in this casee it fills up the area where the sun is with the blue sky which is perfect and then finally I just clone painted out some of the streaks from the lens flares then I export that from nuke as well and I'm ready to hop into blender the first thing I did was import the almic of the 3D scene so I've got my camera and my geometry for the floor then I bring in my undistorted plate as the background image of my camera so I can see what I'm doing next up I bought in the 3D model in this case I'm using a motorbike that I downloaded for free from sketch faab to get the scene scale correct I made a cube that was the same dimensions as a motorbike then I scaled the motorbike to fit inside the cube so I know it had the correct proportions once that was placed correctly I bought in my hdri to light the scam and using the mapping node I changed the Zed rotation until it's aligned correctly with my shot then I can add in a sun lamp and Orient it so that the shadows of my CG objects are going in the same direction as the liveaction footage and at this point I also set my ground plane to be a shadow catcher so I could see it overlaid on the footage slightly easier the model was really good but the materials were very basic so I just did some quick look Dev and applied some extra textures to make them look a bit more photo realistic I did a few final steps to embed it into the shot better like using a UV project modifier to project the undistorted plate onto the floor it's good practice to do this for all shots but particularly because this bike has some very glossy materials on it you'll actually see the floor reflected in them very clearly so it's even more important on CG objects like this then in the compositor I set up my render passes for this it's super simple I just did a beauty pass and then a shadow pass and then for the final tweak before rendering I just made sure that my hdri was properly calibrated to work with the MCB Beth chart so that it would match my footage Jacob from inlight VFX has a really good video about this it's worth checking out he explains it in a lot more detail and my workflow follows pretty much the exact same steps the main purpose of this is making sure that your hdri has the correct white balance and everything once they match all the colors should be uniform across the board and it's ready to render and now we can get on to the fun stuff which is putting the renders together this is a pretty straightforward compositing setup so it's going to be a pretty small script which is always nice I start off by bringing in the render of the bike and then applying my compositing template which is just an un premolt and premolt setup with a copy node then I merge this over the footage and reapply the lens Distortion using another St map from earlier that's the inverse of the undistorting one this takes the lens Distortion from the specific lens I had on my camera at the time and applies it to the CG then I set my blacko I like to do this by turning the viewport gain all the way up and then sampling one of the darker areas of the liveaction footage after the lens Distortion set up I'm then shuffling out the shadow pass and multiplying this over the plate using a second merge node I'm using a grade node after that just to make some tweaks to the density and the color of the Shadow then finally I added a very subtle defocus just to take the edge off the sharpness of the CG render compared to the plate and also added an exponential glow node I turned it right down so it's nice and subtle and this is just helping to emulate the bloom you get when the sun reflects off very bright objects in the scene I added an exposure node right at the end as well I gammer down the viewport so I can see where all the highlights are living in the shot and then I just brought the exposure down on the bike slightly to fall in place and with that done this is what the final shot looks like and we can even add a color gray to make it look a bit more sexy in principle it's quite a simple shot but this simple task has combined pretty much all the disciplines that go into making most of my YouTube videos so now let's see how Fusion holds up doing the same thing one of the main things that people pointed out in the comments of the last video was that I should install reactor it's basically a massive third party library of plugins that people in the fusion Community have made and it adds a huge amount of the functionality that I said was missing by default in my previous video so straight away this made a massive difference so I installed reactor and downloaded several nodes that people had made to replicate some of the nuke nodes in Fusion the second thing that made a big difference to me enjoying using Fusion a lot more second time round was I got the layout working very similarly to Nuke I think the default Fusion one is pretty rubbish but to be fair the default nuke one is pretty terrible as well massive shout out to zanzo or one aspiring artist on Discord we've talked a lot in the background since my previous video about fusion and they've been massively helpful in Sharing resources and pointing out solutions for things when I had problems so I got the node graph set up how I like it I also turned on arranged to Connected which makes the nodes snap in line with each other like in Nuke and I also turned on for Source tile pictures which gives all of the media nodes thumbnails so you can see what they are which is much better and lastly something I didn't figure out at all in my previous video was getting the viewer set up to work properly with Aces basically you have to load the ases config file into the viewer so that it can display properly then I set my source color space to ases CG and the output to recx 709 and once that was set up it magically started working which was a huge relief so I've got my footage as an exr sequence which I started off with the same as in Nuke next I bought in the undor St map Fusion doesn't have a built-in way of using St Maps so I went through a few on Reactor and eventually found one called ST mappa which is the only one that seems to actually process the alpha properly then I can crop the over scan that's going outside of the frame borders and then exactly the same as before I had a SA node which is the same as a right node in Nuke and I just rendered a pre-m of this undistorted plate from there I can bring it back in and then it's time to tackle camera tracking the shot this was my first time using fusions camera tracker and I think it's really good I still think I prefer nukes but again I'm a bit biased cuz I've used it so much so it's difficult to say but I will say that it's very intuitive works pretty much exactly the same way I put in my focal length and my sensor size tweaked some of the settings to add some more tracking points and then Set It Off tracking once it was done it was exactly the same process as nuke I refined the camera track slightly by filtering some of the worst tracks and then selected some points on the floor to set my origin and ground plane once that's done I pressed export which kicks out a 3D camera and some geometry for the floor I had a quick look at it in 3D space everything seemed to be working okay so then I used the fbx exporter to kick it out to blender I didn't bother going through the whole process again in blender as it was going to be identical anyway I then jumped back into fusion and did the same prep work on the hdri I'd not used any of the paint tools in Fusion before either so this was a new one for me the paint tools in pretty much every software are very similar there's usually some iteration of the Clone brush and then things like the smear and blur brush nuke's got quite a few more and I do actually use them all on a regular basis so I think nuke has a definite Advantage when it comes to the paint tools but in this case it wasn't a problem I just used the Clone tool to paint out the sun it took me quite a bit longer to do it in Fusion compared to n cuz I'm not used to the tools but I got there in the end it was quite blotchy because there's such a gradient in the sky going outwards from the Sun so again I used a blur node after that just to even that all out a little bit I used an elliptical mask and just put that around the Sun so I could just isolate the blur to that area and it did exactly what I was after again skipping over the blender process so I don't show the same thing twice I've now gone straight into doing the CG comping and fusion I bring in both of the render passes in Fusion I had to use two loader nodes one for the bike and one for the shadow pass whereas in Nuke I could just use one read node and Shuffle it out but it's just a different way of working one's not really better than the other then again I'm using the St mappa node to reapply the lens Distortion onto the CG renders I did the shadow pass first and then merged this over the plate and set it to multiply which overlays it correctly then I copy the lens Distortion setup onto the bike and that gets merged over the top of everything I used a color correct on the shadow pass again just to make them a little bit darker then I add a color correct onto the CG bike and I make sure to turn on pre- divide post multiply which is the same as unpre molting and pre molting in Nuke after hunting through the menus a bit I found the best way to set the black and white point was to use the output level sliders so I gamed down the viewport and set my highlights to be the correct level and then I increased the gain and set the black point I found a version of exponential glow on Reactor as well which is basically exactly the same thing that's in Nuke so I put that on top of the CG to get the same Bloom effect from the highlights I just dialed it in until it was very subtle again I also applied the same subtle def Focus just to take the sharpness out of the render and at this point I'd mirrored the nuke setup exactly so it was time to render it out and compare the two and this is the final comp from fusion and again with the color grade applied interestingly the main difference if I flick between them is that the lens Distortion is different between the two I'd imagine that's just a difference in how Fusion has handled the St map okay so conclusion time I've actually got some notes so I don't miss anything important I think right off the bat it's worth saying that this time time around my experience using Fusion was very positive like I said earlier once I got it laid out how I liked I immediately felt more comfortable the only real negative that I found while working on this shot was the lens Distortion workflow like I said with the built-in nodes Fusion doesn't have a way of properly using St Maps there's about three options on Reactor that I tried the third one St mapper does actually work but I have to say it took me about an hour to find that whereas nuke has a built-in St map node so the same as I said in the last video I would still argue that nuke out of the box has a much more comprehensive toolkit than Fusion for the visual effects pipeline the second thing I would say is that generally speaking functionally they're both pretty similar and so a lot of the preferences from artist to artist are just subjective however there are a couple of things that Fusion objectively can't do that nuke has capability for and the main one which I think a lot of people aren't going to be so familiar with and will not matter at all unless you're working at a big visual effect Studio anyway is deep compositing it's quite complicated so I'm not going to go super into it but essentially deep compositing is a workflow where the pixels are rendered from 3D with actual depth data so I'm not talking about just having a depth pass that's a gradient going through your scene there's actual depth data that's associated with the pixels so that the computer knows how far back they are in space and this gives an enormous amount of flexibility in compositing when it comes to working with CG renders you can do things like extremely high fidelity ZD focusing traditionally this would be done with the depth part which most compositing softwares can already do however because of the nature of this just being a 2d Channel That's utilized in compositing it creates lots of edge issues in deep compositing this essentially Works flawlessly pretty much as if you render the depth of field out of the 3D software package there's loads of other things you can do with deep as well you can do things like placing Roto and cards behind 3D objects in the scene without having to go in and do any Roto or using Crypt mats and trying to blend the objects together it's extremely Advanced it's really really heavy and most amateur visual effects artists won't even know what it is and will probably never use it but it is worth noting that that's something that n can do over Fusion I will still say and I want to reiterate again that this is entirely my own opinion but personally from my perspective working as a professional and the things that I have to work on on a day-to-day basis I still think nuke is considerably better than Fusion yes Fusion is used at VFX Studios as well and I'm not denying at all that can totally handle most professional jobs no problem but there is still a reason why if you go to any of the really big VFX Studios everybody's working in Nuke still and on that topic let's go into the subject that I think most people bought up in the comments which is the price difference as you probably know Fusion comes included in the free version of Da Vinci resolve and if you want to upgrade to the studio version I think I paid £295 for a lifetime software license comparatively nuke is a subscription based software now there's a few different versions you can get for students and aspiring visual effects artists there is nuke non-commercial which is free it's limited to 1080p HD a step up from that is nuke Indie which I had for a couple of years this costs about £400 a year and I actually think this is priced pretty fairly so it's ideal for Freelancers and small startups full disclosure I don't pay for my own license Foundry sponsor my YouTube channel they gave me a new kindi license for a couple of years and this year they kindly agreed to upgrade me to a full version of newex however if I was going to I would definitely pay for newe Indie I think it's totally worth it it's still more expensive than resolve and fusion one year of subscribing to Nuke Indie costs more than buying resolve for a lifetime so obviously comparatively resolve is much better to Value but I work full-time as a visual effects artist like I've said I work at VFX studio and for the last few years I've also been doing lots of projects on the side as a freelancer so people approach me and ask me to work on their stuff and for the rates that I charge I would make back the price of the subscription for the year in less than a day so it's very easy to justify those software prices when you're earning a certain amount the license that I have now which is a full licensed version of newex I think cost about £5,000 a year which obviously is hugely expensive so from that perspective I totally get it I think Fusion is probably the way to go and I myself would probably do that as well if I was starting out again now however like I've said a few times this video and the last video are from the perspective of a professional visual effects artist and so I think it's worth considering that when you get to a certain point and the projects that you're working on become high-end enough the price of the tools starts to become a little bit less relevant for example I would say the vast majority of the projects that we work on as a company have over six figure post- production budgets especially the big jobs can sometimes go up to over a million that's obviously not profit we do have to actually pay everybody and stuff within the budget for that as well but you can imagine that suddenly when the jobs are bringing in that much money the cost of £5,000 nuke license starts to become less important and I think that's what I was trying to convey in my last video is that pricing aside nuke is still in my opinion the better tool and so ultimately you always want to be using the best tool for the job and if a studio is making enough money from jobs they can afford to pay for the nuke licenses then it makes sense that the artists have the tools that they want to use so there we go I think that pretty accurately represents how I feel about the two softwares I definitely have a much better appreciation for Fusion after this video I quite enjoyed using it and I would definitely use it again like I said last time I'd love to hear what you think especially from people in the future F Community let me know what your thoughts are in the comments the last video opened up a really healthy dialogue and people were giving some great suggestions so if a similar thing can come out of this video they're amazing thank you very much for watching I hope you enjoyed consider liking subscribing and I'll see you in the next video [Music] [Music]
