Intel's chicken is plucked their net income is down 114 their margins have shrunk by a half and their manufacturing capabilities are so out of date that they're paying their competitor tsmc to produce chips for them and adding insult to injury their new Sapphire Rapids lineup of server CPUs has finally limped to the finish line two months after amd's incredibly powerful not to mention cheaper epic Genoa counter punch with poor pricing and customer hostile Hardware as a service features starting to feel like we're watching a Goliath Mega Corporation crumbling in slow motion under the weight of its own hubris so why then is pulseway sponsoring us to tell you about a crappy product that you probably shouldn't buy it's because they know that with a new server and workstation processor come many of the same old problems and the rmm tools in both pulse face mobile and web apps are more than serviceable Solutions and despite the fact that these chips are as outdated as they are brand new Intel has their site set clearly on the future an accelerated future and as bad as things look at the moment that future might be pretty bright good gravy this thing is thick like it's not bigger than last gen but look at the size of it like you could hurt a man with it maybe even kill him if you get the angle just right you know Sapphire Rapids the code name for Intel's fourth generation of Xeon scalable CPUs is based on the same golden Cove core architecture that can be found in the performance course of their 12th gen desktop processors Yes you heard me last year's consumer chips that's a yikes but it does still mean a 15 IPC uplift over their previous generation Xeon so that's good and there's a lot more that's different AMD was the first to bring chiplet CPUs to the world processors that use multiple dies with a high speed interconnector glue as Intel derisively put it at the time how the turntables have turned tabled this generation xeons then will glue together up to four chiplets to reach core counts as high as 60. but the devil's in the details and Intel's glue differs from amds in some key ways while AMD sticks their compute and their caches together and then glues these core complexes to a separate chiplet that contains the memory controller and the i o Intel has opted to keep all memory and I O functions on die with the logic and cache then they take these near complete CPUs and wire them to each other using a fabric interconnect which means that in some ways it really is more like just gluing multiple CPUs together which is hilarious but hey at least they can glue them together in a lot of different ways Intel has announced and supposedly released 52 skus of fourth generation Xeon scalable with more apparently coming so it seems like part of their strategy then was to find every possible segment of the market and build a just right option for it inside it are two well one for now but we'll put the second one in a minute two Intel Xeon Platinum 8468 processors each with 48 cores 96 threads and a max turbo speed of 3.8 gigahertz these chips are equipped with 105 megabytes of cash have a 350 watt TDP and come in at an eye-watering list price of 7214 each I promise we're going to talk more about all of that especially pricing later first let's get this CPU installed this is a bit of a new mechanism one that I have not um seen before I'm going to need some thermal compound first and foremost because instead of installing the CPU in the socket and putting the heatsink on that you actually install the CPU to the heatsink and put the whole thing on the socket wild right okay so um paste you need so much of it we should call this oh a bit got in the socket that's probably fine you need so much of this they should call this CPU the paste eater also because it's been so successful so far okay sorry uh anywho um this thing is this is keyed so it only goes in one way oh my God this is ridiculous seriously this is what holds this in this arm yeah thanks I hate it no no no no no no no no this is what helps you get it out so oh you put it oh this levers it out okay so you just stick this boy in here oh my God seriously Intel you have how many billions of dollars to spend on engineering and this is the solution this is exactly the kind of precision engineered Jank that I would expect from Intel and then when it's time to get it out you use this little lever to pop it up okay we're not gonna do that right now ridiculous okay we got a little bit of thermal compound in the socket but um it looks like it mostly fell between the pins so hopefully this is going to work for Ram we have 512 gigs of 4 800 Mega transfer per second ddr5 which sounds like a lot but that is a fraction of the maximum that this server can handle thanks to Intel's support for up to eight channels of ddr5 per CPU and unlike Andy's competitor up to two dimms per channel that puts the total memory support for this system with two CPUs in it at 12 terabytes what the each CPU also brings 80 Lanes of pcie Gen 5 expansion to the table up to five integrated Hardware accelerators assuming you pay Intel to unlock them we'll definitely get to that later and on their soon to be released Xeon Max series of CPUs they're gluing up to 64 gigabytes of high bandwidth memory 2E directly on the package this could end up giving amd's 3D V cache technology a run for its money coming back to glue for a moment This Server may only have two sockets in it but the highest tier of sapphire Rapids chips can glue as many as eight of these chips together in a single server meaning that you could have up to 960 threads of computation on a single board absolutely dwarfing AMD epic which is expected to cap out at just two sockets and 512 threads per system even on their upcoming pergamo CPUs that's a lot of cores to dull out to your virtual machines thankfully you can easily manage and monitor all that stuff off-site with pulse phase mobile app it helps you track performance and you can get notified if a VM is acting out of turn and snipe it from the comfort of wherever your phone is not only does pulseway give you complete control over your servers and network computers from any mobile phone or tablet but their web app is also great for it management if you need to run updates or have concerns about CPU temperatures pulseway has intuitive automation tools for Windows Mac and Linux this means that you can approach monitoring across your entire environment without the need to micromanage every operation now let's get this thing up and running shall we maybe give cinebench a go to get an idea of all core performance I hope it actually turns on we did not anticipate this uh dang it Adam give her one of these yeah it's not there yeah okay well hold on let's put the shrouds in before they start trying to blow away the computer you have to have the touch uh it's not turning on we got blinking lights yeah we got blinking up here still not turning on holy that's it that's the noise we want [Applause] well let's see if it actually boots we did get it to turn on but there's a memory training error which means it's not seated properly so all we can really do until we find out where our torque wrench is because engineering has it is kind of try to get these the same very clever packaging this is apparently our Torx screwdriver do you happen to have a T30 bit okay how do I don't know oh you've never used it well sure yeah I mean you've probably used more Torque screwdrivers than I have no manual why would I use a manual I've got because people for that okay inch oh my god wow that's fun okay so how many newton meters it's a 0.904 this is scary this seems like too much okay then go two less the good news is if we break this thing we've already benchmarked everything so we'll just continue the video and pretend this didn't happen well one thing we know for sure is that it's a bit of a finicky socket to install in that's good for the dozens of you who will deal with this to know the good news as I mentioned before is that we already tested all this stuff ahead of time so wow what a fast cinebench render that we would have been looking at on this monitor but wait a challenger from team red approaches that's right we got another server and this one is equipped with a single Flagship AMD epic 9654 but that's not fair Linus you might say you can't put two CPUs up against one I can and I will two Intel 8468s costs fourteen thousand four hundred dollars one Epic 9654 costs around twelve thousand dollars same number of course better price and on paper they even hit similar all core frequencies shall we drag race them well spoiler we did it already so yes AMD is faster how about a blender render haha yes we did this already and AMD is faster again but as interesting as those tests are we should really be looking at workloads that are closer to what these server chips were actually built for like managing databases or virtualization unfortunately for Intel the story doesn't really get any Rosier Here postgres season tell get absolutely trounced by AMD I mean losing by that much in one of the most popular types of databases that's a really bad sign and what about raw Max a molecular Dynamic simulator well here Intel actually manages to pull out a win so their high performance compute dreams might not be totally crushed until you consider their margin of Victory here compared to their margin of defeat in pretty much any other General compute task epic is just looking like the obvious choice here unless you know for a fact that you're going to run one application and one only that happens to benefit from Intel's chip design and for all the Ruckus that Intel has made about efficiency improvements they lose in every single one of our tests and we understand that a dual socket system will use more power than a single socket system so this isn't a one-to-one comparison but here's the thing if AMD only needs a single socket for 96 cores well what am I supposed to do hamstring it by saying no you must have more sockets of course not and neither would any decent procurement officer who's evaluating this hardware for their needs if you want a mini core server Intel Sapphire Rapids costs more to buy and costs more to run and they have no one to blame it themselves today but as we said Intel is laser focused on the future and that future is AI so they put extra effort into implementing accelerators for AI inferencing and other common workloads directly onto the CPU now if you're a consumer the concept of a hardware accelerator might already be familiar unlike the general purpose cores on your chip accelerators are hyper efficient for specific workloads but then essentially useless for anything else Hardware video decoders for example are what makes it possible to watch YouTube for hours on end without your phone turning into a hot potato but that is all they do and they take up valuable dye space Intel clearly thought that was worthwhile and the first big one they built in is AMX which stands for advanced Matrix extensions sorry sorry uh you can think of this one as kind of an evolution of AVX or Advanced Vector extensions it is ideally going to provide a massive increase in the cpu's ability to perform AI inference with Intel sighting up to a 10 times improvement over AVX 512 I mean to be clear this is not going to replace dedicated accelerators like nvidia's T4 cards but it's a lot better than nothing so do they win out in a light AI workload then that's a yes with a capital holy AMX can perform AI tasks with double or triple the performance of AVX 512 that's fast almost as fast as you'll be in our new LTT tracksuit in general the lead over AMD is Stark even if this doesn't translate to gains in every AI workload and it could prove to be more and more useful into the future as we see small AI tasks sneak their way into software that might run on a system like this as opposed to a dedicated machine learning box that's stuffed full of gpus well do the rest of these accelerators do well first they're data streaming accelerator should improve performance and tasks where data is constantly generated by hundreds if not thousands of sources like logging the Telemetry data of many different sensors that you might be monitoring after a scheduled remote patch that you initiated with pulseway the in-memory analytics accelerator moves important analytical calculations of databases away from the CPU course then Intel's Dynamic load balancer is supposed to help manage and distribute work across the many cores in your CPU finally quick Assist Technology accelerates encryption and compression the idea here is pretty sound and you can think of it kind of like how pulseway works I know I keep bringing pulse way into it they sponsored the video what do you want so with pulseware you could do everything manually right but it's slower and it's less efficient so you can think of pulse way as kind of like a hardware accelerator for your workspace you spend some of your time using their intuitive automation workflow then your repetitive tasks run on autopilot allowing you to focus your brain power on important things which improves productivity or saves power whichever appeals to you more the thing is though while we would love to put all of these accelerators Little Time Savers efficiency makers to the test it's still early days and software support simply isn't there yet and it might never get there it all depends on whether organizations end up making use of these accelerators there is one feature though that Intel has ready at launch and it's got their shareholders a buzz even if nobody else is impressed it's called Intel on demand and frankly calling it a feature seems kind of generous what it does is it allows customers to upgrade their CPUs by paying Intel to unlock the hardware accelerators that are already in the Silicon on the chip but are blocked through software the most charitable possible take here is that this will allow Enterprise customers to Save A Buck at the time of purchase and then upgrade their chips down the line to accelerate new workloads no need to remove replace and reconfigure a brand new server which can be a hassle especially with how finicky these CPUs are you just unlock the features you need and you're on your way massively reducing the time to value for customers well that's great right savings on initial purchases is a good thing well kind of except that at risk of painting their entire 52 SKU lineup with a broad brush Sapphire Rapids is a pretty bad deal up front and that's even before you pay Intel's ransom for unlocking the hardware they already sold you I mean I'm not sure how it happened but Intel managed to price their top end chip 50 higher than amds which as we've already discussed kind of dunks on it so then how is it that Intel still has so much of the Enterprise market and why aren't more customers crossing the line over to AMD well it's a combination of factors first up is long-term deals many of these Sapphire rapid CPUs were purchased long ago and customers have just been wading through the delays for them to finally be delivered Intel also has both the manufacturing capacity and the engineering staff to support the kinds of customers who buy chips in the hundreds or the thousands or even the tens of thousands rather than one by one like you or I might do over the next couple of years though it's clear that AMD is going to continue to consume Intel's valuable data center market share especially in servers that rely on general purpose High Core account CPUs for specific workloads that can take advantage of Intel's accelerators though AMD has a lot of work to do and it's going to take some time but that's okay they've clearly got it and as bad as Intel's quarterly results and forecast look so do they I mean turning a ship as big as Intel takes years and they have plenty of cash on hand to navigate this rough patch I mean look at AMD many were skeptical that they would ever be able to turn it around after their embarrassing bulldozer line of CPUs but a CEO Swap and five or six years later the company was fully revitalized as they began launching product after product that made Intel shake in their boots like like what's happening now thanks again to pulseway when it comes to monitoring and management these folks are great so if you're an MSP or you
