you know I should set this up better you think at this point in my life I'd had this set up slightly better yet somehow here I am all right there you are all right so now I believe you're officially in look at that oh my gosh look at that it's Greg from left house it's my face it's all right do you ever get that joke I did does anyone ever love it okay you do oh absolutely I was like 15 right when that came out so it was a classic of my middle schooler experience or whatever early High School I don't know when that was but yeah definitely not Middle School you ever drink Bailey's from a shoe what you doing in my Waters boy uh that's great I'm happy happy genuinely sad if you're just like who's old Greg I'd be like oh like you gotta be like so sad that'll be so sad yeah you can't be named Greg and have existed in like the mid 2000s or whatever that was and not and I know that one but okay is that the same thing as having uh if you're named Aaron and getting a a Ron is there like these cultural movements like where you're just like well I guess this is because I got and his name is Robert Paulson Non-Stop because of a Fight Club so when I was young every dude like when I was like 10 11 years old every guy that was 18 is like and his name is Robert Paulson and I was just like I don't even get the joke what are we talking about that's not your name I know my name's not Robert Paulson but it's close enough it's my last name Paulson so I know so it's close enough uh anyways hey all right Greg so hey Gregory so I don't know if you've seen this idea of prime stack by the way uh it's faster it's Pastor Greg yeah so you're an episcopold Pastor how okay so can I can I just ask how does that work out or a priest how do you manage to have time to develop an amazing UI framework I assume you work full time I do not so that's a big part of it so I actually um I you know I basically grew up from the time I was a kid like probably a lot of people here um just kind of hacking away on stuff in my in my spare time um just like little hobby projects and stuff as a kid um and I basically as an adult um I'd worked on some kind of church related apps like when I was in seminary and then when I was serving in a church and I was working in a church full time like 2018 2019 um and then during the pandemic basically one digital thing that I had made really took off because a lot of people were using it for like online worship everyone shut down okay um and then basically the next church I went to is actually looking for somebody like part-time so I'm the the pastor here and I'm like 60 time at the church and I do some freelance web development stuff that you know um pays better than non-profit work right so it kind of filled in the salary pretty well um but then yeah I mean I basically um I did not anticipate adding like open source maintainer to that um which is rewarding in its own way but not so much with the with the cash um yeah it's been really fun just to build up a little community and stuff and I don't know they're kind of overlapping skills right like working with a bunch of cantankerous people who like sometimes get um into big fights over pretty obscure stuff is like a pretty good description of open yeah yeah I'm assuming bike shedding was originally done thousands of years ago at this point the the original Place yeah a lot of that yeah all right well I don't have that level of knowledge so I can't I can't even paint the bike shed at this point um all right so that's excellent so you've been developing leptos now for a while right and leptos is a pretty fiery people really like it yeah it's been pretty cool I the the first the first like directory on my computer that's called leptos is probably almost two years old at this point um but the current version I really started working on and maybe maybe June or July of this year so not actually that um recently but I had been through pretty much every iteration of what you can do with like rust wazen UI I just named them all the same thing but none of them were public at all um so it's been you know really just the last few months and I think it was September I made the you know repository public and all that so it's been pretty busy four or five months uh really okay and so just for everybody that doesn't know rust leptos uh leptos is a UI Library much like solid.js is it fair to say it's much like yeah it's fair to say that like in a lot of ways it's almost a port of solid so a lot of the apis have identical names work in very similar ways it's a little less um it's it's a lot more like baby's first reactive system but it is pretty much API compatible a lot of ways just um in the sense that I was like the router for example um I pretty much line by line ported solid router and stuff has changed over time but it's really nice to use a very similar mental model because then it means it's really easy to implement a lot of the same ideas okay okay and then uh one one more one more question on this whole leptos thing the the naming right everyone always does leptospirosis so obviously I don't think you thought of the disease at this I think you even told me once what you named it after what is leptos named after yeah yeah so it's it's an ancient Greek word which means like fin or light or um actually I guess fine grained um which I learned more recently um and so it kind of it's that idea of like this thin layer of something that's connecting different parts of your application um I apparently leptosporous is a thing I didn't know that it existed when I came up with this name I think it comes from the same Greek word like a lot of medical kind of terms um so you know sorry for any any dog owners people sometimes are like it's really disturbing when I Google this and when I Google it of course it just shows up as I'll talk about the framework because it's like personalized or whatever um but people who have dogs are like yeah I got a lot of kind of gross looking stuff um so I'm sorry about that everybody I'm probably not going to change the name but my bad you know that's actually that's actually really really funny I never even thought about it because when I search it up I also just get rust libraries right because I'm frequently searching up rust uh obviously Google knows me at this point and so you know I have dogs I just I don't search up anything to do with dogs I don't you know my dogs are not my babies they are just dogs I throw a ball forward and I enjoy having around and so that probably explains it okay that's uh yes that is also by the way the most nerdy thing ever to name it after a nice Arcane Greek reference and be like well actually did you know it's actually super great though right because if you name your thing like Fast Dom or whatever crap people name their things like blazing thing like all that stuff is taken on crates.io like I I've had no problem getting crate names you know repository names GitHub organization domains because like the only other thing called leptos is a is a um a real estate company in Cyprus oh yeah and then a disease yeah yeah okay yeah uh you know my general strategy has been for like getting names and everything is I let Twitter choose the name so I have like orgasm uh titty sprinkles you know I just got like the best names possible that the internet can come up with so man of God it's bad for my professional life probably doesn't reflect very well at church they're like hey what do you worry about I'm working on Teddy sprinkles have you heard of it it's actually named after pot I feel like what amazing I don't get it all right uh bun spreader was by far the most uh best named ones oh gosh I can't believe that happened anyways uh name it after uh graphic diseases yeah well okay so right you think about it though right and then there's there's all this stuff in Rusk because there's the like the crab right um and this like crab logo and what is a crab in Latin is like cancer whatever so there's all this stuff from like carsonization is like making a thing more Rusty and it's like guys you gotta not do this like let's just like back away from the like cancer I know it's cancer like the uh uh what's it called um zodiac symbol or whatever but like yeah so you know yeah fair enough I will make a donation if somebody finds like a leptospirosis fund fighting the disease I will make a donation to them that's a pretty big move right there we find leptospirosis online.org I don't see them in here trying to do a charity stream you know but the American leptospirosis Association if they come in we'll we'll do something if the Ala comes in we're right we're here we're ready okay yeah exactly I'll make it now all right all right so I did have some questions so I'm playing around with this whole idea of making something that's serverless uh uses uh uses leptos I I have Tailwind effectively Tailwind was really easy right all you got to do is just here's the files and it kind of just can guess its way into making it work out correctly and I right now it's cloudflare cloudflare seems to be the most supported just in general uh fermion actually reached out I actually got to meet with somebody they said they really want to make it work out as well for fermion so they were actively working on it right now as well so I think that's pretty exciting but I'm now addressing routes routes in serverless land now there's a lot of ways I'm my brain is already running right there's like the manual way which is theoretically you could just Define some simple controller that you pass in every function you want that is a route and it could be some sort of procedural macro that generates what it what its route is right so kind of like how you do actix today which is you have like a this is a get slash whatever and then inside of your actual actx router you're handing it each one of the you know the paths which doesn't necessarily feel as cool uh the second one is obviously uh having some sort of configuration based slash file based routing which does seem to be a little bit better but again that leads to the fact that the main file has to be generated and always a little worried about generation of code at least I assume it has to be generated I'm not sure if procedural macros can read from files and then take that you know take the code and import things correctly and and do all that that sounds a little uh you know that sounds like a lot I haven't you know investigated them enough and so that means either I'm doing something like that doing the first option or there's options I simply don't know about and I know you've done a lot with the leptos router and I know that has a lot to do with some level of routing though I don't quite understand it and so I would just love it if you could just like talk to us about what does routing look like in your in your view and if you were to make this what would be your preferred version of routing yeah for sure um so I guess the first thing that I would say is if you think about it um start just thinking on like a client-side app right um what is client-side routing really doing and the question is it's it's basically taking the URL and like the last part of the URL the path and the query string and it's deciding which components to show so like there's no magic there it is just an ordinary component you could Implement your own router in userland and it's actually part of why like the router packages separate because it's it's all implemented in userland in a sense right like you could create your own router using the stuff that's in the framework core um and so what it does is it just says like okay at any given point there's basically a signal here's the current URL and then it um it matches that against you know some paths that you've defined and then decides what to show on the page and we use like a nested routing thing kind of like um if people are familiar with remix nested routing I think they're adding it or they just added it in in next maybe solid.js does this but where different parts of your path can correspond to like different parts of the page so you can change a path and just you know the classic example is like an invoice page so it's like oh slash invoices and then it shows like you know you've got your menu up here that's on every page you've got your list of invoices that's just on the invoice page you click one and it's the invoice here um but when you change to another one you're routing to a different URL but it obviously doesn't swap out the whole page it just does this one little route you know so we have that kind of nested routing structure so if you look at any examples that use routing that's what's in that like routes component so we have this routes component and then nested within that there are route components and those can have their own children and stuff right and it creates basically this tree up here all the possible routes that we could match and then that just manages the routes thing just manages what to actually render um based on the URL so when you do that and that's all in the client side like that all just works on the client side um fine and then when you do it on the server you kind of have to decide um it can work like this you can say leptos just take my URL and I'm going to literally hand it a string that's like the path so when a get request comes in anywhere leptos deal with it and you you pass in this one context object that tells it what the path is it parses it out it'll render the stuff um to HTML and you're good to go um but you can also do something that's like a little more um specific where it says you know what are all the um uh what are all the possible routes that we could match and then the server only handles those particular ones um so that was kind of like a very very high level um obviously but so basically on on the the question right which is like how do you generate those routes you could do file system based routing if you wanted to um I don't particularly like it so I haven't done any work on it but the router is set up so that that routes component takes like a route definition and I usually you know you generate the route definition using a route component but you could generate it um you know by walking over your whole file system tree and defining routes like file system routing any other system and then just pass that thing into the routes and so like leptos router routes can still handle the actual routing but you can do the route definition however you want um either with the route component or by passing it like a route definition struct and then obviously you can generate that struct um like I don't think a proc macro would work I do think having something in cargo Prime stack running that's watching your directory tree that generates that and puts it in a generated file that could work um so quick question why don't you like file based routing that seems to be a pretty hot thing that people are really into as of right now what is your big argument against it I mean I can understand the pros right which are like all I have to do to add a route is out of file I don't have to also add something somewhere else I've just never seen an implementation of it that doesn't look horrible once you get like three or four pages in or a couple levels nested um because so many of them like every single file ends up being named index.tsx or whatever or there are these weird syntaxes like I as someone who you know not being super familiar with spell kit or next or whatever I feel like I can look at config-based routing or like component-based routing and understand what the structure is supposed to be but if I see like a screenshot of somebody's directory tree with this file system routing I don't feel like I can look at it and understand what how it works without some more knowledge of the framework um so it's just like a personal aesthetic thing but you know the router is set up so it's possible I think in Rust it's also tricky because in JavaScript the file system and the module tree are pretty closely linked so like you can import something from a file path kind of um and because Rush that's not totally how it works I think it's a little trickier too but I don't think it's like undoable yeah no I mean I personally anytime people put additional meaning on things that aren't supposed to have meaning I always take a step back and go is this a good idea so for example if you haven't seen the last couple tweets I say null was a mistake the reason being is people try to put additional meaning on top of what null means right like oh it also means that I have intentionally intended it to be empty right and so it's just like now you're playing the game of intentions which is just it's always a hard thing to do and so when I look at some of these file based routing it's just like what does underscore mean why is it surrounded with brackets now I have to learn like a whole new very simple DSL to understand what is happening on that page and I do find that uh I find it a little bit hard do you know what I mean I I don't know if I like that like something inside of me says hey this is probably not the right place to optimize but what's wrong with it I can't quite tell you what's the thing that's wrong with it you know what I mean I just know something's wrong with it I can see it just like when I see someone using doll intentionally I'm like why why are we doing this what can we do differently you know it's negative one all over again yep yep all right so if you were to do this what what do you think your preferred approach would be yeah so I actually um and I put this in the in our private chat if you want to look at it at any point um but I put like I've been working on a little draft kind of cloudflare integration and so we have these actics and axon Integrations and what those do is basically to let you um go into the router for those servers and say literally like um you know it's like router new whatever you add any other routes you want dot leptos routes and then you can kind of Mount your app at a particular point and it generates it actually runs the app once pulls out here are all the routes that leptos can handle and then it has the server handle all of those um and it's a way of basically like connecting the leptos router into the the native router um so if I were you know if I were you if I were trying to do this I would say something like that and cloudflare it's actually lucky because the the cloudflare worker router um accepts really similar patterns to the leptos router so if you look at their like examples that use the cloud for a worker router um they take like like say I wanted you know um slash users slash colon ID and that's like a param that then I have access to ID it's the exact same thing in leptos like I think the the syntaxes are exactly the same so it's really easy to map them like one to one um and then yeah you just have leptos take over render it return the HTML um and there's like slightly more complex stuff you need to get into for like streaming HTML and for handling server functions and stuff and that's why we package them up in these Integrations so that you don't have to write all the boilerplate yourself um but like that's what I would probably do right let people Define the routes in that routes component um and then you know there's just this very short like I think I I put together a quick demo the other night and it was something like four lines of code for the user to to connect it like it's not a big I'm not a boilerplate um and then it also means that you can swap it out between different providers so it makes it like I really like things that are kind of modular and composable and separate from one another so you can write your whole app in one place and then if you're like ah you know cloudflare workers actually aren't working for me anymore I want to switch to axum you can just switch it out for the Axiom integration instead um and then build a server um so that's kind of what I like doing but you know then again you can you can generate the routes with the CLI tool or whatever you want it's not there are very few opinions right um you mean there's a lot of opinions well right I'm sorry I I want the framework to have very few opinions right so that your opinions can be how you do things not my opinions because my opinions might not be very good yeah yeah no I can definitely see that uh I mean so when I think of the file based routing one thing I think about is any simple application like if I were to build like even if I were to build say a uh a simple rust website that does just say one thing pretty well there might be three four screens like that makes it really easy right there's not a lot to it if I were to build Netflix though I think I think it would be difficult uh I think that it would be pretty hard to really do a Netflix experience well with file based routing uh and so I always have this problem which is like there's it almost feels like there's kind of two audiences here there's the more like prolific user the one that's going to be doing the more complicated items and then there's the person that's like I just want to block right I just want something I can just like throw down some markdown files into a folder and Bob um I just have like a working thing and so that's why I mean that's why I still like Astro I you know I'm not a big JavaScript guy but I feel like Astro is just like it's just such a this is the thing I would use if I make a Blog because it is just that it is exactly that yeah exactly all right it's like perfect it's like totally perfect for that and and that's really like a right tool for the job question right I mean nobody people ask um I don't want to hurt this person's feelings but I think they popped into Discord asked one question and left but like somebody came in and asked um hey I'm trying to figure out if I should use lactose or solid and you know then uh uh asked him like well what's your use case and he's like well I want to use it for my eCommerce startup and it was like okay this is a great example of picking the right tool for the job like if you're building an e-commerce startup I would not recommend that you use a four-month-old open source Library using webassembly to build your company on right and then be relying on me fixing bugs in my spare time uh because your thing is broken in prod just like don't do that like pick the right tool if you're building a blog like if you love rust and you want and you don't care you know and you want to use leptos for your blog like cool but like Astro is a great tool there are a lot of great tools for blogs like just use the right thing right please sorry I I do reach out while we're doing this but so I said it's a perfect example of someone who should not build an e-commerce startup if you're coming into my Discord to ask technology questions um reconsider that startup yeah yeah you know my my buddy is now he he just got he's he's on to like his third or fourth e-commerce startup and this one's actually fairly successful it's uh a publicly traded company it's like a subsidiary or a you know kind of like the Siemens group all those people that do these huge conglomerations uh he's one of the small ones and his answer to this is use WordPress if you're going to build an e-commerce thing build plugins make money there it's a hundred times simpler and people you could I mean there's just like a million and a half businesses you know leptos is not it's not just the wrong language but it's like really it might even be fully wrong in just the idea the premise of it all yeah absolutely absolutely but that's like the thing with open source rate is that people should be having fun like if they're not having fun with what they're doing with with side projects or whatever you know that's going to be a huge problem if you're doing it for work if you're like I want to make money I need to get a solid job like yeah be a WordPress dad be a be a reactive whatever right but if you want to like grow and learn and have fun do whatever you want but don't confuse those two things right I think that's really important um I use I mean I people people may have seen me if anyone's on like Ryan's stream I'm in there sometimes Ryan carnado of solid and like I'll say like I maintain several angular apps because like yeah it's great I mean I don't have to do anything they're they're year after year I can just keep up updating angular and it's awesome right like you don't nothing breaks you know it's it's like sweet right I get paid to good money to do angular apps and like that's fine right like just know your audience and do your do your work and um and get it done but like yeah learn and grow and have fun with side projects and we do have a couple of people who are using leptos for some work stuff now but they are there are people who are willing to contribute and who have become really core contributors I think that's really important with with young open source projects yeah yeah you have to if I mean the hard part is creating anything without more people helping yeah it's just it can't it's it's non-sustainable uh unless if you have like the extremely fortunate situation of like Rich Harris or somebody that it's your full-time job but even then it's still not that maintainable because you'll just you'll never get past the stage of answering questions like you gotta have it's fairly distributed work all right so exactly I like I like I like what you said I'm gonna definitely go investigate some of those because that was kind of like the two things I was thinking about which is like all right it sounds like like it sounds like I may be generating routes like that might be that might be the plan here but I also do like this leptos router thing is there any dangers in it any things that you see that uh what what isn't it good at yeah well I'll tell you something that leptos is really not good at right now which came up this week for somebody um so we do this um so because we use like resources if anyone knows solid there's this create resource primitive leptos does the same thing which is like a fine-grained async primitive so if you want to load um do like a fetch request right you'll stick it inside this and it synchronizes like an async thing with the reactive system which is all synchronous and then it's really cool if you're building an app we actually if you're doing the um server side and client side it will start loading that on the server and stream it down to the client so it's almost like if you're doing a fetch request or a database thing um to an API whatever it's almost like a promise that starts loading on the server and resolves in the browser which means it's super fast and we do the same exact thing for HTML that's in a suspense component like it will render the fallback initially and then it will actually send the HTML down from the server to the client when it's ready and swap it in so you'll actually often sometimes see the full HTML like before the JavaScript and wasm have even finished loading because your request started on the server it's really cool um the big problem is that because it's this like out of order streaming you've already sent most of the page so things like errors and things like metadata so like meta tags with stuff that Facebook uses or Discord uses or whatever for generating their nice little previews is um it's too late to to send those basically and they don't detect them so we've actually had some problems where somebody was like wait a second Facebook isn't seeing any of my stuff and it's in the Dom and it's like yeah it's it's because we've already sent down in order to get this really fast first load you sacrifice you know you send the thing down so I'm going to do some work upcoming on just like better async rendering like that but if you have a page that's really based on um asynchronous data where your goal isn't just to like show it really fast on the page um so I guess like for Content sites right that that's kind of a weakness right now um if you're just trying to like do like a if it could have been written in PHP 15 years ago right if it's like someone asks for article go to SQL database to get article render article the HTML return it that kind of stuff you can do but there are some downsides um because it's this like finer grained approach for the async stuff um but again like that's something that you know we can work on that's kind of the biggest one right now um and then of course I would say just big problem for all wasm stuff right now is the kind of time to interactivity is a tends to be a little slower than JavaScript just because um as in binary sizes are big and it's very hard to um to bundle split so you you don't get that same like a JavaScript you know something in a framework like solid or spell that might load like 10 kilobytes of JavaScript in order to make your page interactive well leptos is going to be like 10 kilobytes of JavaScript Plus you know whatever 100 kilobytes of webassembly once it's all gzipped and stuff so it's just like that that interactive time which is part of the e-commerce thing right if you're doing like eBay or if you're doing something where milliseconds are literally dollars in terms of load time uh there's no web assembly technology that's that's really good for you right now yeah hold on one second I'm just gonna too much arguments going on too much arguments and the the darn YouTube chat I swear they're crazy uh all right I really do appreciate that I I one I do have one more question I think that's by the way I think that's really good to know kind of where your weaknesses are um just because it is you know it's it is a hard sell to have that much wasm come down now whether or not it's good you know long term there's also cashing blah blah you can make a lot of arguments but you know none of that really fixes first load and you know that's still important to a lot of people that's still very very important to a lot of people um one more question I I'm just curious in your head you have these server functions I never actually even played with it how how do they work what what do you what do you do there what's going on underneath the hood so when I go and play with them I want to know because obviously there must be a route that it somehow generates some router has to pick that up there's you know obviously there must be the components server functions route that actually just then has a mapping that knows how to get there right yeah what's the deal it's awesome I actually really really like them it's one of my favorite features and it's something where I actually think um again it's inspired by solid.js I like our version better because it gets around some like the the pitfalls almost um but basically we have a server proc macro right and you can use it if I declare like function my server function and I put that server macro annotating it um what that does is it takes the body of the function and it has like a certain return type right so it returns like a result of whatever type you want and then server function error but it takes the body of the function and it rewrites the function so that on the server your function just runs and on the client it defines a route on the server and when you call the function on the client it sends a request to the server with the arguments runs it on the server and then sends back the data so basically what you can do is like in a single file you can um have you know your component that's defining the user interface for um adding a post to your blog in the database and then in that file you define here's a server function that's like add post um and when you click the button and it calls that server function on the client it's actually sending a request to the server um and then the next level is the way that it does that it actually uses um like URL form you know a form URL encoding rather than sending like a Json or something for the arguments but what that means is that you can actually build a form out of it so that say I have arguments like title and content which are both strings to my server function then I can have a form and I can put an input name equals title the text area name equals content and I can actually put the the action of that form is the server function URL and when I submit the form it makes a post request to the server function and does it um and then we do like you know some Progressive enhancement if you have the wasm enabled but what that does is it actually means that you can create a form that can function correctly before the JavaScript and webassembly have loaded and it just acts like a traditional like multi-page app form that you're posting something and then if the wasm has loaded it will do a client side and it gives you like optimistic UI and stuff um so it's just like a really nice graceful degradation thing because of that was in load time and stuff um but basically yeah so the idea with server functions is that you can just like co-locate stuff so you can write rather than the kind of old school model right which would be like I have three things which are I have a server with some business logic I have a client with the UI and then in the middle I have this third thing that is a contract that's like a rest API that the middle this guy hits and that calls this guy yeah um basically you just cut out the middleman um which is again like it's the sort of thing that if you're working on a huge project with big teams you probably do want more explicit contracts and apis but if you are just building an application yourself or if you have teams where people are working on stuff that's really independent um like it's kind of good to be able to write that logic yourself right uh someone just actually brought up a really great question which this I have hit this and I'm not sure what the state of modern web is versus previous which is isn't there a limit uh to the URL length and how big are these Foreman Coatings I you know you could technically write a lot but I mean last time I I haven't looked into this in 10 years and there's a bug on Xbox and being able to sign in I think this is what the bug with Netflix like eight years ago where the length of the URL got too long and would explodiate through some Microsoft server and so I thought it was 2000 and so I mean that does leave a lot of room for I mean there's a lot of form you can send in in 2000 uh yeah 2000 characters so two things one there's a distinction right between um okay so I just want to say because HTML is the greatest programming language of all time I'm just going to throw that out there there's a distinction between a form method equals get and Method equals post right and a get form is kind of like a navigation where you are adding things to the query string and it's putting it in the URL this is in the body okay a post form is in the body so this is using post and it's putting it in the body so it's the same as any other HTML form you could do I'm sure there's still a limit um I myself have run into the URL length issue because I was doing something um putting everything in the URL which I love because you can copy and paste and share a URL and reproduce the state I had this huge like Json object that I had serialized and put in the URL and it got to be too long so people were were sharing stuff with this huge num amount of configuration stuffed in there um and I actually I ended up using a like a Json compression thing to get it to like a base64 series it's great it's a terrible idea it's a terrible idea don't get yourself in that situation this is the sort of thing that happens with like feature your creep when you're doing freelance work and you're a one-person team and initially they say you know we don't need it yeah we don't need a server side right we don't want a database like we don't need this stuff because we don't want to pay you for it and we don't want to pay to maintain it um so like yeah yeah it's fine we'll just do and this is like a mobile app that had a web app too right and it's whatever um it's all client-side stuff um but then they're like hey yeah we really want to be able to like you create this document and then you share it with somebody and I'm like okay well we can do that if we just instead of using a database to save it we just encode everything in the URL and then suddenly yeah you hit you know mobile Safari has a different URL length limit or whatever and you can't reproduce the bug because it's just mobile Safari or whatever it is you know so yeah don't don't do stupid things like that I'm on your team don't do stupid things yeah but I mean what can you do if you can't use a database there's only one other storage that's available that can be shared or repointed to which is the URL exactly by the way why don't you go with Deco encoding code that with sweet binary and then just put that in the URL didn't know Deku existed at the time that's probably why we do have I'll say with the server functions too we do have um you can use cbar encoding so it doesn't work with the forms then because like a form doesn't know about that but if you are just doing it with the you know with like leptos with wasm you can actually use a binary encoding to send stuff to server functions um so it doesn't have to be like serializable to text or something and it can be a pretty big object okay yeah because I was using uh so when I'm playing around kind of with Vim Royale right it's like you know yeah fun project I'm doing every now and then and that one I was able to I can currently hot swap out Json or Deku and the program's none the wiser right because it all just uses proc macros and serialization so you know it has no idea really what's going on there's an if statement somewhere that's like use this one or use that one but that's about it yeah it's awesome I mean then the thing the thing I love about that right is um it's like a very Rusty way I remember people I was watching the stream a little while ago and people were asking about like oh but like why are you saying rust can do this without super Json and um what you call it Zod or whatever I was like yeah this is just like Siri this is just how it works right if it's deserializing something that's not valid it just gives you an error you know it's like not a big deal um that it's this and it can serialize stuff it doesn't matter the type of it as long as it's like if it derives the trait like it's just it's just what we do right I know it's hard to like describe that it's hard to describe that because if you don't have the problem is if your fundamental notion is that what you decode eventually becomes like like a map then you don't have this idea that no the schema really is the thing you say it's going to be so why have a schema plus the thing you say it's going to then you have to like do this like double running of everything you have to like decode it plus make it decode again but in a sec it's just it just seems crazy talk to me but there's no equivalent in in Json and like we love smart typescript Engineers right smart typescript Engineers will do give you a thing that does like a run time validation but that also comes out with the right types and like these people are doing type stuff that's Way Beyond me and it's awesome and I'm just like hey or it's just like I don't know man that's I don't know I I kudos to you for doing that but an alternative is using a real programming language and that's what like when people like like me and I think like you who'd like rust um joke about JavaScript it's not like it's not about people using JavaScript right it's just like as as a language once you use other languages it just is so limited in what you can actually do with your stuff and it's it's so limiting to you right like so how am I trying to relate it is that if you're old enough you have done JavaScript you started off in a JavaScript world and maybe you came from java right maybe you came from C plus plus and you started doing JavaScript and you're like wow this is so much better uh I really really like this yeah there's some things I don't like about it but man this is better uh I don't really need types types are silly I don't really need them right you kind of develop this mentality you start doing it and then after a while you try typescript and there's this weird thing that happens you realize wait a second I do like types like I did really like this experience and you realize how bad it was being in JavaScript but then you just stop there and you're just like oh I can't get any better you're like no well the problem is is things can get better or there's trade-offs like you should just keep on trying new things because you'll realize like wow that's like you can't tell somebody why enums are so great in Rust if all they know are typescript genomes like typescript enums or the devil and Rusty nums are you can have what makes go so painful in types just right there you don't have to have interfaces anymore you can just have proper types everywhere you need them and so it's like it's so hard to describe those problems because you could only get there by doing it once I feel like I can't you know no one could tell me that right if they told me I'd go I don't get it like I mean I get what you're saying but I don't get it yeah I just want to just read and chat too I want to give a shout out to the person who said yes my position is indeed that Rustin HTML or the only real program languages uh that's amazing you know you all know that I'm trolling you but it's also true right like people don't appreciate I think there's been a Renaissance in people kind of rediscovering HTML right and like HTML Now versus HTML 15 years ago there's a lot of cool stuff that you can do um and even things like like the thing that frustrates me is they continue doing really dumb stuff like the new dialogue element which is amazing right you can use it to create modals only like it doesn't respond to the open attribute or something like there's there's always dumb stuff like you always have to call some method they're always like you know what you know what was amazing like 90s style imperative object oriented programming let's do that um but you know so like fair enough like but I I just I think people like the more you learn about stuff like how to really use forms even stupid stuff like the details element that I feel like is really underused like partly because you can't style it a lot but you know and I think partly this is also coming from me right trying to ship as little web assembly as possible to make the page load as fast as possible but the same applies to trying to ship as little JavaScript as possible like the more you can use stuff that's already built into the browser in HTML the less code you're writing which means the fewer bugs you're writing which means the less code you're shipping which means the faster your page is loading like it's it's really win-win the more you learn about HTML which is the world's I will admend it the world's second greatest program in language after after rest yeah you know HTML is definitely tragic and some of their their consistency and integration with JavaScript like such as like on change on a select doesn't work like that just this just emotionally damages me like you should have just made on change work like you I understand that on select is technically more correct or unselected but it changed let's not let's not beat around the bush here let's just like let's just be real I gotta tell you something that literally literally physically hurt me when I saw it um so somebody was asking me about something with one of the canvas apis can you can you pull up docs.rs and go to the web syst docs okay let's say add docs uh docs RS uh it's web Dash sis right uh it should be understood uh there we go okay yeah there you go so if you go to HTML canvas element uh let's see if I can just find an HTML canvas element there we go and go to the just the first function get context let's see uh get context there we go okay so either move me or scroll so that people can see the whole function signature there all right let me just I'll put you up so you can see that at the same time it's nice this is the most cursed function I've ever seen look at that pubfun get context takes self great takes context ID and string and it returns result option object Jazz value which means this function when you call it could be an error could be an error right because literally anything can throw anywhere fine or it could be nothing or it could be some object but we cannot make any other claims about what that object is other than it's a JavaScript object because the way they designed this API was you pass one of like four strings and each of those strings corresponds to a different JavaScript class for one of these four different like canvas oh that's right because there's like canvas objects context 2D there's there's all those other ones oh I like the fact that you also can get a JS value like I mean the reality is Javascript can just like oh it's an error but it's a string and you're just like yeah why would you make it anything so somebody asking this question like how do I get the context and I was like drill a hole in my head before it's like that is so bad and I and so like that right and you know the thing that kills me right is like it's written in C plus plus yeah so somebody's taking a static like a type get like casting it into just like a generic JavaScript object and then returning it to you and it just kills me it's so brutal so that's what like when I when I tease JavaScript it's it's stuff like this that like well yeah but like Greg you say if I just write my code right I know what string I'm passing in and therefore I know what class I'm getting out so who cares and it's like well yeah if you just write all your code right everything's fine that's not how anyone's life has ever gone though but for me who's constantly breaking stuff in production because I swore that function would never return undefined and it did and then I tried to access a field on undefined that's actually pretty funny you know that is that is a pretty cursive anytime that you do the result option I I just feel like there's something has gone a little bit goofy there it's like not only can it be an error but it can also just not be there it's just like why do you why would you want to handle this many separate cases like it just feels so just it's hard for me but I mean I get it I get that but for HTML that probably shouldn't happen either the thing's there or it's not there it's not I just don't understand why not there is not an error sorry you asked for something that doesn't exist this canvas can't exist here you go right also stacked race um gone a little far afield but I just thought you would appreciate that one as far as JavaScript as a language at its type system yeah yeah you know and it's very impressive because I think for the most part if I'm not mistaken typescript because it's its ability to be like a programmatic type system it can kind of Define itself around these things I think it actually does return the correct type given the string blah blah blah blah blah because you can overload things for specific types and that's just the power of having a crazy type system yeah typescript can do cool stuff with strings and template strings and things um and I don't know how exactly it works but like that's true like in Rust string is a string as a string so you know that that is like a trade-off I guess I found I I'll have to re come back up with the example but I found a hole in the typescript current system I don't know if it's still a problem in 5.0 but if you use the method and you pass in a string it'll tell you what your arguments should be but inside the method if you say here's my string it'll say I still don't know what your arguments are you have to like pass them to figure it out so it can figure it out on the outside just not on the inside what uh what the types should be so it's like this string matches to this type based in a map and you do a generic with a key of type of and it just like exfoliates I think the thing that people don't get about the differences between typescript and something like rust is that the reason rust is so strict about types and stuff is because it literally needs to know how to lay things out in memory whereas typescript is always going to fall back to javascript's Dynamic type system so even if you think something is this really strict or static or whatever type I don't know any of the technical type terms right but even if you have everything fully typescripted out um at runtime JavaScript doesn't know about any of that stuff so you don't get any of the like performance benefits of having all the types there but you do get some so like rust wouldn't ever have a situation where it had that inference wrong because it would be like how do I where do I put this thing in memory like how do I fit it into the computer like it just needs to know stuff which is part of why it's less flexible but also part of why it um you know the inference and everything is so perfect yeah yeah that's one thing that is really hard to describe to people is that typescript fundamentally Works in such a way that no matter what you create instantaneously goes to the Heap in some way or the other it's a boxed value that isn't ref counted it's not you know it's it's not cleaned up when it goes out of scope it's held onto until its garbage collection ring has been called to be collected and so if you last longer than I don't know 500 milliseconds how fast are you garbage collecting how long does it stay in the nursery you can't even like Define its performance characteristics actually one of the this is like a rant up and I feel very ranty about which is you'll see these things where people like compete uh JavaScript against C plus I just saw one recently where they're just like see javascript's about half the speed of C plus plus but they're all like a bunch of calculation functions in which you're totally missing the fact that JavaScript has an entire other side of it which is garbage collection and that whole side which you can't measure in a tight Loop doing calculations that doesn't exist you're just you're only testing jit versus compiled and optimized yeah exactly and it's monomorphic jet like you're giving it the best possible case jet that's not usually your average yeah and it's the reason you see even in so I want to say on um dread pirate Roberts right I want to get to that question about full while some support in the Dom but the reason you see some some of the performance differences in like something like JS framework Benchmark right that's really artificial and just rendering speed whatever all of the wazen Frameworks are already faster than any of the JavaScript ones in things like swapping two rows so render a thousand rows and then swap row two and row 998 or whatever starting at zero and you swap them and it's because the wasm the list diffing is so much faster because in JavaScript it can you know jit optimize something but it also always has to be ready to de-optimize and like bail out at any given any given iteration um so wasm is already faster at certain kinds of you know operations it's just the stuff that's writing across to the Dom so people are constantly asking about um you know when does wisdom get direct on access because then um in terms of performance if if wasm can interact directly with the Dom um it should be much faster than JavaScript for all those operations too um assuming that they let you do things like use utf-8 strings which is one of the big big issues right now is because JavaScript is utf-16 correct so passing things from wasm into JavaScript into the Dom actually you have to re-encode every string um but I mean I think that the answer is at least three or four years ago they were starting to work on interface types stuff um which would be like allow you to do that and over time it looks like they've gotten more and more General with those proposals so now there's like this component model proposal and it's because people are trying to use wasm in more and more environments like using it for wasm time like for serverless for um plug-in systems and they want to make a more generic model so it's not just how does wasm access the Dom it's how does wasm interact with its host environment um and I think the result of that has been just taking time to develop that stuff and then the thing with browser development is like you know wasm time already implements the component model right but it's not like Chrome implements the component model Firefox implements a component model Safari implements it iOS Safari implements it iOS Safari on your grandma's iPad that she can't update anymore influence it the problem and it works but there are probably sites that it breaks you see this with people shipping JavaScript with um question mark dot the um optional chaining optional chaining right um where people people ship they say ah man we don't need to um you know transpile to ES five or whatever anymore we can do more modern versions everybody has more modern if you are if you're on an iPad that's old that you can't update then you can update Safari and it just breaks on your and it just it just is not valid JavaScript syntax right so it's problems like that I would say I said to somebody earlier today like I think probably within the next two or three years we might have direct on access um the reality is if you look at these benchmarks and stuff it's not actually a performance issue for us anymore it would be awesome to have um but like you can write a leptos app that's faster than any JavaScript framework except solid so at that point like the direct dominance just doesn't matter that much yeah if if react can exist then that whole entire argument about performance is not a real argument now the the so do you think what causes such big um uh wasm sized bundles like what is that why are they 250k why are they these sizes yeah yeah well I mean if you think about it um I think there are a couple reasons one is that like a binary executable is always going to be larger than an interpreted text file um just across the board right so like a python File versus a C plus plus application that do the same thing right it's so it's not like rough specific or why some specific um but I think one of the big things people don't think about too is like JavaScript gets to ship its entire standard library in your browser which is pretty huge and like uh you know rust that say it's um say a basic we'll say Sycamore instead of lepto Sycamore gets a little smaller bundle size right Sycamore can can give you a basic component that's like 40 kilobytes of wasm ungzipped in that 40 kilobytes that's pretty good you have it's amazing it's great yeah leptos is maybe 60 right now um and that's unzipped gzip that's like 15. yeah I don't consider G7 wire size that's that's always dramatically smaller yeah yeah so um but if you think about what that bundle includes that includes a memory allocator that includes if you use a VEC that includes the implementation of VEC for every type that every T that there's a vect t right because rust monomorphizes stuff um you know like it has to ship everything you need to run that application it doesn't just have a JavaScript array that your browser has the implementation of so it's kind of like there's a little bit of apples to oranges where a bunch of the binary size of a bunch of the bundle size of JavaScript is actually living in your browser already installed on your computer if they had to ship everything that they need to implement it it would be very different but so I think that's one of the big differences yeah the whole V8 thing really gives JavaScript a leg up that you know they have that whole like list concept or you can put anything inside of a list and it's just you know no one had to make a code for that uh lithium did have a really good question I do want to hear this one as well which was uh State Management what what do you currently use for State Management because when we talked I just used you know uh there's a global context there's a used context in which you can pass in a type which is super cool that you can use generics passing a type and outcomes the actual thing that you put in there which is super convenient uh and then I just take that and I box leak it for those that don't do Rust that effectively means you tell the compiler that this thing will never die so therefore keep it around forever so you get this reference to it which will live for the entirety of the program it also makes it super easy I believe it implements clone off the rip so you can just like pass it around to wherever and it's just a super simple and so that's been my current Estate Management solution which is just one Global context object though I'm sure there's better well what is your current take on this yeah yeah so on on State Management and just one I guess one last point thread pirate Roberts you're asking about binary size Dynamic dispatch yes gets smaller binary sizes and there are other tricks that you can do like um that I can do really that like using a um if you have a generic function but you can Implement like a concrete function internally so it doesn't need to monomorphize all of that stuff that's another trick and I just got like a three to five percent was in binary shrinkage across the framework by doing some of that stuff just a hour or two of work um I've never heard a man so impressed by shrinkage as you yeah man 35 shrinkage is Big when you're when you're uh killing me um but so the so State Management right I think I have like two or three different answers um answer number one is if you're writing any meaningful application with like multiple routes your primary State Management solution should be the URL so like the primary thing that determines the state of your application in my opinion should be the URL um you can have local state within Pages within components um like in like what do I have entered in this form um but basically any change possible should be reflected in the router so that if somebody reloads the page or if somebody um I mean it's a universal resource locator right like if you're doing big state changes that aren't reflected in the URL probably not a great idea people will be frustrated when they copy and paste a URL it doesn't work um so that's like answer number one which is like making the remix guys happy right that's like Ryan Florence is out there pushing this every day URLs as State Management answer number two like in a practical sense um I think what you saw with um with vimorale right is when you're like writing leptos code you're actually not writing very much leptos code yeah you're writing your code and then when you need to update something reactively you're like writing to a signal that you've stored somewhere and that's a really really good way of doing it I think um and because the signals are not like coupled to components really unlike a set state or something um you can you can do that you can store them all somewhere and then just update them and that's a really smart thing to do I think using context is the answer right um because if you create some signals up here and then you pass them down with provide context when you consume them down here it doesn't cause like everything in the tree underneath it to re-render like it would with a really naive use of react context um because you're getting a signal and you're pulling it out right here so if I set it over here and I use it down here when I set it here it just Updates this thing down here like it doesn't cause any other effect in the tree so passing signals with context is really effective I mean we've had um somebody created this create slice API which basically created like a if you had a big state object like a state machine that was going to drive your whole application you could create a slice of it which would give you a signal for just one of the fields and that would only update when that field changed so you could do almost like an Elm style or like a u classic component where you just have a data struct and you put a signal around that and then you create a lot of little slices of it that update in a fine-grained way um so there are a couple different solutions but honestly just taking a signal and passing it through context is is really simple for anything like theming or whatever that you need to do that yeah that makes a lot of sense because uh the the Vim Royale stuff because it's a much different use case right this is not it is a single page app and I guess if you will the most intentional term of that which is you play an actual game single page yeah you play a literal game in the browser therefore having a bunch of you know effectively signals for me to manipulate your movement and all that made it exceptionally simple whereas I don't think trying to render that top down or even at specific locations within the whole set would make it very hard and also make it probably slow enough to be a little ouchy but this uh this felt really good very fast I really liked it people are saying with create slice it sounds like Redux slices yes exactly same exact concept okay okay so all right I am I I do like I do like the idea of URL so that's something so in about 2015 when we were creating Falcor uh the ultimate data fetcher pre-trc trpc trpc thing right that also involved caching by the way caching exceptionally hard I don't know if you've ever written a caching item it's extremely hard I did it for over a year I never it never was quite right caching is really hard um during that time our big thing was URLs should be the main decider of what happens on the page right like that was the thing that was the state management and you know react router definitely does happen and things happen and it's never quite as good but I really did like the idea that URL is the driving uh the driving force not pre-tcp trcp right yeah dang it what is it PCP kids PCP a gallon of it uh GPC grpc right gcp that's a different thing yeah yeah but yeah so yeah it was like I really liked that notion um I'm curious how well that works in larger and larger and larger environments because you know we did try some of it it always looks amazing in any Toy app you build yeah oh dude okay don't lie to okay first off LG okay I I can never get that right looks good to me I always felt like this looks that that one that one right there I can never yeah I always go else it's too gooey yeah I always say that I'm like I didn't get it right but I think they got the idea yeah yeah well definitely with the URL driving State thing right you get these things like okay so then if I have a modal that comes up on the page does that mean I'm supposed to have like slash modal in the URL and someone's like yeah yeah yeah it's like okay well what if that's not the final route what if it's like slash user slash ID slash account but I want to put a modal down here on slash users and it's like yeah I can understand how it doesn't actually scale that well to more complicated things there just comes a point where you accidentally I mean the problem with the model is that it really is two routes in one you're creating two eight two uis you have two layers and once you do that yeah F your whole thing up and everybody's sad about it sorry these are like me like back when I used to try to do the UI architect stuff and this was just like the emotional turmoil of trying to make these like hard and fast rules like URL for everybody and then you come across them like this and you're like I hate my job yeah yeah all right well that's great hey Greg I appreciate you coming on this was great I need to go invest I'm gonna go play around with uh your server functions and uh cloudflare see try to make those things work out because that's like a big starting of it all right awesome Yep and check out I I sent you in chat just a branch that I was working on some of this Cloud Fair stuff it's not going to compile because there's some weird type but uh to delete the thing that doesn't compile and do deal with the rest of it but hopefully you can see a little bit of what I was talking about with that like lepto's routes thing and all that um but yeah this is fun yeah this was great I appreciate having you on it was great to know you hey let's get your uh let's go let's get your little Twitter in here huh oh sure yeah yeah Twitter thanks chat you guys have been very very great I hope I ticked you all off by talking about HTML um the second greatest programming language ever you're really emotionally hurting people with that one all right go give Greg a follow good guy obviously crushing it out on on some sweet uh whatever you call this stuff there you go my hands on the wrong side crushing it out with all the wasm leptos rust stuff they probably are much better at rust than I am you know I find that until you write a library rust is actually pretty easy the moment you go Library also in Rust gets way harder yeah yeah definitely it definitely is like there is a level of but it's also cool right because there are certain kinds of errors that it's like somebody will come to me with an error and it's like what is this weird message I'm like oh yeah you just need to X because I've done it 100 times to myself right it's like you see the same error messages over and over with all the generics and um and I'll say honestly like doing stuff with the browser world is even different because I get to not deal with a lot of things like lifetimes or whatever because the browser wants everything to be static lifetimes anyway so you're just like doing RCS and and it's all single threaded where so there are whole areas that like I rely on other people a lot for um we have a good community of people contributing who know a lot more than I do about certain things so um yeah I would say I would say follow me um I somebody's asking I do have Mastodon I don't really use it um and jump into our Discord the Discord is in the leptos repository uh read me we have a great Community people there so um let's get get your Discord up here hold on let's get your disc yeah so it's github.com oh I know it's Greg it's no it's leptos RS slash oh getting fancy yeah yeah no that's real now you're and I like your logo it looks really good I got a logo underscore funk all right so let's see is it under the the primary one yeah okay okay most excellent and then let's go Discord oh Discord doesn't even appear on the main page go down scroll down it's the button up under the logo okay hold on yeah yeah Discord oh my goodness why didn't that find it Discord I don't know but that's probably like an SVG or something oh yeah it does not find it you you may not be able to see that little red a little red thing all right so I can go right here follow that copy that invite oh look at that I'm accepting it look at that yep beautiful is this turning into an ad at what point does this become an ad I think I have to pay you I wish I do you ever watched Sushi dragon no oh my goodness he does this thing where he uh he presses a button and oh he if you've never seen a stream it's a wild trip but he presses a button and it goes booze you know like turn the background all white and it'll play like a really like just the perfect piano song and it'll say like actual customer underneath and you'll be like well thank you for letting me do you know and he'll go into a customer pitch right in the middle of it it's beautiful have you seen um uh Ken Wheeler's tweet about solid.js no you want to see a user testimonial oh man that's a testimonial for you well I like anything that Ken wheeler says because you know 80 of the time it's it's it's fair on the spice scale yeah yeah you're going to want to search for like I think it was like 900 lions or something okay hold on we'll go like this Ken 900 lines lions like the cat Okay lions all right here we go you can see the beat let's see the beast in action here this is actually apparently he's used this several times damn or search for him and like solid.js or something I can solid Js again wait isn't there like a from command from uh Ken wheeler really wheeler can I just search up oh my dude I effing I hate I hate what how come they don't show me a single person I follow some fella wasn't there like a 10x programmer who was going to fix this in three days where was not fixing oh my goodness thank you oh yeah thank you thank you Theo holy cow oh my goodness Twitter search user testimonial first time in a while I woke up and coded for fun and solitaires feels like a lot like where I wish react yeah I agree every time third tweet a third tweet I was 9 000 lions that were fed nothing but Monster Zero Ultra imagine somebody tweeting that about your library geez that I mean look at that he ratioed himself so I mean it's obviously a good tweet when you ratio yourself you've done something right here amazing I I do like it I feel like I always struggled a little bit with uh with with the hook system I feel like it's not quite there I feel like I'm always uh effectively I I said this to Thea I don't know how much Theo agreed with it but I always said it felt like I was doing uh object oriented programming like I have these properties but these properties can be attached anywhere and so it's like I'm creating these quasi classes and it always felt like I'm I never quite really got a good grip on it where I didn't feel like that was solid I felt like I got it right away so maybe it's unfair I've never been like a I've written a couple react apps I'm not I'm not a react programmer by any means but it is it's telling to me that like a big part of the like Tech Twitter conversation is people posting a screenshot of their own react code that's like a 10 line component and being like you will never believe when this console log logs and it's like I'm sorry you don't know when your code runs like what like is is this library that hard that you you have genuine prompts like my experience of react is people being like I don't know when this effect runs and then react 18 comes out they're like in strict mode and they're like nah wait now it runs twice and like maybe this is not fair but I feel like that that's been like the react narrative and why a lot of people are looking at the fine grain stuff because it's like I finally understand when my code runs and anyone out there who's a react person can be like Greg you're an idiot you just don't know how to use react that's true that's very true however my point is that all these react influencers seem not to know how to use react either and that's like I still don't think foreign I mean I know Theo loves them but I don't think the story makes as much sense as a reactive signal a reactive signal is a one-to-one with some sort of render and for me that is like a it's a very simple way to look at the world which is this point changes when this happens and just this point now it may produce new HTML May produce new signals it may produce a bunch of new stuff but nonetheless like this point is tied with this point and for me that's a very simple idea for my I have small monkey brain small monks every well every framework right is based on functions re-running themselves which is why we have all these like closures in in leptos or in solid like everything is a function that reruns itself because how else can it update something and the problem is that in react the function that reruns itself is your whole component but there's always a bunch of stuff inside the component you don't want to rerun when it updates so so in solid or leptos you're just like no just make those functions that we run smaller make it like the value of this text node and then that's all that we run so you don't have to worry about like like how do I do a set timeout right like it's just you do it it's a setup function you know it's that kind of thing I do I do like the idea that of Constructor functions versus render functions I feel like that's it was harder the first time I used it to build something because I was just like okay gosh how do I set this up this is really hard right the first time I did it it was hard but then after you know like that initial hump was harder but then afterwards for me the idea of a of a uh what's called a construct function makes way more sense because it's like this you put in where it changes and there's only one chance there's no like re going back over State and re having a different outcome when this thing you know happens it's like this is the place where it happened for me it just it dramatically simplified how I think about things in my brain Nana personal experience Theo I think you asked about vs code I did I used to use vs code I've switched using them more because honestly vs code um like I leptos is a pretty big like project that I I work in with all the different packages and stuff and it literally now lags on keystrokes so I actually had to switch to an editor that was not so damn slow and this is on an M1 you know MacBook right and it like it literally lags on keystrokes or on saving files and stuff so I I have actually mixed it up for smaller projects I think I think vs code is okay for for rust and for some stuff but um yeah it's I've I've switched away from it yeah have you have you played around with any of the like the predefined neovim distributions just to take all that stuff out like just give me Astro van yeah no I haven't I haven't done any of the any of the any of the distributions I actually used one of your videos and got set up with with a pretty good setup with um I'm pretty happy with things I need to learn a little bit more still the one thing I really miss is um being able to see um errors in other files like my Diagnostics only go within the same file and I like that little vs code sidebar it's like red bad yeah so there is a way around that there is a way around that there's this idea of make project and you can literally just like make project and you know what a quick fix list is yet if you don't that's okay all right so no code actions I mean no no quick fix list okay so here we go so I'm gonna go in here oh dang I only have one file let's uh here let's let's go to Vim Royale let's go somewhere else all right so if I go into the view right uh just pick a view go in here and I'll go into where is it is there a terminal if I'm not mistaken I have a few references okay so I have this thing I can use my LSP to generate a list of references to this thing now what this these two references are is what is referred to as a quick fix list so right now I can go up and I can select each one but the thing is is a quick fix list lasts forever so I can close this and now I can navigate back and forth between my Quick Fix list and so I can do a search via telescope right there right graph and I go like this terminal and it has all these references to all the different stuff so let's let's let's let's reduce it down to everything that has the word view in it right there we go so now I'm going to press Ctrl Q I sent that over to my Quick Fix list I close it off and now I can scroll through one at a time all my Quick Fix lists and you can see it right there or right here it says 54321 up to seven and you can just walk through it and so quick fix lists are super useful so what you can do is you can actually take TSC or rust cargo blah blah blah blah pipe the build through make project into a quick fix list and you'll get your entire projects errors that you can walk through one at a time and by the way how I'm walking is I just have a remap for cnext and C priests yeah yeah yeah yeah no that's awesome I mean that's the great that's the great thing but you know I mean I think it's I think it's nice I like the the rust analyzer support is really good so yeah it's been fun yeah it's it's real nice yeah so you can do those kind of things where it's it's all about setting stuff up by the way I did build this I'm very proud of this right now so can I just show you one more thing so for I I just got done doing this for my latest little YouTube video called uh something about me making fun of Json so just just let it happen but here we go this is kind of a little bit of a spoiler uh so anyways I turn into zen mode uh normally I wouldn't have tmux on so this is all gone everything is gone so it looks really really smooth right now right it's just an editor and so then I can go this whole Lua and I can say let's see how I can do if I'm not mistaken it is Ghost yes or not ghost it's sorry I just but I just built this last night I call it ghost line and then I can say set the text to that that's my text I'm going to set it to carrot that and then I do this now it's perfectly clear and I press leader TT and prints it up on the side as if it were executing it so it looks really really cool so for YouTube videos I can do you know I'll be able to do that and every time I run it then I have to redo it so I can say you know Greg is awesome and then I can also add another one another line and it will go through and give me most of it looks like I don't quite have it oh then leader TT again boom another line Shazam so I can walk each line I put in there and have this nice little experience I was going to also make it go all the way down in virtual text so you see this really nice little thing I don't know it was something I'm a little you know I'm working on you know make uh you know some nice things and I you know I it just types really nice and maybe you know maybe I don't want it to be uh let's say normal maybe I don't want it to be ghost text so I can do a uh hold on clear get that out of here I can set this and let's actually set it to yeah I can go like this highlight that do this and call and just say pluck and I'll grab my previous highlighted region which is that one and now I can type it out as if it was code okay everybody clap for the man it is two weeks still until Valentine's Day but he has already got his present for his wife let's go I love it just make a video you're typing out messages oh my goodness you don't even have to make the poem If you made the Vim plug-in that types it all out she's gonna be like and then maybe oh I just got to get chat GPS write me a poem and I could make the full circle I could be like babe press a quick couple buttons because obviously she wants to see the fingers move like I'm actually doing something Magic on the keyboard here and boom line after line of sweet poetry about my wife because I've seated a Chad gbt I'm just saying I do pre-marital counseling and man if somebody comes to me he's like I made a Vim plugin to type out poetry for my wife it's like yeah Let's Get Married see if there's four sessions get out of here yeah screw the free marital counseling you've already done this this is getting dangerously close to Arch user level romance it is it is getting really close we got to be careful here next thing you know I don't have kids anymore um all right this is fantastic I I don't do I have a work meeting I don't even know what's happening anymore oh isn't it nice how on topic we stayed right we actually did so I would say we did pretty good this was a good time Greg you're great to have on here you know it's uh it's great to have uh people that can do camera work you know uh I think that a lot of people in the tech world aren't great on the camera they don't have a good presence you have a very good presence about you you ask good questions and you answer very very well you know consider keep doing your YouTube love your updates love those things oh my gosh I know time time it's all about time right but yeah I know it's fun we'll get to we got to do in some more of those I'm actually going to do it I'm doing some code sandbox stuff for tutorials and I'm going to try to do a YouTube video for each one of them eventually to put in the docs like for a little YouTube tutorial so if I had a million hours every day it would all get done faster I know but you know I swear it's it's as if there was just not quite enough time I don't know what it is it's just like this is all right Greg what is your YouTube as well let's get your YouTube plugged out oh I don't even know what is my YouTube I don't even know what is it uh Greg Johnston right okay well how do I Derek LJ there I got you I got you yeah 512 subscribers dude look at that do you people that's a blessed number look at that people who just started YouTube and apparently only have two videos on like that is it that is their catalog would kill to have what you have you've already you're already doing a great job Greg Pro tip they should just make a uh web framework in like go or something uh and then they'll get some subscribers that's true just yeah just talk about typescript uh I may you may or may not have had your subscribers recently changed by at least one because somebody within this area may or may not have been subscribed but don't worry we uh we changed that okay well it's at 560 now so what the heck guys my cool 512 let's get it to 10 24 I guess yeah you really you ruined the power of two so we got to go from nine to ten all right that's the rule thank you very much take care thank you so much this is funny up have a good one all right bye-bye I don't hold on take me a moment to close it ah there we go we closed it we got out of there let me hop back over here oh no not there there we go Greg was still in there for a second you see that I didn't even realize I still had ping plant um 6 23 let's go hey nice job everybody uh he's super nice guy he obviously makes amazing software can I mean if you haven't played with leptos something that's so incredible about leptos is that he made a bunch of lightweight classes in which can be cloned yeah he's quality guy and so these really cloneable lightweight classes or I call them classes Strokes Strokes right and that allows it to be super simple to program so a lot of the problems about rust especially when it comes to this world is like passing objects in and out of closures being able to do this being able to do that uh hey yeah dude he was a great interview he's honestly the best I I really there's a there's some really easy people to talk to
