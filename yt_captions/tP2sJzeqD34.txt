[Music] it looks like I haven't been able to organize these keyboards into a nice rectangle which is really frustrating so I could review one less keyboard and then I could maybe make it work but then on the other hand like why you know today I'm going to take a look at six keyboards and review them specifically for using them with a Mac Apple's magic keyboard and the smaller version of the magic keyboard I have the keyron K2 this has been my main keyboard for several years actually I have the Logitech MX mechanical mini which is a mechanical keyboard I have the NY air 75 which is also a mechanical keyboard and I have the Logitech MX Keys now especially when you're a software developer having the right keyboard is really important you can just use the cheap keyboard that came with your computer or that's on your laptop but there are better options out there and I found it's worth it to spend a bit of money on a great keyboard but what makes a keyboard great I mean there's lots of factors involved like how does it feel what's the layout like how hard can you hit interns with it many things this is not a sponsored video by the way I bought all of these keyboards with my own money or my company's money I am biased though I'm looking at these keyboards from a software developers perspective and from a Mech user perspective and on top of that like anyone I have my personal preferences which may be different from yours and probably are so the aim of this review is not to be completely objective that's not possible I'm going to take a look at these keyboards share with you how I've decided which one of these I prefer and I do have preference and I'm also going to cover a couple of things that I think are important in a keyboard especially if you're a software developer if you like these types of discussions you might also want to join my free Discord server via the link below we've got lots of knowledgeable people there and and they also hang around there from time to time I'm going to start with the price these are priced all kind of differently I've put the prices as an overlay on top of this video basically they're all in the same price range except for the Apple Magic keyboards those are quite a bit more expensive especially the full sized one basically all the keyboards that I have here are within the range of $100 to $200 now that's still quite a big range like the key Chon K2 for example is $99 whereas the fullsize Apple magic keyboard that's the most expensive one cost $200 is the price worth it we're going to find out in a minute of course there are also much cheaper keyboards and there are more expensive keyboards these are just the ones that I have lying around the next thing that I want to talk about is keyboard feel and sound and this is important because as developer you use your keyboard a lot not just for typing in code but also for all sorts of keyboard shortcuts in your IDE and there are a bunch of different technologies that can be used for keyboard switches a few common ones that you're going to see are mechanical switches so that's for example the Keyon K2 that I have here or the newy air 75 mechanical switches use a physical mechanism to close an electrical circuit when a key is pressed they're known for their durability tactile feedback and distinct clicking sound mechanical switches come in various types including linear switches which offer a smooth keystroke tactile switches which provide a noticeable bump in the middle of the key press and clicky switches which offer both a tactile bump and an audible click sound it largely depends on your preference which of these types you want to use personally I prefer the tactile switches I feel there a good compromise between the sound not being too loud and still having a good feel when you're typing another type of switch you might encounter is a membrane switch and these use a pressure pad and have layers of membrane beneath the keys when the key is pressed it pushes through a conductive Trace beneath the membrane to complete the circuit membrane keyboards are generally quieter less expensive than mechanical keyboards but they often lack precise tactile feedback I don't have a membrane keyboard here and the third type you see often is scissor switches and these are often found on laptops and low profile keyboards like the app magic keyboard for example but also the Logitech MX Keys has scissor switches these use a scissor like mechanism beneath each key to stabilize the key cap and provide a shorter travel distance they offer a quieter typing experience and traditional mechanical switches and usually have a softer feel there are other Technologies as well such as Optical switches capacitive switches and more I don't want to turn this video into a complete analysis of all these Technologies but just focus on the keyboards that I have here now my personal preference in terms of feel is to use a mechanical keyboard I don't like the short travel distance of the Apple magic keyboard the MX Keys honestly feels a lot better than the magic keyboard but it's still not as good as a mechanical keyboard to me now now if you look at the mechanical keyboards that I have here the Logitech MX mechanical the newy a75 and the Kyron K2 there is a difference in travel distance and this does affect the field the Kyron K2 has a travel distance of 4 mm the newy a75 has travel distance of 2.75 mm and the Logitech mechanical has a travel distance of 3.2 mm and you do feel that difference the keyron is noticeably harder to typ on than the other to keyboards if you do like the key Chrome keyboards they also have a low profile option of this keyboard the K3 I've tried that keyboard I didn't like it that much in particular I found the keys too springy and also they sort of lay on top of the actual board like what you see here with the Logitech MX mechanical and that means you have these edges and sometimes if you're typing in a weird way which is apparently sometimes do then you touch these edges and that doesn't feel very comfortable and on the keyron K3 I notice specifically that these edges are quite sharp and that made the typing experience a bit less comfortable than on a keyboard like the newy air 75 where these keys are like almost embedded into the board in terms of sound I didn't really like how the Logitech MX mechanical sounds in particular the space bar has a very springy sound the keyron is okay but it sounds a bit noisy and clicky the clear winner to me here is the newy air 75 it sounds great very robust confident sound and the keys feel really stable there are two keyboards here with a larger fulls sizee layout it's the Logitech MX keys and apple magic keyboard full size I also have the smaller version of the Apple magic keyboard here these are typically called 75% keyboards there are the layouts as well even smaller layouts or something in between the full size and 75% these is just the keyboards that I have laying around what are the main things that you get with a larger layout like these two keyboards well you get typically a separate numerical section that you see here you get extra function keys like the ones that I have here on the top you also often get a couple of extra buttons like page up page down home which are not there if you look for example on the smaller Apple magic keyboard but some of those keys are still here on the newy a75 you have them on the right here and same on the other mechanical keyboards a disadvantage of these full-size keyboards is that you do give up desk space and if you work from home and you want to use your keyboard both at home and in the office a smaller keyboard is much easier to transport and in particular Logitech MX Keys is quite heavy now I find the writing on the keycaps to be easy to read on most of these keyboards the logc MX mechanical mini I find a bit harder to read and also on the black apple magic key keyboard I have here there's actually some damage on the a character so I find that a bit concerning now I want to cover a couple of things that I think are important in a keyboard layout for software development first is that arrow keys should be easy to reach I use them a lot for navigating in my IDE also in the terminal to move through commands I don't like The Arrow key lay on the smaller magic keyboard I use up and down a lot and those keys are really small on this keyboard the separate Arrow key section on the larger format keyboard it's much better I can also happily work with the lay on the non-apple keyboard like this newy for example that has the arrow keys here in the bottom right so in short arrow keys are important to me another thing that I find important is having a large enter button it's another button that I use a lot and having a large button is nice I notice it's easy to miss the enter button and hit the backlash above it on the newy and key Chrome keyboards the newy does have a colored Enter key which helps a bit if you're looking at your keyboard from time to time but when I'm typing I'm not not really looking at my keyboard so it doesn't matter all that much shift is another one of those keys that you hit quite often in particular the left shift button for me at least but that might also be because I'm left-handed I find the left shift too small on most keyboards even the large format keyboard like the Apple magic keyboard or the logc MX Keys both the newy and the keyron K2 have a nice large left shift button another thing that I find important is that the Escape key is easy to locate and press it doesn't necessarily have to be large because it's in the corner so it's easy to hit I do like if it's colored differently like on the newy and on the keyron keyboards next I write typically a lot of markdown text therefore the back tick button is important to me and I prefer the location on the top left just below the Escape key that way it's easy to read like on the newy keyboard it's also the location on the key Chrome having next to the left shift button like on the Logitech MX mechanical mini makes it harder to hit and also results in a smaller left shift button which I don't like in order to place this key below the Escape key on the newy it sacrifices this plus minus paragraph key but I really don't mind at all because I never use that so that doesn't bother me overall I prefer that the keys that I use a lot are in a sensible place on the larger keyboard there are lots of keys that I actually never use like the numerical key section the extra function keys or an eject button on the Logitech what is this 2005 even insert and Dell which are on some of the keyboards like the newy I actually never use but I guess that also depends on what you do on your computer if you're an accountant for example you might really value a separate numerical keyboard whereas for me as developer it's not that important in terms of connectivity these are all Bluetooth keyboards that charge via cable Apple's keyboards still use lightning instead of USBC yay the other keyboards all use USBC also there is a bit of difference in the switches Logitech and Apple keyboard simply have an onoff switch new and keyron have an onoff cable and wireless switch which in my opinion is over complicating things and they also have a Mac and windows switch which is useful if you want to switch between machines that have different OS in terms of customization I don't really want to dive too much into that in this review personally I actually never customize my keyboards I'm just that boring guy that just uses things as they are I'm I guess just too lazy to look into it now Apple's keyboards have zero customization except for the built-in options into Mac OS Logitech keyboards have the options plus software this is quite nice and quite extensive and if you have a MX Master Mouse which by the way I highly recommend it's a great Mouse then that also use the option plus software so that's nice the nofi a75 supports via which is an open-source tool that allows you to customize lots of different types of keyboards the keyron K2 doesn't support it but it's also an entry level and kind of older keyron keyboard if you get a more recent keyron from the V series or the Q Series it will also support VM in terms of other options the newy and keyron keyboards have colored backlighting it's nice but it's not really something that I personally care about the newy keyboard also has replaceable key gaps which is a nice feature you can also get this with some of the key Chrome keyboards just not the one that I happen to have here all keyboards except for the magic keyboard allow you to connect to multiple devices and switch between them also hitting interns over the head doesn't work all that well with the magic keyboard it's just a bit too flimsy it doesn't really hurt the keyron K2 though that's a real skull cracker and by the way if you want to avoid getting hit over the head by your colleagues getting my design guide is a good first step it will teach you the seven steps that I take whenever I design a new piece of software and hopefully it will help you avoid some of the mistakes that I made as well as a severe headache just go to iron. cdesign guide to get access for free free the link is also in the description of this video final thoughts unless you really want the touch ID functionality or you want something that feels exactly like the keyboard on your MacBook laptop I don't think you should opt for any of these magic keyboards they're expensive and honestly they don't feel great for longer typing sessions if you want a keyboard that's non- mechanical I recommend the log Tech MX Keys the option app works great it's also going to look nice next to your mxm 3 Mouse if you have one of those also LOD DEC has a smaller version of this key keyboard so if you don't like the full size layout you can get the smaller version and this feels a lot nicer than the standard Apple magic keyboard in my opinion but since I like to type on a mechanical keyboard my favorite of this batch is the newfi air 75 the layout is not completely ideal for me I'd like to have a larger enter button and the insert and D button are not something that I use maybe one of these Keys could be replaced by an AI key that launches your AI chatbot of choice I'm wondering when we're going to see the first keyboards that have a but but like that in any case I've decided to switch from my trusty keyron K2 to the newy air 75 but I'd like to hear from you which keyboard do you use and what are the things that you look out for when you're looking for a keyboard do the things that I talked about today Mak sense to you or maybe not at all let me know in the comments after you've connected your keyboard to your Mac there are a few things you need to do to optimize it for software development if you want to learn how to do that watch this video next thanks for watching and see you in the next one
