so one of the biggest appeals for me of the idea of becoming a programmer was to have the ability to work remotely and to essentially work from wherever I want and that is especially true now that I'm essentially an independent software engineer working on my own startup rather than working for a company because it means that literally at any time I can simply take my laptop and go anywhere I want in the world and continue my work uninterrupted but there's a problem because the setup that I have at home with this massive monitor this hugely heavy keyboard and all of these bells and whistles and this and that I have with me at home aren't really that great for travel but given what I do and if you are someone who wants to work for a mall and who wants to keep programming while you travel you need to have a travel setup for that reason in this video I'm going to be sharing you what goes into my programmer everyday carry backpack that I take with me I work from coffee shops to work while I travel or just whenever I'm going back home to Finland or whatever really there's a lot to be said about having a setup that you actually enjoy working in and that's ergonomic that actually makes you want to start working but that is why there's certain items that I always carry with me as a programmer so this video will hopefully give you some inspiration as to items that you might want to add to your programmer every day carry so let's get started first of all we have obviously the backpack this is nothing special really and you don't need like an insane backpack this is from Jack wolfskin I believe I just bought it from Finland from somewhere the whole point of this carry is I don't want to take a lot of stuff with me just the essentials so all I really need is one compartment for most of my stuff a laptop compartment and we'll talk about later Which laptop I use and everything like that and I like the fact that this is cushion in the back side to make sure that my laptop is staying safe because of my laptop is pretty expensive and I don't want to bring as a programmer as long as you have these three compartments that is really good enough so we're gonna put that there and I'm gonna show you exactly how I would start filling this up if I was traveling in fact just next week I'm going to be going on a trip to Qatar so I'm just going to show you exactly how I would pack all the essentials so the keyboard that I normally use is this one from Ike Unix and I absolutely love this one it's super sturdy feels really great it's mechanical it has this super ah a sexy noise but it's quite heavy and when you're traveling you don't want to have your keyboard take like three kilos of the seven that you're allowed in a backpack or something so this one is great there's an affiliate link down below if you want to check it out you've probably seen in some of my videos but when I'm traveling I'm not taking this one instead I take this one which is the Apple magic keyboard oh God damn it I ended up getting this specifically for travel purposes because I heard about the portability and like definitely this is the one that I always take with me it's super lightweight like this is like literally so light it looks really nice on your desk and that's one thing that I really love is minimalist design and that's why you'll see a lot of Apple items if I type for an entire day it does start to hurt on my fingers but just for sure typing and specifically for typing quickly I really like this one so this would usually just go straight into this small compartment right there by the way let me know if you want to see reviews or the Apple keyboard or my main keyboard or if you want to see comparisons of these I don't know if these are the kinds of videos you would like to see but if you do do let me know down in the comments because I do have experience from a lot of different keyboards and I certainly have a lot of thoughts about them as well next we have this thing which is basically storage like my laptop when I bought it it comes with one terabyte of storage but I find that long term especially for a lot of my YouTube video projects that is not enough and it keeps filling up so I have bought more storage and in fact even this one is starting to fill up now but the way I've built this is pretty interesting you can buy these external ssds from Amazon but if you want to get one for literally half the cost you can buy this one that I'm gonna put on the screen that is meant for essentially desktop computers and then you can buy this accessory to then be able to connect this SSD into your laptop as well so this is like basically a d y DIY portable SSD which you can get for like literally half the price compared to why you would pay normally I got this idea from this video by Creative Tech they make like a bunch of cool videos about Apple stuff so if you are looking for more storage for your computer I highly recommend you check this out and yeah I'm gonna leave both the links to this in the description down below this one also goes straight into this small compartment right there next we have some charges mainly my laptop charger yeah a regular laptop charger not much to say about that goes straight to the front then we have Mouse stuff first of all my regular Mouse which is the MX Master MS2 I can't remember the name I'll put it on the screen I can't be bothered to check in it's very very ergonomic it fits so well into my hand I've switched keyboards multiple times but ever since I got this I have not changed my house one time and I don't plan to change I also take this mouse map which is pretty ugly to be honest it's like some weird gaming mod that I got from my brother or something I might just buy a new one actually because I don't think it really fits my aesthetic that well but for now that's what I have this would go in here and if I'm feeling super extra I might even take this Apple Trackpad with me I promise I'm not an apple Fanboy or anything it's quite overpriced for what you get and like it's not that useful at the end of the day but often when I'm editing videos and I want to like scrub through the time Line This is really helpful for me sometimes I take this sometimes I don't but when I do it goes straight into the front compartment next up we have something really interesting which is this muffed laptop sleeve slash laptop stand this one is a total game changer for whenever I travel it's the same with this origami designed laptop sleeve that also doubles as a laptop stand so I can have my laptop that fits in just like that I can carry in there and place it inside of my backpack and when I am working let's say I'm on a plane or I'm on a coffee shop or hotel room or whatever I can just take this out I can make this into a laptop stand and it has two different modes so he has this higher mode which I'm using right now or I can simply do that and use the lower mode it's really multifunctional and what I really love is the minimalist design and the other thing is like these feel very premium exterior of this is made of water resistant vegan leather whereas the interior is lined with this really soft microfiber material to give a really nice cushion to whatever is inside of it and when I travel I also double this with the morphed phone stand and I can have my phone in front of me like this which simply connects with a magnet you can also get the phones down with this really Sleek power bank which allows you to use the phone and have it charging at the same time and it also simply attaches with a magnetic like this so having these products is a massive game changer for my travel setup and yes they sponsored this video and I do get a kickback if you buy using one of my links below so this is exactly the kind of things that really fits in well with my travel setup so if you would like to add this to your setup the links are going to be down below it's right here which simply goes at the front compartment I will put the laptop inside just like this and fit it in to the back pocket of my backpack and so then talking about the laptop it is the super expensive M1 Max MacBook Pro I haven't upgraded the M2 versions because I just don't feel the need to these does everything I want mostly I need the power of this for my video editing stuff but also for programming it's just nice when there's no lag things never crash anything like that but yeah love this laptop I have the I think it's the ali abdall uh case on it I really love the look of same case that I have on my phone so yeah let's put that inside of the morphed laptops leave link below and let's put it inside of the travel backpack we have the iPad mainly I use my iPad for basically watching YouTube videos and things like this whenever I'm relaxing I just want to lay in my bed on the sofa I just take this I don't really use this for much else I use it for some note-taking and I use it for some sections of my course where I'm use the apple pencil which is another item that I have to like visualize some things about how computer memory works and programming which you can find in my course python developer masterclass link down below it is attach it there like that and I also have the moft iPad stand that I sometimes take with me and so this would go the back compartment and I actually just realized I think this can also go inside of here yeah because it has this additional compartment so this one actually goes inside of right there would you look at that and then we can finally close this and put this inside of the backpack that is most of my programming gear done now moving on to my video gear basically my main camera is the one that you're watching right now is the Sony A7 4. it's kinda heavy and the lens I have on is kind of heavy too so depending on how much I think I'm gonna film during my trip I might not take that I might just take this other camera that I have like be camera is the Sony z1f something like that basically I bought this to be essentially my Vlog camera or my second Channel where I'm gonna be filming some Vlogs and things like that especially here in Dubai they don't usually like having these massive cameras around public so yeah I'll usually take one of these cameras with me this one would go right there if I was to take my big one that one would go in the big compartment like that in terms of my mic I use this one it is the rode videomic ntg and I have this little standing with it that I kind of like the look of on my desk I've also bought a study a microphone which is somewhere over there and yeah these would simply go inside somewhere in here I'm not gonna do it because you need to hear me lastly if I do take the big camera I would also take this one with like a another travel like tripod thing my camera wouldn't go on top of this you've seen actually some videos on my channel have been filmed using this setup so I've had this this one would go the main compartment other than that some memory cards and things like this uh which I would simply put in the small compartment right there Then moving on into some smaller accessories of course we need a wallet this is a Chelsea wallet because back when I was at the general and I used to follow football uh Chelsea was my team still is kind of I don't really follow it anymore yeah it's just just the wallet not much to say about that it would usually just be in my pocket or I would put it in here and use this thing which is the Apple wallet thing which is like attached to the back of your phone usually when I'm out and about I will put my building key card in here or depending on what I'm doing I might use this to hold my apartment key and stuff as well as my Emirates ID which is basically this ID card that you need here in Dubai this fits two to three cars if I put three cars in here they tend to get a bit stuck I had this awkward situation in a bank where they were asking for my Emirates ID but I couldn't get it out of here because it was stuck because it doesn't really fit three things that well but anyway that is what I would do there next we have airport again more Apple stuff I know original right um but yeah not much to say about that last but not least we have the the Apple cloth okay maybe maybe I'm an apple Fanboy okay I admit it oh God damn it this is probably the most useless thing I've ever bought well it's useful I take it with me I use it it's great but for a cloth I don't remember how much it costs but it's like yeah it's an overpriced cloth it's just a cloth with an Apple logo yeah that's God damn it you need to clean your laptop and your phone don't let them get dirty with your filthy fingers so buy a cloth maybe don't buy the Apple cost anyway but that is pretty much what I need as an independent software engineer traveling working remotely all that kind of fun stuff I still need to keep reminding myself of how amazing it is that I've now built myself this lifestyle where I can do exactly what I ever wanted because I can just keep working keep getting everything done wherever I am in the world which is just it's just mind-boggling to me so if something like this resonates with you then all that stands between you and a lifestyle like this is having the right skills but unfortunately most people get stuck in the wrong roadmaps so if you want to learn the code with an actual roadmap that's literally proven the work you need to watch this video right here where I show you my Dev framework that I have developed that can literally take anyone even you from xero to learn the code and achieving this remote work lifestyle so I recommend you watch this video next so I hope to see you there
