i'm about to spend ten thousand dollars in the next four minutes buying the biggest most giant tech that you've ever seen a giant keyboard that's amazing this is the one i've just got to figure out how to import it okay so we're gonna need a huge mouse to go with that huge mouse oh my god oh okay it's not a mouse that was alarming anyway oh i think we might have our winner here but now i gotta get a giant mouse mat too i can feel myself falling into the hole ah we have a mouse pad here which is claiming to be world's largest extended large extra extra extra large that'll do the job i'm starting to picture a setup coming together um what's the biggest monitor we can get this could actually work a quad hd 49 inch curved samsung panel i think that's the one what else do you use in a setup headphones i need some giant headphones oh my god can you imagine if you could buy this and it was like a working pair of headphones that's perfect they've literally just taken airpods pro and super sized them it actually looks really good maybe that's just the photo though oh no that's even better so this is a company who has literally created an actual stereo pair of speakers that are based on the design of a normal pair of earphones that they also sell that's literally that is perfect for this video okay so let's buy that and then also the pair of earphones that they're based on i'm quite surprised with how this is coming together i feel like i need some giant tools to like fit with my new giant lifestyle biggest tool is that jeremy clarkson oh god this is so stupid but i also really want one it's not even a bad price 21 quid for a 44 inch pencil giant lighter what is that is that real i don't think we can buy it but that's probably for the best that's still pretty cool maybe it's one of those things that you have to kind of like see it in person to appreciate how big it is world's biggest light bulb yes please a giant microfiber cloth that actually makes a lot of sense given the scale of the gadgets we're buying no way did you know this that's so cool you can buy a 4.5 kilogram jumbo version of their normal chocolate bar toblerone is literally one of my top three chocolates of like all time human sized toothbrush i might actually need that by the time i'm done with the toblerone okay i feel i'm getting sidetracked tech what is the giantest tech you can buy that is one of the greatest ideas i have ever seen like just imagine an 85-inch nintendo switch i just i can't wait to get this stuff giant android tablet that is the one samsung galaxy vue 2 17.3 inch touchscreen android tablet that is a monstrosity jumbo smart watch can't forget the time 62 grand better be able to turn back time for that ah this is what i want yes that's a tank it's the biggest power bank you can get i've already got a pretty enormous 26 800 milliamp hour one here but let's see if we can top it oh okay 41 600 milliamp hours 72 000 120 000 milliamp hours okay i think we i think we have our answer here and then finally i want to get the biggest tv that money can buy sorry how much what 145 000 someone please take this laptop away from me okay i'm just gonna let you know right now this is about to be a wild video from the looks of it like even better than i thought it could be so let's go in size order from large to giant to colossal so this is our smartwatch i mean this packaging is pretty compact it doesn't look huge you only realize how big the thing is when you see it sitting on your wrist it feels kind of amazing just to have a full android device on your wrist at all times you could watch mr use the boss videos on loop tell me that's not the dream why is it got a camera oh it's on the side so does that mean you can take a selfie if you does make your wrist pretty sore though that is very cool though but i have a feeling things are about to get crazier because this is a lighter why this exists i couldn't tell you but there's one question that's probably on all of our minds does a bigger lighter mean a bigger flame it's definitely sparking there could literally be anything inside of here i'm putting a lot of trust in this all it's giving me is just a ton of smoke come on yeah that didn't work did we need to put fluid in that is that the is that the box of a tablet the size of a pc as far as i'm aware this is the largest consumer android tablet on the market so for perspective this is a full-size ipad air this is a galaxy view 2. imagine just chilling on your bed flicking through the internet on this screen and the second you don't want to hold it anymore you just pull out the stand and plop it down or alternatively break every bone in your face if you accidentally drop it this keyboard is a monster am i the only one who thinks this is amazing all right the time has come to build our super sized gaming setup so just for context this is the size of my normal computer mouse and you know most computer mice but this ain't no ordinary mouse holy look at it [Laughter] that's just ridiculous like no joke this needs two hands to use properly let's plug it in some part of me really likes this it's even got like a jumbo sized clicker hey milo you want a big mouse i'm not gonna lie to you this is actually really usable all i need now is a jumbo mouse mat would you look at that as far as i'm aware this is the largest mouse mat money can buy i think it's the size of my table who is this made for it's a super low friction material i feel like such a pro even though i probably look like such a tool oh yeah and then we have the keyboard this thing was an absolute pain in the butt to find i went to every single site i actually tried to become a wholesaler just so i could import a batch from china but then i managed to find one more unit literally one unit left in stock at micro center in the united states so i asked my friend kevin to pick one up for me and send it this way the point is this keyboard is super rare and also you have never seen anything like it i almost can't believe this is real but you want to know the best bit each of these giant keys has a custom made giant mechanical switch behind it for proper tactile feedback they're such meaty keys oh my god oh this is so nice it feels so good i got the compliments in the video this is genuinely the nicest keyboard i've ever used in my life you know that's really funny i've just realized so you might know that with keyboards you have multiple different key layouts depending on how much space you have for that board this one's actually been designed using the compact layout irony at its finest but of course we have a screen too this is our 49-inch samsung ultra wide monitor is that is that a g on energy efficiency samsung [Music] now if you're one of the the three people who've been subscribed since 2011 then you'll have seen that the very first pc i ever built had a triple monitor setup well this is what happens when you blend three monitors into one you're ready for the best peel of your life [Music] a little bit naughty that i can have like seven full windows open at once and because it's such a big screen the curve is actually useful because it wraps around you also giant screen wipe to keep the entire thing clean quite possibly one stroke i am quite enjoying living the large life but wait a second right now i'm powering all of this stuff off a tiny human-sized macbook we need a pc that can keep up oh that transition didn't work this is going to blow your mind underneath this curtain is a custom pc made by probably one of the most creative people on the planet this is the largest most ridiculous sweetest rig you've probably ever seen all right it's reveal time oh my god what you're looking at right now is extreme two terabytes of ram the highest end graphics card in the world and where's the on button oh yeah that's because it's not a pc the reason i'm in like absolute awe right now is that what you're looking at is a cake this is the largest edible gaming pc in the world maybe the only one too i've never been this nervous to cut something let's just do it okay five four three two one oh my god oh my god i never thought i'd need the gym for a cake all the way all the way nearly there oh my god this smells amazing i'm gonna have to cut it from two sides are you ready to see the inside biggest slice of cake in existence okay holy cow oh that's like 30 layers what does it taste like that is incredible i've had one-eighth of a slice and i'm already so full this cake could feed a city okay now we're moving to the giant stuff oh no you're not giant darling he thinks i call him fat if this is what i think it is then you might be looking at world's largest pencil not technically tech but how often do you get to see a 44-incher let's do it this is such a weapon all right let's see what it can oh oh that's a problem time to see what it can do oh my god i feel like i've got a rocket launcher on my back oh if you like giant videos like this then it's up to the channel would be monumental a little pencil flick to finish off that really hurt i am so excited about this one so this company elecon they make normal sized earphones i bought a pair here they're actually pretty well regarded in japan but then also super sized versions of those same earphones so let's open the normal ones this feels like a pretty traditional unboxing experience for standard higher-end earphones they do feel high quality very dense and uh reassuring but then when you supersize that i feel like my brain is playing tricks on me earphones should not be this big even the peel tabs are super sized no way this is perfect this is exactly what i was hoping for wow we did it i know we've already seen ridiculous but this might actually be the most ridiculous yet for anyone who ever tells you tech is not cool they've supersized the earphones but also the cable they've even supersized the volume control can you imagine wearing these all right time to see how these absolute units sound [Music] it's like out but if there was speakers which is obvious but it i can't describe it i'm just gonna say it now product of the year i do also have these other ones shout out to the hulk who was clearly the one handling this package this is still pretty cool but i feel like that last one just stole my heart [Music] everybody's got a favorite chocolate right well fun fact mine is toborone what you're about to see was actually the inspiration for this video so this is a normal 100 gram toblerone bar it is definitely a lot of chocolate but the honey the the nuttiness just the flavor i could take one of these down myself but then you get to the 200 gram bar and as much as i am an absolute animal when it comes to food let's be honest it would take at least two people to tango on this one but you can actually go bigger because this right here is the 360 gram bar and i love how everything is exactly the same just scaled up this one could feed an entire family but that's not what we're here for we don't want to feed a family we want to feed 20. what you're looking at right now is 4 500 grams of toblerone never in my wildest dreams did i think i'd be doing this that one block is probably as much chocolate as this entire bar let's dive in exactly the same quality this is that block with a full mouthful of chocolate taken out i almost forgot about the toothbrush i've still got no idea if this is a prank or a prop it's only just occurring to me how obscene the size of this thing is it's actually really well timed right after the october the good news is i don't think they were joking look at this i cannot believe it i do actually have some disclosing tablets so if i chew this thing it will coat my teeth in purple so in theory i'll be able to see how well this cleans okay i promise i clean my teeth i don't know what i'm doing here okay just give it an absolutely enormous glow what do they normally say pea sized amount [Music] carpet burn i feel like i've just been attacked my teeth cleaned okay we are getting to the very largest now so inside this box should be the largest light bulb on the internet i've gone through like a 25 minute unboxing already just to get the other pieces out nearly broke my camera trying to film it but the bulb itself is in here [Music] oh gosh it's like a vase let's put this on the stand where is the filament oh you put a small bulb inside the bigger bowl you know when people say they have like a light bulb moment this feels like the opposite of that do you want to see the biggest thing of them all though how about a 100 inch nintendo switch so i've had these joy-con controllers custom-made and then mounted them on the biggest screen i own i was actually thinking of turning them into working controllers that you could play with too but then i realized you wouldn't actually be able to play anything if they're stuck five meters away from you and what would actually be a massive lifesaver was if they were also cabinets so all that junk that's been sitting around is now gone i love this so much oh yeah and if you're wondering what the whole thing was running off well of course the world's largest power bank not because i needed to just because it's crazy that i can okay this video would definitely not have been possible without the good folks over at morning brew and it's not what it sounds like it's not an app or a website or a coffee it's an email newsletter so here's the idea you pop your email address onto their site and then once per morning monday to sunday they will send you a five minute summary on everything important in business finance and tech and i'm a strong believer in the ideology because it's being sent to you it's such an easy way to substitute checking instagram first thing in the morning to actually learning something that you can talk to people about so for example the other day it had a piece in it all about samsung so samsung's just announced that they're going to build a 17 billion dollar chip plant in texas united states and they're not the only ones the us is basically trying to make sure that they never have a chip shortage again and so they're also making sure at the same time that texas has heaps of tax incentives for tech companies to the point where these companies are pouring in from around the world super interesting to see anyways check the link below to sign up it's free it takes less than 15 seconds and it's an easy way to stay
