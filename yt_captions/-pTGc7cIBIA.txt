[Music] okay what's up mkbhd here so this is uh sort of a everyday carry what's in my bag what's on my daily driver tech type video i've done these in the past and a lot of you kept asking when am i going to do another one when am i going to do the 2022 update version because i hadn't done one in like a year honestly i think most of the stuff that i'm using is very similar to the last one but there are some small upgrades so i'm going to show you what those upgrades are that i personally use anyway and i'm going to show you what's on my devices so this is the backpack this is the peak design everyday carry 20 liter so there's a 30 liter also that's pretty massive and great for travel but this is just for everyday i definitely fit everything i need into this backpack i've tried other bags in the past different shapes different layouts this is the one i always come back to and as you can tell it's a little bit different from any of the ones you'll find on their website because it's black with this red stitching there's uh some red stitching on the inside here you can't get that from them there's also an mkbhd patch at the bottom it's the mkbhd edition of the bag that only i and some people here at the studio have but really it's designed uh to be a photography bag it has zippers along the side so you can turn it sideways and open it like that if you want to it's my matte black water bottle stay hydrated people got this as a gift from my family on christmas but the rest of the stuff in here is mostly just everyday carry stuff i'm going to start at the top and that's the back compartment love the way this bag is laid out but here is the laptop of choice which is the 16-inch m1 max macbook pro i reviewed the thing i've talked about it i love it clearly i went with the 16-inch because for the first time i am actually editing videos away from my desk like i've taken this home edited videos on a couch at a table just random other places which is crazy the 14 inch screen it's a great laptop it's just a little too small so this is the the laptop i've actually edited videos on so then the backpack up top here has a bunch of other small uh pockets got a microfiber in here and i just realized i also still have from last time the uh sd card reader but since this hat i don't don't need that uh but that's it for the top so then there's this buckle at the top that lets you get into the top section there's three sections so up top is the stuff i use the most magsafe charger for the laptop of course and these are the headphones that i've traveled a lot with so anytime i travel i typically need noise canceling and wireless that's the ideal go-to and so airpods max pair with the whole ecosystem of alpha products of course and they're in space gray so then i also have my car keys and other keys which have air tags on them and then two more things uh the body cap for the canon r5 which is a bit of a spoiler alert to what's in the bag and then uh there's a webcam this is called the opel c1 uh disclaimer i'm investor in this company and i've been checking this out for a little while now but i really believe in it and this is just a webcam that they've made for the amount of video calls that we're on lately i tend to get a lot of use out of that thing so that's in my backpack and that's it now i'm gonna go the bottom section this is what you do in a photographer bag ready just like that and you can get inside so as a photographer bag you've got photographer things i don't always carry this with me but when i do carry a camera on the go i typically will take canon's r5 i also traveled with this exact same bag when i went to shoot the mr beast video or for a couple other shoots where i know i'm doing a lot of videos i've taken the sony a1 but for everyday stuff where i like take a lot of photos canon r5 with the 15 to 35 is my go-to a lot of first-person shots with wide-angle stuff and then last but not least at the bottom here there's a bunch of uh like charging related stuff spread out the rest of this backpack so i've got two cables one is my usbc to lightning cable and then the other is actually this is super cool that i just found recently this is a usbc cable and there's a little display on the end of the cable and when you plug something in that starts drawing power this display lights up with the exact wattage that that thing is drawing so it's kind of a nice little indicator of how much power you're getting out of your wall brick which is pretty cool didn't think i would care that much about that sort of thing but i like it a lot and this is the wall brick for usbc but that's just this is just like the classic one that's built in that apple will give you i have over here in this pocket a slim one this is made by realme i don't even know if they sell it i'll try to link everything below that is on sale if you want to pick up any of this stuff but it's a it's a dart charger and i think it's about 50 watts and uh it's a slim charger so you can just plug it into the wall just like that usbc at the bottom and so anytime i'm traveling at a hotel or any place i just need to plug something in boom boom charged otherwise over here i've got my apple watch charger and this is the sad part that they haven't made a new version of magsafe duo that supports the apple watch series 7's faster charging so sadly i also carry the uh the faster metal puck charger if i actually need to charge faster this is all nerdy stuff it probably doesn't matter for most people but apple watch chargers then on the other side uh just some pens i typically don't write things with pens very often but if i need to sign something or write a check or whatever that's easy and then down here oh yes my adapter my lightning to headphone jack adapter that i still have that's it that's it for the bag it's empty and that's all i really typically ever carry again like i said camera is in there sometimes isn't there other times everything else is always in the bag but i've got pockets too let's do the pockets okay three pockets actually so as far as everyday carry is concerned i do have a back pocket and that's where i keep my wallet which is this little guy pretty simple it is a trove wallet so i'll link this below although this is again an mkbhd carbon blacked out edition which is pretty sick although the whole uh right side up thing i feel like this is right side up but all the text has this being right side up map like everything anyway but inside it i don't carry much i clearly don't carry a lot in my wallet i don't have cash but this is a dbrand skinned key card to get into the studio very useful to have and then this is just a little backup key to get into the car which actually uses the phone and a bluetooth signal as the key so in case my phone's dead or something like that or it's bugging out which that happens sometimes too so that's the wallet and then two daily driver smartphones i've told this story before but i pretty much always carry an android phone and an iphone one in each pocket it's always the android phone on the right side and the iphone on the left side and that's just because i'm always in both worlds both ecosystems i'm always testing both things now the iphone has the most continuity because it only changes once or twice a year when i'm testing the new iphones but i'm carrying an iphone 13 pro not the pro max actually i downsized so this is the one terabyte space gray version though i found that with the amount of prores video that i shoot on this thing it helps i shot the whole riving video on this phone so i'll go over the setup on the iphone in a second but i'm going to start with the android phone which at the moment is the pixel 6 pro it's been a couple months now this phone it's fine but it's definitely getting more buggy than when it started which is really odd and annoying so i don't know this has happened with pixels before but as i fire it up this is the the setup that uh you're probably so used to seeing i've had this wallpaper for a while i've had roughly this set up on the phones for a while but i'm gonna give some shout outs to some of my favorite things i'm doing on the phone so it's got the weather wedgie in the middle that's cool it seems to really want to go to 60 hertz all the time even though i have let's see i have 120 hertz turned on yep still on which is kind of annoying but the apps are phone messaging tesla flamingo i have the flamingo for twitter app still on my android phones because it's a twitter app that i really like that ran out of tokens and is only available to sign in for people who already have a token on their twitter account so most people don't use flamingo for twitter i use the regular twitter app for notifications but i use flamingo just because it's clean and looks great for scrolling around and just reading tweets then i have my favorite app i think of the entire year which is my to-do app it's called tick tick and i feel like these really good to do apps don't get enough credit i mean i i'm doing a lot of things i'm trying to keep track of a lot of different simultaneous and parallel projects and having a single place to put all that information is super helpful for me so i have it all divided and organized in here and i've tried pretty much every to-do list app that's out and i found tictic is the best at least it's my favorite i really like it the ui is great the features are great it also has a focus planner it has a pomodoro timer it's got a whole bunch of extra stuff you might find useful definitely check out tiktik and then above that i have a bunch of my most recently used or frequently used apps relay pro for reddit you can get any number of different reddit apps but i've just gotten really used to relay pro which is great instagram spotify youtube studio app and then four of my most used google apps which are youtube google drive the gmail stock app i think is good and google photos then over here i've got a calendar widget i'm going to try to link that one because it's really good ways for navigation it's not pretty but it's very functional yahoo fantasy and pocketcast is my pocket podcast app of choice then google keep for just remembering jotting down random notes and stuff like that and slack which we use here at the studio and then i just have like a miscellaneous fitness page over here tempo if you've heard of the tempo like home gym that's the app that lets you plan things with it and google fit but that's basically the most used stuff on my android phone i mean here's the entire app list nothing too dramatic i don't have actually that many apps and a lot of these like annoying apps like my fios or my att i wish i didn't have to have those apps but they tend to be like the most useful way to interact with these services so i have them but yeah that's that's the world of my android phone at the moment this phone will probably change in a week or two i don't stick with one android phone usually for more than about a month because i'm constantly actually using and putting my sim card into the next phone i'm testing but the phone that stays constant in the left pocket at least with only maybe one or two changes a year is the iphone and so this is my iphone setup a lot of overlap because i use a lot of the same services but in the iphone world there's a lot of stuff like uh the copilot app which is a finance tracking app that i love and use on the iphone um the iphone camera app of course i've got a tick tick widget up here and a tick tick shortcut at the bottom because i think it's great um but also things like instagram dark sky god i hate that they took dark sky away from android apple bought the dark sky app and now the best weather app in the world is iphone only sadly but it's really good so i keep that here and i use it a lot tweetbot for twitter the twitter app or the tesla app for opening and closing the car door things like that we have to use a third-party app for group fitness challenges at the studio so the challenges app does exactly that hopefully someday apple can build that in so anyone with an apple watch can join a group competition that'd be cool yeah weather widget nothing too crazy here and then this is uh that app library screen i do have among us on my phone i have this at what's this called again hemisphere probably my favorite game it's really good for just burning time on the plane where basically you start off as this orb and you go around and you basically just try to absorb every orb that's smaller than you pretty classic uh just become the biggest eject move over move over you get the idea it's really addicting though i've gotten a lot of hours sunken into this app um but yeah the chipotle good stuff uh the google home app no surprises there and that's what's on my two phones that i'm carrying with me on this exact date in january of 2022. so yeah that's pretty much it you guys asked for it so now you have it maybe leave any suggestions you guys have for good apps or good widgets or things that i'm missing out on i love tick tick i'm just gonna i'm gonna link as many of the things i talked about in this video as possible below so you can see them but if anything else is uh deserving to be on my radar let me know okay that's it thanks for watching see you guys in the next one peace you
