ladies and gentlemen whether you follow the world of Chess closely or not I'd be willing to bet that you can name several famous chess players you could start in the modern times Magnus Carlson hiar Nakamura maybe you go back a couple of decades Gary kaspari go back another couple of decades Bobby fiser I think it's pretty normal that even if you don't follow a sport closely you can name some of its most famous athletes but even if you do follow a sport pretty closely there are some hidden gems that you may or may not have ever heard of and that is the purpose of today's video I'm going to be covering the most famous International Master to ever live how is he the most famous well his name is rashidov and he was one of the most feared attacking players of the entire 20th century he never became a world champion never even got a Grandmaster title but his story is absolutely unbelievable and I cannot let the Legend die just because we live in the age of social media and you know we only follow the grand Masters and the greats of the past because rashed was an unbelievable player let me tell you a little bit about his story and then I will show you some of his unbelievable chess games Rashid ninov was born in 1912 in what is modern-day Kazakhstan in the region of Russia that was very very poor his parents died when he was very young and from the history that I've read it was literally due to being overworked which is horrible then there was the Russian Civil War and that obviously caused famine poverty beyond belief he was raised in unbelievably difficult times he had an older brother his older brother actually went on to become a worldclass poet which is just an incredible side detail of the story now rased only got into chess for the first time around the age of 15 he was quite good at it but he also had a massive affinity for Checkers how about that Checkers and chess Checkers was widely respected in the Soviet Union at those times then in 1933 already at the age of 21 he took Checkers more seriously than chess until 1936 Rasheed was 23 24 years old when he was defeated by some strong chess players category one chess players not Grand Masters not not even Masters and he got mad he wanted to learn chess and he wanted to beat those guys but then he got sick he spent the late 30s in a hospital reading chess endgame books that is how he got into chess really legitimately for the first time nearly 30 years of age and then there was World War II the first time that Rasheed had an opportunity to really seriously play chess was after World War II ended in 1946 1946 he was 34 years of age 34 years of age and he had a positive record against World Chess Champions mik tal Boris spasy and then players that never became world champions like David brunin or Le Pugi but his record against them was positive he was a fearsome brutal attacking player and I would like to share a couple of games with you so that the legend of n medov can live on I have two unbelievable Queen sacrifices I have a win versus mik tal one of the most revered and feared attacking players of that generation as well and the last one is a feel-good story beyond belief uh well I don't want to spoil anything let's begin this is a game played against Al chernikov and it is probably the most famous Queen sacrifice uh known uh in the Chess World nun of loved E4 he loved open games he loved queens and Bishops getting out and about C5 Knight F3 Knight C6 and in this game we have an open Sicilian it's a Sicilian Defense where we have an imbalance right away and white plays this move Pawn to D4 to open up the lines black tries to put the bishop on G7 that's called a fiano in case this video gets recommended to people in the YouTube algorithm that have never played chess before welcome to the Chess World that is a little house that you are building for the bishop and this particular Street in the city of the Sicilian Defense is called the Dragon Knight C3 Bishop G 7 and white chooses whether he will Castle the long way or the short way Bishop C4 Bishop B3 and shenuka plays this move Knight to G4 deflecting the White Queen away from the defense of the knight in the center of the board you're trying to get this bishop Knights are generally considered slightly better than Bishops but shikov already made a fatal mistake when he played this move you might say Gotham what are you talking about it's just a trade of pieces the problem is you removed your knight which is used to protect your king and you allowed n to float his Queen near your kingside this is like the start of an avalanche this is not something that you want to be close to when it begins falling now Nish medov did not need to Castle Queen side to start an attack on the king traditional wisdom tells you you play this move but actually then black would be able to strip away the defense of the white king and it would be very very unpleasant so instead of that he goes short side and you would think when the kings are castled on the same side it's very difficult to start an attack against the other player it's very difficult how are you going to do that Bishop F6 yeah Bishop F6 I mean that's kind of the point right there now you could get in close then I'm going to slide back that's probably what shikov had in mind he also probably had in mind the fact that well I mean if Queen H3 you you get sniped by the bishop over there black opens up the position and after Bishop to F6 you know if you play Queen G3 there's this Nifty move Queen takes Knight with the idea to go night fork and get the queen so he thought Bishop F6 I'm I'm in good shape but what he failed to realize was that Rashid n medov was a Madman do you know what the G in rashid's name stands for stands for gangster rashed gangster ninov it actually stands for for giovi but it Gangster and in this position Rashid nbv sacrificed his Queen for the bishop that looks like a four-year-old played that move that looks like a 4-year-old went I get a bishop but then he takes my queen but we both got one piece so it's equal Queen takes F6 is unbelievable and the purpose of Queen takes F6 is to get the bishop in the Knight and to just attack the black king who somehow has a really damaged Pawn structure that cannot be properly defended and it's not just a matter of the structure it's the fact that after this black is in serious trouble cuz now you've got discovered checks on the king and the attack will go on and on and on so chenik of sacrifices his Knight like this he gives up the Knight to try to take back the position just says bro you just delayed the inevitable I'm going right back I'm going right back to where I started this man just straight up gave up a queen for a bishop he got a knight for it too but what what's the justification the justification is watch and see the Knight goes to D5 The Rook defends the bishop attacks the pawn and now he just centralizes all of his pieces he just centralizes his pieces n Med plays in a way where stockfish begins to appreciate his moves over time stockfish doesn't get it it doesn't quite understand I mean of course it does if I have like the Google Cloud here but it it slowly but surely realizes wait a minute this attack is really really really strong like the only way to defend yourself might be to start giving up Rooks for these pieces in order to improve your Pawn structure in order to get the pawns together to get these Bish it trades and and remove some pieces from the board but shikov waited too long to do that he played Bishop B5 and and and he went back and then took and now he sacrificed The Rook as well he said I don't need that Rook I don't need that Rook because if you take that Rook you're forgetting about my four other pieces at which point I would play Knight to G4 discover check and then I would get a rook and then I would go here and all your pieces are are just standing around they're figurines they're not actually participating in the game Knight takes F6 shika played this move to go after the Rook that matters The Rook that is playing in the attack Knight takes H7 discovered attack you cannot take the Knight it's a trojan horse Rook H3 Rook h8 Rook F7 as well right Rook F7 I think Rook H3 there's Bishop H5 which is very important which is why you have to play Rook F7 Rook H3 Rook E5 and he just continues the attack he just absolutely he doesn't even take the Rook he doesn't even take the Rook look at these pieces look at look at the symphony that the the harmony the symphony that these pieces conduct KN back to G5 The Rook can't move the Rook can't move because it's made on the back rank Bishop takes F7 Rook takes F7 and now the attraction tactic Rook h8 oh my God this man used every single piece he had Bishop this a man that got into chest seriously in in his 30s Rook F7 Rook h8 you ATT track the king like a magnet into a devastating family fork and when the dust settles it is white who is completely winning this is just a winning end game you don't have to win this game by Checkmate in this position Chik have resigned because say he plays A6 white will go G3 kick out the rook and then slowly win these pawns there's just nothing black can do what a game Queen takes F6 that was the kind of guy that rased Nish medov was I got another queen sacrifice for you but first I'm going to show you this game against mik tal and by the way this game was played in 1961 mik tal in the middle of a world championship Reign he won in uh 1959 no he won in 1960 and then lost in 1961 it's either 59 and 60 or 60 and 61 two adjacent years T defeated binck in a in a crazy match that captivated the entire Soviet Union frankly the world as well I would imagine and then he lost the Revenge match and like I said already this is the stuff that rashed livs where he loves these Sicilians this one is a uh is a shinan it's a it's a night ORF Sicilian this is what tal live for as well these are pro this is a matchup of the two greatest Dynamic players of that generation I mean think about that this is like this is like uh you know your your your your favorite heavyweight boxers going at it and you just really don't know who's going to win Queen C7 n Med Wast absolutely zero time he doesn't develop his pieces he plays F4 and then he plays G4 launching all the pawns forward you know when tal saw this he must have salivated he must have he f t was the kind of guy that probably got if he was a boxer would get punched blood dripping down his face he would he would taste it he would laugh that's the kind of guy that he was F4 G4 we Castle the king here we don't even hide him we just go for an attack now we stop T's advances tall develops his pieces we develop tall lunges into the center of the board we Safeguard our Center with Queen E2 I love how this is just like a INF it's like a nervous system overload he's not playing it he's not playing it just yet he doesn't know if he wants to push his pieces back it's just making T think now tal can't resist anymore he plays E5 trying to strike into the center of the board but now Knight F5 zigging and zagging out to the F5 Square t plays G6 now n medov plays an in between move Pawn takes Pawn attacking the Knight on F6 and also opening the door to his Bishop which now the Knight plants itself on the H6 Square just standing on the outskirts of the black position yelling things pressuring the position T plays Knight E6 looking to seize control of the dark squares ninov plays a move that seems like it does nothing but this move opens up the Rook that's the idea that's why the move F takes E5 was so important that's why the move E5 for black was such a gamble it might have not been necessary T might have opened more doors for white than for himself by playing a move like that Bishop G7 and now the white attack has sort of been stopped what do you play in this position if you play G5 I actually sneak in this capture because the pawn here doesn't scare me the pawn here does not scare me I will move this Knight I'll move the Knight H5 put the Knight on F4 I'm going to be very happy we're going to get a crazy looking position of Knights versus Bishops Bishop G2 Bishop G7 tal must have thought well I'm all right and then I'm going to continue my attack maybe I'll even go long over there in the future but he forgot that he was playing Rashid NES medov because in this position Rashid NES medov sacrificed The Rook the on the exact same square as in the game against jukov Rook takes F6 the idea is actually very straightforward it just has to do with control over the D5 Square now you would think that move makes no sense because you're Rook is gone you have no attack anymore an entire potent powerful attacking piece is gone but what's more important is the Knight coming to D5 because black actually cannot take this Knight it invites way too many problems so instead of that black goes here now slides the queen over to the F2 Square fights for the dark squares and threatens stuff along the file tal now has to jump in his Knight and give it away now do you think n Medina will trade the Bishop for the Knight or the Knight for the Knight traditional wisdom tells you Knight for Knight is probably better it's better to preserve the bishop no no no no no it's better to take with the bishop for two reasons one you need to preserve the Knight to apply pressure two it's all about timing you get the Rook into the game as fast as possible e takes F4 and just before we do that we lunge into the center of the board with E5 we surrender the control of the Knight completely because if Bishop takes D5 has played in this position you open up the king Rook E1 is a devastating threat Bishop G2 is possible Queen E1 king would go to f8 I would then bounce the Ping the king back into the center like a ping pong ball and I would play Rook E7 and devastating impact would arrive as well as Rook D1 which obviously just wins the queen which is also good enough E5 opens up the position you're looking to bring in The Rook like this now tall plays Bishop takes T never want to shy away from a fight it actually according to the engine would have been better to play Bishop H4 there was no stockfish back in the day T tries to defend himself like this but he forgets who he's playing of sacrificing yet another piece on the F6 Square now Queen to D4 look at this the Knight standing on the outskirts is just preventing the king from sliding over and getting out of danger now the Bishops are still staring at each other the Rook is still pressuring n m was a god amongst men when he when it came to extracting the maximum effect of Devastation with his pieces he he just bulldozes the position Queen d8 and now the way we get the queen into the attack is very simple we sacrifice The Rook again two Rooks sacrificed in one game this is hardly a sacrifice this is more of a discovered attack tal accepted the capture Queen h8 the king is mercilessly hunted into the center of the board and pawn takes F5 and tal resigned because after King D6 n Medina would went here he would have taken his Queen he would have taken his Bishop he would have taken his soul you would think in a clash of two Titans like this one of them would be upset when he lost as if to say that he was not the alpha right although I think the alpha thing of wolves has been like disproven but whatever we all just say Alpha anyway but actually mik tal said that one of the best days of his life was when he lost Med it's it's quote I wasn't there to verify that quote that's what tal said it's all you have to know about him as a sportsman as an athlete as an individual now Lev paleski one of the best players of that generation as well versus Rashid n this time Rashid has the black pieces rashed always look for confrontation early although what's interesting about this is this might have been the best thing to do against Rashid Nish get him into a queenless middle game how is he going to Checkmate You Without a Queen I mean seriously okay we saw in the Chik of gave me literally sacrificed it but you know this was still a dynamic position this is a much more positional game no we get E4 and now we have an imbalanced game all right Rashid plays Bishop G7 castles and Rasheed immediately instigates confrontation with Knight to G4 and queen H4 as if to say if you Castle pre move here L I'm going to play Queen takes H2 but obviously that doesn't happen but rasid doesn't stop the confrontation F5 this is just about the worst type of game that you could play against Rashid nenov if you're trying to survive because he plants his Queen firmly outside of your position right he's got the bishop He's Got The Rook he's got the knights dancing in the center of the board and it's like somehow you know the players that figured out Y medov at the time were players like petan karoi players who were technicians they were really good Defenders they were stubborn Defenders and they didn't let him have his fun but some players couldn't couldn't resist I mean there was like tal couldn't resist and some players just they had no answer Bishop H6 seizing control of the diagonal right Pugi plays Queen D1 and already as early as the 14th move of the game we see Rasheed G is for Gangster yov have a very pleasant position and it's an avalanche the pawn comes down to the F4 Square the Knight comes here and this is just a samide attacking Master Class if you want to attack your opponent on the same side a couple of conditions have to be met number one your opponent's pieces cannot cause any harm to your king once you start advancing your pawns the way you think about that is you have to look at your opponent's pieces yeah White's pieces don't really impress anybody they're kind of stuck this Knight can come to D5 and open up the bishop but if the Knight comes to D5 black plays Rook F7 and everything is guarded number two when you attack like this the center has to be closed and right now n Med has the knights and the D6 Pawn completely sealing the center shut it's almost impossible possible to open up the center white could play C5 black could completely ignore it black could take it but even taking it weakens the center the best move is not to take it it's to continue the attack because by the time you get all of this you're going to lose by the time you open up the center black strips you of all your defenses and brutally checkmates you and embarrasses you so those are the conditions that have to be met Knight to D5 was played in the game and Y Medina played G4 and poki said all right you know what I'm tired of getting bullied I'm going to stand up to you andov said okay good luck F4 with the idea if Knight F3 check the king actually escapes this is incredible look at this defensive idea putting the King on E3 this is what pukki was banking on he was banking on the fact that his King was actually going to go on a spiritual journey and then he would play Rook H1 and then he would Counterattack what he failed to realize was he was playing one of the most resourceful attacking players that has ever lived and that resourceful attacking player just developed his Bishop calmly and said you can't take me because then I will absolutely brutalize you with Bishop takes and Bishop E3 Bishop B6 is a gangster move that's why his nickname is G because Knight C7 is a fork but Knight C7 would run into absurd complications following a sacrifice on the F4 square if the Knight takes there's Queen G3 if the Rook takes Rook takes if the pawn takes I take the bishop and Knight F3 as well if Knight takes I just shows you what happens so you can't do any of that instead we have the bishop going back to C2 and now Pugi tried to go on this king walk and my man my man Rashid NES medov removed the defender of the white position galloped with his Knight out to the edge of the board The Rook came to Counterattack the Queen the queen is 100% hanging 100% hanging but Rasheed saw something Le Pugi did not see in this position n Med played Rook takes F4 dear God completely leaving his Queen to die didn't sacrifice it for anything didn't take a knight like he did in the first game he just left the queen to die and the reason is if you take which by the way you have to take if this I just keep attacking your king here Knight takes F4 Queen G3 Knight C2 check by the way look at that so bad Rook H2 Rook F3 and now Bishop to G7 the king does not have a legal move look at stockfish realizing a little bit late how bad the situation is the threat is to just attack with the pawn but it's even more brutal than that it's to attack with the pawn and then take with the pawn it's not to take with a knight it's a pawn capture situation where despite being up eight points of material why does up a queen for a pawn it's over you can't defend your king this is unfathomable now the best move to defend yourself was like moving this Knight for example Knight C3 if C5 DC BC you got to sack your queen back you got to sack your queen back into a fork and then you got to try to survive this position where there's you know Knight D2 and Knight H2 and and apparently it's a it's a it's a it's a repetition but legends aren't aren't born that way Legends are born out of freaking their opponents out paralyzing their King and then walking their opponent's king to the other side of the board and forcing a Checkmate in eight moves King A6 there is a multitude of mates Knight C5 Knight B4 Rook B6 how did this King end up here while Pugi was up nine points of material there was only one man that could make his opponents look like this in the 1950s and 60s and his name was Rashid ninov I told you I would end the video with an incredible story and this is it so many things about this game are impressive this is 1954 this is the fifth round of the Bucharest chess tournament being held in Romania this is the only chess tournament that rashed ninov managed to play in his entire life outside of the Soviet Union think about that all those incredible players got to play all over the world can you imagine what this man could have been if he learned chess early earlier he had just a little bit more in life than he had a little bit more of the opportunities this is the only tournament he ever played outside of the Soviet Union in 1954 and he got second place behind vikor kchoi they granted him the international Master title because of this tournament that's it this is the fifth round his opponent is enrio poi and right before this round his child was born he sent a telegram to his wife at the time and he said I dedicate this game to our child and he won the brilliancy prize for this game folks just didn't learn they just didn't know they they kept playing the Sicilian against this man and this game he went all out we've seen him attack people on the same side but what happens when Rashid NES medov gets to Castle on the opposite side of you as you can see from the advancement of his pawns very Very Bad Things Rook C8 Pawn to G5 Knight E5 he slides out of the way and he's ready for his F Pawn as well this is just the worst possible situation you could find yourself in against Rashid n medov the attack is right there King B1 B4 he's waving the red flag in front of enrio poy the charging bull and he ignores the attack completely and it's already game over Queen and Rook Battery King stranded in the center of the board and Rico P struck with E5 trying to lock the position and now with all of this barreling down toward his King he defends himself with his Queen and rashed says take my knight take my knight take it there you go I have a hanging Knight I have a hanging Bishop you have a hanging King Pawn takes F7 you can't take if you take the queen gets in it's game over you got to slide out of the way I can take the Knight and promote to a queen with check but instead I'll go here I will threaten your Rook I will threaten this I will threaten promotion you can take everything you want go ahead my king is safe Pawn takes D4 my king is safe just out of the way of danger Rook H2 is literally mate that's mate right there it's threatened but Rashid n Medina was not going to be denied and he gets there first he gets there first like a James Bond movie winning the brilliancy prize for this game against enri the day that his child was born this is the only tournament he managed to play outside of the Soviet Union and he was granted a a international Master title for this game and for this uh for his performance not for this game but for his performance getting second place behind the legend Victor cooy Victor cooy might be the greatest player to ever become world champion I might make a video about that too if you want it you know let me know in the comments Rashid n medov is unequivocally the best International master that has ever lived the only reason he didn't get a Master title because nobody at the time was getting a Grandmaster title between between the 50s and 60s like 10 people in the world got a Grandmaster title I mean The Grandmaster title was virtually invented in the 50s and 60s should he get a retroactive one look what look at this look at what he's doing to people it's ridiculous his story and circumstances are unbelievable I hope you enjoyed this historical Deep dive do let me know if you have any uh others that you would like to see in the comments get out of here
