- Anything you can carry, I'll pay for, but if you drop one item, you get nothing. All right, pick a store, any store. - If you get Best Buy, I'm literally gonna walk out. - Gas station.
- Gas station. - Hey!
- No! - All right, so, we're here at Sheets, this is what he drew. Whatever you can carry in
this gas station I'll pay for. - Oh, dropped. I don't get it? - That means you don't get anything. - That was a drop. - I don't get anything?
- That was a drop. - Aw, man. - Why are we still here? Just to suffer? - You had to be aggressive. - I have to put all of them back? - Yeah, put it back. - Yeah, I'm pretty sad. I wanted to get Chris that
beef jerky, but I couldn't. - Hey, it's okay, man, you did great. - Thanks. - This is Chandler's brother, Zach. - What's good, everybody? - Chandler had to go to
a doctor's appointment, so Zach's gonna fill in for him. I'm not even gonna make
you draw from a hat since you're Chandler's
brother, where do you wanna go? - Best Buy, let's go to Best Buy. - All right, we're gonna go to Best Buy. Whatever you can carry I'll pay for. But if you drop one item, you get nothing. Oh yeah, by the way guys, Chandler's brother is freakishly tall. Also, if he has a name, you shouldn't refer to
him as Chandler's brother. - Zach! - What's the most
expensive laptop you have? - The most expensive laptop? - Yeah. - All right, let me clock back in. - I need content, he wants
free things, it's a win-win. But you gotta tell us
some stuff about Chandler. Did he ever poop his pants? - Let's just say like,
he might have missed. - Get stuff like that last. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. - $149 HDMI cable? - All right, bet. - It's unopened. - Oh, okay, he's looking out for him. - Do you want this thing? Well, you already touched
it, so now it's yours. You want one of these. - Get him the Yeticaster. - Only have the gold one. - Hey, you want a Google Home? - Nah, I don't want the
government in my house. - All right, see you. - If he drops something,
I'm gonna feel horrible. Like Garrett dropped beef
jerky and that felt bad. - Why are we still here? - This guy has like three grand. - How are your arms feeling? - Not good. - Not good? Nah. - Chris, can you do one of these videos? It'd be more fun if it
wasn't my money, for me. - Well, if I had fire
merch like this to sell. - True, they should go buy it. Do you want a $300 toothbrush? - Yeah, heck yeah. Wait, wait, here's a thing
up there, it's the security. - He's got it. - You want that right here? - Oh, that's where I was gonna put this. - Okay. - All right, we'll put this right here. - And here's your $300 toothbrush. All right, you done? Yeah. - All right, put it down right there. - Set it down, it's just
gotta touch the edge. - Dude, I just squatted to touch it. - Yeah, you got it, squat, squat. - There we go, it is done. - It is done, and none of it touched the- - Oh no no no! - I'm glad it's over. - We were just talking about- What's the price Tareq? - Seven grand. - This is your money. - Yeah, yeah. - Shop Mr. Beast, Zach. - shopmrbeast.com! - I'm not gonna act like
I'm not making a video out of this to get ad revenue. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but still. - Promise me you'll buy a hoodie. Actually, Chris, can I see that money? Buy a hoodie.
- I'll buy- - I don't want see you
not in Mr. Beast merch. - I'm getting the Joker red
one, that's my favorite one. - So how much is it? - 71 30, 31. - Does that cover it? - Probably, I guess we'll find out. - So how does it feel, man? You bought a bunch of stuff. What is it, 7,000 worth? - Yeah. - Comment, which do you like
better, Zach or Chandler? - Ooh. - Chandler, anything you
can carry, I'll pay for. - So anything I can carry? - I'll pay for. - Yay, how much do I cost? - All right, well now you can't or you lose. - No, this is just joke. Where is it? - Chandler, why didn't you
prepare for this challenge? - I didn't know I was coming. - All right, he picked it
up, he cannot put this down. If this touches the
ground, he gets nothing. You need the LED strips. - You also need a battery. - Get these, these are $30. Get a TV. They don't look that heavy. - Yeah, you're right, so let's- Uh nah. - This guy was in our
battle royale, buy his book. - Yeah, you're right, man. - There we go, perfect. Shout out to this Walmart. I've been kicked out of
Walmart so many times but this one's actually pretty chill. - Okay. - Okay, you already touched it. - Was this a mistake? Probably. Should I get some knives? - Yes. Oh, it touched you, you gotta buy it now. Chandler, you want some pins oil? - No, I don't write that much. - How much is in that basket? I think you've done goofed. You might have just
should have gone for a TV. Get out of the way! - Dude, sorry. - How are y'all doing, doing good? Just wanted to see what's going on. - We're just filming a video where anything he can carry I buy. - Okay, we can't have you guys filming unless you have permission
from our corporate office. - It's funny how we want
to do videos spending money and we get kicked out. It's like they literally
don't want our money. So Chandler, you spent 18 hundred. - Yeah, dude, ha. - Ethan, our other editor, drew Food Lion, and as we all know, food shopping
isn't super entertaining. So I'm gonna speed it up but put some rock music on it
because that's entertaining. - You obviously know what
the best cereal is, right? - Yeah.
- Say it together on three. One, two, three- - Captain Crunch. - Whoa! - All right Ethan, how much money was it? - Grand total was $106. - Weak, that's all you could spend was a hundred bucks, come on. - We're at a discount food store. - I don't care. Garrett, draw a store. - Yeah. - You drew Adam and Eve. Do you guys know what that is? - I think it's like a Bible shop, right? - Yeah, they probably sell
like Christian things. 'Cause Adam and Eve. - Yeah. - I can't wait to read about King James. - Whoa. - I like it. - Man, I thought it was
just gonna be Bibles, but it wasn't Bibles. - Chandler, stop, close your eyes. - Close your eyes, close your eyes. - Chandler's not allowed in here. - Hey Garrett, you
should probably get this. They have really fancy ping pong paddles. - All right, well now you have
to play a lot of ping pong. - At this point, I was really excited 'cause in college I was
a ping pong champion. - I love how Chandler's
just sitting outside. Look at him. He's just sitting outside,
looking in the window. So like I said, Garrett,
anything you can carry, I'll pay for it, you got it? Your little ping pong paddle. How about this? - Ooh, what is this? - I don't know. Hey Garrett, let's not walk over here and let's keep this blurred. There, get that. - Okay. I'm into those maids. - Oh yeah? I'm kind of into, what is that? Is that making Mickey Mouse, Miss Mouse? Yeah, I'm into mice. Chandler's calling me. - Guys, people are giving me weird looks out here. - Stay outside. - Okay. - Hey, you should get this. It's called the jackhammer multi sensation and it's 600 bucks. - All right. - All right, to the counter. You said you wanted expensive. It's the Jackhammer. That's it. We gotta go join Chandler,
this is two unholy for me. - How much was the total? - Uh, 1,069. - That's a lot of Bibles. - Note to self, Adam and
Eve doesn't have anything to do with Bibles. - Guys, I think it's
my turn to hit a store. Dick's Sporting Goods. Looks like I'm going to Dick's. - Didn't we already go there with Garrett? - Get it, 'cause Adam and Eve. - So we're here at Dick's. Why isn't it blurred? Let's do it. - What's your plan here at Dick's? - I wanna buy my hat,
that hat I always wear. I want like a thousand of them. Where's the gray one? Hey, there's only one left. - Jimmy it's hot, I need some shorts. - Chandler, if you want
anything, just throw it on me. You want some spandex? - Sure. - Get away from me. - Come here. - Chandler, I miss when we used to play baseball every day. - Here you go, let's go hit. - Uh. Can you find me some batting gloves, then let's go hit some baseball. - Do you need a helmet? - No. - Jimmy, how does it feel to participate in your own challenge? - Great, honestly, I
love getting free things. - Wait, aren't you paying for this? - Anyways. My arms are tired. I just realized, either way I'm paying for it, so who cares? - Your total is $1,326 and 52 cents. - Now that we bought some bats,
let's go hit some baseball. There we go. All right, that's all I wanted. Chris, draw a store from the hat. Whatever you draw is where you get to go. Anything you carry from said
store, I will pay for it. What is it? Chris drew Party City. All right, Chris, let's go to Party City. - Sweet, I can be 40 different
people for Halloween. - Honestly, Chris, I'm seeing a lot of items you could buy. Chris drew Party City
which was pretty boring, so I sped it up for you guys. What's going on back here? Oh god, Chandler, calm down. - Hey, I'm Dora! - Don't look, draw a store from the hat. What is it? - Walmart. - Jake drew Walmart, we
are going back there. Chandler was at Walmart
and only spent $1,800. Let's see if you can beat him. - What, that's it? - I can't carry much. - I'll beat him.
- All right. - I'll spend 19 50.
- Follow us. All right, Jake, we are here on Walmart. What are you guys doing? - Nothing. - Whatever you can carry, Ill pay for. Anything touches the
ground, you don't get it. No gift cards, go. Oh, well now you have to pay for it. - Jake, you need this dirty bra. - Dude, I'm not pointing at it? - Oh, now you have to, you touched it. - Are you serious, we're gonna
sabotage like this right now? - Yeah. - Where'd you get this awesome hoodie? - Shopmrbeast.com. - Chris, do you wanna know what paid for your Dora costume? - Yes, I'd love to know. - That amazing frosted
Beast hoodie you're wearing. - Oh, thank you. - Or, party Beast. - Well, look what Chandler got. Oh dude, this is game over. - And it got the double strap. - I don't know if you saw, but Garrett dropped
beef jerky and he lost. So he didn't get anything, 'cause he dropped one thing, one thing. - It's tragic, so tragic. - You're gonna need a plunger. - I already got a plunger, dude. First thing I buy is a plunger. - You take viking sized poops. - Good job, there you go. Yay. - Can I also get "Sekiro"? There you go, right there, oh yeah. - Rollercoaster? - No, I don't need it. - But why not? - I would like to check out. - So so far we're at two grand. I told you I was gonna beat Chandler. - So right here as you see it, there's an L, I'm gonna
have to hand that to you. - I'll just add it to my collection. - Well, at least you got stuff. I went to Party City, I have
a Dora the Explorer costume. - Yeah, that's true, here you, sorry. - Yeah, thank you, I'll take this L. - I have too many anyways. - All right, Jake spent $2,500. - The champion. - Chris, it is your turn, draw a store. - Fusion skate shop. - Did you just fart? All right, Fusion it is. - Oh my god, my car smells like a sewer. - I'm gonna get the squad sunglasses. And then apparently get this
blouse 'cause I touched it. - You didn't have to grab it. - It just was a complete
reaction and now I have this. Just gonna go ahead. - You're cute, man. - Thanks, man. Oh, look a doggo. If I touch it, can I buy it? - No. - I'm going to pick out
five pairs of sunglasses. All right, I'm gonna FaceTime my mom and get her to pick them out. Hey, what's up? I'm gonna turn the camera around and you tell me which one's dad wants. - The bottom ones, yeah. - Appreciate it. - What am I getting? - I don't know, what do you want? - I've always wanted a surfboard. - Get it Chris, he's
gonna get you a surfboard. - I'll get you a surfboard. - Love you, bud. - Love you too, bye. So I FaceTime my parents, ask my dad what he wants, sunglasses, easy. My mom wants a surfboard. That's heavy, all right. - If you have any issues,
blame it on your mom. Can we just stop filming
and play with dogs? - Grab that baker board. All right, now the very bottom lock board. All right, now put the shorts on top. Check out, check out,
check out, check out. - One more item. - This is really complicated. No, just put it on the surfboard, we can pile things on the surfboard. Stop adding things, it's so heavy And it's official. - Since it's a skate
shop, it only makes sense for him to go down the ramp with all the stuff he just bought. If he drops it, he can't keep it. All right Chris, don't drop anything. - I landed on my nuts. Something hit me. - Guys, the sunglasses
are okay, we're good. Since you've sacrificed your
nuts, you can keep everything. Let that be a lesson,
if you drop something and sacrificed your balls,
I'll let you keep it. Hannah is one of our trio of editors. Please draw a store. Don't look, don't look. - No! - Wait, what does it say, let's see. - It says Dollar Tree. - Dollar Tree it is. All right, we'll see you there. - Okay, Hannah, what's your game plan? - Now my game plan is probably find the most expensive thing I possibly can. which will probably be a dollar. - Whatever you can carry, have at it. - We'll do it one time. - All right, but guys,
you have to have two. - Oof. - Get something for Ethan. - Oh my gosh, what would Ethan want? - Dog food. Dog food. - Okay, so we're having an Easter party and we're gonna get lots of chickens. - Don't let her drop it. - I love how you're making Easter baskets and we don't even know when Easter is. - What if it's today? - Happy Easter, happy fool day, happy- - Look, it looks like Ethan. Which one reminds you the most of Ethan? - That's Ethan. Chris, how do you feel about Ethan? He's not editing this video
so we can say what we want. - Ethan, he's a butt face. "Frozen" tattoos. Okay. - Put it back. - Okay, I'm sorry. - This is gonna be the game. The main attraction of the party. For six years and older. Chandler, you can't play. - It's gonna take you six years to put that together? - Let's get out of this dollar store. Let's go to ours, ours was way better. All right Hannah, congratulations. - Thanks. - You having trouble there? - No, I think it's going fine. - This is fine. - Many of you may not know this, but we're actually still
giving away golden tickets and here's two of the most recent winners. - Hey. - Is Patrick here? - He's working. - All right, so Patrick wasn't home so we're at his job
and we're with his mom. - Yes. - And we're gonna surprise
him with the golden ticket. What's going on, man? - Oh, what, I did not expect that. - Are you Patrick? - Yeah. - What's up man? - 'Sup? - What's up, I need to
buy that off of you. - Yeah? - Yeah, will you take 500 for it? - I don't know. - Well, I hope you would
cause that's all I got. Here you go man. - Thank you. - It's nice to meet you. - You too. - Nice meeting you ma'am. Now that we bought the

to buy that off of you. How much do you want for it? - 20 bucks. - 20 bucks? - Yeah, is that cool with you? - I mean, it'd be cool, but I'd rather frame it, to be honest. - He wants to frame it, Chandler. What are we gonna do? - He wants to frame it, no. - What are we gonna do? - What about 900? - 900 bucks? - Yeah. - I'd take 900 bucks, honestly. - All right, pretty sweet, it's a deal.
