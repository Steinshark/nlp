let me tell you why I quit my job at Microsoft and walked away from 250 000 right at the beginning of a recession a month ago I was pretty down I just broken up with my girlfriend I was stuck in a job I was pretty burned out from all of my friends had just packed up and left to another city this all changed in three weeks this story is kind of crazy and stick around to the end because it probably doesn't play out the way you think I grew up here and here one major thing these places have in common is that they are not America but I do work in the United States now on a Visa wait not that kind of Visa this kind of Visa I started working at Microsoft in 2019. around the time this one Baddie boy from Wuhan tried to take on the entire world and In fairness he did a pretty good job or she I've always wanted to build a startup but since I'm on a Visa I can't do any work outside of Microsoft or I could get deported don't tell anyone about this YouTube channel luckily the Boy Bill Gates is actually pretty dope he started the process of getting me a green card when I started on my first day at Microsoft if you don't know a green card is just permanent residency in the United States okay so thank you guys for 100 000 subscribers the most upvoted comment on this video will be sent a pair of airpods pro all right back to the video my goal is to get a green card chill for a few years and then maybe build a startup or something the goal was pretty loose kind of like your mom okay okay okay let's pause here first you need to know about this company called y combinator if you don't already Y combinator is a startup accelerator that takes companies many just an idea and it gives them access to the best entrepreneurs to help them build it and then also gives them half a million dollars they also pair you up with some of the best entrepreneurs in the world that have built billion dollar companies and they give you access to them you can just text them literally anytime YC that's what the cool kids call it is responsible for building some of the biggest companies in the world including Airbnb coinbase Dropbox instacart door Dash tons of unicorns all you need to do is fill out an application and then you do one or two 10 minute long interviews it sounds unreal right like it sounds too good to be true but it is it's true this is actually how it works so I finally got my green card in the mail they a green card means I can do whatever I want I'm not tied to one company but why would anyone leave my total compensation for Microsoft was expected to be about 250 Grand in 2023. the job was really chill the work-life balance is incredible there I liked all my team members if you'd asked me five years ago this would have been my dream job every day since I started I feel like I've been slowing down more and more I feel like I'm getting stuck in the mud and I really just want to take risks and move quickly and that's not the place for a big company or is it consider when a company is small it needs to take big risks to survive but once it's big a big risk could sink the company in the past the idea of being scared to take big risks has sunk entire Industries cough cough print media oh I was supposed to actually do the cuff but maybe tech companies are different consider Twitter I haven't used Twitter in years but Elon Musk bought it by accident as you do he fired like 75 percent of the staff you're fired get out of here and he's basically revamping the entire thing now I don't know how this is going to play out but I can tell you that I've used Twitter more in the last month than I have in the last five years combined in this case though I think Microsoft is pretty happy where they are they mostly cater to Enterprises and Enterprises don't like big changes Microsoft has diverse income streams so they're probably okay as I thought about leaving though one thought wouldn't leave my mind nothing I've ever built as a side project has ever been used by anybody nobody's ever paid me for anything the most successful thing I've ever done outside of work is this YouTube channel and this isn't the startup I was essentially walking away from 250 000 to make zero but I think the reason that none of those things ever worked is because of this safety net the Microsoft salary comes in every two weeks keeps me comfortable but also complacent so right after my green card came in I walked upstairs I called my boss and I put in my two week notice yeah thanks so much I really appreciate like all the work at Microsoft and the team I think it's a great team I think you're a great manager and I really love working here but yeah like you know this is just the opportunity for me so it's super sad but I don't know I'm happy for you my theory is I have to jump in the deep end and then I'll sink or I'll swim the only thing I had going for me is I can kind of code and I have a 4.91 rating on Uber so that's pretty sweet now let's get back to Y combinator now everyone says that to get into y combinator the most prestigious accelerator in the world you need to have a product that's growing 10 every week that means if you have a hundred thousand users then within seven days you have to get another ten thousand well I have zero I don't even have a product so that is kind of a lie y combinator actually funds companies with just an idea now five hundred thousand dollars for an idea it has to be a pretty good idea right again no when it comes to funding a company this early the investors really only care about the team a good team with a bad idea will find a good idea a bad team with a good idea will fail to execute and a bad team with a bad idea will somehow make millions my co-founder parth is a best-selling Tech author as well as an ex product manager at Facebook so together we thought we made a pretty good team now you're probably wondering what we're building which leads me to today's sponsor code here now listen up because if you want to build a new project for your resume I highly recommend using these guys we're building an easy way for creators to make gamified video courses on mobile think Duolingo meets Tick Tock but for any course creator we want to make it dead simple for any course creator to make a living making their own video course and even house it on their own app and website so where does cohere come into play We're utilizing the power of AI to help them make this content and then help them categorize process and respond to all of the messages they get essentially helping them be a one-to-one coach with every single student now I keep talking about how AI is the future on this channel and cohere makes it super simple to integrate some of the world's most powerful language models that can tackle any text-based task with just a simple API call now Cole here has offered us a super generous free tier meaning you don't have to pay at all until you bring your app to production when I say we I mean you and I we both get this deal I'll add a link in the description if you're looking to build a new side project I highly recommend you using these guys I wouldn't recommend them if I wasn't using them myself when we wrote the Y combinator application we had written zero lines of code the great thing about the Y combinator application is it forces you to understand your own business we actually slightly pivoted when we were just filling out the application so we hadn't heard anything all our friends were kind of like maybe you didn't get in two weeks later all of a sudden YC reached out they said they wanted to interview US I woke up this morning to an email from my combinator saying they want to interview us and I'm just like completely buzzing I ran down to the gym and I worked out just to try to get out all of my excitement and I'm still like almost shaking I took the day off from Microsoft and we studied studied studied I've gotten it three times now dude and this would be hilarious you can only get it if I'm not filming it it'd be hilarious to show to employees oh it's not coming off now when you interview at Microsoft they do four one hour long interviews when you interview a y combinator they do one or two 10 minute long interviews it's literally only 10 minutes how can some would decide to give you half a million dollars in 10 minutes well it's a rapid fire interview they ask questions and your responses have to be concise meaningful and only one or two sentences long or else they cut you off and get on to the next question it's pretty brutal at least that's what everybody said we interviewed with Gustav the guy that helped rapidly grow Airbnb and honestly it was just a pretty nice conversation it wasn't Cutthroat at all and you never cut us off we felt like we killed it interview went really well until about 30 minutes later when we received an email that said they wanted to re-interview us with new interviewers in 20 minutes now I was at the grocery store I wasn't checking my phone and neither was my co-founder we missed the second interview this this isn't a joke like literally we just missed the second interview I emailed them apologizing and asked if we could reschedule and then later that night they said okay we'll reschedule for another 12 hours from now phew not dead yet so rinse and repeat I took the day off and study study study this time we got Jared Friedman CTO and co-founder of a company called ripped a YC company that's basically the Netflix for books and any kind of PDF you probably have accidentally landed on this website while trying to find a previous exam to study from this time we click the link joined 10 minutes early and we're waiting 10 minutes past nobody joins another 10 minutes pass nobody joins so we check our email and we have them from Jared saying are you joining  we were on the wrong Zoom meeting we joined the one we missed from the day before we raced over to the other interview and we tried our best but we were just thrown off they seemed really skeptical of our idea and the interview just went terribly you're supposed to hear back by around 6 p.m that night it was Friday night we went to dinner expecting to get a terrible email any minute four hours passed nothing comes in six hours passed nothing comes in Saturday comes and goes nothing comes in what is going on we've never heard of somebody not getting an accepted or rejected email by the end of the day now it's been two days Jared emailed us Sunday night and said he wanted to re-interview us on Monday again three interviews has never happened in the history of YC okay I don't know that for sure but I assume it's true Prince repeat skip study blah this time we joined the right Zoom call we're on our best behavior Jared joins and says all right guys I will catch the chase I have babies for YouTube We would like to invite you guys to join the winter 23 Bachelor that's awesome oh great yeah thank you that's that's a really cool event wow wooden experience we got hit to YC it was such a roller coaster within those three weeks I got my green card I got into the best startup accelerator in the world and at the same time this channel hit a hundred thousand subscribers by the way I can't thank you guys enough for that we went from 3 000 to 123 000 subscribers in like four months so we packed up we drove 800 miles through Mountain snow and rain in a 20-foot U-Haul which honestly almost killed me multiple times and now I live in San Francisco foreign so quickly that I was doing so much research just to stay on top of it I decided to make a newsletter with daily updates of all the most important information it's completely free it'll probably be paid in in a few months but for right now it's 100 free as long as you go to the description find the link and sign up straight away it'll be free for lights
