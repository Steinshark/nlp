hello everyone and welcome in this video we're addressing a common misconception within the car community that says that threshold braking is better than ABS braking and this is nonsense so in this video we're going to explain why okay so before we get into threshold breaking versus ABS there's some background theory that we need to understand surrounding flip so we're looking here at a graph of slip on the bottom and then our y-axis is essentially our grip now slip as a percentage is essentially comparing your tire speed versus your vehicle's speed as a ratio so if you write it out as an equation split percentage equals the velocity of your car minus the velocity of your tire divided by the velocity of your corpse so simple example if you have a car traveling at 60 miles per hour and that rear wheel is spinning such that the outside of that tire is traveling at 60 miles per hour well then you have 60 minus 60 which gives you zero which means you have zero percent slip there is no relative motion uh there because the core 4 speed and the tire speed are matched you have no tire slip you're neither accelerating nor decelerating You're simply coasting along well what about the opposite say your wheel is completely locked up so your car velocity is 60 minus zero divided by 60 that gives you 100 so then you're at 100 slip if your tire is locked up so that's what slip percentage is on a scale from zero to a hundred percent now there's an important distinction here because there is a certain point during this percentage of slip where you have the ideal frictional coefficient meaning at that point you are able to slow your car down the quickest and so that's what we're looking at here we're basically looking at our frictional coefficient and as we start to slip that tire and get onto that brake pedal and slow the car down eventually we reach a point at which we have maximized grip based on the slip on the tire and the ground now if we keep applying more brake pressure we're going to start to lose grip and fall into this unstable region where then the tire wants to lock up and so as that wheel starts to lock up we lose grip as you can see here and so we're stopping distance increases so let's do an example using this Tire's slip versus grip profile here so if we were to keep this breaking within the sweet spot right there at you know about 20 slip in the case of this tire where we have our ideal amount of grip if we were to slow down from 60 miles per hour to zero and we were able to perfectly keep it within that range then we would stop in about 120 feet now if we slam the brakes we don't have ABS and it just locks up the tire and it goes over to 0.8 as our coefficient of grip rather than 1.0 well now our braking distance is 150 feet so we've added 30 feet in braking distance just because we weren't able to keep it within that sweet spot now this leads us to threshold braking so threshold braking is when you perfectly maintain that maximum level of grip and you're stopping that maximum level of slip which results in the perfect braking distance in this case it would be 120 feet now this is virtually impossible to do we'll get into the reasons why but even the best drivers out there if you look at any form of Motorsport that doesn't have abs which is you know a lot of the popular ones they don't have ABS and you will see Wheels locking up all the time because even the world's best drivers cannot do this perfectly and so they lock up those wheels and you see a bunch of smoke as they slide along so in this scenario pretty much any driver out there is going to fall somewhere between these two values here because if you just slam it lock up that's where you end up and if you do it perfectly that's where you end up so what ABS does is it takes everybody out there and it brings them to near perfect numbers so what is the goal of ABS well the goal of ABS is to continue to allow you to have steering to to provide you with stability and to decrease your stopping distance so it does this you have sensors at every single wheel modern ABS systems you'll have four wheel sensors you'll have four separate channels and so you can modulate your brake pressure at each individual Tire based on the input from that wheel sensor and knowing what its speed is relative to your vehicle's speed so what ABS is doing is attempting to maintain your tire slip in that perfect little range so that you have the perfect stopping distance I think a common misconception people think about ABS is that it's this on off switch and you're bouncing from zero percent slip and it just releases the brake pedal to full lockup and it completely squeezes it and it bounces between those that's not what it's doing it's not bouncing from here to here and back it's bouncing in this tiny little range right here to maintain that perfect stopping distance so it's very precise in how it's doing it and it's doing it at every single individual tire so think about it at each tire you have changing surface can conditions right you have different levels of grip you have different tire temperatures that provides different levels of grip you have different tire pressures each tire will have different wear you will have different suspension positions at each wheel you'll have different loading at each wheel you'll have different alignments all right I think you get it the point is that each wheel there will be different levels of grip and abs can account for this while you cannot now it's worth mentioning that not all systems are the same right so if you go back to older cars you could have vehicles with fewer sensors fewer channels meaning you couldn't adjust at every individual tire but I looked at studies as far back as the early 2000s and even then ABS systems were outperforming humans okay so let's look at some simple examples here so we're looking at distance traveled versus how much grip do we have so we're saying that we're going to slam the brakes on this surface and that surface as you go along it its level of grip is something like this there's some slight variations in that grip so if you have abs and you slam on those brakes it's is immediately going to go find out it's going to go slightly past how much grip you have up the wheel is starting to lock up I'm exceeding this range right here I need to go back so it lets off and then it adjusts and it remains very close to this line if not just beneath it throughout its duration of trying to slow that card down and you get what is nearly a perfect stopping distance now if you're a human we have these other three traces so let's say one of three things is to happen first you apply too much brake pressure so you overshoot it well now you have to react and then you let off and then you come back down now you're not applying enough pressure then you apply a little bit more pressure you start to get it right oops you go over again it starts to slide and then you come back down you're not going to be as good as ABS but let's just say for example you were let's say you nailed it well you nail it you get it perfect then your surface level grip slightly changes and now you're no longer perfect so then you overshoot it so then you have to let off and react to it and keep trying to get it right again ABS is going to do this so much faster faster than you so you lose in that scenario so okay what if I never activate ABS well you go in here and you think you're a genius because the whole time you never went into abs and you're like look I nailed it I got the perfect stopping distance well you were leaving a ton on the table there so if you never dip into that you're not going to realize how much actual grip you have so it may feel like oh I stopped really well but really you left a lot of extra grip there on the table looking at this last one in pink here okay so why do I say it's virtually impossible for you as a driver to beat ABS using threshold braking well first of all you can't beat a four Channel system it's able to look at each individual tire and break them each individually you are not you get one brake pedal so you're just not going to beat that plain and simple next you don't know what the friction of the road is you don't know you're looking at it you can see it but you have no idea what the grip is you have to press the brake pedal and you have to make some assumption so if you lock up well you lose abs 1 if you don't lock up then that means you you were probably leaving something on the table because you didn't get into that unstable region so you're somewhere over here thinking okay I found the perfect spot but in reality you're leaving some breaking on the table so if you don't lock up you also lose it's just an impossible situation to pretty much win also it comes down to reaction time so modern ABS systems I've seen studies saying that they can activate you know 15 Cycles within a second if you think about the average human reaction time it's something like a quarter of a second if you think about the best human reaction time it's something like 120 milliseconds So within those 120 milliseconds that it took you to realize that you started to lock up that tire and now you have to react within those 120 milliseconds ABS has already gone through two cycles of adjusting pressure so it's insane to think that you're going to beat that when you can't react as quickly as ABS can and I've seen estimates saying you know much higher uh Cycles than 15. so a human simply cannot win and so then you'll see people say well okay if you are going to use ABS the right way to do it is get into the ABS and then just back off slightly and it's like well two points here first of all that means you're Reliant upon ABS a superior technology to inform you of when you have reached the tires limit of grip and second of all if you start backing off of that you don't know how much you've actually backed off right so you're going to start pulling yourself back down this curve and then again leaving grip on the table if you start to back off of abs abs is finding The Sweet Spot it's finding the perfect spot to slow down and then you're saying no I know better it's crazy now another thing I want to mention is brake bias so in racing cars for example you can adjust your brake bias front to rear so you have more braking go to the front or more brake and go to the rear any variation in between and so what this does is it allows you to maximize your braking using a system that doesn't have abs right so let's say you have a car that has a static weight distribution of 50 50. and when you slam on the brakes at the maximum amount of you know breaking that the car can allow your weight distribution shifts so that your loading is now split 70 30. 70 of the load is on the front tires 30 of your vehicle's load is on the rear tires so you would set up your braking bias so that you have 70 of the braking Force going through the front and thirty percent of the braking going to the rear great now allows you for that really close to perfect stop right but then what happens if the driving scenario of what you're driving on changes well you would have to adjust your brake bias because let's say for example this on dry pavement yes that 70 30 split works great but let's say you're braking on Ice where you don't have as much grip so when you slam on the brakes you don't have as much weight transfer go to the front so if you don't have that loading at 70 30 and say you're on ice and you hit the brakes and now your loading is 55.45 but your brake bias is 70 30. well it means you're breaking the front too much so you're going to lock up the fronts and you're not going to provide enough pressure to the rears meaning your rears could do more braking and your fronts are going to do worse because they're locked up so this is just another further complication that ABS can get rid of completely because it'll look at each individual Tire versus you as a driver you can't you can adjust this race cars adjust this to get as close as they can and they're constantly adjusting it throughout the race because things like fuel load is changing higher grip is changing as tires wear so they're adjusting that brake bias but you cannot win against ABS it does this without even thinking about it now does ABS have flaws yes it absolutely does so let's take a look at some different scenarios and we're looking at the same graph that we have over here but for just different conditions so here in red we have a dry Road same over here we've got a dry Road here in red our slip percentage versus our grip percentage now you'll notice that a dry Road and a wet Road and Ice all have this similar shape where you reach a peak and then as that tire starts to slide you lose grip however for gravel and for unpacked snow you can see the maximum amount of grip is actually achieved when that tire is fully locked up so what's going on there well for example on a gravel road if you lock up that tire then you start to accumulate gravel in front of the tire same with unpacked snow you start to accumulate a bunch of snow in front of that tire and all of that helps to slow down the vehicle cool so if you lock those tires you actually get your best braking distance and an ABS system will say hey I don't want to allow that I want to allow make sure that the wheels are always rotating so that we can maintain steering control and we optimize our stopping distance well in certain scenarios gravel unpacks snow you're actually going to increase your braking distance by using ABS now we have adjustments for this right so different cars out there will have modes like sand mode for example where it can adjust how much is it going to you know have abs intervene versus just when it knows you're driving on the road so you can have different modes to help adjust for this but it is worth pointing out that ABS isn't going to help you in a scenario like gravel if you're trying to maximize stopping distance now two points worth mentioning here if it's an older system you might be able to do better than ABS say it's an old truck from 1970. maybe you can do better but a modern system you're not going to beat the other thing is maybe there's a modern system out there that you can beat and what is going on in that scenario well in that scenario that modern system what it is doing is it is sacrificing your braking distance for something else probably in the name of steering or stability basically to not have something swing around on you it might leave a little bit of breaking on the table on the rear wheel so it doesn't slide out but realistically modern cars can adjust for this they can see yaw they can see any steering inputs and so they can adjust the brakes to make sure the car remains stable and has the perfect stopping distance so truly in a modern system you're not going to beat it and if there is some rare exception out there I would be betting that that is the reason for why but I don't think you're going to beat anything now if for some reason you're still unconvinced I found three separate studies performing testing each about a decade apart starting with the year 2000 quote compared with conventional braking systems abs results in shorter braking distances as much as 30 meters at 90 kilometers per hour from 2010 a study looking at ABS on motorcycles quote adding anti-lock control to a standard braking system increases deceleration rate and from 2018 a study found that on a motorcycle the race mode ABS configuration quote produced the highest average decelerations and shortest stopping distances compared to not using ABS okay now one final Point all of these studies they do a bunch of runs right and they look at the best examples of these many many runs and they say look if you look at the best of what a person can do versus the best of what ABS can do abs wins in the real world you don't have that luxury right you get one chance you press that brake pedal once in an emergency situation or maybe you're track driving around that corner you get one chance right and so are you going to rely on yourself or abs abs is going to win every single time it's so much more consistent and and it does it better so it's like it's crazy to argue between the two also if you look at racing why is ABS not allowed in Formula One on Indy car and NASCAR things like that it's because it's supposed to be a spectacle we're not comparing how well can a computer slow down a vehicle we're comparing how well can a person slow down that vehicle without that assistance if they were to put ABS into a Formula One car oh it's going to help out tremendously especially in scenarios like where you have rain and you have all these differing levels of grip on the track if you look at drivers as they're coming into the pit Lane that's a corner they're not performing a bunch of times right so they don't know exactly what that grip is so you'll often see them locking up as they come into the pit Lane that's losing time they don't want to be locking up right but in that scenario they don't know exactly what the grip is they're finding it sometimes they cross it because they're unfamiliar with that corner people will not be perfect at threshold braking it's just simple fact ABS will get as close as we can design cars currently today to do it if you have any questions or comments feel
