I I know normally I grab articles from the primagen react on Reddit uh but you guys kind of have missed a few articles that seem really really great and I like this uh oh someone in it trolled me for over a decade oh gosh I got to go look at that um but look at this right here no one linked bython okay bython is brace's python this is literally the greatest iteration of python ever created incredible okay you think that JavaScript is iterating at a pace in which is unmanageable but have you seen python bython look at that pseudo H pip 3 install bython or we can do this one if I want to install from the repository I do I have to pseudo install it fine f it uh F fine you know what maybe maybe we will pseudo in install this bad boy all right oh you can even man your python oh yeah hell yeah hell yeah let's let's try this out Let's do let's let's write ourselves a little quick so I never write python so this is going to be actually a little bit difficult for me but let's do this let's do this hell yeah hell yeah all right that took me entirely too many tries okay okay so let's try this um let's try this uh test I'm just going to call it test Pi probably not the right way to do this uh what's how do you do a main statement let's try this bad boy out how do you do a main statement if name equals main all right let's try this out I'm just gonna yank it there we go boys we got it python is awesome how do I do an array comprehension how do I do an array comprehension how do I like make a range for this one right isn't there like a way like how do I take a is there a way to take a number because I don't know anything about that um forget about it we're just going to we're just going to we're just going to go back to it oh yeah look at this indenting all wrong indenting all wrong 4X oh yeah look at this uh X4 I in y uh num do I have to hit him with the range do I have to hit him with one of those okay what do I do with that I'm so bad at uh did I do that right I don't even know I don't I honestly have no idea what I just did there that's probably that's probably not real but let's find out bython that's how good I am at this okay X is not defined oh my goodness oh my goodness that that totally worked okay people I mean this is totally working dude I am so bad my array is X for I in range yeah X for I in range this do I have to put like an i at the end of it okay you know what forget it I'm not this smart okay I'm not I'm not oh gosh it's trying to give look at this trying to give me those colons the man's trying to give me some colons okay I don't want your colons okay we're going to go like this okay I don't want no colons for x NX no I'm just I can't even hear you first try first off second off I would just like everybody to know that we just did python with braces that was python if I knew anything I do Python's like the the language that I do not know at all I actually kind of feel ashamed that I don't know python I kind of feel like I need to know Python and it would make it would make my life better like is this one of those things I need to do yeah the semicolon the semicolon may have snuck in there is is this one of those things that I need to go and like just Learn Python no yes no yes no okay okay okay for all the people saying no hear me out hear me out why no somebody tell me why no I already know C just not to the level of like the other stuff static types python is still slow yeah python sucks okay I understand python sucks okay you should know this by now I say the same thing about python python is the literal worst language and it is also literally the best language ever created at the exact same time so don't try this with me that's why I'm sitting here thinking maybe I need to learn about python awful tooling have you tried JavaScript okay I don't know which one's worse JavaScript or python it's worse than JS yeah but it at least has like EnV set up it has anaconda don't want none of your environment okay it has a couple things like kind of set up pip three is not all that bad anaka is good yeah people like anaka JavaScript is by far worse like anyone that's done JavaScript the moment you exceed any level of complexity it turns into just chaos in the build system I mean the fact that there are several Engineers that will work on the build system is crazy anacon sucks okay you guys all are so angry thank you Pineapple gang what what what is with you hey dish pit let's go dish pit oh my goodness uh because Whit space Reliant languages are hot garbage but of course that's just my opinion great opinion though great opinion uh my advice is to use Jupiter notebook if you want to Learn Python um yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's very nice I've done I've done that I've done so i' I've used Jupiter notebooks I've done I've done I've done enough python from time to time that I kind of know it that's about it like I couldn't tell like I can't program it but I read it I can you know like I can eventually get to something but this idea of adding braces actually makes python feel more approachable to me okay you know like I'm not going to lie to you I'm not going to lie to you guys I actually really like Lua the fact that there is a function in end I actually think is really really nice I my favorite feature of a language is required opening and required closing tokens I it makes it really easy for me to read uh as somebody who has reading issues anything that anytime I can look at something and I can see greens right here I can see these tokens I can see all the keywords it just makes it really easy to parse something without looking at it right and so I really love the fact that there's an end I love ends I love that if statements have an end right I love this I think this is a really good way to go about things I love beginning and end tokens for things but I'm a human right I'm a human and end and and and end and and end when you see end end end end end it's no different than seeing this I mean how many times have you put some stupid crap like that in JavaScript right or in some other language of course you are python is just filled with magic you'd hate it well I don't hate magic I never hate magic I just like to know how the magic works that's it as a professional python developer I would say python although I would prefer it uh to JS any time of the day yeah see that's why you know that's why I mean I already know two Dynamic languages right really really well Lua and JavaScript well actually I don't know Lua that well I know Lua kind of I I really can't fully metat table yet and do all the cool kind of magic key stuff yet I just haven't really tried to do it because I think it's probably a bad idea like generally magic keys are just always tend to be a bad idea I just don't know Python and I kind of feel bad I don't know enough about python anyways I was very excited about python because I just think it's a hilarious idea which is it's one of the reasons why I don't like python I don't like whitespace significant languages I don't like the idea that if somebody walked by your system and did a leading whites space removing joke on you you could ruin your program you know cuz I've done that right I don't know if you guys know this but there's there's there's these ways there's here let's see where is it dot files let me show you let me show you um what is it is it a knit. Lua where's my okay this right here so do you see this this command if you mess with somebody you could actually ruin their stuff right so what it says right here is all of the white space to the end remove what if I toss in one of these Okay match a bunch of leading Whit space I'm going to take this I'm going to shout it out and I'm going to save like look what I just did to my system imagine if you were in Python right now imagine what would happen if you were in Python right now it would ruin your life so a good April Fool's joke is to swap that little little line around in somebody's system very hilarious I think uh also actual evil a dang it uh shout it out there we go actual evil but it's hilarious just a prank bro dude it's so funny to do to somebody like you only do it to somebody you really know you know what I mean TS makes JS infinitely better type annotations don't make python any better that's not true I used I I did I did use a little bit of type annotations and it did make it better the name is Python's actually it's how python should have been okay what is weirder to ask somebody to install python on their computer or bun okay think about it a j
