is currently 7 AM and we're in the process of co-founding a new tech startup so here is what a rather hectic day in the life of a new tech company co-founder looks like [Music] for returning views this is not the same Tech startup that I've been working on before I decided to switch Focus because I got this opportunity to become a co-founder in this new tech company that we've been sort of secretly planning for like months now it's a new chapter in my software engineering career it's actually funny how this happened my co-founder is actually one of my old friends from Finland like from my high school days I'll be mostly part-time he's going to be full-time and we're looking for one more co-founder at the moment I think this was my old room that I lived in before I left London and I just came back here for a couple of weeks to clean up and stuff so I'm like working remotely from here and now I'm gonna head to a wework so I will catch you there [Music] while I'm on the taxi I like to start with some light work like making notes and planning my upcoming day this time I was thinking about how we might be able to implement analytics to our app using data science the problem I realized that we were going to run into however is that once we get a lot of users and a lot of data our data sets would become a massive which are difficult to work with with normal text editors and so once we get into that point one excellent tool that we will definitely consider is ultra edit but also today's sponsor ultraedit is a highly configurable text editing tool specifically designed for large files it allows you to natively open reformat and edit heavy files that your regular ID might just not be able to handle although it doesn't really replace an ID it's just an extra tool to allow you to do the things that you cannot do with a normal IDE Ultra edit has a wealth of features from Car Mode live preview XML manager Etc all in their native app and on top of all this already also comes with world-class support to support you as their User it's basically like the Swiss army knife of code editor so it's no wonder that he keeps winning awards every single year so if Ultra edit sounds like the right tool for you you can check it out from the link down below thank you for all Friday for sponsoring this video but I think now my taxi ride is over so let's get back into my day foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] okay so the way we're working right now with my co-founder he's currently in Finland whereas I'm here in London for like a cup so my co-founder is currently in Finland whereas I'm here in London for a couple of days when we're working remotely the way we work is that we're essentially just on a zoom call at all times and whenever we then go to work on different things we just like mute each other and whenever there's an update we update each other things like this the only worry we had is that something like this couldn't work because I'm also going to be remotely for most of this when I go back to Dubai but it's been working pretty well so far touch wood for the next month or so like month and a half I will actually be in person in Finland so there's gonna be Vlogs from there and stuff as well coming up um but yeah it's just really exciting to be working on a project with a different person rather than just my solo project and this is definitely the sort of Direction I want to go with all of my projects going forward um so yeah in my co-founder just texted me that he's back so I'm gonna go back to the call [Music] thank you should we go have lunch not supposed to do that you're supposed to have other fans in the background I mean it's extra steps extra fun she loves Chrome extension it's too complicated [Music] red is literally the only thing I miss about us really yeah yeah it's doing it of course made in London decided to start pouring on us lovely it's gonna break my camera and then I can't upload this vlog God damn it horrible weather freaking terrible I do still like the city of London the thing about the city is I only like it in the summer so my plan is pretty much living in Dubai over the winters when basically everywhere in Europe just sucks and then for the Summers you can still enjoy European summer like for example here in London or Paris or things like that and so yeah it's nice to be back in Hunter for a while [Music] is the reality roasting Maple before I see you next you're gonna be dead you're gonna be dead driving around this freaking City how many people tell me you cycle in London yeah I'm like yeah what else do you want me to do like crazy freaking fight sounds to do two stops of Subway or something no yes well actually now the traffic for Cycles is bigger than the traffic for cars are there cycle Lanes here actually good so yeah yeah I think so I mean I come from a country where Cycles have no place whatsoever so here it's a bit at least the lanes are larger the cars don't go too crazy I would get run over about in like 10 minutes whereas here so if I say good it's my choice it's my choice smart [Music] thank you
