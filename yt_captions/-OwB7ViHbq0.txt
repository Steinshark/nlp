ladies and gentlemen in today's video I'm going to be sharing a secret trick to win more chess games that's as simple as I can describe it if you want to get better at chess you got to play a lot you got to study a lot you got to not make the same mistakes repeatedly but there are few techniques at various levels that can just simply win you more games particularly when you are losing let's jump into the four examples that I have for you this entire video was inspired by this game I have a subscriber on Twitch his name is Sean his username is Bob AKA Sean he plays completely ridiculous chess let's take a look at this game and I will show you this simple trick to win more chess games Bob started this game a Blitz game against harshil from India was a Karo Khan and Bob got a great position early as he did everything you're supposed to do in the Karo Khan which is develop your light squared Bishop put some pressure here and put some pressure on the center Knight C6 and life was good for Bob Bob got absolutely perfect Karo Khan style position with Knight D4 pressure here threatening to damage the structure over here and I mean he was just doing everything right his position was absolutely wonderful he was about to play Queen A5 and then capture this pawn and then capture that pawn and then get his Rook over here and I'm just really enjoying drawing arrows in different colors um and his position was wonderful now you may be asking well Levy what's the trick I mean this just looks like normal chest the trick is folks sometimes you're gonna get really really bad positions in chess because you're a human and you need to know how to fight Bank when you get a very bad position and it involves your king pay attention in this game Bob's opponent went here and Bob had a little trap in this position he can play Knight takes E5 Knight E5 defends the queen and also wins him a pawn and if his opponent takes this he takes the queen if his opponent moves he just does this and this but Bob accidentally hung his Queen in one move Bob spent 10 seconds on this move eight seconds hung his Queen in one move we've all been there we have all been there we've all blundered our Queen a lot of you would hit the resign button a lot of you would throw your phone a lot of you would yell smack yourselves panic but this is what you should do instead when you blunder a queen you should continue the game you should try to keep as many pieces on the board as possible do not trade because the more pieces you trade the less of a chance you have of coming back keep as many pieces on the board as possible white here gets a little bit too excited gives up The Rook for the night that doesn't make a whole lot of sense now you take with the Rook Queen A7 and I mean make no mistake Bob is losing a lot and the person with white here has a getaway Square for their King should Advance their Pawn should try to trade Rooks try to trade Bishop for Knight like this and just win the game and for a little while actually white was doing exactly that I mean Bob doing his best but it's really hard A6 and a couple moves later A7 now here I don't really understand why white did not play a7a8 right like why didn't white just play like just make a second Queen there's absolutely no danger here for white minute 40 on the clock but Bob stops the queen and uh well is a couple of moves away from losing and now folks Rook up some now I will show you how to win more games from completely lost and hopeless positions there is an m in the evaluation you don't know that when you're playing you don't know that it's mate but you know that the situation is dire there is a technique in chess this technique confuses everybody it makes people completely not know what to do and for about 90 percent of you watching this below the rating of 15 1600 this technique will work in your online games maybe not over the board but definitely online and that technique is to run your king up the board when all hope is lost I'm not saying do that in the middle of an equal game but when all hope is lost then you are about to just get checkmated run the king up the board I'm telling you right now what you are about to witness is absolutely spectacular King to G6 of course this is losing of course it's lost in fact it's so lost that there's made in one but it was lost even before the king run and you might as well try to do something to fight back if you do nothing white just wins white just wins but when you run the king up the board people get a little confused they are used to checkmating a King in the corner they're used to Checkmate but when the king starts running people get very confused by the Angles and so check Rook G7 is made but white misses that and now the king escapes white takes a pawn white doesn't know do I check do I not check look how much time white is spending all right we go from like uh Rook B7 I mean you know Rook B7 queen f8 king jet Queen Y8 white is just trying to give some checks and win material back but like 14 seconds 14 where's the mate 14 seconds where's the mate I don't know where's the mate where's the mate I don't I don't see it how do I Checkmate here Queen E4 all right I'm getting closer but suddenly Rook A1 check oh my God Rook B1 back 10 seconds spent on that move 10 seconds he doesn't trade now it's Queen G4 Queen G4 is game over however because of this white got scared and took and mated himself white checkmated himself despite having a full 50 seconds on the clock and having made in one on the board multiple times this only was possible because black decided look I can't just sit here and die I need to run my king folks you might think this is ridiculous but I swear to you this will win you more games when all hope is lost the position is completely lost run the king just do it don't believe me watch these other examples this is again this was another game sent to me look at their ratings they are 1700 pay attention E4 all right white plays pretty solid opening takes a lot of space all right D5 played and uh C5 is not a good move I mean white is uh opening is not the most important thing in the world queen F3 F5 black is crushing from the opening all right first of all black I don't know what black is doing here 1700 on leeches can't even see Bishop takes this Rook uh Bishop takes and this all right it's plus seven for black it's plus seven seven it's plus seven if the game is over I mean at the 1700 what are we even looking at right first of all what on Earth is white doing like how does white not just go take take completely seize the center you know F4 Knight F3 cat like how do you not just how does white go from plus two to losing literally all their pieces now if you're playing Black here just take the Knight just trade pieces like don't even think about it black glaze Knight D7 now white play C6 Knight F6 Bishop A3 and Rook H1 all right it's -10 at the 1700 level so what do you do with white you avoid trades you try to create some counter play you actually have a pretty reasonable position black should of course go here infiltrate trade Queens with you all right 94 okay Bishop B2 no there's Queen D5 yep and queen eight no I mean it's over it's completely over King E3 that's just the free Bishop Queen B2 it's it's minus 13. I bet the game is over Queen D2 Queen F2 like made it made in two Rook G1 is played and it's made in two I told you I mean every single one of these videos like this is what's gonna happen run your king run the king sometimes you're gonna be forced to run the king because if you don't you're just gonna get checkmated run the king black doesn't find Queen D2 black just doesn't fact it happens sometimes you just you're winning but you can't win you can't seal the deal Night comes back now I love this Queen E5 G6 and now run find a way to run the king white doesn't know what he's doing anymore sacks The Rook it's m in the evaluation at the 1700 level you know how many you know how many people watching this right now are nowhere near 1700 that is a very legitimate rating King F4 now if I'm playing Black here just give tracks just give checks I mean just give a check like force the king back and and white is lost but when you run the king as I told you people panic they don't know what to do you take a random pawn and instead of taking this or checking you or mating you in a variety of different ways or forking your queen and king to force a queen trade Force the Queens off you will never ever lose but people malfunction they just they don't know what to do so they go here that is a discover check but it allows your king to infiltrate and folks if you think that what you are about to witness is exactly what you are about to witness if you're looking at this right now and going there there's just no way right yes yes yes yes yes Queen G7 made 16 points of material up I mean are you are you kidding me what do you know how many mates there are in this position fifty thousand any move any move by accident you will Checkmate your opponent I mean Rook Cafe Queen D4 Knight E4 just instead black just made made 1700. I'm not exaggerating okay this method of making comebacks from completely lost positions run the just run it as far as possible just go just go you will not regret it that this position has a ridiculous last example I'm going to show you this one is so so disgusting I'm gonna show you this one this is 1600 game all right this one starts E4 right relatively normal stuff Vienna F4 love this shout out to my Brazilian here playing the Vienna Vienna Enthusiast gets a great position I mean I don't know what he's doing I don't know I don't I don't know who taught him to take with the pawn there let me tell you definitely wasn't me here's an example of a Gotham sub who gets my course gets a winning position on move eight and then does this and is now losing like this is right here this is a chest study 101 get a winning position on move seven in an opening lose it on move eight uh Bishop H6 is obviously not a good move takes Bishop C1 ef6 Bishop B2 and white is completely lost completely lost one point away from being 1660. you're telling me a 1600 rated player hung a piece on move six actually moved 10. uh Knight D5 I like this move now takes takes okay I like that move because this is kind of annoying for black it's kind of annoying to deal with and you know White's King is relatively safe white can try to consolidate but of course black can play like 95 hit this hit this get the king to safety kick the Knight out okay black plays 95 indeed and then takes great now kick the night out with the move C6 excellent 97 looks scary but it's not check and um yeah this is a little bold uh D5 because what it does is it actually allows the White Queen to enter and that's actually very dangerous uh which is exactly what subscriber does now you may be asking yourself well Levy didn't you say that in this game uh you know you're supposed to run your king when you're losing right and well to be honest with you uh yeah black gets uh completely lost position here because of double check look at that absolutely insane move King G8 and now this is relatively easy you just check and you can just be patient because the king cannot go to the G file so The Rook will always cut hit there and you're threatening Knight C6 discovered attack it's just a crushing position you can go here take just winning however um my dear subscriber um thought that he had a smothered mate here he thought that he was going to play Queen f8 Rook here and he thought this was Checkmate which is adorable um now you know if if if this was the position he would be right he would have played an absolutely legendary smothered mate that is a smothered maid indeed hits this check problem with the way my subscriber did it is he just hung his Queen because that can just be taken and now black is just up a rook and since black is up a rook what black should do next is take a pawn but be careful Rook G1 is made it's never too late to blunder Checkmate in one move so you want to make some room for your king bring the king Take a pawn rookie eight Rook G8 Etc black does that F6 yeah take take take and now you should bring the king king F7 and take the pawn and win the game a little tricky a little trick so what did my subscriber do did my subscriber Rage or get mad or resign no he ran his King it took a little time he first brought his pawns together and then King F3 and King G4 started running his King here's the thing if white plays D7 black will take and uh essentially what'll happen in this in this position is uh something like this where this is like a best case scenario for white and maybe drawable but probably black will win all the pawns and end up going on to win so black goes Rook G8 kick here and Rook C5 King H6 Rook F5 and I mean black is completely winning and it's made in two in a couple of moves Rook G6 King H7 Rook H5 is made so white goes here and now Rook gg5 you still cannot promote anything because that's Checkmate Rook H1 and Rook D5 okay the game is over the game is absolutely lost Rook takes D6 A5 when suddenly when suddenly black so enamored with the presence of this King started focusing all of his attention on it okay started focusing all his attention on the king and forgot not just that there was a pawn promoting there's upon promoting and then it's made with two minutes on the clock black allowed a promotion instead of just standing in front of the pawn and winning the game with F4 and just and this only happened because white from a totally lost position decided Well I got nothing else I'm gonna lose all my pawns let me just run my king up and I mean black could have played anything black could have played absolutely black could have just ran the pawn black just needed to avoid this right and he didn't he got he got a little distracted started attacking the king and then just forgot about the pawn and lost but if you think this is bad you ain't seen nothing yet this is the last game that I will show you if you don't believe me this is a Vienna not the most accurate move order against D6 I recommend Bishop C4 D3 F4 but fine uh and uh yeah I mean the opponent plays Knight D4 of course just Queen D4 here and white is winning white just has a completely winning position so uh long Castle it's plus nine I mean White's position is incredible white needs the cat White's getting a little bit too aggressive here um Rook takes G7 is also a completely winning move so crushing just absolutely crushing white decides to trade give away a pawn doesn't Castle suddenly counter play comes in uh Rook D1 is a decent move and yeah King F1 is nice take take and the bishop is hanging and they give a check and give a check and Bishop F2 and um it's a very very back and forth battle like why it back and forth in terms of it looks like white is completely winning uh and now white blunders Rook D1 so why play 20 is something that moves as you do when you're 900 you make a blunder and you're almost lost because you have to go here and I mean it it just looks like you're getting mated now it just looks like the game is over it is the game is over you're not getting mated but the game is lost um so your king now gets hunted and just starts running and like I said sometimes you are forced to run sometimes you just you just go for a run okay and uh rookie one King F2 rookie two King G3 King G4 and the white king is just going for a run now black has Rook H2 and Bishop g3s now black is completely winning all right now what white should do here is prevent the pawn from queening right and just keep the King around do some stuff with the King and that is exactly what white does white just bounces the King around the board which is king of seven all right couple moves later we're gonna move it again Rook G7 Rook G8 they're creating some threads Rook C8 all right at some point we're gonna start getting the king involved again and the King moving around the board is so tricky because you're just looking and you're like I wonder where like where the king's gonna go to next and yes there is low time look how disgusting the white king ends up in this game King D5 B3 King C4 the only legal move in this position is for black to play B5 and the only legal move in this position is for black to play B4 and a takes B4 is made there is black is forced to Checkmate himself black has one legal move in this position it's this black has one legal move in this position and it's checkmating yourself that is why you need to run your king when the position is bad you will win games you have no business winning now get out of here
