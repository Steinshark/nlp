foreign [Music] okay it's kind of hard to believe but yeah this is a real product what I'm holding is the new Dyson Zone air purifying headphones that's exactly what they're called you can look it up so when this first started popping up on actual like Dyson social media channels I had to double check the calendar to make sure it wasn't April 1st because seriously Dyson are you pranking us right now this is It's a thousand dollars for air purifying headphones I wasn't really sure what to think probably safe to ignore it but then one by one videos started popping up on YouTube on Twitter on Instagram and people actually started asking like hey Marquez can you check out those Dyson headphones can you check out the Dyson zone so that look you see here is me realizing I just spent a thousand dollars plus shipping on something that I already believe is a terrible product but I'm still here to do my job and find out anyway but here's the thing and probably the weirdest part and most important part of this whole thing Dyson this product could only have come from Dyson it it makes no sense but makes all the sense in the world so ignoring the whole embarrassing social media campaign around the vacuums for a second like I love my Dyson vacuum cleaner right A lot of people I know have bought Dyson vacuums No Regrets We love these things they're great and then over the years Dyson has built up like a cult following and loyal fan base over what is basically Motors and filtration like Dyson is a Motors and filtration company and they've built that out and turned it into some of the most amazing vacuum cleaners in the world and they're also some of the most expensive like seriously if you want a stick vacuum you can just get one on Amazon for like a hundred bucks easy but then you kind of get the feeling that Dyson is the brand name that they're all copying but naturally you don't stop there right you're successful with one thing but you got to Branch out so what else do you do you've all seen the Dyson bladeless fan thing right I mean this is almost a legendary product on its own the Dyson fan slash air purifier in the corner of the room of a 500 a night Airbnb do other companies make bladeless fans now sure but people want the Dyson one the 700 Dyson one another successful implementation of Motors infiltration there's also the Dyson hair dryer another cult classic this thing is absolutely incredible I don't even use a hair dryer I actually use this thing to heat up the dbrand Skins to put on the back of my phones and it's awesome for that too another successful implementation of Motors infiltration so Dyson is no stranger to charging a lot of money successfully for a seemingly Niche product but that doesn't mean they can't miss you guys have probably heard about maybe you haven't they made a floor lamp too maybe you haven't heard about it because it's less successful it's also 850 so they can miss you also might have heard about the car prototype that they brought to CES which like okay yes you make Motors and motors are one part of an electric car but there are lots of other parts of a car that are really hard and trust me a Dyson car is kind of a tough sell no matter what you're going to price it at so Dyson has a lot of hits and some complete misses so what's this one going to be okay so this product is part headphones part air purifier I know about headphones so let's talk about the headphones part first and these headphones are absolutely wild first of all they're gigantic like they're absolutely huge I don't even have to tell you that now a lot of the size will make more sense when we get to the filtration part and everything that's also inside these ear cups later but just as a pair of headphones on your head these things are huge they stick out a lot to this side but honestly it's mostly the weight okay so Audio Technica is M50 so I've talked about those in the past very familiar headphones totally normal 288 grams not that bad on your head then you get to like the heaviest headphones we talked about how heavy airpods Max are those are 388 grams which is a lot these are 588 grams so it feels like I'm wearing a football helmet these things are so heavy now there's a lot of metal but they do try to maximize comfort with these really soft cushions and the ear cups are super soft and the top of the headphones are soft and then it's this purple velvet color the side pieces are more for stability to keep them in place on your head and honestly if you're just sitting in one place not moving around too much listening to music in a chair or on a train or something I guess then they're not terrible it's just the second you start moving around or looking up and down or walking that you really feel the weight it seriously feels like a helmet material wise though it is nothing but the premium materials I gotta say the headphone band is metal the cushions are super soft the ear cups are metal through and through you can see the microphones very clearly around the bottom the USBC port and the controls are actually very very clever everything is on the right ear cup and it's mostly by this little joystick here so instead of trying to swipe on a finicky touch surface or something like that you literally tap up and down on the joystick for volume tap left or right for the next track and previous track and amazingly you can actually hold down the joystick to the right or left to scrub forward or backward in whatever audio you're in and it worked in a bunch of apps for me too to my surprise worked in apple music worked in Spotify my podcast app it didn't work in YouTube or SoundCloud but even yeah just the thought of being able to fast forward a little bit to the middle of a podcast or something on Spotify is kind of sick I've never seen that before but of course with the super high price tag you hopefully care about how they sound so how do these sound big premium expensive active noise cancellation 40 millimeter drivers how did these do they sound as high-end as they cost no they don't but they sound okay I mean they sound like some two to three hundred dollar headphones that I've heard even though they're built like 400 headphones but I'll say the sound overall is pretty balanced and reasonably Bassy and Punchy in the low end there's a pretty good passive seal with these ear cups and then the active noise cancellation does a little extra work for you it is just a Bluetooth headphone there's no wired connection and nothing fancy as far as lossless audio or special codecs or anything like that but you know they sound crisp with a little extra brightness in the highs what's more impressive is so the active noise cancellation is pretty good but the transparency mode is actually excellent this is the best I've heard from anything that isn't airpods and you can double tap the right ear cup to switch between transparency mode and noise cancellation the battery life of these is about 50 hours which is right at the top of its class where noise cancellation headphones with ANC on um they also don't have an on off switch so they do on head detection kind of like airpods Max so when you take them off your head they go into this I title mode and you put them back on they play this nice chime they turn back on and now you're listening to music again ergonomically they're not anything special but we know the joystick for the controls the transparency mode these are pretty good headphones so that brings us to part two so like I said this is a two in one product part headphones part air purifier let's just completely ignore the why for a second just so we can just understand what's happening and how this works so these headphones come with this little plastic visor thing so inside the ear cups of the headphones you can pop off the outside cover and that's where these filters go that came in the box and those filters are covering these air intakes and Tiny micro compressors that suck in the air from the outside world these filters help purify the air by cutting down 99 of pollutants as small as 0.1 microns then they pass that clean air through these slots the visor connects the headphones via magnets to these slots and creates a seal so that the air is channeled down through it and passes over your nose and mouth through the mesh at the front it is a pretty intricate setup but the idea is pretty straightforward basically like oh okay you've got noise pollution noise canceling headphones gotcha cover oh you've got air pollution too fresh air all the time we got you covered now the timing of these was actually super unfortunate because contrary to what you might be thinking right now this has nothing to do with the pandemic nothing to do with covet it happened to be announced right around the same time um but this is really directly advertised that people who live in or commute in cities with bad air quality dust pollen smog gas fumes grass clippings whatever it is just bad air quality so the idea is you're about to go out on your commute with the polluted world around you so you put the headphones on you snap the visor on and now you're uh you're getting the fresh air the entire time you're outside with these fans spinning it's the idea anyway now I went through the painful exercise of going out and testing these things so you don't have to okay so I'm looking kind of ridiculous on public streets because hey I want to see if this will actually work I walked past roadways to see if I could smell gasoline I walked past Landscaping to see if I could smell pollen and lawn clippings I walked into a public Porta John to see if I could survive you know and uh bad news I could still smell a lot of everything I mean there was a nice little stream of fresh air going over my nose and mouth it's a nice little breeze but yeah you can still smell everything I think right off the bat there's really actually two main problems that hit me immediately with this setup one is when you put all these together and you put them on uh the fans which are in the ear cups start spinning up and the air compressors turn on and you can hear that because it's right on your ear and so you're hearing that through your music so you can kind of drown It Out by turning the audio up but that right off the bat was kind of annoying but then the second is there's no seal like you can still have air passing over your nose and mouth but things can also slip in above and below even if it's close to your mouth so they want you to have as little of a gap as possible and it's adjustable so you can shrink that visor down as much as you want to basically have it touching the tip of your nose but stuff will still get in as long as there's no seal and nobody wants to walk around breathing from a literal tube like a scuba diving mouthpiece so yeah this is just a built-in flaw of the fact that nobody wants that that's the way it's designed plus there's a bunch of other quirks like once the filtration gets going the battery life goes from 50 hours to two hours the visor is super light and flimsy because it's completely plastic presumably to be lightweight and keep it balanced on your head but then it also has all kinds of weird scratches and poor finishes on the mesh and rubber and plastic and just feels really cheap and none of that none of that even touches just how ridiculous you look and then there's the pull medical problem so I'm not a doctor but I do have a friend who is Mike also happens to have a YouTube channel you might have heard of him but he explain to me exactly why this product is even more flawed than I realized on the surface yeah so I see a product that actually confuses me more than anything because I don't know who the intended customer is because they very clearly say this is not a medical grade product there's no seal that exists here on like a traditional n95 mask I look at the marketing material and I see somebody out in a city in a subway station and on the streets and there's there's pollen there's smog there's all kinds of other things and they put this on and suddenly the air they're breathing is clean they don't smell or inhale any of it is that a dream or am I missing something they say that the product cleans up to 0.1 microns particles out of the air but it's not HEPA rated because a HEPA rated filter will actually filter particles with a 99.95 efficacy it's not as good as an n95 mask which has a seal and this is where a lot of misinformation actually spreads with n95 masks because when we say n95 what we're saying is they have a 95 percent efficacy at filtering particles that are 0.3 microns and you might say well a covid particle is 0.1 Micron so does that mean they get through n95 masks that's what some people who are anti-master said right most coveted particles that travel in there are attached to things water droplets respiratory droplets that kind of thing so they're already bigger than 0.3 and they end up being captured by the mask but they specifically choose 0.3 microns because when you go smaller than that like a coveted particle at point one it follows something known as Brownian motion and this is where these small particles move so randomly around when they're dissolved in a gas like our air that they end up being trapped by The n95 Mask even better than the 0.3 okay there's a lot of things to why this doesn't make sense I also saw a tweet about how if you are specifically thinking about covid and you are someone who has covid and you wear this now when you exhale all that air blowing is now just being ejected out into space where it'd normally stay in The Mask yes like this device is not designed to keep your air and your particles to your face like a mask would yeah uh so what the company has said in response to this that there's enough room to wear a mask in between but to me if you have room for an n95 masks this eliminates the need for this product because the n95 mask is more effective at filtering the air and creating a seal in this product so why in the world would you wear a mask that filters better than this and then this thing on top of it but what I worry about is it actually creates risk and it creates risks in two ways one is that it blows air directly onto your nose and mouth which are your mucous membranes anytime you have air circulating areas that have a natural level of moisture you dry them out dry mucous membranes are a problem because they crack and create openings for pathogen Center your body then it's cold outside this thing is blowing cold air at your mucous membranes which actually causes vasoconstriction meaning less blood flow less white blood cells in the area protecting you another problem and then the real problem is I'm going to really Hammer at home yes yes they say this is like Urban environments where pollution is high there's brake dust car pollution all very valid all big problems we should address but in urban environments based on CDC data the rate per hundred thousand of debts from chronic respiratory disease is around 35. but you know what's 33 percent higher than that unintentional accidents that goes up all the way to 47 per hundred thousand yeah and you know what's increasing rates of unintentional accidents are you saying that these noise canceling headphones might actually cause more problems than they solve yeah so why did they do this Dyson is a weird company like I said at the beginning they're they're a motor and filtration company but they've had so many hits they've made these Niche products like stick vacuums and air purifiers and hair dryers into like cult favorites which is crazy I can actually see how this product came to exist and how it ended up being a thousand dollars actually honestly the thousand dollars part is the easy part like when you just look at the materials and the Cool Tech and the packaging that went into this thing it's kind of silly these headphones themselves are super heavy but yeah they're all metal the cups are metal the bands are metal and there's obviously a ton of tech in here the packaging is hilarious there's not just the headphones and the visor which look like a smiley face but there's also a super high quality carrying case with felt lining there's a thick braided elastic strap for that carrying case there's an extra set of filters there is the softest velvet headphone carrying pouch I've ever seen there is a dual color braided USBC cable with a headphone jack adapter there's a metal airplane adapter there's what I assume is a reusable filter cleaner with a handle and another carrying pouch for just the cables and the accessories also super soft and then there's this Dyson app that connects the headphones that lets you not only change the settings but also gives you a live look at a summary of the air quality in your area and then gives me a live readout of the audio levels of my my environment and how much sound the noise cancellation mode is preventing from getting to my ears I've never seen anything like this with headphones and like live real-time data visualization like this gives you a summary of your fan speed usage your noise cancellation usage over time and gives you an estimate of your filter life and a direct link to buy new filters for once you run out of the ones that come in the box if you showed me all this repair headphones and never even told me about the filter thing or what brand it was from I would assume that these are at least 400 headphones but at the end of the day most of this like so many other things in the tech world can be explained by branding like it's only Dyson that could have pulled this off and gotten this thing as far as it has to get into this video but there's a sort of a term that you've probably heard in the business world before that a lot of companies use called the loss leader strategy Barbara Corcoran was on my podcast from Shark Tank and she taught me about this concept called Lost leader and basically she believes that products that are gimmicky in this vein will actually not make company money but they'll draw enough press that they'll sell other products perhaps that's what's going on they earn press yes yeah because there's lost leaders that are like oh we can afford to sell you this hardware for cheap and lose money on it because you will buy the software and make the money back this one is a loss leader because no one should buy it and probably no one will but it'll generate enough Buzz that people talk about Dyson we're doing it right now and they'll be on them yeah you win this round dice here we are talking about your stupid headphones with your stupid filter and it's not you didn't even have to pay for an ad like you wanted to so yeah well played thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
