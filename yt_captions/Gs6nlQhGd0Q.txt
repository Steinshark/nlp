so last time on mystery attack we were left with a cliffhanger and that can lost the item that we were supposed to have Ken do you have this issue rectified yet I mean that's not mystery to great it's fragile hey this is a camcorder this is the camp where we sold on eBay that came back returned oh I'm getting flashbacks I mean flashbacks what am I supposed to with the speaker and why do I have the wonderful album world's by Porter Porter Robinson Porter Robinson I know how to speak oh look the correct item that we were supposed to take a look at last time enjoy this gem from the eighties it is a rare piece of music culture did you put this in the box no that was actually the seller from eBay I was not expecting that at all I think I know what this is is this that weird vertical Sony turntable I've never seen one of these before in person how much was this $800 so do you remember when you fail not one what's you so oh I just love for dramatic effect why are you unboxing that's my job cuz you know you left you left and now I get to unbox this thing that I I sweet I get to be behind the camera I'm gonna look at this camera because so josh has to use it you should actually look at the look at the item oh that's more than austin pays me that's that's 551 I know I know right so the cool thing about this record players that you can actually stand it vertically and when you pop this out your record goes in here so you can actually try to demonstrate that right now and I believe all you have to do I mean short of plugging in and obviously is like you just pop it in and a disc old there we go I assume now once we plug it in and press play we should be good to go and we also have to plug it into the speaker obviously because it doesn't have any do my actual day job now hey Porter can we use your music oh wait too bad we're already copyright claims are you ready yes oh I heard it one of the cool things about this is that it looks awesome 2530 years later like that's crazy to me it might be a little yellowed but it works 100% flawlessly I mean I don't think it was worth spending $100 I'm still upset that he's been a hater dollars on this but it's super at a few sidetrack all of your work wherever you work what does the sidetrack portable monitor the ultra portable mounted monitor for laptop productivity this is really just connect via USB and like attach to like the side of your display or something okay right wait do we know how much this is wait wait no no no I'm not doing this you have to literally permanently mounted he civ to the back of your laptop I'm not sacrificing my laptop to put the stupid thing on so ken has kindly donated his laptop from broke versus pro so let's see how this actually works so I'm going to line it up with the back corner like that that's in you sure it's it okay it's fine it'll stretch is that broken right now is that the way the USBC port is supposed to look I didn't pull it that hard it's just like first of all it's not working we've tried a couple of cables but second of all I just I'm not convinced that this is the way this is not the greatest hinge setup in the world I don't want to permanently attach something like I get this in theory but I would personally much rather use a USBC external display this has like a little stand let be a sous one and then I would be just fine because this is like technically if it worked would be fine and if I didn't break the cable which I'll admit is my bad but like hmm and now this was stuck on the laptop at least the adhesive pads are okay there friends okay [Music] Chuey what's this oh the chewy mini book with an 8 inch screen oh look something actually like how much was the chewy mini book 550 yes great love it so inside we have not only windows in an 8-inch 1920 by 1200 IPS display but we also have an amber Lake 80-100 Y processor which is an i3 or m3 I'm very curious this is a very very small little laptop it could be cool I'm not sure about that though oh that's it I mean that's actually kind of cool you know it's surprisingly dense for something that's this small this actually feels like a weighs almost as much as like a really small laptop okay so I initially have some reservations this keyboard is wacky issue would be my official way I would describe this so we have fairly large keys but are very bizarre layout so the P and the Delete key shared we have a bunch of these little mini keys that are all squished and besides the shift so the little touchpad is interesting because it's not bad but you can't make large movements with it like you kind of have to really sort of swipe with it although it is a touchscreen and realistically I feel like I would use the touchscreen more than that but I guess it's nice to have both you know what I could probably used to this I don't think I would have be particularly fast but it's not it's not garbage Tom Sowell the keyboard is actually not that bad I found a problem the e key is just sticky like literally it's down right now in fact actually it's wait how do I get back up oh we're a hundred percent cpu essentially boosting a 2.5 you hear how loud that is I mean it's kicking some air there's a market for a computer like this right if you want something tiny that of course is running full Windows 10 in with specs that are reasonable right I mean you've got some decent USB ports you've got USB see you've got micro HDMI I mean there's something to be said for the chewy mini book however I'm not entirely sure that this is for me and especially considering that this specific model has the e key which is sticky and pretty much makes the keyboard almost unusable that's a bit of a problem it's cool though you don't really know who needs this right you need this you need the chewy mini book yes what do you need a chewy mini book for we're just trying to like put your laptop in your back pocket like mmm okay so we are you trying to tell me that you spent $550 on this so I could talk about a mystery tech for 45 seconds then you're gonna take it home and use it from now on I kind of keep that that we've been spending a lot of money I don't believe you but okay okay cellphone jail lock your phone's reconnect with the real world why I got build this thing thanks Matt your videographer with uh with Luke Cage no it's like all right why you in jail stupid get out stupid awesome you'll never get yours Ethan back I have the keys you'll never be able to get that back I just your lock so thank you very much for the phone jail this is really well put together and that lock really kept me out can we move on to the next item please all right okay that looks complicated there's a little Tesla coil okay okay so I immediately can tell that this is built on top of a CPU heatsink can you see that it's literally it's got like the mounting and everything like that looks just like what you would put on CPU although I guess it's mounted with the fan on the inside how much was this Tesla coil all right three two one oh that's cool what yo it's literally like shooting sparks out when you look some slow motion on this so essentially what this is doing is its using the Tesla coil the magnetic field to not only spin but also you can see that there are these sparks that are coming out the ends and it almost looks like it's sort of like splitting off into - it looks really rad so it might be hard to see but we've now installed the needle so theoretically this is the mode that will actually work with the record so its first start it up okay so spinning now let's hit play on the record whoa [Music] dude okay pull us again hold on SEC what's happening right now is music which has been pressed into this record is being read by a needle pass through this 35 year old record player through a headphone jack into a Tesla coil as being played back on a needle what this cell is like actually like a not great speaker but like look at that that's little and needle vibrating and that is what's causing this this okay you know what time for my next party trick so if I get it close oh wow okay that Amelia works look look how far I am away when the LED turns on see that oh if I push it closer it gets brighter but look all over here I'm getting wireless power that's wild wait let me try the other one oh it's green look at that you can see exactly where like a little bit of power that move it and that's pretty much it for full brightness and I can move it pretty close and it just gets brighter and brighter ooh even hisses probably shouldn't get it that close let there be light ah much better and Xbox one X that we already own okay I'm assuming the sin thing that goes with this the game sir aim switch one combo for all controllers all right that is a thing wow that's much larger than I thought it's going to be I don't know if I like the feel what cut keys are these TTC mechanical switch I have no idea with that oh we can't go red they feel kind of like not very good they're like us squishy red switches how much was the game sir I'm gonna guess $100 okay guy plug the receiver into the USB port of the Xbox all right so I need a display I need to get the Xbox up and run okay so heavy I broke the box what's up what is that games you got a games case what's the guardian and why is the address all over eight Josh just got sent to the frame again oh good it's not the office addresses just your home address so we can leak that that's fine now they know now they know why is it so big what is the order place say January holy what guardian Pro XP performance gaming monitor what is even happening with this thing look at all the stuff this thing does do you need to do all this stuff are you really a pro gamer also the my favorite part my favorite part of the reason why I got it was there are mounting holes on the top you have melon for your smartphone but you can also mount lights on there so if you want to stream from it and have that whole set up you could do that too so you're trying to say that I can plug my twitch channel at twitch.tv slash Austin Evans right now where I will not be using this monstrosity yes but I know where you will find someone oh I love it Josh thanks for censoring that didn't even have to ask how much was the game's guardian you trying to tell me are you trying to tell me you spent $800 on a stupid record player $750 on a giant golf gaming thing $500 on a laptop that doesn't work you see the pile of stuff down here look at all the things you got from mystery tech what's cool the $90 little like Tesla coils this is the fullest expensive mystery tech of all time this is ridiculous you missed a spot whoa Wow that's all screen Wow this is actually this is really nicely made I will say well for 700 dollars it better be you want to be a pro gamer you don't listen to Kimball Ito you buy what Kimball Ito buys your rug the realist spokesman for the channel because like everything you buy all the kids are gonna want to buy cuz you spend all the money like mom can use that up broke versus pro can I have one no a little Timmy no you can't so after a little bit of troubleshooting we actually have none of the games case working but our game serve so first of all with the games case so this is taking advantage of a 1440p display and as you can see it looks some actually pretty good I'll say I mean she might not be the brightest thing in the world but honestly I would be super happy playing with it what's nice is compared to most portable cases the screen is massive now with the rest of it it's kind of interesting so the idea is that you can cable manage this up so we have channels here and here so the ports from the Xbox are going into the game case itself and then we have more USBs and headphone up front so essentially what you have to do with the game sir is this part is Wireless right so you have your keyboard as well as your mouse so this all runs on a battery it wirelessly connects to this little puck and this puck combines the signal from the gamester as well as from a legitimate Xbox controller pass it via USB I took awhile to get this thing actually properly working but once you're in a game you actually do have decent controls read dad's not the greatest example because it's got a little bit of that like sort of acceleration because she's pretty good too it's weird though using the mouse for aim because it obviously the game thinks that we're just using a controller for some games I think this could be perhaps a bit of an unfair advantage but also it's a little bit of a janky setup I mean I have a lot of cables in front of me right now I think I'm a little bit more on board with the games case than I am with the game sir for very specific use cases the gamester might be good but the problem is is that when you're looking at what's capable on the Xbox one X and the one already you can plug in a mouse and keyboard and a lot of games will support that so why would you deal with this when you can just use a legitimate mouse and keyboard that will actually work much better without any of this sort of tomfoolery thank you very much for watching this episode of mystery tech do I have a good outro no but I do have some words of wisdom don't listen to Ken don't spend all your money on mystery tech because inevitably what you get is a pile of disappointment thank you very much for watching I will see you next time on mystery Tech my to close right now it stayed actually pretty in focus
