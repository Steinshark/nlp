hi everyone in this video we're going to be creating some rudimentary armor for our character so let's start with some plate legs so I'm going to duplicate the pense object as a starting point for those I will move this over onto its own layer and let me just select only that layer and the character layer will go into the shape keys and just turn all of these down to zero all right now on this duplicated pencil jacket in the materials I'm going to remove the pants material and create a new material called something like under clothes so this is going to be some sort of dark gray material that the character will wear under the armor so something like that and then I'll go on to edit mode on this let's select faces and I'm just going to alt shift right click to select some of these faces here shifty to duplicate that P and separate by selection and I'll select that object and it is going to be the actual metal part of the leg armor so I mean to remove the under clothes material from that and create a new material called metal and I think I'm going to make this some sort of grayish purple alright I'll now go into edit mode on this just select everything all to s and just fashion a tiny bit all right we'll be careful that it doesn't go past the center here and I want to shape this slightly so that's going to vertex mode and I think I'll enable a proportional editing by pressing o I'm just going to select either side of the top here press G and I'll scroll down on the mouse wheel to shrink the proportional editing a little bit I'll drag this down just to get a sort of curve at the top here let me drag this up slightly alright to make sure that doesn't intersect and from the back can shape this here as well alright just something like that perhaps and then over here I'll select these two vertices and I will drag these down so that at the front here it's sort of curving around the kneecap something like that and I'll do the same thing for this lower part I select these two just drag those up and I need to scale them a tiny bit as well if you don't want it to affect this part of the armor we can change the proportional editing type to connected and now you can see it'll only affect parts of the mesh that are actually connected to these two selected vertices all right so something like that and I'll do the same thing here grab these and just shape it a bit like that just basically trying to make it look as nice and armory as possible now I'd like to have some metal in this region here as well to protect our precious and kneecaps so I'm going to alt right-click to select this edge loop I'll Jeff right click to select the one below it as well and ctrl e to go into this edges menu and I'm going to choose the bridge edge loops command just to fill in that shape there then I'm going to press P separate by selection and select that new object I'll then go into edit mode and scale this up slightly and also just shrink this at the back a little bit like so I'm basically just trying to give the illusion that some thought has gone into how this is going to actually Bend as the leg bends as long as it sort of looks like it might work then we should be under clear all right let me go out of proportional editing here I'm going to add in two edge loops and let me just give this a nice Bend around the knee and maybe from the front here should be nice if this is sort of a little bit pointy that looks kind of cool I would quite like this to be a slightly darker color than the rest of the plate legs so on this muscle material here I'm just going to press the plus icon which is going to create a new copy of that material and I'll call this metal underscore Jack and just make this a slightly darker purple something like that looks nice alright and then I'm going to join these two objects back together with ctrl J and I want to give them some thickness so in the modify panel I'll add the solidify modifier and let me just press a shift H to hide everything except these objects so we can see what sort of thickness we're actually giving it here just something like that looks fine I guess and we probably don't need to render the insides of these plate legs here so we can just say fill only the room so now we don't have any mesh in those areas that won't be visible all right I'm going to press alt H to unhide everything and no but we have that I think we can just select this apply this little fine modifier and then on the under clothes I'm going to go into edit mode face select mode and just in wireframe here I'm quickly going to select these faces that won't ever be seen since they were concealed by the metal completely I'll just press X and delete faces all right can then select these two different objects in object mode ctrl J to create one object from that and I'm going to go ahead and call this plate legs alright now it's possible that we'll want to have this plate leg sometimes and just lying around in the game world for the player to pick up so let's press shift H to see how it looks without the player and I'd quite like to I just make this Tapia a little bit less messy especially considering that in unity these back faces will be invisible so you'll actually be able to see through the armor to the ground below so I'm going to go into edge mode and just fill in each of these edges here like so in press control are adding a loop along there and then just go into vertex mode select these two vertices of em to merge merge at last all right and then let's see I'm going to move this around to sort of make this look like a sort of lake whole alright and then in face mode I'll select these four faces given to the materials create a new material let's call this just black and make that very dark and just a sign there alright so that looks like some sort of whole way you can slip your legs in I guess so that should be fine alright and at the bottom here I'll just fill in all of those ok so now we just need to worry about how this is deforming some glue press alt H to bring the body back and I'm also go to select the rig layer quickly go into the body and just enable the legs shape either and then let's try bending the legs and see how this looks so getting some intersections over here and also some weird twisting around there with this law sort of a kneecap piece so what I might need to do to fix this kneecap pieces just separate this onto a separate object quickly and then in a way to painting mode I'll select these two leg bones and just gone to weights and assign automatic from bones all right so that sort of part around the back there at least isn't twisting over itself anymore and we can then just bring in our add brush here and let's try getting this part too I behave a little bit better so I'll just add some weights around there so that it's folding back nicely and I'll do the same thing on the lower half for the lower leg bone I mean just up the strength of it this is taking forever alright I think that looks quite good I obviously don't like the intersection I'm getting here with the sort of lower part of the armor then I quickly just to make this a single object once again with ctrl J and then I might just fix that intersection by first of all shrinking this part of it here so I'm gonna go into face mode this is quicker select all of these faces and maybe just alt s to shrink those in and then also grab the vertices around here alt s to make that we've just s make that a bit bigger and hopefully now when we bend the leg we'll just sort of look like it's sliding over it instead of intersecting so that looks nice and from here I just need to fix that slightly maybe make that a bit thicker okay you can probably solve the problem up here in a similar way just by making this part of the armor thicker so I'll grab some of these vertices and just move those our tablet okay I think I am fairly happy with that for now so means you reset the pose and we can all get to work on the plate body so I'm going to quickly show the shirt layer I'll duplicate this and move the duplicated object over onto its own layer and let's now disable these other layers and just show that duplicated shirt layer and I'll quickly get the legs back to normal I'd be nice and then on this shirt layer which is going to become the plate body now I first of all want to split this up into the sort of torso region and the arms region just grew handle those separately so let me just quickly go ahead and select all of those P separate by selection and I'm just going to hide that object for the moment okay I want to change this to our metal color and I want this to be sort of clearly split up into separate sections as if it's made out of separate plates to give it a nice chunky feel so in edit mode I'm hulagur to come here and I just straighten out some of these edge loops and and I just position these slightly differently all right now I'll select all of these vertices here as the sort of first chunk and I'll press e to extrude alt s and just scale that up a tiny bit and then I'll come and deselect some of these mmm maybe I'll just deselect those and then press E and after right-clicking to cancel alt s to scale it up so we've now got our three separate segments of the armor and if we just want to have sort of slightly crisper shading on these we can just add some edge loops near to the top and bottom of those ridges just to define those a little bit better alright so just a straighten that out slightly so that looks kind of nice I might just want to move this whole section up a little bit and maybe this one can come up slightly as well okay something like that and maybe just to sort of enhance the definition of these edges go into face mode and just select these loops that run underneath and we can add a new material here and set that slot to the dark metal and then just press a sign to assign that material to these selected faces all right going into vertex mode I just want to quickly sort out these intersections with the arm here so let me just bring this down a little bit lower that seems to work fine and also around the roof loop here because we extruded this twice we've got these three sets of edge loops so I just want to remove this one in the middle here so just ex and remove edge loops will have the same thing around the neck just select that middle one and delete that as well okay so let's bring back our sleeves object by unhiding that and we'll change the material here to under clothes and I'd like to get some metal sections one for the upper arm and one for the lower arm so going into edit mode here we're going to face mode I'm just going to select all of these faces actually shift D to duplicate and I think I'll separate this onto a new object I'll select that and just all test you fat in this a little bit and assign the metal material to that now on the bone here I just want to make a note of where the actual elbow is so where the arm is bending it can hold D to bring up the grease pencil and just make a little mark there by left-click dragging all right so now going on to here we can see where that elbow is so I want to separate the two sections around there so just selecting this edge loop you can press a V just split that into two I'll move this one to the one side and this one over to the other side of that mark I made and now that that's surface purpose I'll hold down D and just right Mouse drag to erase that all right so let's just shape this bit of armor a little bit and you can really cover up over here a little bit more so something like that and let me just have some fun with this lower part as well okay I'll then also just extrude each of these edges in so just extrude and scale suppose you could also apply a solidify modifier for this so I'll just do it manually all right and I'm going to select all of these different objects and just ctrl J to join it into a single object now I'd like to join up this edge loop to this edge loop so I'm going to press ctrl e and just ask it to bridge the edge loops and then I'm going to select this middle one here and just X and delete edge loops now these faces around here selected I'm going to assign the dark metal to that so we get something like that looks good and then next I'd like to discrete a little shoulder plate so we will come in here and select some of these faces and shifty separate to a new object I'll just scale this up a tiny bit and let me just give this some sort of shape and maybe extrude that out once over the shoulder there and I should probably add a solidify modifier to this so we can give it some thickness all right know exactly how this should look but just something like that maybe looks okay and I just added some edge loops here to help out with the shading of it and I'm not sure if I want this to be in the dark color or not let's just give it a quick try I'll assign that now you just add some variety I don't know I'm just gonna make this bulge out a tiny bit more all right I think that looks okay so let me apply this little to fire modifier and I'll now join those objects together and let's press a shift H to hide everything but this object and we'll do what we did before with the plate legs which is just make sure that this looks okay even if it's not attached to the character and is just sort of lying freely in the scene so I might for example want to just extrude this in a little bit and then fill that face and I'll assign an accreditor Slusher assign the black material to that so it looks like that's a whole way you I can sort of climb in and I'll do the same thing over here I'll just scale this in a little bit and then fill and just assign black to that face same story at the end of the sleeves fill that and assign okay it doesn't matter so much that these faces are made up of so many different vertices it will just get triangulated when we imported into unity so I'm happy with the model we just need to make sure that it's deforming nicely at the moment getting some rather good definitions I think so let's perhaps just try going into waste painting on this I'll select all of the burns and just ask it to assign automatic from burns now the main problem that I have with the defamations at the moment is just when I move this lower arm bone here you can see there are some intersections going on up here so what I'll just do is go into edit mode select this top bit of the arm armor here and just make sure that that in the vs. groups has no weight assigned to the lower arm bone so I'll just remove and then selecting the upper arm bone here I'm going to edit mode I'll make sure that it has a weight of a hundred percent on the upper arm bone so now if I rotate this that should be fixed in the interest of time I'm just going to leave the rest as it is but I encourage you to I go ahead and tweak that to your heart's content I want to move on to the helmet quickly but let me first select this object and in the object data here just call this plate body alright I'm then going to disable that layer and get to work on the helmet so I'm going to start by adding in a cube and in edit mode I'm going to subdivide smoothness once and scale it down move it up on the z-axis and just try and get this to roughly fit the shape of the head so something like that and I'm going to delete these bottom faces here so that it's open and just scale that flat so scaling to zero on the z-axis and once I've done that I'm going to select everything again and subdivide smooth once more alright so that's looking slightly helmet II let's quickly turn on smooth shading as well and I'll assign the metal material and this will be easier to work with if it's so I'll select one half delete those vertices go into the modifiers add a mirror modifier and snabel the clipping now all right let me flatten the bottom here once again and I'm actually gonna do this with each of these edge loops just flattening them like so and then I'm gonna straighten off the shape along the front of the face here and then at the back it can be a little bit more shaped sort of around the outline of the head like so I'll add in a loop at the bottom here so I can sort of flare out a bit alright and from front view we'll need to shake this as well so I'm gonna quickly drag this around I think that starting locale mushy yep let me quickly select this SX and 0 just to straighten each of these out I think that's looking ok now these faces over here I'm going to ultimately be deleting that will be this sort of open region of the helmet but before I do that I just want to press spacebar and search for inset faces so I'll choose that command and we can play with the thickness of that but I'm basically happy with that and go to delete just these ones on the inside here delete those faces and you'll see why I'm doing this in a moment let me just join that together there bring that done and I'm just gonna maybe make this a little narrower and make it a little bit less rectangular around the eyes here okay something like that then I also want to add in a loop near the top just that I can define a slight first so I'm just going to scale that up slightly something like so so I've got a little bit of a crest running along the back and I want just to look too weird over here so let me just touch that up all right and let me tidy this up just scaling these two is zero straight in the marsh okay and I'll do the same with this very bottom one here I'm going to add in one more loop along there just to smooth out the flare a little bit and now I've actually go into face mode and just select these faces around here and along the crest and around the bottom and I just want to assign the dark metal material to this something can you slosh dark metal and assign okay so that looks kind of nice let me just touch that up slightly and also want to have some thickness here so let me add a solidify modifier there we go I think that looks helmet enough maybe make some last week's do loop along here and just keep tweaking a little bit not quite happy with the shape yet maybe straighten this out and I think that's looking a little bit better when they saw these in and at the top of the helmets looking a little bit too low poly so adding a knot the loop there and just fashion that out a bit and then just move that up okay that shapes looking a little bit better so this could quickly go into the object outer call this helmet and because we didn't create this from the body mesh we're going to have to parent this to the armature so go ctrl P and let's just say with empty groups and then we can go to weight painting mode select the head bone here and then in the vertex data go into edit mode select that and just assign it to the head bone alright so the head bone moves and the helmet moves with it great so let us remove the helmet onto its own layer and now we can select all of those layers oops and see our set of armor very quickly I just like to set the origin points for each of these pieces of armor to their respective centers of mass so need to first go ahead and apply the mirror modifier on each of these and then I'll select all three of them and press shift ctrl alt C and just say origin to center of mass and you can see those orange points are now in each of their centers of mass and so they'll each translate around that point okay now the last thing I want to do this video is just correct a slip up that I made last episode which is that when we export this character into the Unity game engine the shape keys that we have here aren't going to work while this mirror modifier is still active so we need to apply that but the frustrating part is that the modifier cannot be applied to a mesh with shape keys so I'm afraid we're going to have to remove the shape keys that we created here and then apply the mirror modifier and then we'll have to recreate those shape keys so let me show just the body and I'll just go through the first one here again so this will be the legs and this is going to be easiest if we go into first edit mode then into the options turn on the X mirror so that when I select all of these and alt s to scale the other leg will get scaled as well all right so I'll just set that up how I want it something like that and let's turn that slider up and we'll test this out with the pants so you just want to make this as unnoticeable as possible let's bring the bones back and test this out with the run animation so getting some intersections and I'm just going to fast forward through as I correct all of these and set up the other shape keys because you've already seen me do this last episode all right so I've got the shape Keys set up again and the armor is looking nice so going to be leaving off here for now until next time Cheers
