today is really about where the world wide web has come from it's hard to think of any invention since possibly the printing press that's actually had this sort of level of impact and influence but it didn't spring into being fully formed it was really a very very simple implementation of the vision that had been around for decades so simple in fact that when the the world wide web's first outing was a paper that was written and sent to the atm's annual hypertext conference and it was rejected on the grounds that something that simple surely couldn't be considered to be hypertext it was just a set of um documents and and pointers the roots of the worldwide web really go back a very long time and before modern digital computers even um back in the early part of the 20th century there was a scientist an engineer called vannevar bush who was an american scientist he made his name working on mechanical calculating machines and he rose to be tremendously eminent and during the second world war he became the director of the office of root scientific research and development was essentially the manager of all of the american government's research projects that included the nuclear bomb project and many many others he was really the first scientist to get to grips with a big modern bureaucracy and of course what he found was vast amounts of information flying around all over the place far more than any one person can keep in their heads and he looked upon that as a scientist as a problem to be solved and in in 1945 in the in the last few months of the war he wrote an extraordinarily influential paper that he called as we may think that was published in the atlantic monthly in it he addressed this issue of information and knowledge but thinking could we use machines to manage that and he speculated about a possible machine that he called a memex a memory extender which was basically an automated microfilm reader and it was intended for scientists um to use he said in the paper that maybe one day every scientist could have one of these machines on their desk and it would contain all the scientific literature published i mean everything that's the idea of of this he then started thinking about how you organize all of the scientific literature ever published and he started designing systems of links and trails and guides and such like and although the memex was never built i mean this was never something that became real the thinking behind it that machines could be used to do this were fantastically influential some decades later in the 1960s computers started to become mature enough to potentially be able to do this sort of thing and a number of really important pioneers of computing started thinking about this they were well aware of vanilla bush's work there was somebody called douglas engelbart douglas engelbart lays a very great claim to having invented our world he invented the mouse windowed user interfaces word processing email he was the recipient of the very first email video conferencing the list just goes on and on but maybe that could be another video but he was at stamford being funded by the government but when they his funding um came to an end xerox head hunted a lot of his team and so a lot of douglas engelbart's research team wound up in xerox park creating all the things that they created there in any case um douglas engelbart was very much influenced by vannevar bush and he speculated that you could design computer software that what he called augmentation systems and an augmentation system is something that augments human intellect basically it makes people smarter people it makes people better at doing the things that that they do and at the same sort of time from a very different background um there was somebody called ted nelson ted nelson was a writer really primarily a writer he came out of the world of movies his mother was an oscar-winning actress his father was an award-winning television director and ted was looking at this technology and vannevar bush's um thinking um to see how this could be used for literature and for literary purposes and one of his really important books that he wrote was in fact called literary machines and ted nelson invented the word hypertext and he designed back in the 1960s systems that in many ways have inspired the modern hypertext systems and the world wide web um his grand design was something he called project xanadu which was a software system that was never really finished in those days it's been worked on since and to some extent ted nelson is still working on it to this day the idea of project xanadu again as with memex it could store all of the world's writings and literature and it would do that in distributed servers it wouldn't be all in one place but there would be servers scattered all over the world that would communicate over networks and all of the material the content would be available and people could create new material and new content by quoting original sources and taking the original material and putting it into a new context but an interesting part of this is ted also envisaged a micro charging system so that the original content creators would actually get revenue from their material being quoted and put into new um context and there was also a layer of linking so as well as the the mechanisms of quotations you can link from one thing to something else which is relevant to something else xanadu was a fantastically complex and visionary design and it influenced a whole generation of computer scientists who were thinking about these sorts of things and then in the 1980s and up and up through the early 1990s there were a number of hypertext systems developed mostly in universities as some became commercial products there was a rather wonderful system called guide guide was it wasn't distributed it didn't communicate on networks but you would create a document a bit like an ms office document but it was a document designed to be delivered on a computer full of links and different ways of presenting him in information and guide was for what it was developed in the university of kent but it for a while was a commercial product and it was used for doing things like developing online manuals and training material and such like there was another system called microcosm which was developed in the university of southampton now this took the ideas of ted nelson and douglas engelbart but it embedded them rather than a piece of software it embedded them in the operating systems your entire operating system would become a hypermedia system and by the time that microcosm was around there was such thing as windows and you would install microcosm onto your computer and it would give windows itself all of this extra hypertext functionality of linking and and various sorts of things all of the software on your computer would then become a viewer into this microcosm world again at this sort of time in the um early 90s um the story which i'm sure most people are aware of is tim berners-lee and also a colleague of his robert caglio were working in cern the particle physics labs in geneva and they were interested in using this sort of approach the whole ideas of hypertext to help scientists share papers that they were working on that was the original intention of it and of course their project was the world wide web and that has changed the world spectacularly but the really interesting thing is why because the web wasn't the first hypertext system is that he said it has been around for many many years it wasn't um particularly innovative it wasn't the best system in that it had less functionality than many of these other systems the stroke of genius and it's the genius that really has changed the world is not in what it was but how it was utilized because all of these other systems were heavily protected when there were research projects if you wanted to use them you had to be a research collaborator and go and sign non-disclosure agreements and get involved in the research if they were commercial products they're often quite expensive you need to pay a lot of money to use these things whereas the attitude of tim berners-lee and what really created the web far more than anything technical was um this is simple this is free anybody can do anything they like with it and very quickly people wrote better web servers than the original web servers and better web browsers than the original web browser and started adding features to it the very first incarnations of the web very simple by modern standards they added graphics added all sorts of other facilities and it was that making it open to the world throwing it open to the world of geeks that is what has changed the world more than anything technical it's very difficult for a firewall or something to notice this because these are valid http requests they're just super slow right and um you know maybe i've just got a really bad internet connection maybe yeah um now this doesn't affect every web server it mostly affects apache
