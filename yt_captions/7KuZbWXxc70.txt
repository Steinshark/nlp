i have a confession to make i'm not this wiz kid 
kind of coder i've been working professionally as   a coder as a software developer now for almost 
five years from working at a startup focusing   on back end to working at a large corporation 
focusing on front-end leading a team of developers   becoming a senior developer so how did i get here 
if i'm not that great at coding well today i want   to sit down with you and i want to explain to you 
in this video what i mean with i'm not great at   coding it's not as simple as it might seem i know 
there are times where i'm still googling about   for loops or googling about different algorithms i 
think to myself you should know this what is going   on you teach others how to code you mentor others 
around coding what is going on also before we get   further into this video i want to say a huge 
thank you to speakly for sponsoring part of it   similar to learning coding languages or 
programming languages there is an art to   learning spoken languages and with speaking there 
are two founders of it both polygons who know   seven languages so they clearly have uncovered or 
unlocked what the technique is to learn languages   quickly with the speakly methodology it helps 
you learn languages five times faster compared   to what you're accustomed to which means getting 
from zero to solid speaking skills in around   three to four months and i know for myself when 
i download the app by the way it's available on   both android and ios i immediately went to german 
fun fact for those of you who don't know i am half   german swedish and started learning it was about 
30 minutes a day and i've been doing it now for   i would say the past three weeks and there are 
some improvements let's let's give it a little   test here let's try hello how are you hello hello 
hello how you doing oh gosh this is so it's so   stressful to meet on camera hello we gate is there 
what do you want to discuss now my favorite color   anyways back to speakly though it is this great 
app that offers everything you need to know   to learn a language learning a language 
is so important and it's a great way to   really have other skills or other skill sets that 
you can show off as well when you are interviewing   and it really shows that you're willing to 
learn new things take on new challenges and   with speakly it is the only language learning 
application that actually lets you choose   how you want to study new vocabulary and 
i think that's really important because   everyone learns so differently so 
maybe you focus on writing maybe   multiple choice or a combination i link them 
down below so make sure to go check them out and to get to this answer we need 
to go back a bit back back in time   back to the early days when i 
was first learning how to code and i'm going to take you on a little journey 
with me so i want you to sit down visualize   kind of my journey throughout coding to really 
get to what exactly i'm referring to let's go   all the way back to high school we're going way 
back now when i was in high school i'll be honest   with you i was not that great of a student i 
did not get great grades especially in math   and that's something that throughout my entire 
life i thought i needed to be a math with in order   to be a coder so i instantly wrote it off that 
you know if i don't have these math skills   coding is not for me however 
fast forward to university   ended up taking a very basic coding course like 
wow i can do this you don't need to be in math   quiz you need to have logic and problem solving 
skills but those two things they can be developed   so i ended up going to a coding bootcamp spent 
most of my time probably crying in the bathroom   having bad imposter syndrome but i learned a 
lot most importantly i learned how to learn   i think that's a skill that a lot of developers 
really need to achieve or adapt to is learning   how to learn and learning how they learn in a 
quick matter because we're often picking up new   technologies quickly but then i realized something 
after almost five years in this industry it took   me quite a while to understand this and realize 
this is everyone thinks they're bad at coding   it's not just me i'm not alone on this everyone 
who is actually a good coder or decent coder   thinks they're bad at coding but why is this 
why do some of the best coders out there   i'm definitely not one of the best coders out 
there but why do so many people think they are bad   at coding and they're not really that bad well i 
think it goes back to the fundamentals if you look   back at being a coder or coding you're constantly 
learning new things if you want to be a good coder   you're always going to be uncomfortable by 
learning new things put out of your comfort zone   uh learning new technologies otherwise you're 
going to be stagnant and yes you'll feel very   confident in your coding skills but are you 
actually that good of a coder if you're not   learning anything new that is a very interesting 
question and i truly think the answer to that is   you're not you have to be learning new things 
willing to get uncomfortable in order to be   a good coder because technology is changing 
so rapidly that we need to attempt and i say   attempt because it's impossible to keep up with 
it but i also think another thing when it comes to   coding and not being good at coding is if you want 
to be a really good coder there is so much more   to it than actually coding i have seen people 
who are brilliant at what they do they're very   technically skilled they can code 
anything they're they're coding wizards   but they lack other skills and if you want to be 
good at anything i really think you need to have   the entire package so you might be excellent 
at coding but does it make you a good coder   technically yes but does it make you a good 
software engineer or software developer   that is up for debate in my opinion i think 
you need to have more than just the coding   skills you need to have the personable skills 
are you willing to communicate are you willing   to work together in teams those are things 
that are often missed when you are coding   well that brings me to my next question i really 
want to address if you are someone who is learning   to code or maybe you're like myself and have 
been in the industry for a long time whatever   your case is if you're feeling like you are just 
this terrible programmer or terrible coder how do   you really shift your mindset from that because at 
a certain point it can become almost debilitating   where you completely freeze you don't actually 
learn anything new you question your skill set   you don't go for that interview or in some cases 
which i've been there you flop an interview just   because of your own you get in your own head and i 
think this question is really important to address   because i know so many of you have felt this way 
i mean the numbers and the data around imposter   syndrome and feeling like we don't belong or 
feeling like there isn't this place for us   unless we are these genius coders there's a lot 
of us out there and i think at the end of the day   you need to take a step back look at your skill 
set not just your coding skill set but your full   package are you showing up to work every day 
with a positive attitude no i'm not saying you   have to be you know this super peppy happy person 
every day but are you showing up to work giving   it your all are you coming up with different 
problems to solve or solving different problems   there's so much more to it and although coding 
is so important of course it's not the end-all   be-all in our jobs and i think we really need 
to recognize that you need to build beautiful   code that solves problems and all this 
other stuff but if you aren't doing that in   a team setting building together working together 
at the end of the day it's gonna be really lonely   so what are some signs that you actually are 
a bad coder and it's not impostor syndrome   i think throughout this video i speak about 
how it's okay to feel like you're a bad coder   or to question your skills but what if you 
actually are just a bad coder and you suck   at coding well i think there's different ways you 
can kind of identify this the number one thing is   that if you are coding and you're really 
hating it like dreading coding all the time   even if you are expert at coding but you hate 
it i would say you're a bad coder and let me   explain what i mean by that i mean that if you 
really are not passionate about something or   enjoy doing something naturally you won't excel 
at it or grow at it as quickly yes you might be   able to find it easy or uh get the fundamentals 
down but are you able to pick up new technology   quickly pick up new languages quickly maybe 
but if you have no passion or interest to do it   i would say it's a give and take there's a 
possibility you're just going to be a bad coder   now some things that don't make you a bad coder 
but we think make us a bad coder include failing   at interviews not being able to solve algorithms 
having to google everything i feel like one thing   i've googled my entire career and i will continue 
to google my entire career googling is a skill set   at this point hopefully over the years you 
learn to google better and smarter but it's   something that you will have to do all the time as 
a software developer and i really wanted to make   this video and talk about these feelings of oh i'm 
such a bad coder or i'm not that great at coding   because there's this mythical unicorn that exists 
in the tech world of this coder who is this whiz   kid genius who can solve anything very quickly 
doesn't need help from anyone sits in their   basement doesn't speak to anyone and yes although 
that does exist that is not what a good coder   full package really in my opinion looks like 
i think there's so much more to it than that   okay i'm gonna stop this video here but i hope you 
found it very valuable and insightful for anyone   who is struggling feeling like they're the worst 
coder we all think that and there are people who   are worse than you i promise you we got this we 
just need to recognize that it's a journey and   these feelings are totally normal and we just 
need to navigate them in the best way possible   also i'm curious this is one of my first 
videos where i'm doing this kind of style   moving around uh just kind of like i don't know 
do you like it are you into this style i feel   like it's more authentic and true to myself so let 
me know your feedback down below in the comments   thanks everyone back in my back flow we back 
again so highly just that back in my back flow   we back to change the climbing this that back in 
my back flow we bring the force like time yeah here
