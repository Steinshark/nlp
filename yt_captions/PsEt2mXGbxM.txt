this [ __ ] website and it's perfect seriously what the [ __ ] the else do you want you probably build websites and think your [ __ ] is special you think your 13 megabyte parallaxative home page is going to get some uh some [ __ ] uh award Banner you can glue to the top corner of your site and you think your 40 pound jQuery file and the 83 polyfills give ie7 a boner because it finally has box Shadow wrong I love you is this written by Samuel uh wrong [ __ ] let me describe your perfect ass website shit's lightweight and loads fast fits on your let's see fits on all your shitty screens looks the same in all your shitty browsers the [ __ ] accessible to every [ __ ] that visits your site shit's legible and gets you get to your [ __ ] point across if you add one instead of just five megabyte picks of hipsters drinking coffee you know what I'm liking it I'm liking it this is a ward material right here well guess what [ __ ] you are over designing look at this it's a [ __ ] website why the [ __ ] do you need to animate a [ __ ] trendy ass Banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of [ __ ] you spent hours on it and at 80 kilobytes uh to your [ __ ] website and some [ __ ] champion at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers we'll never see that [ __ ] this is just Samuel the dude I didn't realize Samuel was uh Samuel L was in a web was when it was inside design Theory this guy knows it through them sausage fingers them banana fingers they ain't touching nothing not to mention blind people will never see that [ __ ] but they don't see any of your of your shitty [ __ ] you never knew it but this is your perfect website here's why it's dude I can't even I feel like I can't keep cursing this much it's making me uncomfortable it's [ __ ] lightweight this entire page weighs less than the gradient mesh Facebook logo on your [ __ ] WordPress site did you seriously load a hundred kilobytes of jQuery UI just so you could animate the [ __ ] background color of a div you loaded all seven font faces of a shitty web font just so you could say hi at 100 pixels height at the beginning of your site you piece of [ __ ] [Applause] oh this is brutal oh man react in shambles right now it's responsive you dumbass you thought you needed media queries to be responsive but no responsive means that it responds to whatever the [ __ ] screen size it's viewed on the site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a [ __ ] Tamagotchi he's actually right this could literally work on a Tamagotchi it [ __ ] works look at this [ __ ] you can read it I'm literally reading it right now that is if you can read them uh if you if you can read [ __ ] oh my goodness what is this it makes sense it has [ __ ] hierarchy it's using HTML5 tag so you and your [ __ ] ass browser know what the [ __ ] in this [ __ ] site it's semantics what is this it has content on the [ __ ] screen your site has three bylines and a link to your dribble account but you spread it over seven full screens and make me click some Bobby button to show me how cool the jQuery scroll to plugin is cross browser compatibility load this [ __ ] to ie6 I [ __ ] dare you it's semantics this is a website look at it you've never seen one before like a man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is you have no [ __ ] idea what a website is all you've ever seen is shitty a skewomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communication a [ __ ] message this is a real naked website look at it it's [ __ ] beautiful this guy dude he's starting to remind me of like ICP it's [ __ ] beautiful yes this [ __ ] is [ __ ] satire you [ __ ] my goodness I can't stand cursing this much I'm not actually saying your shitty sight should look like this what I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are ones created ourselves websites aren't broken by default they are functional High performing and accessible you break them you son of a [ __ ] good design is a little design let's see is as little design as possible some German [ __ ] epilogue from the philosophies expressed poorly uh above tixty was created you should try it today to make your own [ __ ] website [Applause] Samuel Lyle Jackson everybody Samuel L Jackson uh thank you very much for this is actually there is a really amazing grain of Truth in all of this which is the problems we've created on web are truly problems we've created ourselves every single time see the strangest thing about the web in general is that in in yesteryears when technology or something was a problem typically we made something different right tried something new about it the web on the other hand it's like okay this is a problem so what if we take it and we add more to it and then a new problem happens okay what happens if we add more to it I personally believe this is why we have achieved react server components it is a series of what if we add more to it all the way through all the way 100 percent personal opinion um it's just it's a very interesting flaw it's just very interesting JavaScript I love it um well the problem is I I've been I've been using I've been using uh what's it called I've been using uh Firefox for a little bit it's horrible look at those peas and h3s and all that yes uh I know want to fight about it this is good I don't know if you caught that oh I can't zoom in how do I zoom in are you really serious you're not gonna let me zoom in are you serial are you serial either way this is beautiful console debugger uh where's the sources in this stuff how do you even use how do you how do you even use Firefox oh this is why you view Source instead of div tools yeah uh dude I never use Firefox and I hate it uh where's view source is view Source on here view selected source it's literally just a P tag thank you dude I hate you Firefox so effing much okay I hate you so much here's my non plug-in here's my non-plug-in version sources all right I just ignore Firefox analytics really you put analytics on it the goes and goes and does that and puts analytics on there that's what's happening you son of a [ __ ] you son of a [ __ ] how dare you do this I wish I could do a great Samuel L Jackson impersonation I feel like I could almost do it but I I I can't you know like have you ever heard this MF is that method s yeah exposed fraud dude if only there was react loaded honestly that would have been the funniest of them all is if react angular and view was all loaded just never used it would have been so dang good oh he left a little comment what is the comment oh yeah I know he says yeah you want to fight me about it yeah I mean he he is calling himself out about it I mean he is he knows you can do a Bill Burr though no that's that's just my natural voice you mad all right the name is the [ __ ] gen
