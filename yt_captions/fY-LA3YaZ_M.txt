way you poured the water. - They didn't see me
pour the water, though. - [Man] I'm actually freaking out. - Isn't it funny how some
people, when they freak out, they just say I'm freaking out? - I'm freaking out, I'm shaking. - See guys, this is why you should invest in Shop Mr. Beast merch. See how happy this guy is. Oh, he woke up! - Thanks for the dono. - What's it gonna take for
you to give me that ticket? That's it, $4,000. (all scream) - Pork sausage, Jake, you look

lot, we've been bad boys. Somebody spanked me. - Y'all don't know the
month that we've had. My husband had a heart attack. And we've been trying to make ends meet. - Wow, I don't even know what to say. Keep giving away my money. I'd rather not have money
