even with all the time given up to me now by lockdown there still isn't enough time it takes forever and it's a good job i'm semi retired from being a a part of the school of computer science at nottingham because honestly as a regular employee i could not justify the hours i've spent on my latest ultra fascinating project i refer you my dear watson to the strange case of dennis rich's missing thesis we all know who dennis is unix was invented by ken and dennis ken thompson dennis ritchie if you want to simplify things ken was sort of in charge of unix the operating system anything to do with creating c language facilities and c compilers because remember unix was one of the very first operating systems to be written in a specially invented high-level language called c and dennis was absolute whiz with the c compiler and he needed both them to do this so uh again many of you will know dennis because one of the best selling computer programming textbooks of all time is the c programming language by dennis ritchie and our good computer file colleague and friend brian kernighan there's some big gaps in our knowledge about dennis and i should remind you i think sadly he died in 2010 and has been must much missed in the 10 years or so since that but recently the computer history museum in the usa came up with a story which just amazed everybody people who knew him said yeah yeah he he went to harvard and i think he did an applied mathematics degree oh so of course he's that he was dr richie wasn't he he did a phd well the answer is he studied for a phd but it never properly got submitted examination panel was appointed they never met and the chm story basically says we don't totally feel happy about this story the cover story is that there was a standoff and that there was a need to submit a bound library copies of his thesis dennis objected to paying having to pay to have this done he thought he made enough sacrifices already presumably in keeping himself alive while he did his phd thesis it's worth saying his phd was a very theoretical one coming out of the maths department um perhaps not too surprising but he regarded his thesis as something to be got out of the way but he was far more interested in playing space wars and writing real c programs that were useful to help out ken his newfound friend you see i know you'll all say you know everybody don't name drop yes i have to confess i did meet dennis ritchie once it was in 1986 brian had been over to see me in the early 80s i paid a return visit to bell labs i had a very enjoyable lunch dennis ken brian and me in which ken regelled us with his story about if you were a qualified pilot you could get to fly a mig in russia if you played your cards right they were so short of foreign currency foreign exchange in that time any gimmick that brought in tons of dollars you say was absolutely fine so yes i did meet dennis just that once and uh it's totally charming guy it takes one to spot one he's a computer scientist and so was ken they were so similar to each other but so different you know they uh they had this wicked way of answering exactly what you'd asked not what you wish you'd asked ken didn't get a phd but he did get he did enroll for a masters i think at berkeley and got that so he was known about but everybody just assumed that dennis must have got his phd from harvard there were no hitches turns out there were and bell labs were not pleased to find that this person they'd appointed who they knew was good they they chased after him as solidly as they chased after ken i think they were they were tipped off how good he was but to find suddenly i think somebody from bell labs wrote harvard and said what is going on when will uh mr richie get his phd and got back the frostiest reply you will ever see effectively saying we have no plans nor are we likely to have any plans to give mr richie a phd thesis he had upset somebody mightily and neither i nor brian nor his brother bill still we don't know the true story maybe we never will 1967 was a long time ago even for me even for me just think of that i was only 23. oh it's like back into jurassic you know and just to put things absolutely clear what would have been available to dennis for his output medium for his thesis really something like a clattery model 37 teletype will be coming available they had a fixed character set you couldn't sort of extend it in any way but they were very good i mean you could have a a teletype plugged in they were used in stock exchanges so they were a common currency so you could plug a teletype into your computer so this thesis does exist then it did exist you see his sister lynn who i think died two three years ago was very fond of her brother looked after him carefully she had a copy of his finally submitted thesis one of his fellow phd students also from harvard albert meyer quite a name in theoretical computer science but of course again now he'll have retired he had one and the other one if you like was dennis's own working copy which eventually got submitted or was about to be submitted normally at this period what you would do was handwrite all your great thoughts and hand it to a typist the idea of being able to do it on a computer and with computer assistance was at its very very infancy we have a copy here of what it was like could have been submitted it didn't get submitted but dennis decided quite rightly that a teletype terminal wasn't powerful enough because it didn't have enough characters so if you're going to either hand type it or typeset it from a peripheral stuck into a computer what were your options well your options were either an ultra expensive very early photo type setter font characters as photos on a film strip so your a to z were 26 different little bits of film probably wrapped around a drum that you could illuminate from behind massively massively expensive even bell labs hadn't invested in one of those at the time although a few years later they did no if you come back from those rarified heights you could type it by hand and if it was an old-fashioned typewriter you had special characters on little things that look like nail varnish sticks that you put into the throat of the typewriter and you hit any key and it was like a sort of relayed impact that alpha character was actually typed i or something any character would do and it hit the back of this special gadget and you got at the right place the letter alpha but going beyond that because that was a pain ibm came up with the idea of a golf ball typewriter this is the best thing that's happened to typing since electricity the ibm's electric typewriter they are miraculous things unbelievable what they did was that instead of having 26 different dipsticks for weird characters they would put put them on let's say a greek character's golf ball for special purposes you take out your regular golf ball you plug in a greek character's one when you look at the way that they embedded those metal characters onto the surface of a sphere in such a way that if the sphere rocked ever so slightly another row of characters became as it were normal to the paper and could be hit in a tight right you can have little arms with a metal kind of thing that gets at the end and they all end up in the neck or the throat or whatever it's called and on a conventional typewriter you move the sheet around with a selectric you only move the sheet for line feeds forward and back you didn't move the sheet for horizontal motion this unbelievable cradle with a golf ball in it going seemingly at the speed of sound was leaping all over left and right putting in characters it is an electromechanical marvel of the first order and did not come cheap it cost as much well the story at the time was those of you on the far side of the atlantic can translate it's better than me it cost as much as a buick now a buick is a not an utterly luxurious saloon i don't think but it's not cheap and it certainly wasn't cheap in those days so it cost as much as a medium-sized saloon car just for this output device and dennis having been taken on by bell labs as the bright new lad actually conned them into letting him have an online version of one of these devices it's called a 2741 and a dedicated line that had a monthly rental at eye watering prices just so that as well as working for bell labs in his new job he could also have a golf ball machine down there where he did experiments in how to type set his thesis properly and brother bill will point to his website age nine years old at the time was just in awe of dennis sitting in their basement in the richie family house then it's rented the basement just swapping golf balls and messing about with this thing in one corner of the basement from what i understand but even so how did he in the end manage 180 pages of thesis with changes of characters all over the place because we're talking about uh typesetting equations here aren't we as much yes i probably better turn our attention to this one i think which is pretty horrifying i mean when you look at it there are the obvious alphabetic characters there but at the moment inked in is a greek row or is it a p symbol in dennis's own handwriting and just the sheer density of this stuff one on top of another a funny thing there which is a monas operator so this is horrifying to contemplate is how many golf ball changes would you need to typeset that page because what you've got to do is do all the easy stuff and there isn't much easy stuff here set it back in a sense to a home position and put the paper back in again in other words if it's on track to feed make sure you get back to exactly the right style position then go through it waving the golf ball around on its carriage and then deciding ah i'm needed there let's type one character there so you might end up having to do multi-pass processing on just about every page depending on complexity now some of you may remember we did actually you may not even recognize it as a comparable exercise about six or seven years ago we did a thing about the vacation memo it was a 13-page memo of the fights they'd had with mergan tala and with the hardware to get everything working but they succeeded in the end we effectively want to do for dennis's thesis what we did in rescuing the vacation memo the trouble is it's not only ten times longer is this thesis it's also easily ten times harder to do because his material is so complex the stuff on the 202 we were rescued by the fact that fonts carried on beyond the 202 into the great new world of adobe type 1 true type fonts open type fonts for those of you introducing there are standards you can miss out all the stuff in the middle take a flying leap into the world of fonts and things become easier fortunately how do we make our flying leap here here is a font if you care to call it that which basically exists on a golf ball on a time writer not a traditional conveyance mechanism for what a typographer we'll call a real font nevertheless our good friend chuck bigelow typographer giant of the lucida typeface family in advising us said i'll have a look around and see if somebody has seen fit to turn the selectrix font into what we would call a proper font and he found for us from the bitstream foundry a font which i think is called piker10 and it's pretty darn close to what a standard selectric golf ball has gone but unfortunately nobody did the exotic symbols and the thing about the main running text is that because it came off a typewriter it's what's called fixed pitch maybe a lot of you don't realize this but if you have a fixed pitch typewriter have you ever noticed that the problem is that the letter i looks very lonely because there has to be a lot of space on either side of it the fixed pitch of these characters is 602 one thousandth of an inch okay for ordinary alphabets but when you get extended characters like a greek alpha which has got a floppy head and a floppy tail they don't look very good fixed pitch you have to redesign them but they look all constrained and not their usual florid self there are have i have been no fixed pitch redrawings as far as we can find into a font of the greek cymbal ball it's it's a minority interest so i've had to do my best in rescuing dennis's thesis on work is ongoing or take quite some time here to say well we'll have to use a variable pitched typewriter-like font for the exotic symbols so for example the uh alpha symbol in greek requires variable pitch 890 1 000 not 602 and if you start to say come on bro stop being lazy just take the variable pitched font and using your innate skills oh no squash it down into being a fixed pitch version of it it's hard if you don't believe me read my semi rant back in the vacation memo paper it took me something like between 120 and 150 hours to create a font called print out and the results look rubbish unless you have artistic innate capability which i don't it means that my lines on the rebuild are sometimes a bit longer than dennis's because i'm having to use quite a few variable pitch characters that are inevitably they look more elegant but they're longer than they would be in the fixed pitch version so under my left finger is the stuff that dennis left his display equations swapping over quickly here using the bit stream pika 10 font is my attempted rebuild of the same material i'm still working on it but can you see the pie symbol there looks better there's all sorts of things for those of you saying well how are you producing it i've allowed myself the anachronism of going five years later in bell labs history anybody who's into ancient units would say that was yelling out for eqn and t roth why didn't dennis use them they hadn't been invented his thesis was in 1967 equine and t-rove weren't there until 1972 and it's got superscript and subsequent positions and you must respect those because those affect the meaning of the equations he was five years ahead of his time and lord knows how he did it but in following him may we be forgiven we're giving ourselves five years benefit and considering ourselves that had dennis done his thesis five years later he would have used these tools so we have used eqn to set these equations feeding into the device independent version of t roth because stylistically and date wise they are earlier than things like tech and latex by a bit so this seemed to us to be the best reproduction compromise scene looks very very similar so if the robot is actually here it would say that i might be here i might be here or i might be here and we do represent like that let's be clear in all of this work that i shall be doing now with disks and stacks
