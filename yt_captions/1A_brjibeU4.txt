the heavyweight Clash we have all been waiting for It Was Written in the Stars Hikaru versus Fabiano all the pairings were out before the event was made but who knew that going into the final game Hikaru trailed Fabiano by one win now you may ask yourself how is he two and a half points behind him well if you're new to this tournament we did soccer or football scoring so a win is three points if Hikaru wins this game he closes the gap of two and a half and he takes the lead and there's no more playing time this is the three-point shot at the buzzer here we go he Karu sits down plays the move E4 probably put on some manscape by the way before he went downstairs E4 Knight F3 Knight C6 Hikaru goes for an Italian okay Hikaru likes to play the Spanish he's also very good at the Italian and already actually a minor surprise very small surprise Fabiano caruana plays the Petrov defense he plays this on the second move like it is his bread it is his butter it is his water it's his Gatorade it's whatever he drinks Prime hydration whatever he drinks he plays the Petra of Defense he does not play the Stafford Gambit although I'm sure he's well versed this is normally what he does but he has played Knight C6 two times now against Hikaru they had a game in the candidates Hikaru played this now Hikaru goes to play the Italian which which is a bold move by the way to play the Italian against the Italian I mean seriously Fabi plays Knight F6 Fabi also can play Bishop C5 these are the two main lines but currently the modern main line is Knight F6 D3 and the players just do some stuff the players hold hands walk along the canals of Venice the players hold hands they go shopping in Milan the players hold hands they go they go to the university and Turin like that's what happens in the Italian Hikaru takes all of that and at this point stands up and flips the table at Fabiano and plays Knight G5 that's a crazy move Hikaru is going for the fried liver Hikaru is playing a fried liver he is looking for Knight takes F7 with a fork on these two pieces against Fabiano caruana in the last round of the tournament to win now the fried liver is very forcing nobody blunders anything at that level of Chess but they do get very sharp lines and they have to know what they are doing black plays the move D5 Fabiano missing an opportunity to play for the Traxler counter attack by the way can you imagine how gangster that would have been if Fabi pulled up with the Traxler that would have been so cool if Fabi just played like Bishop takes F2 King F1 and and played Queen E7 I mean that would have been unbelievable but Fabi plays the classical main line which is the move D5 and now rather than taking on D5 Fabi plays Knight A5 you will notice that from the time span Fabiano is not surprised he knows exactly what's going on now uh if white does nothing black is just going to take the pawn back in the center and then he's gonna castle and he's going to be in good shape so he plays Bishop B5 check which is all Theory black plays C6 now we have Pawn takes Pawn takes and basically black is like excuse me white is like well I want a pawn so now it's time to bring my Bishop back now here there's several moves there's Bishop E2 there's Bishop D3 and there's Queen F3 right Queen F3 uh if C takes B5 is played white picks up the rook and even this position is actually playable it's very very sharp and very complicated uh particularly for the faint of heart but Hikaru just goes back to D3 He thinks for some eight seconds and you know most of that was probably spent writing a move and now Bishop to D3 and from this point there is a lot of different Theory um black is a pawn down white has an extra Pawn but kind of blocking his own development so white is gonna have to develop in very deviant and non-traditional manners in order to actually capitalize on that pawn Advantage Fabi plays Knight D5 spend some 30 seconds he puts his Knight in the center The Queen Is Now attacking the Knight and the Knight is going to venture over here potentially to take the bishop Hikaru brings the Knight back to F3 nobody has thought this has all been played before chess is solved it's stupid it's just all memory there's no skill involved plus L plus ratio Bishop D6 from Fabi Hikaru castles all right so far so good Hikaru is a pawn up at some point black will play Knight F4 at some point Blackwell Castle Bobby plays Knight F4 right now Bobby is looking to get the bishop on D3 right away S Knight C3 so here's the thing why does being threatened with a very ugly damaging of his position but there is nothing he can do if white plays the move Bishop E4 it just gets worse because black plays F5 then after you play Bishop D3 I can still do the exact same thing but now I'm also forking you which is very unpleasant so you really don't have much of a choice here essentially what white has to do is absorb the damage to his structure and catch up in development with the move Knight C3 Fabi takes and Fabi castles okay you'll notice Fabi spent a little bit of time here he was just remembering his lines I think he was contemplating just castling but he chooses to damage white structure indeed and then castles his King and Hikaru plays B3 basically instantly now there are several moves in this position for white all of which the computer deems as equal white can play rookie one targeting the pawn on E5 uh black can defend the pawn and black can also completely ignore and play C5 and just try to open up the Bishops this way very very sharp stuff something like 95 but should be seven black is two pawns down but has very violent intentions for white Hikaru plays B3 okay B3 is a very simple move white wants to develop the bishop on this diagonal that's it at some point he also would like to move the Knight somewhere there targeting the squares targeting the bishop and here Fabi spends another several minutes and just develops his Rook Fabi can play rookie eight he can play Bishop A6 attacking this he can play C5 he plays the move rookie 8 and Hikaru plays rookie one nothing complicated about this position here for the first time in a while Fabi spent time he played C5 after spending 14 minutes again there is a lot of stuff that black can do here and the thing is why playing the fried liver is genius at this level it it's it's it's it's a genius opening to play when the person has no idea that it's coming not because it's going to win you the game not because Hikaru is going to win fabi's Queen and rook and Checkmate him in eight moves like it's possible in the fried liver it's because yes Fabi could have reviewed the lines recently yes Fabi can know some of the computer lines but he does not have as deep of an experience in some of these lines as he might otherwise and especially if Hikaru has just spent hours looking at these lines and reviewing and kind of digging up new ideas this is how chess has played at the highest level you show up to a game with a new idea rookie one and now C5 so Fabi could have played F6 he could have played uh he could have played Bishop A6 uh a move like F5 looks nice and aggressive also potential right um but he played C5 good thing about C5 completely clamps the dark squares bad thing about C5 could very well be a Target you are clamping the dark squares but you could just succumb to the pressure of the white position Knight E4 Bishop A3 Rook C1 all coming that pawn is just a Sitting Duck Hikaru plays Bishop A3 okay Hikaru also could have played Knight E4 targeting some pieces here all right and against Knight E4 maybe you do things slightly differently there is Bishop f8 maybe there's 96 maybe you play Bishop f8 right away and you try to play for F5 and we can get to the exact same position um for example in this position uh if you play Bishop A3 targeting this Pawn black doesn't even have to defend it black and actually just play the move Knight C6 because he has counter play on The Pawn on D3 that stupid Pawn that he helped create several moves ago so that happens Hikaru plays Bishop A3 Fabi plays Knight back to C6 and gets to this position and now we have Rook C1 however at this point self-doubt had set in and I think Fabi must have thought something went a little wrong because right around here he was seen on camera kind of talking to himself just I mean that's what it looked like I I it seemed like there was some clip and he was just sort of sitting there cutting hikaru's not in front of him because that would have been a bad you know game plan giveaway it was clearly something upsetting him and for Fabiano to spend 14 minutes to push this Pawn maybe he was mixing up some lines he was remembering something he was supposed to do maybe C5 was completely fine but when you're down some 20 minutes on the clock you know and you get to a situation and you're unhappy you're gonna do something a little drastic you're gonna do something a little bit out of character and in this position it is absolutely true black cannot defend this Pawn I just said that but what black has done here in every game that has reached this position is black has played Knight to B4 the idea being to get the pawn out of danger if white takes and if white takes on C5 then black has Bishop takes Rook takes and this Fork clearly Fabiano did not like something about the move Knight before it already could have been that he thought that he messed something up it already could have been that I don't know what he didn't like about the move Knight before Fabiano caruana saw the move Knight before but he didn't like it and instead he played F5 and he played it pretty quickly because this is what he set out to do the move F5 is forcing white to take the pawn that's what it's doing and he does Hikaru is now up two Pawns and Bobby is fighting back he centralizes his Queen okay Fabi has good pressure on the position right pin Knight maybe white has some Target here maybe black is going to play E4 Hikaru does something like every person should do when they're winning by material Queen C2 the idea of Queen C2 is he wants to play Queen C4 he just wants to trade the Queens there's a king there there's a queen there and there's really not any way black can avoid this if black tries to play King h8 and get off the line I'm still going Queen C4 and if you really try to avoid I play Knight G5 and then I win the game so Fabi plays Rook d8 Bobby plays rook d8 and queen D5 he spent 30 something minutes on Queen D5 the move F5 was played fobby knew Knight C5 was gonna happen okay he then spent 30 minutes coming up with his next move that's a bad sign Queen C2 Queen C4 Hikaru trades the queen C Carlos just up two Pawns Hikaru can breathe easy he is two pawns up he wins this game he wins Norway chess he wins 700 something thousand Norwegian Corona which is something like 75 000 USD Hikaru brings the other Rook Hikaru slides the bishop back targeting the center Pawn Hikaru brings The Rook out of danger from the light score bishop and Hikaru plays D4 if Hikaru can get rid of literally the only bad thing about his position that's it it's a home stretch it's when you take the exit off the highway that's an American reference people out around the world don't drive as much it's when you're on that last like you turn on the bicycle and it's right there home is right there Pawn takes Knight takes Fabiano fighting back with his apron Hikaru dances back Bobby's got nothing he has absolutely nothing he has some light squares with Bishop A6 Hikaru is now going to trade the Bishops the more pieces that get traded the closer and closer we get to the loss of Fabiano caruana Hikaru goes back to A4 and now Here Comes The Rook he is forcing an exchange and the bad thing for Fabi is his pawns are in decent shape but they are split night before The Rook slides confident at some point Hikaru is going to play H4 to avoid getting back rank mated Hikaru was also completely unafraid of getting a damage to his structure he's two pawns up it's Rook Knight 6 versus Rook Knight four you're not gonna win this you're not gonna win this he's going to get to that pawn he's going to push his two on zero rookie eight Bobby does this now kikaru is going for the F Pawn Fabi defense Hikaru centralizing his Knight puts the Knight on C4 activates the king from the back rank so there's no more problems and now it's a delicate dance it's a very very very delicate configuration of the pieces Rook into D6 there goes the Knight to D5 Knight C7 Galloping in Knight comes back to attack The Rook on a f8 pawn to F4 H5 taking away all of the oxygen from the black pieces Hikaru marches down the board and on move 55 with Rook d8 with D5 with the Knight coming in with the F Pawn marching with the King approaching as well Fabiano caruana resigned and Hikaru wins on demand he wins Norway chess 2023. he is now officially no more races number two in the world on the classical chess rating list damn Fabiano caruana drops us number two in Norway chess crazy he led from wire to wire a buzzer beater shot from Hikaru wins him the tournament my friends we need a little update on Magnus Carlson Magnus has not won a game in classical chess in this tournament if he does not win this game it will be the first time in 16 years Magnus has played a classical chess tournament and not won a game I don't know the last time he played a classical chess tournament and didn't win a game and lost the game meaning he finished on a score of -1 he's playing with the white pieces against norger back Abdul sotorov by the way I just called this out the Petrov defense I thought Fabi was gonna play it right big updates Hikaru absolute gangster but we gotta figure out what's going on with Magnus he plays D3 and now D4 it's a symmetrical excuse me it's a symmetrical structure and we see him grab the bishop grab the bishop play C3 load your back wastes no time at all fighting straight back you see if not your back doesn't move that pawn if not direct I don't know play something like Knight D7 probably white is going to play this move F4 it's a very very instructive positional move because what this move does is it creates a backwards Pawn a backwards Pawn is a pawn whose neighbors have abandoned it they've moved forward and the square in front of that pawn is occupied so that pawn is a target so instead of getting a backwards Pawn created noisier back plays E5 And Trades into this position in this position white has the most microscopic of advantages the tiniest of edges but that is all Magnus will need to get his first win of the tournament at long last Knight to D2 Knight D7 he targets the bishop on E5 Pawn to G3 very nice move blunting the bishop I was gonna bring his Rook he's gonna activate his Bishop life is going to be good good pressure down the center lines here comes the goat nice little King G2 just an improving move harmonious piece play here A4 magnum's trying to instigate all right if that pawn gets uh gets over here it could be a little bit of an issue B4 Knight T4 all this nice stuff targeting the Pawns of course if black takes that's positional insanity and uh if if the white Pawn even gets the A6 it could be a problem in a lot of end games that A7 Pawn not your back just unafraid A5 A5 Magnus you're not gonna get anything you want to push over good luck A4 A5 Rook B1 you're trying to play B4 no problem Knight G4 putting all your pieces over there but look at my Knights look at this my horse is standing nice and confident knowing your back is not backing down from Magnus he's not backing down at all but magnus's Magnus is Magnus he's gonna he's gonna bring the magic about getting counter aggressive over here but this is very easy because now you play Bishop C1 and you're gonna kick the knights out you're gonna play C4 and here it comes look at the beautiful piece coordination of the white pieces rookie won Incredible stuff everything defended you're gonna kick all of these pieces out and it's going to be an avalanche right back all right now the Rooks are traded B3 kicks the night out of the position Here Comes H4 there we go here comes Magnus with H5 on the way this is it this is what we've been waiting for the entire game the Bishops are gonna punish the black position if you take on H5 I jump in here with my knight it's a massive migraine nods are back however completely ignoring all of magnus's transgressions and just plays Bishop A7 and says what about the night in the center yeah you can isolate all the weaknesses you want Magnus but now you gotta get the king out of the way I take and now nod your back fired back a Savage brilliant defensive move from the young man from Uzbekistan Knight to G4 brutal he sacrifices the Knight to zip in here with the Rook norgerbeck takes over the ship and says look at me I'm the captain now this is all it takes if you take on G6 you get into the position with rookie to check King to G1 King G7 the brilliant counter-attacking movies not rushing in with 93 or anything FG King G6 and despite being a pawn down nod your back correctly evaluates that he is a pawn down but Magnus is down a king his King is paralyzed it does not have access to some 60 squares the King right now can go to three squares on a board of 64 squares that's not very good Bishop F4 noji back plays B5 now Nordic is about to create a pass Pawn of his own Rook C2 Rook C3 and my friends I've got bad news I've got good news but I've also got some bad news is going to hold this position with ease against the greatest end game player of all time that could be bad news or good news however you want to interpret it the craziest thing is Magnus went on to lose the Armageddon Aiden lose the arm again but he drew he was unable to beat nadir back in the Armageddon game for the first time since 2007. according to tarya Svenson Norwegian journalist uh if since then he's made an updated post I do apologize that is what I saw on Twitter Magnus has finished the classical chess tournament without a victory in slow games well that's what classical chess is that's crazy right now in classical chess in particular Hikaru and Magnus were on on different you know like they were some sums up and and uh and this is not the end by the way we had one I got a game for dessert some of you are here right now I really appreciate having a couple of video videos ago you said and they put the timestamp you said I'm still watching if you're still watching I got a little dessert game for you the underdog of the tournament my friends give me like two three minutes all right you can last that long uh the underdog of the tournament Aryan tari Norway's number two he is always invited to this tournament as an opportunity for him to get to bet to play the best players in the world it's called Norway chess after all it would be a crime if they didn't invite some of the best players of Norway that are not named Magnus Carlson they invite Ari antari every year some years he has great great results he has struggled this year until today orientari playing The Perennial 2800 Superstar the greatest Talent we have ever seen in chess since a guy named Magnus Carlson tari starts out with a sister well fairuzia starts out with a sicilian tari plays Bishop B5 check Bishop D3 and in every game that tari plays he's doing very well in the opening he's very well prepared his openings are very good for for user to try to win this game he's gonna have to try to take some risk look at this Pleasant position that white has Perugia starts maneuvering brings this Knight back into the center tari's setting up some nasty intentions with active pieces a lot of tension in the center of the board he pushes ferruges Knights back G6 perusa Maneuvers the Knight into the wide position here comes the queen here comes the bishop and a crescendo strikes on the 28th move of this game as right here Ali Reza farusha sacrifices the night on G2 ferrugia has come to collect it is the underdog of the tournament aryantari up against the most fiery ferocious attacker of the modern generation he's young he's got plenty of energy Bishop takes G5 Queen G5 this is looking like bad news and it looks like orientare will succumb to the calculation skills of the Phenom ferrugia but Aryan tari had a trick up his sleeve in this position he played Knight to H3 this move hits the Queen the queen can't move anywhere and defend the knight at the same time so Knight E3 check discovery on the on the king and the Knight is hanging the queen is hanging there Knight takes Queen Knight takes Queen now here orientare plays what's called a Desperado if he takes the Knight he's gonna lose his Knight so before he takes the night he sacrifices his night on the way out Knight takes F7 all right Knight takes F7 he's gonna get a pawn get to this position and the players will likely be headed for an end game that will end in a draw in this position Ali Reza would not have it the Knight arrived here it was looking to take it was looking to take and alireza did something that I absolutely do not understand he kept his Knight alive at the cost of a crucial Pawn a crucial Pawn in his position this is a massive massive gamble that pawn will collapse the black position if black is not careful Rook f8 White's Rook targets tonight the Knight gallops out and all of a sudden ariantari is beating up the soft spots of the black position he trades off the only active piece that black has the Knight is a beast staring at the bishop the bishop now has to go look at this gangster Pawn chain Rook C2 oh my goodness alireza has to seal the door shot and start bringing his King Aryan just plays Knight B3 he's broken in Rook is getting in here there is nothing black can do Rook C7 on the board Knight C8 check Ponte oh my goodness oh my goodness orientari might actually pull this thing off Perugia plays Rook F6 orientation gallops to A7 Knight C6 Bishop D5 Bishop E6 all sorts of net Rook C8 is mate Rook C ate his mates hmm deruja has lost his Bishop Arusha comes in but Knight C8 check Rook takes a6's check the bishop seals the connection between the rook and the Knight ariantari Against All Odds and overzealous firuja H4 check he resigns because of an absolutely ridiculous threat the threat is Rook F5 and Bishop F7 mates and in this position after Rook to F6 Oliver resigned and orientari just defeated a 27-86 fide rated player to get a win before the tournament is up how's that for a little bit of dessert my friends the final standings are as follows your champion of Norway chess 2023 Hikaru Nakamura with 16 and a half winning on demand Fabiano caruana with 16 points dama Raju gukesh D clean third place finish what a beast that man is soon to be the number one ranked player in India and Magnus Carlson six out of ten what comes next for all of these players as they compete there will be more online rapid but what is going to happen in the next classical chess event I'm not sure we're getting one from icaro we're probably gonna get one from Magnus but Norway chess 2023 is over Hikaru and Magnus were in different directions in this tournament congratulations to Hikaru we'll see what's next for Magnus huge win by Aryan looking at gukesh's Rising career now get out of here
