ten thousand dollars of plastic chips ow not to mention the 2500 special box to look at them in 20 grand worth of mannequins looking good bro everyone here seems to want a mac literally thousands of dollars of neodymium magnets nine thousand dollars in network gear a small apartment for some reason expensive edition pillow anyone you've undoubtedly heard me mention lttstore.com but what you might not know is that we've got a dedicated facility with over a dozen staff who work here which means that this place is an absolute freaking cash sink which is why i'm extremely grateful to sponsors like robo rock for sending over their s7 max v ultra this bad boy does dirt it does mopping it automatically switches between them and even docks itself the ultra model that is anyway empties out its dirty water empties out its solid waste refills its water tank it's freaking amazing and you know who cleans up every other mess around here let's start in customer care we've got adam there and i'm filling in for nolan these guys care so much about answering your support tickets as fast as possible that they've got 300 hertz displays why do you guys need gaming laptops of course you guys didn't tune in to see the stuff we already made let's leak some stuff we're working on an obvious one is socks and sandals so what you're looking at here is basically every prototype ltt sock that we've ever brought in the problem is that while many of these are pretty good and some are really good none of them are as good as my daily drivers from darn tough so until we can match this level of quality we just aren't going to do it as for the sandals the cost of doing the plastic molds for all the different sizes is going to be astronomical so it's a project we keep kind of kicking down the road here's why this hoodie was delayed for about a year see the gradient here from up close it looks like absolute dog by comparison here's what the final one ended up looking like it's a much smoother gradient oh this is cool i'll be able to give more details later but in a nutshell this is a modular acoustic panel system that promises to offer a balance between the cost of diy and the convenience of like a pre-done commercial kit supposed to just kind of snap together and there's going to be all different shapes but first fashion unfortunately bridget our senior designer is not in today but that's okay matthew's here he's actually working on some baseball cap concepts a lot of what you're gonna see in this corner of the office is gonna be at very very early stages of development a reversible bomber jacket why reversible you might ask because who wouldn't want to wear an interlocked ltt logo bomber jacket see it says ltt all over it that was a matthew innovation [Music] there's lots more going on here too we've got the super comfy pajama pants the retro inspired polar fleece we've got the tech pants we've got the 3d down printed jacket thing this thing is so freaking warm swim trunks lots more colors of our plaid flannels that have gotten such amazing reviews and my personal favorite that matthew is working on right now where is this one oh yeah we're doing a tracksuit this we've leaked before but we've got a second round of samples of what will be the wag hoodie they're not going to be cheap because they're actually built to the same standard as the regular man hoodie but they'll definitely be stylish we don't have air conditioning in this building yet they quoted me a hundred grand to do this place it's only four thousand square feet so i go back to them like hey why are you quoting ducted ac why don't you quote mini splits and they come back and it's like a quarter it's madness what are you working on oh i don't think we're talking about this right no we don't talk about that wait we have a full-size run of wag hoodie yeah i didn't know we were that close on this and finally we're restocking our classic colors of the ltt underwear we have ended up switching suppliers for these i think four or five times whether it's come down to print quality factory conditions supply lead i don't i don't know what all the different reasons have been but it's been really frustrating and we are finally ready to go again with something that meets our standards so yay in here is the archive this is where you'll find one of pretty much everything so if we ever had to dig up an old garment some of the samples that we bought from other companies just for inspiration or for competitive testing for example this is one of all of our original run of our colored tees that way we have something to compare against if we get a subsequent order and the color or the materials or whatever else is way off obviously with such treasures as the last remaining brand new lambo edition beanies in here security is a big priority so massive shout out ubiquity unparalleled image quality the app's amazing they're all poe so you just have to run a network cable to wherever you go they have ai detection for people and events which actually ties perfectly into our sponsor robo rock also uses machine learning for their reactive ai 2.0 obstacle avoidance they've got cameras for out in front and they can recognize and avoid up to 27 types of obstacles so there's no need to pick up hazards off your floor which is good because our floors full of lots of hazards like all these 40 oz water bottles and this giant tv it's got five different suction modes including up to 5100 pascal suction so it'll pick up just about anything you throw at it and their viberized mopping system scrubs your floor rather than just vacuuming this place has a whopping three bathrooms this bathroom has a toilet right here behind the door and then you've got a door out to engineering on this side sup engineering nice nickname thanks it's a liao original the 90's you got a lot of smart comments for someone who hasn't launched a product in the 18 months he's worked here oh here they are the first we thought they were golden samples but then we actually found one last problem that is now fixed because of community feedback we will be launching it in both silver and black shaft variants by the way and it will be available in orange black and black black colorways so a little something like that the reality is when you want to not just match but beat respected experienced tool manufacturers like these guys it's just a non-trivial task we've got the back force oh so good it's so light we've got the sound great but getting that tactile click on the selector that's taken some doing it's the little details that matter okay what's he got in here 3d printed early handle designs there's going to be a whole video about this whole thing last taiwan ratchet because we had that whole thing where our supplier for the ratchets got bought by don't put that in please to all the people who think that we supposedly just still screened our logo onto a megapro driver here's a megapro driver here's ours does that look like the same driver no i didn't think so there's a big difference between licensing someone's patent and putting your logo on their product ooh the network closet man one of the coolest projects we did for the build out here was their air fiber internet connection they're connected to the main office which is about 50 paces that way by a dish that comes into this switch set up right here also from ubiquity and then is distributed to the entire building have you guys had so much as a hiccup in your internet connectivity yes what are the sfp connections yeah from these uh i mean other than that one other than that one no but like every time those decide to flip an update we lose internet for five minutes oh really it happens in the middle of a freaking day have you told jake i'm sure that can be yeah oh yes if you didn't get software updates you'd be crying there's no software in the middle of the workday i mean he says he's working but have they shipped a product yet i mean do you want do you want just your driver not where you want to put it right now probably you hit all your stuff yeah it's all over there potentially a super open gaming mouse this is kind of an early concept for what the ergonomics might be like you can see it's 3d printed our intention would be to release all the schematics so you could actually 3d print your own enclosure for it if you really wanted but with high-end hardware and we mean high-end thousand hertz pulling we'll get there we're at like 700 now right we're at 700 over bluetooth ish and a thousand over usb still some work to do but we also want to make it so that you can easily swap out the switches it should basically be the last mouse we can't call it don't put that in oh my god there's been so many revisions of the acoustic panels oh yeah good gravy hexagons i think that we're pretty settled on this snap together mechanism that you came up with yeah so it'll clip together and clip apart you don't need any tools to build it oh and this is another tynan project which is a lot more difficult than you might think okay this is so close to launch only one small problem if you want to launch a children's product there's all these certifications and stuff that you have to go through basically there's this small parts cylinder test fixture thing and you have to make sure that nothing fits in there because that determines whether it's a choking hazard and then there's the like the paints and varnishes that you use but it'll be a while before it sees the light of day it's not just kyle the whole engineering department actually hasn't launched a product yet what do you got jacob would you believe this man spent weeks of his life learning the optimal ways to position magnets for maximum grab force i actually have the simulation up on my computer right now do you really uh yeah the geometry is basically rotationally symmetric you can distill three-dimensional physics down to two-dimensional stuff so here i've got a cross-section of the magnet and you can imagine that if we were to take the rotator really was a ton of work that he put into this whole make them as strong as possible thing but i think it paid off i mean not yet because they haven't shipped a product yet but do you have anything else going on all right we have the joystick lock can you give me an old prototype that doesn't work very well uh just about anything basically we identified a problem and the problem is that joysticks like die if you're transporting them they're very likely to end up kind of mashed against something in your bag or whatever else the case may be so we set out to solve the aforementioned problem with some kind of support mechanism for the joystick to keep it from getting bumped and jostled when it's being moved around more workstations for when we hire more engineers which we might do once we ship some screwdrivers this is a cool one i'm really not gonna tell you what this is no i'm not gonna tell them what this is oh where's the where's the shoe dryer it's in a place in my in my docket called silicon hell right now shout out to any pcb designer that has to redesign their board certain times to release a product because as soon as you design something it sells out well it's a battery-powered fan that will basically like dry your shoes or dry out your gym bag it's just because i wanted one and also because a lot of the engineering work to build it would be applicable to other projects like rgb doormat or whatever who'd pay someone to put that it's only an idiot yeah there's a haircut hello linus you need to come upstairs yeah i'd love to i just gotta run to the washroom first well don't follow me in here weirdo aside from video calling the app includes a 3d mapping feature that you can even decorate with furniture like your space not that this particular space is particularly furnished hello hi sarah what are you working on um just some secret things can we talk about this yet i mean future water bottle design capacitor inspired oh and this is a new desk pad what's the inspiration for this one all of these graphs represent some sort of statistic based on our channel this would be our male to female viewership right you know it and the coolest feature is the qr code that we have included will take you to our latest uploaded ltt video we should definitely uh go to never give you up oh limited edition golden controller plushie is this the one we settled on yes yes sarah does all of our sticker pack designs and this is our new eco-friendly packaging for the 2022 pack right yep this is 2021. what else you got going on sarah all our postcards fun are these all the ones that have arrived so far yes we're gonna make a wall of them so if you get an ltt store uh gpu wasteland coloring card you can send it back to us and then we can add it to our wall in the future yeah you guys should totally do it we've gotten so wow some of these are amazing look at this one how fun is that it warms my heart every day that i receive i love it this is nick and natalie's office they are both out of office today nick's got a prototype desk pad though this one will never see the light of day because i didn't like the pixelated ltt logo but it's kind of cool right i don't even fully understand what this room is i see packaging mock-ups hey sarah do you have that super cool shoelaces package here's our packaging for our shoelaces wait what's this called again the the net color nib yeah yeah yeah we have a gray version of this t-shirt that's also got the little color flex in it and the drawstrings we're gonna have matching shoelaces and they're gonna come in a little power supply box how cute is that and then they'll stick out like this what else is going on in here our temp set coffee mugs never found anything oh yeah bananas for scale various versions of a potential wan toque or beanie the ill-fated coasters yeah these were super cool too bad they all broke in shipping um a gpu pillow with rgb ooh this is fun these won't be launched by the time this video comes out but they'll be very close that's right 64 ounce versions of our circuit board water bottles now we get to the really weird part of the tour the people that we bought this unit from managed to get the permit for the caretaker suite so they were actually living upstairs the layout was super weird you had to go all the way around engineering all the way back up through fashion and all the way up to get to that side we decided to open it up and this is now the employee lunchroom we've got a washer and a dryer which it wouldn't surprise me to find things inside yep this is our color block hoodie and one of the big challenges that we ran into with this one was that the bold colors were bleeding onto the light colors in the wash so this is a new sample that's treated in a way that will not allow that to happen and as you can see see any color bleed yeah you don't one nice thing that the previous owners did there's like 60 ethernet jacks in this 4 000 square foot place there should be plenty of network connectivity like look at the size of this room okay this is a linus for scale how could i possibly hope to cram four people in here unless i start stacking them lloyd you moved your desk i went over there and i was like lloyd still works here right sarah's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah what's the deal it was too hot all right well i'll just move to where the air conditioning is okay that makes sense well no one's using it well what is wearing a sweater what is happening what are you working on right now lloyd what can we leak to the people just trying okay anything else to show the people come on it's the people yeah we're thinking of doing like a laser cut wooden bookmark these ones are a little on the thick side still and we unfortunately cut them out going the wrong way with the grain so they like snap in half which is not a desirable quality but we're working on it it's early stages this is gonna be a little like it's like a soft silicone kind of a lamp so it's gonna look kind of like that and then it'll be opaque all around it and the screen will glow whatever color you want and it's probably not watching you sleep yeah no camera no camera here's the front stairs which you haven't even seen yet these are a real time saver this one's not particularly fancy this is from like two or three years ago and it's got detachable arms just in case you're into that sort of thing but we have some custom models coming that are like five grand a pop and why basically custom size so it can fit to our standard medium size so it's our like nerdy techie meeting yes you can't really put pants on it too well well we tried yeah we had to take off solid put a solid effort into put yeah i gotta say the pajama pants which is what we have on here kind of flattering actually yeah as for the color viewing room i wasn't kidding about the cost ten thousand dollars for these plastic chips i already talked about that this has five different lighting modes so you've got daylight store light because that's where people make a purchasing decision when they're not shopping online like you know modern people home light and uv light 2 500 bucks for that oh and it gets even better this group of booklets so these are cotton chips how much were these three twenty seven we don't actually know how much these bros books cost because we got them from a supplier then you also need the paper ones the best part of these ones is you're supposed to replace them i think every 18 months and they're like a few hundred bucks every single time why do we have so many of these oh they're all different fashion home plus formula guide solid coated i mean for real though it matters if i show this to you you would say what color is it black okay if i show this to you what color is it black okay are these the same color no no i'm sorry what is this thing i just glossed over this so just put your fabric here and then it'll cut this exact diameter of a circle yeah and then you would weigh that onto the scales then you convert that to right grams per square meter and that's how we determine the weights of all our fabrics and it's really important that we validate this stuff ourselves because we've had suppliers lie to us about everything from the weight of the fabric to the colors that they use to the treatments that they apply to even the composition of the fabric and then we also had like some instances where the screen printer had like burn issues so then we had to double check the composition to make sure that it was poly cotton and not something else mixed in there speaking of burning fabric we've got a behind the scenes over on float plane where i accidentally set our props on fire not once but twice i've been informed that this bathroom has some special equipment in it oh i see a fancy steamer commercial now really there's a commercial grade steamer what did this cost uh 275 oh well that's pretty cheap especially when you compare it to all the like lab tests that we do every time we notice something could be a problem or we have a manufacturer make a marketing claim to us like for example the 3d down jacket the manufacturer was making some pretty bold claims about the waterproofness of the material so we went well i mean we could take your word for it but i am so excited for this one we're targeting fall right it's a jacket so hopefully yeah you say that but it's not gonna be cheap but it's like really nice here's the shoelaces i was talking about earlier this is part of our rgb line so that's why it has an rgb thing inside where the tags attach i don't know what this part's called does this have a name neck binding thanks that's a less cool name than i was hoping for oh right right i was going to show you the shoelace you could have matching shoelaces and drawstring if you want to look what is it on fleek do the kids say on fleek still i'm hearing a lot of no and i'm hearing a lot of opportunity to bring things back around to robo rock our sponsor these puppies have been saving us from ourselves one of our staffers was snacking on the uh like chips and thieves have been doing a
