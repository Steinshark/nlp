what is up everyone and welcome to the WAN show I was up until 5 a.m two times this week and about 3 30 last night so the energy might be a little lower and highlight rain we've got a great show for you guys today we're gonna be talking about nvidia's recent assertion that native resolution gaming is dead Long Live dlss and oh I don't know if I can argue with them about this there was a massive Xbox leak revealing plans for consoles controllers games and dreams of Acquisitions what else we got to talk about this week Microsoft announces co-pilot for the 78th time or something around there I'm not entirely sure and a video that came out recently that was actually quite fantastic the mom and pop computer shop video that came out yesterday was that yesterday that's a topic we're going to talk about some of the behind the scenes stuff oh fun all right let's go ahead and roll that intro first [Music] the show is brought to you today by Corsair The Ridge and ag-1 let's jump right into our first topic yesterday Nvidia officially released dlss 3.5 so far it's only supported in cyberpunk 2077 and creative tool chaos Vantage but dlss 3.5 is kind of cool it adds Ray reconstruction which uses a super computer trained AI Network so buzzwords an AI Network yeah cool um to generate higher quality pixels in between sampled Rays by recognizing lighting patterns from training data and recreating them during play Nvidia claims an eight percent frame rate boost in cyberpunk 2077 over dlss 3 and also claims that it is less demanding on the GPU though that has not been Quantified this is this is wild though in response to a question about whether Nvidia plans to prioritize native resolution performance in gpus Brian Catanzaro sure nvidia's VP of Applied deep learning research stated that relying on brute power to improve graphical Fidelity is a sub-optimal solution when Moore's Law no longer seems to hold old instead the future of gaming Graphics will be a greater Reliance on AI assisted rendering and upscaling according to Catanzaro smarter Technologies like dlss need to be implemented to improve Graphics Fidelity and circumvent the otherwise low gen on gen performance improvements seen in today's graphics Hardware this is a quote I think yep dlss AI will eventually be able to replace traditional rendering entirely now I think there's a ton for us to unpack here because first of all looking at it from a right now today perspective I think it's fair to say that most Gamers would strongly prefer to just render it native resolution and have an identical experience every time the game is rendered accurately no matter what Hardware they're on right and it just all comes down to well how well optimized is your Hardware but I would actually okay there's there's a few things that I want to kind of bring up as uh as sort of a a a devil's advocate sort of argument um but I mean do you think that's fair to say most Gamers would rather just game at Native res not necessarily um I I think I would be a little bit sketched out if I was a competitive player trying to put something that's going to potentially like uh yeah it seems pretty good most of the time but maybe it it doesn't show me the thing that I need need to see perfectly the one time I need to see it right because you might actually be aiming at a pixel yeah so like uh I don't know but if I'm playing single player games I don't I don't know how much I care as long as it looks really good it's probably fine you know so here's and and I I mean I think we can see from the uh not just sorry not just aiming at a pixel either and oh maybe this kind of ruins the competitive game argument um but also like Pixel Perfect jumps Pixel Perfect timings and various you could be competitive in a single player game that you're trying or something yeah yeah yeah um all right now here's here's before you guys before you guys get too far ahead um oh do we have a problem I'll figure that out seems like maybe just floating back not sure okay cool uh before we before we get too far ahead of ourselves here 's I at least seems like the chat is mostly on the same page as as my sort of perception of the situation they would rather not rely on these AI upscaling or or machine learning Solutions but can I just make us make a small point in game development how often is it that we are seeing hacky solutions that are implemented in order for us to achieve playable frame rates you know whether it's uh man I remember doing this uh going down this rabbit hole into how uh Reflections in the scope of a rifle are done in traditional gaming versus uh path traced or Ray traced gaming where the kind of hacky solution where they're there they basically create I forget exactly what it was but um the the way that they could do that with a minimal performance impact and still have it seem relatively accurate just absolutely blew my mind um what is the what is the difference there that's kind of my question to you what's the difference if it's implemented at a driver level by an Nvidia or an AMD versus if it's implemented game by game in order to optimize the game your thoughts yeah reflects a pre-rendered image is at least one of the techniques for that I don't know I something that concerns me about a lot of this kind of stuff too is like what we saw with Starfield I know I'm like giving kind of a politician answer so I'm not answering the question that you asked I'm still going to ask you to answer the question sure go ahead um but like we we saw that come out without dlss right I'm sure the community was able to respond that time and there was a paid solution then there was free Solutions and then now uh Bethesda said that they're gonna bring native dlss to Starfield and that's cool and whatever sounds good um but if if the quote that I heard that kind of spooked me a little bit of dlss Slash AI will eventually be able to replace traditional rendering entirely like uh that sounds like we're gonna run into a lot of issues um I feel like that would that would bring problems in in relation to like abandoned where Dead games that you can't play anymore because there's like some weird thing going on with how it was expected to work at one point in time but now our current rendering paths are different um I also think uh that there's a lot of potential for really not cool combat between the various companies that have their various proprietary solutions that are trying to sponsor a game and then they try to you know line Pockets to get them to not actually include certain Solutions so it's basically unplayable on whatever graphics card and then like the performance difference between Brands ends up being really dramatic depending on the company and the partnership that they had with the GPU company uh stuff like that I mean whether the anti-competitive stuff happens or not it's not like we haven't seen similar things in the past and I just don't I don't necessarily know if it's going to be any different than you know your tress effects and your hair works and your physics and all the different things that we've seen over the years and can I just can I again play Devil's Advocate again here and say okay but what if the AI assisted version is just legitimately better seeing what they can do with the amount of diarrhea on a modern GPU that is dedicated to this machine learning processing going through these going through these like these these trained models if they if that advances at a faster rate then just raw GPU grunt I mean could we see a game developer be able to design like this you remember this right Nvidia canvas yeah yeah I mean obviously this wasn't being done in real time at you know 60 to you know 500 frames per second when they first showed it off but I think it's pretty clear that in the machine learning space we're seeing a development or an advancement curve that is much faster than traditional GPU raster rendering so with that in mind is this a better way I think it kind of already is because with uh 3.0 because we're already we're already in a situation where we are it's it's clear that 4K is kind of the final frontier for you to have any hope of high refresh rate gaming I just I don't I don't foresee and you know what I'm probably going to end up eating these words at some point but I don't foresee a reason I don't foresee any need for us to drive games at significantly higher resolutions than that natively because you have so much data to process at 4K that you could upscale it not infinitely but wow a lot yeah um yeah and just the the the just the general improvements that you get from it are something that we've recommended people use for quite a while now so like yeah yeah so okay so I see I see 4K is that much better now basically the the end of that which is almost kind of an argument against my point in that if we're not trying to push resolution higher well then the obvious answer is to push visual Fidelity higher but then looking at um oh shoot yeah start start field what what's that technique called where they they they actually scanned real objects in order to get the the texture quality super high sorry say again they scanned Real World objects in order uh I feel like Dan is going to know photo something um photogrammetry yeah yeah yeah so if you could if you could just create all of your in-game assets with photogrammetry and then just run basically almost like uh almost like a like a mocap sort of equivalent like or or like a proxy footage equivalent where you're actually rendering with markers essentially and then your GPU is just interpreting it's almost like compressing the entire asset library of the game in a sense like you kind of get what I mean right yeah but because we're coming back to this that seems even more concerning for multiplayer games and like sure there's there's been this like what about destructible environments and multiplayer games using that setup oh as long as you well actually hold on that could be a way to make destructible environments manageable from a performance standpoint because if you've got this material and you've assigned characteristics to it then all you need to do so the geometry isn't done that way yeah so you can all your answers now you can spend all that compute on Geometry and then the the exactly the textures or like the unique scarring of the surface or whatever yeah that might differ from one player to the next but it'll be probably reasonably close until you know someone discovers that if you wear like uh like a an all an all like um blacked out you know suit or something like that and you happen to stick close to like wear explosions where you can hide or something you know I'm but what's the difference Luke people are already exploiting everything anyway yeah yeah so it's just it's just a new thing to do right like you know don't don't pretend you know your hands are totally clean I see you and Joe playing tarkov with your second monitor with your Discord seeing each other's Viewpoint like that's not technically the way it's meant to be played but realistically everybody else who's squatted up is doing it anyway so okay fine then at a certain point it's not like uh unfair it's uh get good if you don't don't hate the player hate the game yeah I just see you dress in Black sometimes you'll see engine demos yeah those engine demos were like look really sick the Fidelity will be super high yeah um but then you you start kind of diving more into it you start figuring out like okay uh creative auditing from the community in this engine is like not going to be a thing for XYZ reason none of these environments are destructible uh if you if you look at these environments in different angles it starts to break down pretty bad ways like different things like that and I I think I'm my concern if we go away from like the the just the statement of replacing traditional rendering keeps getting me concerned about like the technology that we've already built for traditional rendering abandoning that and going forward I feel like is going to have pitfalls that we don't necessarily understand that I don't understand um in regards to the the games that we can necessarily make maybe I'm just completely wrong about this that sounds good to me hopefully that's right but I mean I think once we resolve a lot of the copyright and intellectual property ownership issues around AI generated assets um if anything I and I mean maybe I'm just coming at this from a lay person's perspective right like I don't do game development but honestly it seems to me a lot easier yeah probably like if I easier yeah but is it is it as good of a space to be creative in that's the thing that I'm concerned about I guess it's it depends depends creativity you want like uh you know I think we've we've talked before about like if I if I was to you know invest in making a game you know what kind of what kind of game would it be and honestly if if I was to if I was to spec out my dream game that I would make it would be episodic even though I know the business model is totally broken and doesn't work um it would be it would be heavily heavily story focused like I could see okay there were these like kind of uh kind of trashy like fantasy novels that I read when I was like a teenager uh by this author Terry Brooks and it's all about this um this like Fantasy World shinara um and I could I could honestly it's all just like adventuring all over this land and I could I could see a game like that where you instead of hiring game writers necessarily you hire writers writers like and just create this world that gradually opens up and with every episode creates more and more environments to for you to go and visit essentially an MMO but not you really gotta play Baldur's Gate massively multiplayer oh I know I know 100 um you're really nicely defining ball Escape three well that's that's great um one difference though is that nothing I wouldn't intend anything to be High Fidelity so I for my three looks really good yeah from my point of view I had almost zero interest like I was thinking like um like RPG Maker level of of graphical Fidelity like it doesn't matter to me yeah but if I could if I could just you know draw a stick figure and then say okay yeah you know that now and now it just looks like something cool so you're talking about basically lowering barrier of Entry yes don't have to be as much of a coder don't have to be as much of a designer or reallocating resources because I think that's something that we've mostly agreed upon for a long time that a lot of the time the the the things that games get wrong is they'll have these really cool technical details or they'll be absolutely you know beautiful it's not actually fun but it's not it's not fun it's not engaging the AAA curse or this or like the story sucks and you just you know your Sidekick dies and you're like so you were just a three-dimensional you're like oh thank goodness now they're not going to bug me anymore yeah thank thank gravy I don't have to do another shut up escort escort Quest yeah exactly so I mean I don't know we've got people in chat saying I want graphical Fidelity or I'm not interested yeah but you can get you can get that yeah yeah that's the thing no part of what he's saying is that you wouldn't get that what he's saying is that when he's making it he doesn't have to worry about that you can you can draw stick figures he can do whatever and then it's going to turn that into something more um but again you know there's all this intellectual property stuff to to figure out oh yeah definitely I I don't know when or how or if that's going to be resolved I suspect it will be but yeah Wayne however if is is pretty questionable um it's an interesting thing because it's it's cool that more people the more things are more accessible with it but then it's also not cool uh taking people's jobs away and also you know it's real good at getting something that's going to be acceptable to a decent amount of people but it's not real good at making masterpieces no that's fair that's totally fine like I I there's there's this old story of where was it Austria is that where Beethoven's from Austria I can't remember wherever he's from there's if I remember correctly it's it's a this could just be not even a true story so great watch it here comes fake fake Story Time totally might be totally might I'm really glad I heard this like this forever ago it might have even been a different uh composer yeah I don't okay so you don't know who you don't know where I don't know if you don't know exactly when you have no idea if it's true why don't we just say Luke's about to make up a story yeah yeah yeah okay tell us a story um but it was basically every every school in that country had a grand piano yeah because they're like you never know when the next version in Luke's fictional country okay yes carry on every every school had a great piano because they were they wanted the opportunity for if if another person like this came around um that they would be able to realize it okay cool that's a really neat idea yeah there was a massive Xbox leak that revealed plans for consoles controllers games and dreams of Acquisitions this week and the amount of Click bait that I saw around this has been absolutely colossal like I I clicked on this one article that was like Microsoft planned to acquire Nintendo yeah and as I'm reading through the article I'm sitting here going no that's not what happened at all like I I I I I clicked it because I went well surely they couldn't be stupid enough to think that like the the government of Japan and Nintendo itself would what for for money like sell out to Microsoft like that it's it's not even it's not even conceivable and I was like surely they couldn't have gotten too far into these no there were there were no talks there was no there was no Microsoft the Nintendo acquisition that all uh who who said it was it was it Phil Spencer I don't remember but someone basically said that would be a career defining moment or something like that well yeah it would that would be an industry defining moment if Nintendo's been around for like what 150 years or whatever it is hey Linus God what wouldn't be sick if we acquired Mr Beast yeah yeah so news news here comes the dexterto article you know line is almost acquired almost beast but yeah almost happened feastables more like Tech typical that's our new chocolate bar the quick bits that's not bad we we've quick bits for like a bagged snack we wanted to do a cereal at one point that'd be pretty good I know it's a really good name for a cereal oh yeah dang we also have um we also have uh Linus cat tips quick bites and quick bits in the production in the production queue do you know what Linus cat tips are no okay so I want to make like a cat teaser oh a cat toy and then it would have interchangeable tips and they'd be it doesn't doesn't matter oh yeah I'm really sorry anyway a Microsoft employee appears to have mistakenly uploaded a large Trove of confidential documents both redacted and unredacted to a legal Court website used in the trial between the FTC and Microsoft this has resulted in what is possibly the largest leak of Xbox related information to date most of it from 2020 and onward on the hardware side project Brooklyn was a discless Xbox series X refresh and project Elwood an equivalent Series S console that we're scheduled to launch in Fall 2024 or I shouldn't say was uh I mean maybe anything leaked could be could not be you never know things can things can be developed really quickly sometimes and projects that seem like they're just about across the line can get axed so who knows a next-gen hybrid Cloud console that uses both local and Cloud processing is scheduled allegedly for 2028 that is actually farther out than I expected really yeah I I mean looking at how hard they were pushing uh looking at how hard they were pushing the cloud with Xbox series X I thought it sounded like they're going to do this with Sirius X yeah sebile an elite style controller with haptics that double as speakers a lift to wake feature and direct to Cloud connectivity similar to stadia man this is cool uh one document showed a mock-up of a first party Xbox handheld but handheld was listed as not in scope for first party on what can only be described as a funding pyramid what huh interesting not in scope for first party so what they would allow an ecosystem of Xbox handhelds like kind of Logitech gcloud kind of thing or maybe that oh that'd be that'd be super cool and what what else what else we got here uh oh however the Keystone Cloud console is in the funded section despite being canceled last year before this document was generated Okay so take all of these leaks with a grain of salt but definitely cool stuff then on the gaming side Bethesda parent company zenimax had a planning document listing several upcoming games yeah including a doom game called year zero Dishonored 3 a ghostwire Tokyo sequel an Indiana Jones game ah that what the Indiana Jones yeah was for yeah that'll either be amazing or more likely kind of terribly trash yeah yeah probably terrible I mean you never know I mean I didn't have a lot of Hope for the 2016 Tomb Raider reboot yeah and that was actually very good it ended up being excellent it's it's one of the few games in the like at that time in my life when I was very busy that I actually played all the way through it was very good a lot a lot of movie tying games are not good um did you just call Tomb Raider a movie tie-in game is it not I didn't play the ones when we were really young was there no like super old school Tomb Raider movie I know the newer Tomb Raider movie was not good but I thought those were like remakes of some super old thing I'm gonna quietly ask you to leave I don't know honestly I just don't care um but I was gonna say Spider-Man my actual point wasn't Tomb Raider it was Spider-Man came out and was absolutely surprisingly good I thought that's also not adapted uh yeah it is actually obviously originally there's the comic books but I'm pretty sure the game is based on the movie is it not yeah so nice try bucko um moving on from not sort of it's specifically pulled from the movie people are so mad I'm totally twisting what he's saying yes it's so much worse than it is and they just Dove right with you I'm just glad they're mad at you for a change yeah yeah that's that's okay I'll take that I'll take that too to be honest um moving on from there there's remasters of Oblivion and Fallout 3 which the the remix yeah the Oblivion the Oblivion movie The Oblivion movie Oblivion movie yeah graphic novels the Elder Scrolls it's from a scroll yeah a lot of them they're old they're eligible Scrolls come on um they already did a vault the the move to remaster Oblivion I honestly think is really weird um really because because of Sky Oblivion and I honestly bet you at this point Sky Oblivion will be better than the Oblivion remaster so then they just issue a cease and desist so that they can sell Oblivion remastered I think that would be honestly hard for them to do because it's a mod of Skyrim given how given how precarious their relationship with the modding Community I think that would like kill it yeah because this is this has been such an incredibly long-running project from people that are seen as very good members of the community you know I don't know I don't know I think that would be really bad but to me like the especially because Sky Oblivion is the furthest along one because there's uh what is the what is the Morrowind called Morrowind one called Elijah in the chat Boomer Scrolls wow cool stop um yeah skywind is the is the Morrowind version of that project which as far as my understanding goes is not anywhere near as far along as the um probably more challenging oh I'm sure yeah um business stuff from executive emails by at least 2020 Microsoft apparently had write-ups outlining the potential value of acquiring Nintendo and valve though they apparently saw no means to do so uh yeah um they were likewise interested in purchasing the U.S branch of tick tock and Warner Brothers interactive Phil Spencer said acquiring Nintendo would be a career moment okay so it was Phil Spencer there's confirmation that Microsoft is primarily interested in Activision Blizzard for King the makers of Candy Crush how sad is that I mean I don't know I don't know what's worse the fact that Activision Blizzard has fallen so far that we don't care about IPS like Diablo or Warcraft compared to Candy Crush or the fact that gaming has or at least the the money made in gaming has shifted so heavily to mobile like whale whale harpooning games like Candy Crush um that I think that's the worst part that that those that that traditional model is not really interesting at an executive you know return for shareholders level anymore that's wow yeah honestly the the heights that blizzard fell from and the heights that Activision fell from are both like incredible both of those Studios were just like top of the freaking world and have totally fallen off so that's a big part of it um I think the the games that they've been releasing are are pathetic Shadows of what they used to so I don't know um but also yeah people eat into that model so like it's I don't even know what you say at this point because gamers are gonna buy stuff it just happens in one exchange Activision execs describe the Nintendo switch 2 as closer in power to last gen PS4 and Xbox One which makes a lot of sense have you seen the recent rumors that the switch 2 will be as powerful as a PS5 or an Xbox series X no what are you talking about that's not how that works if it is a mobile device which as far as I can tell most people seem to be indicating that it will be a switch too a direct sequel kind of like the Super Nintendo or the Wii U right what could possibly make you think it will have anywhere near in the same article I'm reading I'm reading people who are saying it will be based on nvidia's ampere architecture and it will be a mobile device and it will have the same performance as a PlayStation what are you talking about oh my God Conrad just said it's gonna be called The Switch U just to make it extra confusing that would be amazing I would love that I should just call it switch off at that point because no one's going to tune into that forget it like I feel like I feel like this is the same conversation that we had back when Tesla announced that every one of their cars that they had that they were shipping would be capable of full autonomous driving and I'm sitting here going look I don't know everything about everything certainly not I there's lots of things I don't know or or don't understand the intricacies of but one of the things that I do know is that at that time microprocessor technology even if even if Tesla was five years ahead of the competition there was no there was no road map to the kind of the kind of AI inferencing that we were going to need for full self-drive like because remember self-driving full autonomous operation is not 99 of the time or 99.9 of the time think about it if it was 99 accurate in a hundred hours you would spend one hour doing the wrong thing on the road that is not okay horrible 99.9 of the time if it was that good every thousand hours you could be spending an hour driving down the wrong side of the road or on the sidewalk or a more Minor error there are yeah there are there are a little bit of there are some issues with interpreting it that way but it's also not that wrong yes but I would say if you if you evaluate it so okay you're right and based on how that thing is laid out there's no way to know how that should be interpreted because you don't know the severity of these errors yes but looking at like people driving down the road what percentage of the time are they doing the wrong thing uh by looking somewhere incorrectly or just absent-mindedly like not really seeing what's in front of them stuff like that it's probably extremely high but they're probably also not driving down the wrong side of the road like you're giving for an example and there's no way to differentiate those levels of Errors that's true that's true and and and we we don't know for sure if like you said humans are making are are spending you know yeah one one out of every hundred or one out every thousand hours like completely doing the wrong thing I you know people run red lights it happens people fall asleep with a wheel yep 100 percent I think what we can all agree on is that um Meg's 1991 says in the float plane chat Luke thinks Mario Bros is based on a movie I didn't know I didn't know how I just don't know how you got it so wrong Luke it's too meter who cares it's 13 year olds care you don't like pyramids look we did the first Tomb Raider game okay there's two Raiders game release what was I like five or something 200 gold is 1998. all right so I was 1996 in October so I was five could have been a movie I don't know why do I care I don't know maybe you were a precocious youngster and already a pyramid Enthusiast I do I honest I might have been at that point I'm not sure you are well you either recently were or you were going to be one soon you know it is interesting that there's a bit of a gap there yeah yeah yeah so we ended up um talking about nursing Luke I'm sure nobody had that on their bingo this is pretty interesting someone who float plain chat linked to me um uh one of the leaked versions oh this isn't working anymore since we restarted uh stream index broken can't show you my laptop but it's uh one of the leech documents um says gaming there's a picture of Master Chief because of course there is uh then it says gaming devices oh there we go yeah gaming devices passed to 2030. console business is the foundation damn it Microsoft uh consoles are considered a key Health meter for the brand and will continue to drive majority of Revenue and subscribers into 2030. um new endpoints are the it's still very unimportant right now yeah me too this is the interesting part though it's like they kind of shift immediately after saying that so they say consoles of foundation this is the health meter all that kind of stuff and then they say like to get 200 million members though unlocking new off-console endpoints and improving the experience will substantially grow subscribers over the next eight years okay so which one is it Microsoft exactly that's an interesting point to be fair I think they're saying it's the foundation this is our majority that type of stuff but we need to right so they're saying that to build a pyramid they have to have a lot of consoles yeah and then they have to have a sharp point of endpoints yeah and then they turn it on the side yeah and then you have two of them controller controller becomes the hero as Point number three the new Xbox controller is the only thing you'll need to play on a on every new device this new low barrier of Entry will fuel subscriber growth um so subscriber growth so they're just talking about like game yeah that's it that's all they care about that's it Game Pass baby yeah personalization and customization personalization customization continue as a hardware strategic advantage and a key profit driver and customer delighter never heard that word before but it sounds good yeah I've heard like delighting customers being a delighter a customer delayed yeah I don't know if I've heard of a customer delayer before but I also don't spend a ton of time in gentlemen's clubs so yeah yeah or pyramids um sustainability and accessibility continued progress towards uh reduction of carbon tax impact re-energizing our journey of inclusion personalization it's interesting to me that they would think that personalization is a strength of Xbox they do um no it doesn't you got to send us back there we go they do they do push their custom controllers a lot yeah but honestly I think a lot of people buy them why not the console though customization of the console yeah like look at how Sony's doing with the with the PlayStation 5 dark plates or whatever their first party one is called the the dbrand thing like I um Avon fox says Tomb Raider was a pyramid scheme yeah that's how they made money it kind of was it was the kind of what yeah yeah yeah um yeah that's interesting I don't really you know chop for Xbox as much I don't even think they've done much in the way of before the Xboxes this time around like we have this we have this super cool uh like gears Xbox One X that was sick or was it a 1s I don't remember but you have one of those actually yeah let's did you steal it from work no oh okay why the hell do you have an Xbox a long story I turned it on one time I'm interested in this it's still under my TV though I'd like to hear the story I wanted the controller so we found his weakness we found the thing that will make loops oh no no money no no I didn't buy it oh my God carry on I wanted the controller so I had the the red I should have known better gears controller yeah that I probably stole from work um yeah that definitely because I think it disappeared the red one I've had it for like years it was before there was a lounge so I don't know where I got it from I might have got it from Willow actually I'm not sure nice backtrack it's possible good job it's technically possible but I had the red gears controller and I wanted to play uh NHL with my brother because they won't release NHL and PC since like what was it like 96 or something like no no it was in the 2000 it was like 2005 or 2006 oh maybe it's 2006. yeah um but yeah they haven't released NHL on PC in forever so my brother and I wanted to play on Xbox um and I wasn't I didn't really want to buy an Xbox but I had um plans of how we could play an NHL game on the TV don't worry about it through Cloud streaming sure um but anyways I'd wanted more Xbox controllers and I couldn't find just getting just the gears controller because that's all I wanted I didn't actually want the Xbox so I reached out to a contact and I was like can I buy just the controller and then they sent me the whole thing I didn't know they were going to do it so you leveraged your you know contacts here I did not meet this person through work he knows what he did well no I've had it for like four years or something yeah they got a really great value out of that yeah yeah okay yeah hey I mean the good news is it can never you know Red Ring of Death if you never turn it off well okay because I know that's not an issue with the series Xbox One S or whatever but right got that TV yeah the TV was more or less also so that I could like have people over oh right and then that was like that was a week before coven happened yeah how'd that go for you no I I'm not even the one that uses the TV anymore it's like exclusively my girlfriend I don't ever use it I think you had a I think you had an inkling that that was gonna happen at the time though I did yeah because you were like yeah I don't care about the TV but this is the good one right I'm like yeah you're like okay yeah that's exactly how it happened yeah okay that makes sense I did zero research I called Linus like on the way to the store and was like tell me what to do hey it's a good TV it's great it was yeah it worked it worked quite well I was yeah you bought it a good time because basically there were some huge sale you've got 4K 120 hertz you've got HDR support you've got variable refresh rate with like g-sync compatibility or whatever um so you've got basically everything you need and all that's happened since then is they've gotten a little bit brighter basically more color gamut more brighter they are better the newer ones are better but if you are using them anytime other than during the day with sunlight coming in I I the newer ones are better but man are you ever having a lot of the experience with I think it's what like a C2 or something that you have C1 I don't remember I don't remember you'd honestly probably remember better than me man it might not even be no it must be like a C10 yeah because they they started over oh really yeah yeah so there's like there's so C8 and 9 and 10 or whatever I can't remember if there was a c in there Luke thinks when show is based off Rancho pink sorry oh man okay anywho uh Dan we don't know what to do because you don't have the cue cards up yeah I lost uh everything uh hey my buttons work now I fixed the buttons I just fixed the buttons it's flustered Dan uh what do we do merge messages now I don't know this one says do merch messages okay put that up there see he hit the microphone it's a microphone why are you hurting our viewers saved yourself I deserve it no no this hasn't happened in so long I don't know what I'm doing anymore I swear this never happens to me yes it's interesting sorry hold on what hold on there's there's interesting slides in this deck um Cloud first Gamers is the blue PC first Gamers is the the light green and console first and Multi-Device gamers are we that small well okay I think Multi-Device is yeah that's stupid you can't just lump Multi-Device in with console because there's plenty of PC first Gamers that are Multi-Device oh man yeah that's pretty dumb that feels like someone on the console team trying to inflate trying to juice it yeah trying to juice the numbers yeah yeah I don't know that's it yeah that's a strong disagree wow that thing is it looks like a router it's just like a circular it's one of those old stupid uh like D-Link had routers that look like that I think back in the day updated Technologies wow this is this leak is crazy that actually is holy crap giving our fans more to love like this is this is clearly presentations that real time was spent on and are very real wow die string for improved efficiency Undisputed yeah I think there are a fair number of people that would dispute the series s in general and it's um it's positive contributions to to console gaming but sure yeah uh all right let's explain what merge messages are and do a couple we don't do twitch bits or whatever the thing on super chats man I sleep deprived you know there's a there's different kinds of sleep deprived sometimes I get kind of like uh like like silly and then other times I get you know today I'm just stupid like I I actually I feel like I feel like this is what it must be like to not be very smart start a thought and I just I don't know how to explain this there's there's you can you can say something I'm like I don't understand you can apparently make uh rough equations or sorry rough comparisons between sleep deprivation and and uh being drunk yeah being awake for at least 18 hours is the same as someone having a blood alcohol uh content level of 0.05 being awake for 24 hours is equal to having a blood alcohol content of 0.1 percent sick uh well see I'm not sleeping that way it's more cumulative yeah I think that's a harder one to measure but I'm sure it has a similar effects I I have I've had a really big um I've had a really big project on the go lately we finally finally have the one you land Center gaming systems up you know what we can talk we can talk about a little bit later on the show first let's explain what emerge messages uh so we don't do those normal kinds of messages to shows because we think they're kind of a bad value for the viewer what if we don't see them or what if we see them then frankly they're not very you know relevant and we don't respond to them then you basically got nothing you got pixels on a screen um and and that's that's a shame but the way that we do it hey you get your pixels on the screen sup Alexander G uh our producer Dan will go through some of the merch messages and either reply to them himself like to Alexander G or send them to us to address later on the show or none of that happens and hey you just get your order in the mail and you get like a sick t-shirt or a hoodie or water bottle or a screwdriver or whatever the case may be so you just gotta go to the merch message box in the cart and whenever we're live fill out the merch messages field and then go ahead and place your order and it gets dumped into the queue for producer Dan uh Dan do you have a couple of uh a couple merch messages for us I do actually first one here hey lld given the amount of times you talk about tech related lawsuits or legislation have you considered adding legal experts to the team to review them so we know exactly how it's affecting us I think for the most part unless you are an enormous company you you generally seek legal advice on a consultancy basis like I mean even I'm thinking like even you know the cnns and you know Fox News of the World um uh they uh okay hold on hold on just a second they obviously have internal legal legal counsel oh but they'll also have but they but when they're but for the content they bring in legal contributors who my understanding is a lot of the time are not necessarily paid they're paid in exposure on the network is is my understanding and to be clear I'm not I'm not suggesting this is not a call for lawyers to consult for me for free it's just what I'm saying is that I don't I don't necessarily know that media organizations will just have a lawyer on staff because the thing about law is it's not just you don't just it's very specialized so if we were going to talk about you know copyright or if we were going to talk about um for example uh patent uh patent law or if we were going to talk about um I wouldn't even be surprised if Financial crimes you know CNN style legal team would almost be a legal team that uh like Works through contractors or like finds the right no yeah knows who to know and who to who to bring in for you know a a relevant take on whatever the the topic du jour is yeah I could totally see that yeah vectavis says I have an ex-prosecutor as my company's legal counsel sometimes they can pivot I mean that's true but what if they what if they don't or what if they make a mistake would I be better off just you know bringing in someone to consult for us on a you know whenever needed I yeah I don't know it's not something that it's not something that's on our radar right now I think right now we're just really focused on making really great content got a lot of really exciting stuff lined up uh oh man there's something I really want to tell you guys about but I guess I can't really do it yet soon soon I will tell you guys soon but I'm very excited about it all right Dan what else you got for us sure last one here dear Dan Linus and Luke and Wan crew my 22 year old autistic brother dropped 120 on Mario Kart tour last week do you have any tips on how I can help him not be susceptible to this kind of thing this is a tough one um it's funny because this I'm having almost having like a Deja Vu moment because somebody asked me something recently that was like how do I prevent this like grown ass person yeah that's that's the problem from doing something yeah and I was like well there you can't yeah like from from like like legally morally like all of these ease um they are an independent person who can who can make I think there's some I think there's some layers here their own decisions did they want to do that is this like an impulse control problem after the fact they're like I wish I didn't do this that type of stuff then maybe there's some opportunities to step in is it their money yeah I mean if it's not their money remove the card from the account or if it is their money um but they're going to be reliant on you now to replace that that things they would have spent that's where things can get very complicated with family obviously we don't know much about the dynamic here but like I would I would Hazard okay can can your brother afford it is another question that I would be asking so you know if it if it is if it is his money and he can afford it then but then yeah you know I I don't know right because I would want to intervene so in spite of everything we just said like I would I would want to do something if I saw if I saw one of my siblings throwing away money at at different colored pixels that kind of money so I I it's in a week oh yeah no I I understand and my assumption oh go ahead uh my understanding here is not anywhere near um good enough but I I believe people on the Spectrum can be very fixated on certain things sure yeah and maybe they find and and very very high amount of enjoyment from this and they have the money if if those if all those things line up then whatever it's an adult making adult decisions it is what it is but like you were saying does this now make them reliant on someone else's money sure is this not their money is this all these other different types of things um and did they did they want that to be the reality at all like this might be a situation where they came to this person who sent in the merge message and like potentially ask them for help we don't know how regular of An Occurrence this is that too maybe this is something that where this is not the first time that they've spent you know a hundred plus dollars on uh you know on a mobile game essentially right ah I mean I I personally um I I find that adding steps to things is like really beneficial to make you not do it um like one of the one a money spending hack that I I know a few people that have done um is they'll they'll um stop carrying certain cards yeah and just carry cash I took the Twitter app off my phone yeah I still have Twitter yeah I can access it on a desktop I could install it again if I really want to access it on a desktop yeah if I really want to look at something I can I can open the page in a browser at least I could until they like made that more difficult sick um but but you add these barriers so maybe just don't let the mobile device remember your card or if it has to remember your card uh just remove the card after the transaction yeah nighttime astronaut says it's predatory from the company I'm a disability Advocate and I'm neuro spicy we are targeted by ads purposefully yeah that's um I'm sure that's a thing that's nasty I'm also totally convinced that's a thing yeah oh I mean there's really believe it there's no question in my mind that that's the thing it's just it doesn't change that from a legal standpoint this is a grown adult and you can't you you can't tie someone down and go like no no more Mario Kart tour yeah but yeah I mean other other than just other than just here's a yeah here's a weird potential idea sure try to get them hooked on a a different Mario Kart that doesn't have Micro transactions that's the problem is it's not as hooking mechanisms are not built into those games yeah but they're they're still fun I know but it's Super Mario Kart 8. it's a great game it's different yeah I know it's it's different it's not the same thing show some enjoyment play it play it with them have fun I don't know yeah there is there that's a good point there isn't a substitute for spending time together yeah so like maybe maybe I don't know this is this is possibly not fair and I'm volunteering this person's time but um that's probably the approach that I would try to if I if I saw that someone that I knew and cared about was having a toxic relationship with something I would try to help them go in a different direction but not make them but just make it voluntary like hey you clearly really like Mario Kart you're playing this version of it that has gotcha microtransactions that sucks I'm down to play Mario Kart 8 with you going to go play that let's get all the unlocks in the game because you can unlock all these different kite things and wheels and all this kind of stuff let's focus on doing that let's do it together and then you go play that together and then they get hooked on that game and it's um potentially a little bit better I don't know just an idea it's unfortunate but I don't know I I don't I don't have a way to solve this I mean I see people kind of talking three different possibilities in the chat and you know you've got the uh you know government regulation is going to be one that's always going to be a controversial a controversial Topic in these things right because you've got Advocates on the one side saying we need regulation we need regulation because these companies are just going to exploit vulnerable people and then you've got people on the other side going look we can't regulate ourselves into a nanny state if if a grown adult wants to buy a product or service why shouldn't they be allowed to buy a product or service and I think there's compelling arguments both ways I don't think this is a simple black and white issue um and I I'm reminded of the the news I think this was also this week it was either this week or last week that neuralink is looking for human volunteers for early implants yeah and I'm kind of sitting here going you know these obviously these are going to be grown adults hopefully you know of sound mind and body who are making the decision to be to to be guinea pigs for for their experimentation uh should this even be legal and it's like I guess I mean it's your body but I mean it's in some parts of the world isn't suicide technically illegal I don't I don't think there's a what is that what does that mean well I don't think there's a punishment for it to the person who is dead obviously but it can affect things like for example um your insurance I know that I don't know that it's the illegality that would affect that but you know if you kill yourself you don't get the insurance payout um yeah uh noodles it says in the chat in the U.S suicide is illegal it's like okay it was it will put you in jail yeah it's illegal in the UK too says night pause what does it mean so is it just an insurance thing because that yeah apparently it's illegal so the police can get involved without a warrant that's interesting uh Ian Ian Xmas says gambling needs to be monitoring control I mean sure but where's the line right like look how was it gambling look how long it took to regulate like what's the name of this game again Mario Kart what Mario Kart tour tour mobile game super got it oh people are saying it's illegal so that trying so attempting it can be punished like yeah okay you can accomplished with that seems stupid I don't know man so you can be forced to get help um that you know oh okay that's that's something excessively you're gonna throw them in jail for it like what do you think that's good yeah also if someone helps you they can be charged with aiding and abetting okay so I think I'm cool with that turns out there are some good reasons I'm sure there's I don't know it's a very nuanced topic they're 100 percent transactions for me in the game yeah I'm not certain if the Mario Kart tour if the market transactions are just like buying a thing or buying a a dice roll got it I don't I don't know what they are yeah I'm not sure all right do you want to give us one more merch message Dan um yeah sure um let's see what I've got here hey lld what kind of actions would you have to take of any if a Mr b-sized Creator wanted to join flowplate ah I think if a Mr b-sized Creator wanted to join we'd probably have to beef up the infra just a little bit I would imagine they'd have some special requests in terms of tools they would want built for engagement With Their audience that's pretty common yeah as long as they're not too onerous like as long as there's something that we could sort of try to Fast Track or get on a road map where they're willing to be a little bit patient um I I would think at this point not too much you know don't don't quote me on that right there's there's stuff that we would need to do but there's solutions that we can Implement that could solve it like we'd be fine all right why don't we jump into our next topic Luke you want to pick one sure give me a sec I was looking to Mario Kart tour stuff uh uh do we have the co-pilot thing we have it oh nice okay well should we do that should we use it okay so you're still doing stuff okay well let's let's maybe do that later oh I see oh cool no no 1080 is fine oh you keep poking with that I'll talk through this topic uh on Thursday Microsoft announced Microsoft co-pilot in Windows which you may have thought they already announced but you may be thinking about GitHub copilot which was announced in 2021 Microsoft 365 co-pilot which was announced in March 2023 or Windows co-pilot ever more different than you know anyways that was announced in May 2023. Microsoft co-pilot in Windows rather is the unification of the company's disparate chat bot like services rebranded with a new colorful logo and an actual release date this Tuesday September 26th finally a release date on any AI product is fantastic um the feature will roll out in Windows 11 in its early form accessible Through the Windows plus c key keyboard shortcut okay I'm not gonna lie I'm actually like very excited to try this right now no this is this is interesting Dan has a laptop for us because we've had we've had a lot of it on the floor why is he putting it on the floor I don't want floor laps it's not I don't like things yeah yeah floor laptop laptops are not based on movies the movie um the movie of the game uh as Microsoft revealed when announcing Windows co-pilot copilot can pull data from a user's calendar email documents um so nothing from anyone who's using Google for all of those things I guess anything Microsoft app related to help you answer questions and perform tasks it can also help you control your desktop itself you can tell it to arrange Windows change system settings launch specific Spotify playlists way and much more okay well let's do stuff yeah try to arrange some windows pull open some stuff uh I mean there's no apps on here at the back of that laptop is very distracting yeah I know right uh I don't know how to turn that off imagine having that in a class I mean I think that's sort of the point you just piss off the teacher just peacocks super hard yeah just tape over it wow um I put a new button on your deck there when you want to switch into the the laptop oh sick okay where is it oh on his yeah do you want one no no it's fine everybody can have a button they're free there you go let's see here's two oh oh there you go you're special okay they're like ducks at the park yeah they're free you can just take them home like domain names despite the unification Microsoft's branding is still all over the place concerning commercial customers who can also consider using Bing chat Enterprise and Microsoft 365 co-pilot the latter of which will be available for Enterprise customers November first I didn't know that Enterprise Microsoft 365 copilot is gonna be very interesting hopefully it's not trash we'll see openai also announced Dolly three which the company says does a lot better than other modern text image systems at not ignoring words in prompts it can also actually generate text in an image properly as seen here and then there's a little example that I'm going to jump to I just feel so empty inside which is amazing for people who have messed with these things in the past because the text was always just like garberly no real letters just kind of some weird shape patterns where the text is supposed to be so having actual text is very that's a pretty big step to be completely honest um that's pretty cool that economy fed uh open AIS demo prompts into mid-journey and compared the outputs and it's pretty close apparently we're gonna check that out as well uh uh like this let's go to the beach and find the right hermit close-up photograph of a hermit crab nestled in wet sand with seafoam nearby and the details of its shell and texture of the sand accentuated yeah I don't know if this is a hermit crab I don't know what a hermit crab looks like to be honest with you oh okay yeah oh that's from dolly and my Journey's on the right huh okay I don't know how many examples there are here we go dancers desire that's a really long prompt but they actually do look pretty similar one is just like facing us and the other ones facing away sheesh photo of a lychee inspired I think that's how you say that I don't know inspired spherical chair with a bumpy white exterior and plush interior set against a tropical wallpaper huh quite similar and I I'm every time I play around with this stuff or look at it I am just kind of Blown Away potatoes we know a thing or two about generating potato images on Dolly we do um anyways speaking of uh speaking of potato uh no never mind I'm not gonna I'm not gonna tease that oh wow okay something potato related that's all I can say the doll E3 uh or sorry dial E3 is in research preview now and will be available to chat GPT plus and Enterprise customers in October and will of course be integrated into Bing and various Microsoft apps and services as well lastly there were new service surface devices announced all with very iterative upgrades Business Insider and windows Central say that this is part of the reason for formal surface Chief Panos penaz sudden departure this week after 20 years at the company surface laptop Studio 2 with an Intel 13th gen core i7 h-class chip various ones I suspect at different price points and RTX 4050 or 4060 Intel neural processing unit and up to two terabytes of like dedicated storage and 64 gigs of RAM starts at around 19.99. I say around because they don't specify what chip it is and there's two different GPU models so I don't know um surface laptop go three pretty much just internal upgrades same 12.4 inch screen now has Intel 12th gen in not 13th I guess instead of 11th and starts at 7.99 surface go 4 for business same chassis as go 3 Intel Core Intel door Intel dual core Pentium I got there in go 3 replaced with quad core Intel n200 marked for business do not have fun with it it's illegal that's right Riley wrote that right yeah right yeah I assumed I don't even have the dock open right now but I I I know I don't I don't technically know that I I just I didn't put it in there oh okay yeah yeah that's one of them almost certainly Riley um and then last but not least potentially at least who knows uh surface Hub three some minor upgrades over the Hub 2s announced in March Hub 3 mod module can be purchased and installed in existing Hub 2s devices okay should we just start doing copilot yeah I've been waiting for you to do this this whole time no I'm ready okay tell me what to have it do do the windows organizing this is the last conversation we had well no but I want to do a couple of interesting stuff okay I think Windows organization open a browser for me very interesting hmm uh no thanks can you open a good browser oh let's see let's see if it doesn't off of this which please confirm the action in the dialog box that has appeared oh I have to click it why would I have to click it that's weird sure you can confirm what say open Google Chrome I don't know why you would ever want to do this instead of just typing in the start menu well because eventually you would want to interact with your voice not the keyboard yeah like I don't see I don't see a voice input right now you could do your own but yeah please confirm the action in the dialog box that has appeared what are you talking about it's already he clicked it though he said no thanks and it like grayed out hello buddy uh okay um open File Explorer and chrome is not a good browser yeah I just I the only one I see on there is Edge and chrome yeah open File Explorer and show me where my uh program files are is this gonna do anything I mean yes yes obviously click it what grade it out yeah grade it out it looks like it's duplicating I try well it's grayed out it wasn't grayed out originally all right the file explorer is now open you can navigate to the program possible it's hallucinating already I don't want to navigate to that folder okay well I asked you to do it and it's defense you're using it in the way that it's not it should work the way that you're doing it but it's it's clearly not intended to be used that way I think you should start a new chat let it dump so that it's not gonna lose click the button properly don't close that fine you're you're a bad pilot fine it's just trying to co-pilot but you're not you're not open File Explorer okay so maybe I just need to maybe I just need to click it way faster well no you're just typing something new before you click it yeah it's working well why does it why does that second dial sure you can confirm the action in the dialog box that has appeared and you've already done it yeah I've already done it what are you talking about those problems for sure okay um show me where my music is oh I mean theoretically if I have a folder called music then it should I mean sure I guess so oh my goodness um no um where's my music in file explorer wow this is pretty rudimentary to be honest with you yeah I think you need to start a whole new thread though because you're you're already hallucinating uh no I don't okay fine how do I how do I new thread I don't even see the here maybe up here okay so refresh all right okay fine also I will I will say here that this is not the release version we don't well we don't know that this is a release version or not are you talking to the stream right now dude oh yeah Dan you might as well just talk to the students because we're just going to sit here in silence while you talk to us anyway yeah hey that's nice okay Tomb Raider is both a movie and a game oh my goodness okay but that's just normal co-pilot stuff it's more of a come on try to try to get to do cool things open some windows get it to organize it come on I'd rather bother you oh my goodness ah it's not more of one than the other I'm just gonna start as a video game series in 1996. hmm iconic protagonist Lara Croft again when I was five do you think that's an excuse Luke is this Enterprise if you only get four prompts on free like Bing this would be useless using it properly so like who knows if it's useless or not he's like being antagonistic to the to the poor little I'm not being antagonistic yes you are it's it's presenting an option yes or no click these buttons and then you're not clicking it okay fine well they took they went away they got grayed out because you typed something more I shouldn't have to interact with my mouse I agree but clearly it's designed that all right fine so use it properly but I'll just type in what you can you can criticize that it's it shouldn't work that way you can criticize it it should it should work off of your texted response but you can also use it properly at the same time come on Mr reviewer man tell me tell me what you want me to have it do I've wanted you to have it organize Windows literally this whole time okay fine open Steam and open Chrome and why would I want it to do that and organize their windows I mean what what am I even how could it possibly help to do this for me I don't know whoa yes oh whoa yes oh wow this is yes why would I need three prompts for this I snapped a window for you you didn't so it did the it did it all at the same time so the apps weren't actually open yet yeah I'm the one making this bad Luke thank you that's very helpful no I at least we've learned something now what did we learn that it sucks we already learned that we learned that when you click things it actually does stuff so that's pretty cool you didn't organize the windows oh this is not how you interact with these things why not because it's just needlessly antagonistic oh well it worked smart guy I'm sorry for the confusion I can't physically It also says it did it for you and then I click yes and it doesn't do it I snapped a window before you can snap others beside it oh steam's open okay uh can I close can I can I close steam without it appearing in my taskbar oh I don't I don't know can it do that for me can it close it to the system tray I don't know if I'm not signed in so I don't know if it'll behave a little bit differently here how to close steam without it okay so just searches for it okay what are fundamental Windows things that it could do it okay so let's jump up to what it talks about um okay it can help you control your desktop itself you can tell it to arrange windows change system settings and launch specific Spotify playlists and much more can I find the original thing where it lists these features and maybe I can find them more [Music] with over 150 new features I could see this being super super okay here we go this is what I've been trying to get to I'm sorry for the misunderstanding but as an AI I don't have the ability to directly interact with your computer's interface I can provide instructions and guidance but I can't perform actions on your computer how did steam just log that's not true though because it did perform actions on your computer how did steam just log in uh what just happened huh all I had was a login screen someone scanned the QR someone somebody logged in that's actually pretty funny um you need to make sure you fully close steam because they could remote in right okay that's pretty funny though that is excellent don't ever do that again but that's hilarious um anyway oh my God I shouldn't laugh at that uh bad no um something I have new things to write down that we need to protect anyway but I can't perform I can't perform actions on your computer you'll need to follow the steps I provided to remove the chat icon from your taskbar let me know if you need further assistance so I could see this being super super useful for people who don't want to dig into the three different control panels that Windows has now to figure out how to you know change your audio device this is just clippy try to get it to change like power modes sure um or or like sleep settings or uh what happens when you close the lid okay can you uh set my computer to sleep after five minutes yeah I think that's basically just gonna be clippy with chat GPT oh it had to search for that yeah like why do you have to search for that sorry I can't do this can you can you start a new chat can you clear this chat and then try that again I can I I don't think it's going to make a difference so Luke I don't think it can actually interact with the system basically at all like that's why it needs that manual prompt every time it allegedly does something for you like open a window the notes in our dock I'm trying to find this in the official thing but the notes in our dock say um it can pull data from a user's calendar email documents anything Microsoft app related to help you answer perform tasks it says it can help arrange Windows change system settings and launch a specific playlist did it just do this okay so it's ridiculous it opened it for you but you have to be the one that flips the switch now that it didn't open the right thing look at this please disable Wi-Fi sure would you like me to turn off Bluetooth for you okay then it goes I open the devices page in settings well which one is it are you supposed to do it for me are you supposed to open this window also I don't have the capability to disable Wi-Fi you can do this by going to the network settings on your device where suppose I'm a novice user I don't know where this is why did you give me three different answers want me to do it for you here do it yourself I can't do that I don't know man I um that seems pretty bad this seems that seems pretty basic yeah I want to turn off my Wi-Fi do we have anything um here does this thing have like McAfee on it or something like is this pre-loaded with any like junkware oh you know what I bet it has like Candy Crush or whatever on it all right what's what's the junkware that comes on um on Windows devices didn't it used to come with Candy Crush uh check out paint yeah open paint I mean isn't there new paint that has transparency now that's kind of big news why are we not talking about that online show yeah I don't know I forgot about it there's a lot of cool things in new paint is this new paint I don't know I don't think so I mean so I had I had some concerns about us trying this ahead of time wow this is fun I'm having a good time yeah okay I drew um it looks great you start here now you gotta now you gotta do the use the fill tool to fill in some of those things and then it becomes Modern Art okay and then you end up here you go so you start at the house and then you end at work it's a truck oh hey it has a little like that's a little Cloud coming out the back and everything and here's hold on hold on oh fine details fine details here's you oh nice nice yeah anywho sick um how did you get the truck is your method of transportation though how did you get to it oh I don't know what if that just shows the path that you've taken so far can you save the drawing I made in Ms paint can you do basically anything so here's here's my problem yeah with this is this supposed to be a Windows update um oops and like I'm going to jump onto my screen really quick okay new windows 11 update delivers over 150 new features including bringing the power of copilot to the PC co-pilot in Windows in preview paint photos Snipping Tool clip champ Notepad new Outlook for Windows modernize File Explorer all this other type of stuff we clearly don't have all these things what did we install just the copilot preview is that right Dan uh pretty sure this is like the most bleeding edge version of Windows on the planet right now um so this has the right but it doesn't have all these other things so we we don't know how old this version of copilot is we don't know if this is the version of copilot that they're actually going to be launching and when they do launch it it's going to be a preview version now I will say given its performance right there I'm not the most confident in it um hmm I I just um would you want it to be able to do actions without user input well it's not without user input I am inputting I mean okay this is something never what if I wrote a script to pretend like this is my this is why it doesn't do things on your computer because then it's dangerous right yeah yeah it's going to be dangerous regardless you could already script those things to happen yeah it's not like you can do anything in here that you couldn't do in a Powershell which can run in the background anyway yeah so like what what are we what are we protecting from here exactly lawsuits well yeah but if they were going to sue over this they could sue over Powershell you know what I mean like I just I don't really I I do wonder if this is just you know the starting point where it's basically chat GPT but you don't have to go to bing.com which is a benefit I mean that's something I just don't think we should say almost anything because we don't know if this is the right version well what we know is that this is a version that is in development sure but like that's not the necessarily we're talking about this as if it's the one that people are gonna get no we have no idea if that's true I'm talking about this in the terms of how it describes itself right it describes itself as not being capable of interacting with your computer which was exactly what I wanted this version of it describes it that way I think that that is a significant design decision that's not a technical thing that's a design decision so no I don't think it's likely that that's going to change in the what is it like four days before this is more broadly available okay but here's the thing the one that they're showing off in the video Yeah has a mic this one doesn't sure this is not the right version sure but I mean again that doesn't address what I said where you can help me focus and it automatically opens Spotify oh no no it doesn't so so you have to do everything it just no it just did it look well here hold on hold on we haven't actually tried that yet I thought we did no no I was just bothering you we never actually tried it because I asked it to open stuff then organize it and what it did was it tried to use um aerosnap or whatever it's called now and then It ultimately there's there's more stuff in here that it's doing without user input hold on hold on hold on let's try let's try it organize my windows here we go uh yeah I would sure so yeah yeah this is not how it works in their video isn't it a marketing video but like it's I I don't we're using a version that is not the one that is going to be released do you think it's really going to be significantly changed differences between the two apps we cannot say this is legit we will get destroyed for this this is BS this version came out today it doesn't matter nobody said it's legit Luke we said this is what Microsoft has made available right now this is an extreme preview build yeah there's like four layers of extremes completely irrelevant because one that is clearly not this version because it has functionality that we can see like the mic button is being released in a couple days and we're talking about one that is now already clearly old I am mad you guys don't see the problem with this no not at all oh my God not even a little bit goofballs balls they released this today so what so why would we not talk about it this is not the news article that we're addressing so but this is what we so we read out a news article with talking points and then talk about something completely different I mean okay can I draw can I make an intelligence secret uh no I won't name a certain brand uh LTT store releases a new shirt well they used American Apparel shirts like seven years ago so let's review an American Apparel shirt but that's not comparable at all it's like if it's like if a game developer announced an upcoming game and announced a release date for it and showed a showed a trailer for it and then like you know two days later or whatever put up a preview build of it and people played the preview build and talked about it that's what this is there is nothing wrong with that they didn't have to make this preview build available this is not pirated this isn't a leak this is something Microsoft made available I don't think it is proper form to read a news article about something and then open up something that is clearly not that thing chat GPT 4 in chat says Linus knows he's wrong he's just messing with Luke no I I I legitimately don't I think it's completely valid if a company releases a preview to use it and talk about it 100 percent they don't have to do that in in my opinion this is a preview build of what is going to be released on Tuesday and they exist in the preview builds for you know stability testing for The Wider Windows you know Lucas right Luke is right that we don't know that yeah but there are certain things that we can uh that we can anticipate based on what we're looking at right now and they might they might turn out to be different and I would I would love for this to be very different but it's clear to me right now from uh from a design standpoint that this is meant to be more of a um but I think it's the world because we're saying things like it cannot do this thing yeah right now it can't right but it they are currently showing in their stuff that it can so we need to be clear when saying that I don't know that might be FNB it could be so we need to be clear when saying that that this preview view build can't do this yet sure but I can't test this thing and maybe we'll know when it releases on Tuesday or whenever it's releasing because like look at look at this turn on dark mode searching for the right action generating answers dark mode turned on so like can it actually do that I don't know from our testing can we tell that it can't do that no because this is not the same version but this is what they released today it's just so irrelevant yeah so look it can turn on dark mode did it actually do it I don't think it did click yes let's see right but you didn't have to click yes on their thing there you go there's your dark mode so it can change settings but the dark mode on their thing doesn't like explode over the screen all beautiful like I mean there's no way that that is going to be a feature of anything that's definitely not a thing so it's cool though it's clear that it's been judged up a little bit yes and what will land in however many days until it comes is probably somewhere in between that and this yeah and I would say I would anticipate it will be closer to this and that and that is in my opinion totally fair to say sure we just have to make it very clear very clear so we are not talking about the thing that's in the news article that we're addressing the thing that's releasing around the corner we're talking about this preview build that we have that is clearly not the same one because there's no mic etc etc etc if they release it on Tuesday and there's no mic that would be hilarious sure but we can't actually say that that's like gonna be a thing or not look the only thing that I'm taking away from this is that it's pretty clear that the usefulness will be fairly limited oh yeah probably it's it's very clear that if this is anywhere near where they were at any point in time that was not a year ago that this is it's going to be quite Limited yeah so that's that's my only point I think that's a pretty I think that's a pretty realistic assessment you could be I'm not even say you could you could be right because all you're saying is that we don't know for sure and that's fair enough but it could be entirely different it could also be literally exactly the preview build that we just tried it could also be like with no change yeah absolutely we just don't know I'd be surprised if it doesn't have a mic because to me what I'm seeing right now is this is this is clippy that I can interact with with my voice and it will be some combination of chat GPT and maybe being able to do some stuff for me but its utility is going to be really limited like I can already tell from that organize my windows thing that that's not going to be how that works how on Earth would it know which window I want to make big in the top left quadrant or yeah I mean that's the other thing too is like aerosnap I I really can't remember the new branding for it so I'm just going to call it Arrow snap forever that's my commitment how could it possibly know if I want one thing to take up the entire half of the screen and then I want the other two in quadrants it wouldn't it would need user interaction for that so the version that we see here honestly looks a lot more realistic where it takes one of my windows snaps it to the side and kind of asks me to ask me to select another one and actually kind of useful for people that aren't used to Windows snapping because it can get a little weird a big issue I have with this though is the number of different ways that I'm expected to interact with this computer it's slow I either need to use my voice which I think you have to click the mic to reprompt the voice every time I think unless I well I know that Windows has had voice prompt support in the past although when they killed Cortana I don't know if that died like can you can you say hey Bing and have your mic wake up on your computer I don't even know I've never had a reason to bother setting that up if it even exists so I I have to activate a voice prompt somehow which means I either have to touch my keyboard to hit a hotkey or I have to interact with my trackpad or my mouse and click on something I then need to say something out loud I then need to wait around for a data center somewhere to receive that that audio file because they're probably not doing the processing locally I then need to wait for it to searching searching figure out if it can do something and I then need it to apply it um it feels oh right and then in order to apply it in many cases I'm either going to have to basically do it myself or I'm going to have to click on something or otherwise can confirm you need to click on the yes is like anytime you're I I okay I've I've had I've had a lot of people point out to me that I don't use uh Ctrl shift escape to open task manager and my response to that is my hand's already on the mouse my hand wasn't on my keyboard the fastest tool is the one that's already in your hand in a lot of cases and if my hands are already on the keyboard you know by all means Ctrl shift Escape let's go right if your hands are on the keyboard because of typing what you just typed so it's yeah the little see I really hope that the build that we get has an easier way for me to just press enter like enter confirm enter to confirm or or maybe yeah maybe just I don't know if Escape for no is good or not but maybe enter for confirm and backspace for no ah I don't know because in a text box those both already kind of have meanings no I know yeah it would have to only work if you haven't typed anything yet and then the second you type anything both those controls go away here's the only way I've thought of it working here's the last thing I want to know about this preview build okay okay all right what was I looking for the other day oh no oh no yeah this isn't going to be any better oh no really this it Sleep Country Canada falls under best match and change when the PC sleeps when plugged in is number three are you  kidding me you guys web results really shouldn't show up in there I hate it so much or they fine fine maybe they do but if I search for just sleep what are the freaking odds what are the odds Microsoft that I am looking for Sleep Country Canada instead of power sleep and battery settings also can I can I try some oh no sorry not that one can I try something really quick here can I can I open these in a new tab I want to know what the difference is between all these different things what are these Okay so we've got change from the PC sleeps when plugged in okay so that's power and battery hold on sleep okay we've got oh they're different they're different genius okay we've got choosing energy efficient sleep settings okay so it's just all the different things and it just highlights it okay where'd one of the other ones go oh power sleep and battery settings okay so that's just this that's just two names for the same things same thing sure okay fine good enough my mattress anywhere else oh no everyone's just talking about Sleep Country no I'm not gonna lie the second you said that that jingle immediately [Music] um I'll say this there's a lot of good reasons to buy a mattress somewhere else and we'll just leave it at that God uh talk about one you land Center uh yeah sure I I I have had an extremely challenging week um but also an extremely exciting week did you realize that the first video about the land Center at the at the at the new house can I even call it a new house anymore it has it's been three years it's got some scuffs on it like it's it's not new new that's for sure uh it's still it's still great and I still love it and I'm you know I'm really excited about all the things that we've done with it and actually there's still still lots of plans but I don't know if it's new anymore so whatever my house um the first video that we did unveiling the one you gaming systems that we were gonna put in the rack to have like super super high gaming density in the wreck that was almost a year ago since then I have had laptops that I borrowed from work set up at all those stations yeah 11 months ago this is my new gaming PC one upcs for my new house part one that design completely thrown away completely gone then it gets even better uh we then did a follow-up video a couple months ago I think it was where we unveiled the all-new design we ran into some problems it was validated quite well by the team super proud of the team you know great job um but they didn't try a fiber optic DisplayPort cable so what happened was the layout of that system had the GPU on the inside which is totally a thing especially for compute oriented rack mount machines where they'll just yeah they'll just like have a bunch of gpus lined up in there they don't have display out anyway so who cares these do have display out but they had a solution to that we were going to have uh just little pass-through cables that and just have a um uh like a female jacket the back of the case to a male going into the GPS fancier than you would have needed to do really yeah so pretty sick oh yeah or just well a pass-through just a grommets looking good that's rough because all of a sudden what you're doing is way better I'm just saying like this is not an impossible to overcome problem yeah that's fine okay there's a couple of reasons that it was um the way the internal layout was there was no there was no space with like the power supply we needed and the GPU and the cable coming out of it like it actually didn't fit in the width and then number two was that if you ran something through a grommet in a rack mount you'd have no way to pull it out without unless you had a bunch of slack at the back and you had it like perfect I have one of those things where you have like the coiled cable on like a yeah like a track it's a bad solution like yeah so anyway um so that design had to be substantially changed because all of a sudden we couldn't have the GPU inside the case so uh this was a really good idea I can't remember if this was Jake or Antoine but uh someone came up with the idea of okay we'll hold on a second why don't we just borrow an idea from some other GPU servers and put the gpus at the front have front i o because I mean track Mount right you can have yep stuff in the back stuff I mean honestly if I thought of it I would have put the networking in the front too why on Earth why on Earth do the vast majority of rackmount network switches have all their ports at the front and the vast majority of rack mount systems have all the ports I actually don't understand this to be clear some do some do have ports at the front yeah they definitely don't all they definitely don't all and the the vast majority of networking is in the front of the rack that's a pretty good question and I'm sure there's reasons for it because you know just having everything water falling down the rack to the systems at the front it's not necessarily better than running everything around to the back anyway but I get it I get it I get it but um the point is that we borrowed that idea and we went to roll everything out and there were some big challenges it turns out that having um five different people build all five of the systems results in five different sort of types of mistakes that can get made so I ended up spending somewhere in the neighborhood of between like 15 and 18 hours over the span of the Friday night the weekend and then a couple of nights this week putting all of the finishing touches on these systems there were some extra standoffs in one of them that was really awkward because I had to reposition the reset switch and the system was on and I was just plugging in a header which doesn't matter and the board flexed more than I expected because there wasn't a standoff in a spot where there should be one and it shorted out on a standoff that wasn't supposed to be there so that was a really scary moment fortunately it survived um but I also man I finally I did the works okay I finally did it I custom terminated cables for every system in my rack they are exactly exactly oh my gosh the right length um the water cooling to the pool is in oh wait for all the one used to oh yeah oh there are six systems running off it now my personal machine all five of the one use right now right this very moment now all those systems wow that's actually pretty cool are cooled by the pool um all the cable management at the back is such that I can have if I need to perform maintenance on a system I can have it unplugged out of the Rack in about 30 to 40 seconds and I've temporarily because this is something hopefully I won't be doing a lot of but I've got a radiator pump res combo and tubing whips with quick connects sitting on a bench I can have it on that bench and plugged into those in about another 30 seconds and I can have it I can have it booted in well under two minutes to do any kind of diagnostic anything because I ran into some weird issues out of the five systems two of them wouldn't update the BIOS just I had one that was just resetting every time I tried to do it when it was in the rack and running over display I mean you never know theoretically Optical DisplayPort is totally transparent to the system but you know I don't know that but the display would just turn off sometimes when I took it out and I put it on the bench it just immediately worked and the and the screen never flickered or went away so yeah you you just you want to eliminate variables you know when in doubt when something's going wrong you just take out any potentially unusual circumstances around the system put it on a bench you plug in just a keyboard just a monitor and power and that's it nothing fancy I actually want the most whenever I'm troubleshooting I don't want anything good I want the most basic old thing that just works yeah that's a long time there give me DVI all the techies would go around with uh PS2 keyboards because there's like a huge chance that your USB keyboard wasn't going to work in BIOS or whatever 100 it's kind of funny um man there's gonna be there's definitely going to be multiple videos coming so we've got the one where we finally show the actual final build of these machines uh we've got one where uh we do the plumbing for the whole pool water cooling and we show um what's the order of these videos can be released in there's been some debate internally okay I think right now building a final final underscore three underscore final for real this time system is coming next okay and then plumbing and uh so Plumbing the house and then Plumbing final State all five of them into it yeah is coming next and then I actually need a bit more time to do a more thorough thermal investigation so I had all five of the land systems running for Mark simultaneously which means at about 320 330 watts per 3080 they have 3080s in them just because they are a banging deal and I wanted to go EVGA one last time yeah EVGA doesn't have 40 series I also said I wouldn't go for these series and I was like you know what EVGA one last time so all of them have EVGA xc3 3080s in them or something like that so that's about 320 watts each times five so with the CPUs as well we're looking at about 2 000 Watts now here's the thing Alex and Jake talked me into using a heat exchanger instead of doing just the pool Loop going directly into the systems and from look guys from from day one I've known that they are right about that but I think you guys know that I like to live on the bleeding edge and what the heat exchanger isn't is living on the bleeding edge because you're going to be giving up some performance okay a heat exchanger operates most efficiently when the difference in temperature between the fluids that are flowing through it is very high but you gotta remember one of my goals for this project is to cool the room so it is actually not great for me even if it's fine for the system to have the coolant on the room side be 10 degrees higher than the pool yeah so I think it is possible that post payoff with the heat exchanger might come out I might figure out how to fly a little closer to the Sun and run the pool and just to just to make sure you guys understand um it's not pool water pool water yeah there's no salt or chlorine it's a loop that is embedded it's just it's just plastic tubing that's embedded in the walls and the floor of the pool so it just loses heat over that in immense distance to the concrete of the pool into the ground um this is really cool it was like super late it was like five in the morning or something like that and I was like okay so this is neat I can see the temperature difference with the thermal camera of the water going out of the house and coming back in so obviously it is losing some heat out there and we reached an equilibrium point where the uh inside temperature I think was ugh I'm gonna get some of this wrong so there's going to be a video and and we'll get all the details right in that but um somewhere between eight and nine degree Delta between the inside loop and the outside Loop but what I didn't know was where is the heat being lost because the run is far like it's is it all I think you just said this but is it all copper piping there's no copper oh it's all plastic oh okay yeah so it's a mixture of PVC and um think it's PEX I'm not sure exactly what the stuff they use for like in-floor heating is but like that red stuff that they embed in the in the floor for like in-floor heating it's just the opposite of that it's in floor well it's in floor heating the pool but in floor cooling the water so anyway um so what okay there you go packs so what I was thinking was wait there's an access hatch out there what if I take the thermal camera outside and go right next to the pool and to my delight even though it is so far like we discovered this back when we did whole room water cooling we weren't actually dissipating any of the flipping heat outside because we were just shedding all of it inside the room with the copper tubing and I thought I'd have the same problem even though it's plastic obviously it dissipates some heat otherwise in-floor heating wouldn't work right yeah but even though it was small there was a difference in the temperature of the water going into the walls of the pool and coming out of the walls of the pool works I actually think like I I actually think it freaking works which is so exciting um yes Bots and floor plane shots is 90 degree Delta is significant yeah that's big yeah but what that ah and what that means is that the room is not that cool yeah also I uh there was a there was a fundamental flaw in the plan because from the start I said look I want to cool down this room but but um what I didn't really account for was that the vast majority of the heat that I would be removing with this system was net new heat all the switches and like nvrs and the servers I'm not going to water cool like the hard drives in my server yeah all that heat is not getting dumped into the water and so all the systems that are dumping heat into the water are being added to the room so the good news is at least you're not increasing yeah yes yeah it's not substantially harder yeah but it's very clear to me that in addition to what I've got going on in there now I'm gonna have to add like a radiator door or even just a janky radiator plumbed to the pool water just like I had before to just take hot air in that hot corner of the room right behind the rack just said you live in Canada if you want to cool the room uh just put in a window one problem it's in like the yeah yeah it's well it's not but it also the there's no window going in yeah let me put it that way there we go no window going into it so issues there um and then two that's actually a huge problem in BC is a lot of our housing was built with no air conditioning in mind at all or just cooling in mind at all and now the summers are getting like really unsustainably hot and it's like actually a huge problem yeah so many people are are putting in uh move the stupid heat exchanger outside no no that doesn't help that doesn't help because it's there's there's still like the tubing in the reservoir and and all that like it's it it's not a bad idea but no the heat exchanger is going to stay inside for also for maintenance the other thing too is that a huge part of the point of this was I didn't want to waste the Heat yeah I'm paying for the heat anyway right when you power a computer you're paying for heat so if you could do something useful with it then you might as well and obviously I you know I what what I'm Gonna Save like 20 bucks on like the heating bill for the pool 50 bucks a month probably probably not even that much like but yeah maybe maybe I saved 20 bucks on the pool heating bill or something like that but 20 bucks is 20 bucks that by a bunch of months yeah it was more it was more just like a proof oh I mean I'll never make back what I spent on the implementation of this no if it wasn't for Content but it would make no sense but it's cool and the thing is that you don't have to do it like this I think a lot of people watch our videos and kind of go that's totally impractical nobody would ever do it like that and it's like yeah I know but but you could but you could do it like kind of like Pimp My Ride yeah like I remember uh when when we did uh Taran uh old Taran not new Taran when we did old terran's extreme Tech upgrade he had kind of a janky version of essentially what I'm doing where I have my system connected to fiber optic cables in a different room right he just like but he just had copper cables and he just had it like running under his door but it achieves the exact same thing it was so cool because I was like hey hey that's that thing that we made that video about but done for like 23 dollars instead of you know 500 or you know whatever it costs for a bunch of fiber optic cabling and uh uh and you know in some cases having to have like a contractor run it or you know digging around in your crawl space or like um like what ant venom did yeah when he essentially did whole room water cooling but just put it in his basement where it was a much shorter run and where he didn't have to have something outside that could you know hazardously fall off of a roof at some point which never happened no miraculously I got to it before it fell down that was not good craftsmanship what happened with that roof mount that's Linus what plan is for winter um okay so I think we're gonna look into whether it makes more sense to drain the pool to winterize it or um or just run it at a really low temperature like I think I've heard that if you just run it at like 10 degrees or 5 degrees or something like that that's that's actually pretty good it has a it has a cover like it has a uh like a not a lid but it but it has a cover which apparently helps with efficiency like flipping a lot yeah um I am a little bit worried about like dew point and con condensation um however the heat exchanger might be an advantage then so here here's something I don't know what I do know is that as you go you know a couple meters underground the temperature is basically like kind of fixed year round and that's one of the big reasons that geothermal heating and cooling works so well because you can attach a heat pump to it and you can basically extract heat from the ground or um put heat into the ground and it's it's Limitless in its capacity both ways because it basically is this fixed temperature kind of year round but what I don't know is whether that applies to two meters down in a pool where the dudes kind of has outside air exposure props so probably not but then if there's water in it but then if that water is heated a bit or something yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure exactly where your where you're dumping most of the heat to because on the one side of the tubes you've got the water and then on the other side of the tubes you've got the Earth so where's the where's the Heat going it's gonna basically you know path of least resistance yeah probably probably some both ways but I don't know where the bulk of it is and so I basically my plan and this is a very Linus plan is to keep an eye on it as the temperatures fall and um just react see how that goes yeah I'm definitely going to put antifreeze in it I don't want it to freeze out there you know so I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go ham I I know like in the ocean from like scuba diving I'm sure you've experienced this the further down you go the colder it gets um but I don't I don't know if the pool is really deep enough to have much of that property I don't know I have no idea I don't know and I don't know how much of that changes when you cover the pool because a lot of that happens from how much sunlight is able to penetrate the water so if you're covering the pool and it becomes zero anyways I don't know how much impact that has because the water is going to churn to a certain degree so I don't know not sure yeah I don't know I mean it could be it could be that if I do ultimately turn to my direct pool cooling system that I might have to have like uh like a valve yeah yeah so that in the winter I'm actually using the heat exchanger just to make sure that I don't you know run zero degree or five degree freaking water into my rack and then end up with a bunch of condensation in it yeah yeah it's interesting yeah it's not a bad idea actually yeah okay okay speaking of not bad ideas I have another idea because I was sitting here thinking hey hold on a second in the winter do I really want to put this heat outside I mean it get like kind of you know it's it's fine okay so you're gonna need like a series hold on just hold on I'm gonna get there you know kind of like you know obviously if we do keep the pool filled then it'd be better to like you know have a little bit of Heat going in there that's not burning gas for no reason but then okay hold on hear me out new pitch there's a fireplace in the living room that we don't use and is still not even hooked up properly because you know contractor things uh yes so I pitched to Yvonne okay we create this motorized or like we have like like fans that blow little like pieces of like red and orange and yellow plastic to make it kind of look like a little fire and then in the back of the fireplace I just have a radiator with fans on it that just blow server room heat into the living room all winter huh it's not as stupid as it sounds because get this the original plan for the server room was to run through these computer sorry you should get one of those like kind of crappy you see stupid commercials for them all the time but it's like a fan but the fan blades are screens and when it spins it creates an image yeah so it's it's a fan blowing the air and the fan that's blowing the air has flames on it yeah so we have these tubes that go from the server room to the side of the house we were gonna use that to run down to the pool but then the the other contractor the much worse one forgot to run two of those tubes so there was supposed to be four two for the solar hot uh hot and cold and then two for the server room hot and cold well they only ran the two so we had to use those two for the solar solar heating yeah yeah and then we had to find another path for the pool one or for the uh the server room one so it went through that conduit that existed back when the original owners of the house had wanted to put pool equipment in the basement and then that's apparently not best practice anymore so it's outside in a shed but anyway um so we have those tubes running they happen to run almost right under the fireplace in the living room so I even already have the tubes all we have to do is put some holes in the ceiling and find them ah holes in the theater room ceiling no problem life approval Factor 10 out of 10. because it's the theater room so she doesn't care yeah she shouldn't chat she probably wouldn't care about that anyway um aborno says I've always wanted to use my racks excess heat to feed a 3D printed closure see this is what I'm talking about just uh yeah no Yvonne Yvonne did not approve the radiator in the fireplace yeah my like first thought was like just put a TV in front of it and put like uh you know the like screen of a of the Yule Log fire on it I was like well that would kind of stop sort of all the airflow and also superheat a TV which doesn't sound great yeah yeah no the whole the whole point is that it's it's supposed to be a radiator that kind of looks like it it doesn't need to look like fire it just needs to look fire so we could just paint it red like Dyson fans work uh all those like air blade ones or whatever yeah I think work is a strong word for how they something but sure I've never are they bad they're they're very expensive and they're really not very effective compared to just spinning blades it's in its and it's vacuum with pressurized output is that how it works I forget I've never actually known that's just what I've assumed if you could use that same type of system and just have a bit of a like panel Gap maybe that could work I don't know hmm interesting I mean yeah it's it's not it's not happening either way it's just it's just I don't know I I just I was I I became infatuated with the idea of utilizing waste heat for something yeah yeah that's the that's the bottom line yeah seems cool so you know if there was if there was some way that you could transport the heat from your computer to somewhere where you don't have to feel it or that better yet you could use it in some way I just think that's super cool like I um okay I didn't realize this but in some houses there is a there's a loop that just has a separate pump on it that moves water around so that in key places uh like the the main like regulation ensuite bathroom you open up the hot water tap and it like has hot water right away because it just constantly has hot water I I had no idea that was even a thing so in the in the main bathroom in our house that was that was installed by the previous owners I'd never heard of that before like in our old place it took like a minute sometimes for the the hot water tap to be hot um so you know okay what if I could use my waste heat to like heat that stupid Loop that is just burning stupid gas for no stupid reason instead of like so even in the summer is what this is what I'm trying to say even in the summer there are potential uses for for Waste heat there's there's sometimes times when you might need heat for something but the problem with a computer is that you know back to what I said about the heat exchanger where part of the challenge is that the difference in temperature is not very high like the one that we're using I think is is rated for its capacity at like it's also many tens of degrees Delta between the two sides unless you mine or fold uh it's also going to be very inconsistent so you you wouldn't necessarily want to use it for something or you would not want it to be the only solution for something that's like you're actually going to care about yeah so like that that causes some issues as well if it is going to be something you're going to care about you'd have to have backup systems or whatever else yeah really I'm surprised you didn't do insta hot on every spot no that sounds that sounds expensive and just totally unnecessary I mean for me it's it's less about the cost and more about just kind of the wastefulness of it I don't think that's really necessary if that hadn't already existed um there's no way I would have installed something like that I think I can wait 30 seconds for hot water then again this is an interesting question what's more wasteful the water that you just the cold water you just dump down the sink while you wait for hot water or keeping that water I'm actually not sure I do not know the answer to this but I do know that

can I've never I've never had a onesie technically I would say or generally I would say um no I wouldn't wear clothes under it it's definitely nice and soft and comfortable okay you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm going down full send yeah I'm going down to underwear I mean they can't tell I could just be miming I could just be miming what I'm pretending to do right now Dan want to hit me with the merch message while I get uh changed I kind of like see sure wherever I can I think you can no it hurt my eyes yeah I mean yeah you do you do whatever works for you yeah but I'm I'm going onesie I'm going to be comfortable for windshield after dark today okay uh hi lld heavy when Friday question after the computer store video how did the logistics team feel when the truck came back and what's the plan for all that stuff now that it's in inventory okay so I have multiple multiple answers for that first of all uh Logistics not impressed um but that's nothing compared to how unimpressed accounting and procurement were um it turns out that you know without getting flagged for all kinds of you know auditing um doing all the reporting for something like this is is very time consuming and very complicated I mean we're still really glad we did it um Keith was even aside from what he said in the video just you know thrilled with the whole thing I mean it's uh this is stock that you know for you know whatever he might have said in the video about his his uh his bills don't buy those people were still interested in this stuff I mean I think he knew he was never getting rid of any of this stuff for any dollars let alone you know anywhere near full full sticker um which you know ultimately I did pay I paid a lot more than what stickers should have been for a lot of those items um so you know we're still glad we're glad we did it it was it was a really cool idea I've had actually I've had quite a few people ask me like where did it come from I was at the dentist um and I had to meet my family for lunch and um anyway I had to meet my family for lunch and I didn't have the car so I had to walk to the restaurant and I passed it and I was like yeah man shops like this had like how does this how does this still exist you know how is it how is this how does this work yeah you know what are these things on the Shelf why are they there what's the story behind every you know archaeological PC item on this shelf and um I figured you know what the best well you know would be really cool um is if someone just came in here and bought all this stuff so that they could get rid of it and they could have new stuff and I was like oh I'm someone um so that happened over a year ago I I thought it was about six months I told Keith I was like yeah I poked my head in like six months ago and he's like oh I would have thought I would notice that like I I watch your channel I know who you are and I was like hold on a second maybe it wasn't six months because it was when I used to go to that dentist near there and I've done two appointments at my new one and they're at least six months apart so it must have been over a year ago so I so I popped my head in and was like oh yeah we should do this and then Tanner reached out to him six months ago oh yeah yeah so that six month timing makes no sense yeah so Tanner reached out to him six months ago and then intentionally ghosted him so that he would have no idea that we were actually doing it so so he basically vetted the guy made sure he thought he'd be camera ready made sure he'd be okay with us you know coming in and taking over his store for the day and then was like radio silence so that it could be both okay and pre-approved but also a surprise uh so super cool I forget what the original question was um oh yeah Logistics how'd they feel about it so anyway really glad we did it but there's definitely some been some challenges to overcome and I think this Saga is far from over we have some ideas for what to do with the stuff I think we've got some video Concepts like I think it'd be super cool to do a video just building a computer out of my hall um I also was oh man hold on I've got I've got some ideas that I just like jotted down in the middle of the night and emailed to myself one sec so much of what happens in my brain just gets emailed to myself because that's the only way that I know how to function uh uh I guess someone saw when I stood up they said can confirm lukewarriors ldt underwear I actually wear no other kinds yep I wear only altitude I thought you're going to stop it oh no oh man no no no that's when I sleep has this for a video concept now you have a onesie yeah we go through and play a little game where I try to guess the eBay listing price of all of it combined oh no and then someone actually adds it up and we see how close I can get see like how hosed you got yeah because I'm pretty sure I watched the video I'm pretty sure I'm pretty opposed there's a lot of things in there where he was like oh this amount and I was like okay no I can't reveal this one because it might ruin it um but what about that or that's pretty good yeah I don't know that might be pretty good um oh video title he told me this was indestructible I disagree for that laptop and we basically just like kind of do uh like a how much does it take yeah to get it to a point of being destructible because like the thing's not particularly no offense to Keith's pricing model um not particularly valuable at this point in time yeah so I think if we were to if we were to just you know run some generally speaking I'm I'm opposed to destruction of working Hardware um it's it's sort of against the principles of our Channel but I think I could make an exception for an indestructible laptop I'd be an instruction test sort of thing is that a challenge total leak in float plane chat said ask some of the younger staff what the items are that's so depressing and I'm gonna write it down now it's really good I think that's really fantastic um try to get or like try to get them to even like install some of them stuff like that just ask them what they are try to get them to actually like use them or install them or do things like that I think that'd be pretty good that's freaking hilarious all right so I mean honestly I could spend the entirety of next week just making follow-up content but then the problem is that like what about you know other videos I feel like people might feel like we're milking it a bit but also all these concepts are really good like they're just good videos it doesn't matter that they're like a sequel to something that was successful I I don't know I just it's also just a great video like I didn't realize I watched it and then when I was done I was like smiling like the whole time because yeah it was it was heartwarming but also just hilarious and like there's a lot of interesting and whatnot but I didn't realize it was freaking 34 minutes I added the gambling I didn't realize that until now four o'clock the night before the shoot oh that was a great idea I was like Tanner we need that made it a lot better we need a way to keep this engaging throughout we can't just like watch me get quoted prices and put items in a bin for yeah you know at that time we were aiming for like 15 to 20 minutes for the video okay okay what can what can we do to spice this up a little bit okay games of chance um swing by the dollar store in the morning just get anything that you could conceivably turn into a game of chance so like the Pull the Rope one sure or like you know the the custom custom dice the pudding the crappy darts yeah exactly oh my goodness they were awful there's more footage of them being awful um we've got one float plane exclusive up already with extra footage from the from from that video and then uh there will hopefully be more actually we've got two videos up we have one um that's from the shoot and then we have a second one that is logistics receiving everything so if you want to see firsthand uh what that was like oh yeah unloading the tech shop wow I didn't see this yeah and then I think there's probably going to be more at some point but uh that's not a guarantee I've got to talk to the the social team about what they have going on uh oh yeah wait why is this hello oh right right right right exclusives have their own tab now uh behind the scenes unloading the tech shop yeah so the first thing we see is is I think like callanan being like um okay someone on the main account has watched this already a brother brother here's my stuff just ridiculous completely ridiculous oh man oh wow uh Community response to this one is extremely overwhelmingly positive that's awesome nice uh what was the question again I don't know my mind is so fried this week team feel when the truck came back right what's the plan for all the stuff now that you have it yeah yeah so a lot lots of different plans I uh oh right one idea we had and tell me if you think this is a good idea was to we never do like signed merchandise I think we've done it a couple times with Lambo stuff yep but other than sometimes with giveaways too but not not purchasable other than that we've never really done it and I I had someone internally pitch to me hey what if we what if we sell the items as just a signed item and then it's kind of like a random crap shoot what you're gonna get so most people will probably get a cable or something but some people will get a monitor or a Xeon server or a 3080 so you're a TV you're making a real life loot box yeah I don't know what do you think I have no idea is that is that stupid or is it smart because it'll be nowhere near what we paid just to be very clear this is not some kind of like ingenious money making scheme I suspect we walked out of there with somewhere in the neighborhood of like 300 to 700 items so even if it was like 25 bucks or something like that for for a signed piece of this video or whatever um but what what would that work out too let's say let's say I think I think you should decide the price okay chill uh I think you should decide the price after you figure out what the eBay value actually was oh interesting and then we base it on the eBay value yeah that's not an average out the eBay value I don't know if we're actually going to do that video though because like it's a lot of work a lot of work actually a ton of work more importantly I don't know how interesting that content is it feels like a part of a video instead of it feels like a short it's a ton of video and it feels like a part of a video yeah or it's a ton of work and it feels like part of a video um donate to extra life could be an easy way to just like kind of get rid of it because I don't think we want this stuff sitting around forever well see that's the thing is right now it is vary in the way yeah yeah the bigger issue is not unloading it the bigger issue is walking around it right now um yeah I don't I don't know I don't know so okay if there's 500 items and we said it's okay it's 25 bucks for a signed piece of this video that would be 12 12 000 which is a fraction of what we paid and I think probably kind of both a realistic um actual value for that stuff um and uh anyway uh yeah that's the main thing I think that's probably a fairly realistic actual value for that stuff like there is some expensive stuff in there like there's there's more than one 30 series graphics card and stuff like that but the vast majority of it is basically I mean the distribution will probably be pretty similar to what you would actually get from a loot box yeah yeah probably most of it's cables I'm really concerned about how to ship because right now we're not really set up to just ship random stuff like we're not an eBay store so we don't just have a bunch of like those expanding foam bags things yeah yeah we don't just have packing penis like nothing we sell on the store is really fragile and it all comes in its own individually packaged boxes so a lot of the time you'll see the like the the main the main carton that has smaller boxes in it won't have a ton of packing material in it because I mean what this is going to break inside its box I mean I'm sure I'm sure a courier somewhere is up to the challenge but generally speaking it doesn't really happen yeah we'll pay more than 25 for the Mac 4G Mac G4 Cube well no that's the whole point though yeah you won't get to pick if you get the G4 Cube oh right that was one of the other video Concepts doing a sleeper build in the G4 Cube I think I actually got a deal on that I don't even know if it works but uh here let's let's let's eBay that right now I know I didn't get a deal on Buzz Lightyear but I think I got a deal on the G4 Cube the Buzz Lightyear thing was hilarious this is just the power adapter whoa hold on a second wait oh okay no no no no okay okay new listing hold on yeah this is 15 bids which people want this nine days left why do people want these hold on two speakers surround hold on power adapter whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on a second did I get a deal hold on well wait this is oh wait this is just the case are these super collectible why they're uh they're a pretty interesting period of of Apple and I don't think they sold very well either there's like none yeah you got a rare computer holy crap I actually got one thing that the posters worth 20 bucks they're uh they're pretty special oh sick so then are they so special a pencil drawing of one I'm sure they don't summon me though yeah okay hold on the power bricks are 150 bucks okay are these things so special that people would be really upset if I did a sleeper build in one though that I'm not sure about but I'm not entirely sure you should let it through your fingers just yet okay well I'm not committed to I'm not committed to uh you know the the the signed loot box thing I think it'd be even cooler if the G4 Cube was the sleeper though so we do a sleeper build and then we do the like signed loot box thing and instead of getting the G4 Cube you get a sleeper gaming PC in the G4 Cube what if you uh what if you just like reproduce the cube may be slightly larger with a sleeper build in it I don't think we'd be able to do that it's it's have you have you looked at it lately it's it's basically a work of art yeah it's beautiful um okay oh the G4 Cube is yeah people are very very split in the audience over whether it's okay to uh I don't think so to cut that thing and it's pretty special special it's like art almost apparently they only sold about a hundred thousand of them or something like that yeah it doesn't sound very special to me Lou this man is so jaded look why is it art it's a box you're too mad for someone who's wearing an adorable onesie right now he looks too comfy to be this angry I am actually pretty comfy I think I got actually tired after I put it on because I was like I felt cozy you even got it on over the headphones you're ridiculous I'm like I'm fully chilling out right now it's made out of the underwear material it's I oh because it is really soft yeah that's why it's like soft and stretchy stretchy and stuff it's quite nice yeah we put a bunch of we put probably too much work into this for how many I expect us to sell but uh the team was really excited about this product and so we we did like a whole bunch of rounds of sampling to just to get it just right yeah it's it's pretty nice so it's underwear is it's like full body underwear essentially yeah it's the longest underwear yeah um do you want another merch message I sure yeah I forgot what I was even responding to at this point hit me okay hold on would you have to destroy it yeah oh yeah yeah you'd have to you'd have to significantly modify it oh right I've I put up a pole and float plane let's have a look at the results ah show results okay to sleep or build 60 say yes only okay so here's the thing this kind of poll is not really just majority rules like yeah when we asked about okay when we asked about uh posting exclusives that we had already produced during the uh production break I think about 60 percent said yes but based on that 40 percent said no we made the call to not do it because the no kind of has more weight when the when when it's something very significant I guess is what I'm trying to say if it was 98 yes two percent no then those no's get drowned out a little bit but there's it's not as simple as just okay 51 say yes okay we do it what if the parts don't work yeah does that okay okay hold on here let's let's try it let's try it again the conversation currently going on in flow plane chat and I I kind of I think that's interesting I fix I know fix Oh Sleeper no okay I'm not I'm not I'm not uh spend more to spend more money on on this yeah overpriced Cube yeah you could you could let people that care about this uh thing have the parts that don't work because maybe they can restore them or something it would probably be good to uh if you do do a sleeper build in it then make the parts available because I'm pretty sure those are difficult to come by yeah interesting um like uh for your phone uh you know that was parts that I managed to get oh do you have all the parts for that it will be here Monday I hope oh fantastic but an entire phone guess what wait what yeah that was the way oh yeah super cheap oh just an entire new phone with a broken big screen oh perfect uh because my big screen Works your big screen works so we can replace literally everything else yeah it's gonna be a Linus and Dan Extravaganza uh as it turns out I do need to fix my fold three that uh fell in the pool because there's some footage that we need for a video ironically a video about my computer breaking um that is on that phone like I didn't need any any of the family stuff I had actually backed it up about three weeks prior but and so I was already going to do the video with Dan anyway because I thought it was really interesting to just do like a phone repair video but then we discovered that I had selfie shot some stuff that had not been ingested in that three weeks before it died in just and so we actually do need to get the data off it the good news is based on the symptoms I've seen I think it's just a busted battery and then Dan also found some corrosion on one of the daughter boards yeah um I might be a little bit more severe we don't know yet it seems like definitely it wants to have two batteries and one of them is just absolutely puff to maximum it's so puffed that one of the displays We're not gonna have to uh heat up to get the adhesive loose it's all it removed half of the glued on display which was really nice yeah and thankfully that's a feature not a bug and it seems like that is the side that may have got a far more uh water in it than than the other one which might be okay so we'll see we will see and the side that got a lot less water is the main board that's the important one yeah with the storage chips on it and the soc so so I'm I'm pretty hopeful honestly speaking and um what I'm excited for is if the main board doesn't work we have a bunch of Reflow tools and so what we'll have to do because I got you a working phone but it's all broken we'll have to take the soc sorry we'll have to take the memory chips and Transplant them that won't work that'll be uh that'll be the Hail Mary I know I really I I sincerely we can just like message Drive Savers or something hey hey does do they because if you if you if you oh if you cared that much yeah then yeah if you no I don't I don't mean to send it to them I just mean we could just ask them is there any point doing this because I think the answer is no I think if you decouple the controller from the nand chips um the new controller no longer knows where anything is and should take the controller too uh well the controller should be on the soc let's take the soc okay right but then if it's but you see where we're going yeah I see where we're going we're going in down a rabbit hole Yeah that's why it's a Hail Mary yeah I don't think we're gonna go down I don't think we'll need to I think I would rather I would rather just reenact me in the server room discovering that my computer is broken I think that would be better honestly we'll see we'll see I can I'm hopeful I put the act in reenactment so I'm in my computer room right now I can't believe this my system it just it just I was in the middle of using it and it turned off what the hell what the heck I thought I'm a tech tips man why is my computer broken I'm pretty sure I can pull it off uh hold on we got a second merch message of the three this is going very smoothly uh can you ask Luke how he got that star field constellation Edition watch uh I bought it he just he just I don't believe you I actually did hold on a second oh my God hold on oh no hold on what have you done with Luke hold on a second 300 did you oh no you also get the game and you get other stuff too I've bought Collector's Editions before okay that's that's true he does buy physical copies of games this is a thing he does yeah dude the physical copy is not a disc but it's like a it's a credit stick from the game it's actually kind of cool why are these pictures so small this is stupid this is kind of dumb yeah wait so are you wearing it right now what's right here oh why is it sitting on your keys well because I took it off because the onesie sleeve goes all the way oh all right I didn't want to like make it look weird so what it what what kind of watch is it is it smart or is it just like uh it's a smart okay so it's I call it a last last last last last last gen Smartwatch I see yeah but it's like actually kind of nice oh so it doesn't have a touch screen no cool four buttons around it the left side is up and down top right I think is like settings and then bottom right is I think back cool definitely need the leather strap if there's another strap option I don't remember what exactly it is that's the standard you can get any strap I think it looks great it has a step counter on it sure it shows your notifications on the screen you can change your music on your phone with it heck yeah yeah all right hello dll off topic but will the Badminton Center have rental rackets yes yeah I think it's really silly that a lot of places don't have rental rackets and Rental shoes it's like such a nominal investment that pays for itself so quickly how could you possibly not I just I can't fathom it um just it I think one of the challenges is that a lot of sports facilities are run by Sports people and not business people and like to be clear I don't even mean like like like business business monsters you know like nickel and diming everything or whatever I just mean sort of just generally Financial efficiencies and things if your general efficiencies like I you know to me it's just uh it's just a no-brainer that okay you can get a decent racket for like 80 Canadian dollars so that's like 60 US Dollars your cost is less than that let's assume your cost is like 45 or 40 bucks you can rent that racket out for like five dollars ten bucks so in in somewhere between four and ten rentals you have completely covered your cost on it and everything from there is brand new money you would have not obtained if you just if you didn't make that small investment that's just very obvious to me that you just need to do it um yes badminton has specific shoes Bots they're for the court their Court shoes you don't want to Scuff the you wear them when you get a parking ticket oh just trying to figure out how to make that into a court joke and I couldn't this man's a professional okay no I got one more maybe slightly longer one if you want or we'll save it for later um let's see high dll Apple's proprietary M chips are very powerful and efficient why don't we see Intel and AMD start having Ram as part of the system on the chip ddr5 should run much faster in this case oh man um with uh hold on eventually hold on no no no no no I'm sorry yeah hold on hold on one big board risk future risk is good yay ah crap I can't find it right now but if you actually if you look at the if you watch the video we made recently called starting at is the biggest lie in Tech or something like that um there's an Asus laptop that I believe is either available now or will be available very soon that uses a very similar um RAM on package Asus laptop here I really would like to find it dang it I do not want this future I want upgradability and interchangeability I can't just mean mental I can't find it the point is it's coming it's coming now uh it's I mean it's and it's not just laptops like you know we kind of oh it's everything yeah everything is configurable it's it's it's not even it's not yeah it's it's even in the data center where we're seeing we're seeing chips that have hbm right on them well that's not upgradable right whether it's like nvidia's um uh uh Grace Hopper or gray Superchip or whatever it's called Uh I think Intel has some stuff coming um it's it's it's coming and the reality of it is this is reflective of how the users of these products use them and not just something that's being pushed on us by the manufacturers like I remember my mind being blown the first time someone told me that in a data center like in a scale data center like that someone like a Google might run or an Amazon when a server is bad if a stick of ram goes bad it is not uncommon for them to rip that server out put a new one in and basically just send that to the scrap the storage and put it in a heap for you know whoever our partner is who flips these things on eBay you get rid of it it's gone it's out whole server not not a drive whole server and I was like what shouldn't they just have an IT room where they like fix them and the answer was at that scale it's not a good use of time it's a better use of time to just throw in a known good brand new working server and not deal with that because they have enough to do and I the the the the the DIY are in me just just about died hearing that but then if that's true if that's the case at least in some at least in some places uh at real scale they do this with entire racks of Kit not just Services yeah we have this topic later in the doc which is Intel's meteor Lake launches in December but people have linked articles talking about how it has LP ddr5 on chip lpddr5x Intel demos meteor Lake CPU with on package LP ddr5x is a Toms Hardware article yeah there you go through but yeah uh there there's one Asus laptop that we pointed out in that video though that I believe is already using uh on package memory or if not on package it's very very close yeah um and they and by doing that they were able to run at much much higher frequencies compared to running in a dim or even being soldered to the main board but farther away just the signal Integrity is so much better so so right so back to the servers for a second this coupling of CPU to memory is reflective then of the use case I mean most people treat their computer like a microwave and I know this is this is the kind of thing that I think is hard for us to wrap our brains around but for most people when their computer is dead the computer is dead yeah yeah and you can take it to a repair shop but as we know if you've ever taken something to a repair shop I mean they want 60 bucks to put in a memory module right so imagine how much it costs if you want them to substantially repair the computer it actually doesn't necessarily make Financial sense to rep to have that computer repaired by someone else it makes sense for us because we're going to fix it ourselves right are you trying to get something to Jacob Danes yeah the former leader of the pirate party of Canada We're In The Presence at royalty um let's see how this goes is this to do with the buzzing are we like trying to figure it out right now or something what is he even doing here what time is it I can't I actually can't let you log into my phone I'm sorry oh there's like multiple not even works look how red he is his mom watches the show just wait for them with the ones look how red he is that took no time did I get a nerve I was gonna say if you wanted to like text it you could do that I just can't let you on to the actual phone itself that is so you need to do something to it is there like a do you need Dev mode okay sounds good all right um anywho you don't have to do that what was I talking about right right so so this is reflective of the way that people are using this Hardware anyway right right but consumer technology right so people don't people don't upgrade stuff yeah they don't repair stuff because it's not cost effective if you're going to spend 300 repairing a computer you bought for a thousand dollars five years ago it's probably not even worth three hundred dollars and something else might fail now yes but and and whether it would or wouldn't I could see that being the mentality well if the if the Transmissions going then probably the you know I'm gonna need to change all the belts soon anyway and then you know probably the the power windows are gonna start jamming realistically you know at what point does whether it's a car a computer or whatever else at what point does it just turn into a money pit and it's better to start over new and I think that whether it's uh um whether it's true or not a lot of people have that perception of computers so if people are just going to go hey my computer's slow I need a new one anyway then I think from the manufacturer's standpoint they're sitting there going okay well this is slower which makes us less competitive it costs more which makes us less competitive and people aren't even asking for this why are we doing this and so you know in some cases I do think Apple does things that I then get very frustrated by because they weren't necessary and the rest of the industry just goes there but in this case they're probably just ahead of the Curve we were headed there anyway I mean we've been talking about this ever since what was it like fifth gen I think fifth gen core it was rumored that Intel would solder desktop CPUs to motherboards and we were we were mad about it I mean I think justifiably so but it was it's been clear the writing's been on the wall for the better part of a decade now so maybe writing is on the wall in regards to who's going to purchase the thing which is going to drive engineering decisions at companies like this but I would say I still don't think it's necessarily a good thing um because someone could repair it eventually even if the initial consumer isn't going to repair it no you're right it doesn't mean that someone couldn't repair it eventually tell me this okay I'm totally pivoting a little bit here in the world we live in today with security vulnerabilities being as impactful as they are and as widespread as they are should we be running 10 year old processors or should they just go to the Scrapper and retrieve the goal um I think for individual consumers I think a lot of the CPU level vulnerabilities that we've had are not really that big of a deal yeah be completely honest yet sure fair enough I just uh but a lot of them have required targeted attacks if I'm remembering correctly sure okay um So speaking of targeted attacks uh did you know that we would need someone's permission to drive by their house with a password cracking server and break into their Wi-Fi because it's illegal not surprised why'd I bring that up I would have just done it anyways no reason I was I didn't care anywho [Laughter] if it was a really powerful password cracking server oh you're gonna try to hit me I don't know I just the people and good luck people exist and uh really powerful password cracking servers exist yeah from kamino hypothetically yeah uh if a company called Camino existed then maybe they would have a really powerful server that could be used for cracking passwords I thought this was I thought you were referencing something I had said no a bit ago but okay sounds like no oh we've got some good videos coming out in the next little bit here like seriously we've got uh I reviewed one just before the land show um checking out LaserDisc I had only had one experience with LaserDisc and it was extremely brief not even I didn't even get to watch a whole movie uh so we gotta have you ever tried LaserDisc no you know how big they are right uh aren't they like records yeah they're records yes yeah yeah but they look like giant CDs like novelty sized CDs um I've never actually seen one in person and they have movies I don't know about them yeah you can store like an hour of footage per side so if you watch a two-hour movie you actually have to get up in the middle and flip it Lord of the Rings is like four discs yeah yeah and the the they're double-sided so it's uh so it's yeah it's two hours per disc but it's one hour per side so you're gonna be you're gonna be getting you're gonna be getting up to flip your precious over pretty often I think yeah so Lord of the Rings uh wait Lord of the Rings The Two Towers run time is two hours and 59 minutes with that said um Lord of the Rings was never released on LaserDisc so it's not an issue but no I know I just think it would be fun Gone With the Wind sure was and that's like a three and a half hour movie or something like that so you'd be getting up like four times to or five times to flip the disc or whatever the math Works no four times I think um anyway uh there were just before anyone jumps in with the you know correction uh there were more advanced players that had read heads on both sides but you still had to get up and change the disc if the movie's longer than two hours which a lot of movies are that's not the extended I'm trying to find the actual extended edition times but either way regardless it's long yeah so that video is coming out I think this weekend uh we have another one coming this weekend on RF blocking paint so we found this site that kind of pedals in um digital smog like conspiracy uh uh cures and and remedies and they have RF blocking paint that you can use to paint your room to keep the to keep the 5G out brilliant um it's I don't want to spoil too much but it works shockingly well really yeah it's actually kind of cool yeah so it's the first would you say this is the first legit use of the RF uh the EMC chamber like in video no no oh he's eating is there yeah he's having some dinner doesn't the wall block the 5G though no no the 5G millimeter wave yeah it could be blocked by a piece by this this garment um but a non-millimeter wave no no it can like pass through stuff is there yeah a bunch of people in chat are asking this too um it's not lead paint is it oh yeah oh oh well yeah that's good yeah yeah like I took it and I brought it with me like this wow no it's not lead paint you know I believed it oh man come on the extended times are three hours and 48 minutes for Fellowship 3 hours and 55 minutes for two hours and four hours and 23 minutes for return to the king okay so okay so for Return of the King hold on one side two sides two hours three days three side four side so you have to get up so you have to put it in you have to get up to change it that's one getting up you have to get up to put in the second disc you have to get up to flip the second disc and you have to get up to put in the third disc if it existed you would have to get up four times during the movie including how long was it four hours and uh four hours and 23 minutes including one time 23 minutes before the end of the movie to basically just watch the epilogue essentially yikes that's pretty Epic uh oh we're supposed to do some more topics hey wolfic says here's the question how many movies are even less than an hour oh no so you're gonna be flipping no matter what you're watching unless you have one of the fancy dual head ones yeah whoa so it doesn't even flip it itself it just starts playing so there's like maybe a blip and they're like for commercial there were commercial Solutions like really advanced stuff where you it had like Changers remember CD Changers well there were laser disk Changers but it was not for movies it was for like karaoke yeah one of the big benefits of LaserDisc was it was to my knowledge the earliest home format to support multiple audio tracks my dad used to run it uh like one of its major adoptions was karaoke because you can have all of these tracks on one big disk and then you want to go to the next one well it's right here on the disk done instant every single time you know it's awesome plus video I'm pretty sure that came through the mic yeah so yeah for karaoke they would have entire libraries and it was so cool because you could have the vocal track in the music track separated which for karaoke I think has pretty obvious benefits um anywho we should probably do another topic or two because we have sort of oh oh well I think we should probably do this topic what the one I highlighted okay you'll find about it whoop whomp I'm sad I'm genuinely sad we have made the difficult decision to not move forward with LTX 2024. um there are four key reasons uh one the vast majority of our company does not focus on events um and while our core competencies like technology media production do overlap somewhat with event running the vast majority of our time and effort is spend on other things which means that we do not have well-established processes and workflows and running events at a large scale um requires well-established processes and workflows or you end up with a lot of inefficiency and you end up with a lot of stress so that's I I the biggest reason but also very closely related to the next reason which is also the biggest reason and that's crunch while there is a lot of work that can be done in advance of an event like LTX there's also an enormous amount of work that has to be done in the days or even the hours immediately before the doors open this puts a ton of strain on the entire team um another big reasons cost um you know I want to be transparent with you guys that's that's that's the way we run this company that's the way we run this channel LTX 2023 was profitable which is good but there's also an enormous opportunity cost compared to focusing on our regular activities meaning that prioritizing LTX doesn't necessarily make the most sense and remember part of that opportunity cost is not just money part of it is also process and and quality of life for the team and all those things I mean I even said on Wan show at ltx23 when Luke asked me the hard question of is it coming back I talked about this I talked about the crunch I talked about how even if it does make money that doesn't mean it necessarily makes sense um I asked him then because I was trying to get him to commit to it before he thought about it logically no I had already been thinking about it a lot um number four is it's not all about money of course LTX was born out of a desire to serve the community and other creators but again it's clear that for the investment we made into LTX which was very substantial there are many other opportunities that we could pursue for collaborations and Community engagement that might be more exciting and don't cause the same degree of strain for the people that work on the events so that's what it pretty much comes down to we do have some alternative things to be excited about one of them is whale then um we are going to continue doing whale lands aiming for anywhere from 200 to 300 attendees per one I'd like to do them more often than just once a year personally I'd be down to do it once every couple months once every few months I've had some people approach me internally and say hey they think that's too much and it won't be special anymore or something like that I I honestly think it'd be in some ways more special I think it'd be just such a such a just hang out um just kind of break the routine LTX was a really cool event for the fans as a whole but whale land I have more personal fun at so and I and if we could do more whale lands and if we could bring some elements of LTX to whale land like maybe at a whale in we have a a a tech Midway like we had at LTX or you know some of the the con evil you know games or or things like that like I I think there's ways for us to make whale land really amazing you could still even potentially have like the the uh water cooling educational Workshop thing totally like if someone like a rod came up um you know there's no reason why we couldn't you know do something like that okay yeah at this whale land uh we're going to be doing two bending 101. yeah maybe it doesn't run the whole time because maybe rod wants to play some games too yeah like and maybe someone like Rod actually gets to play games for a change yeah I'm not convinced he actually plays games I think he just like builds cool computers I thought he was really into it wasn't it War Thunder or something I don't know I've never seen him actually play a game but I've seen him build a lot of cool computers that's all I'm saying that's all I'm saying I've seen them do both I've seen him build far more cool computer he says he says he says yes yeah I'm not sure what he's responding to exactly because of the chat delay but definitely yes my dad says there should be quarterly will end okay all right all right all right Rob I'm on it we're working on it we need a facility first geez excitement is High um so yeah I um this was uh this was a super emotional decision for I shouldn't say decision for me because I didn't make the decision I was involved in the decision I I laid out my points I ultimately did Advocate against future ltx's just for look I mean okay maybe I'm speaking out of turn here um Colton basically said Point Blank if we're doing LTX again I can't do this um I don't blame him it like it's it's it's brutal um and and and so it's like it's not it's not just like I have I have said the whole so he he was against I was four I have said the whole time though that I'm happily voting for as someone who had nothing to do with any of the work that was involved in it I think my vote was probably like the least valuable out of all of them um because I was the least attached out of everyone I think genuinely um so it's easy for me to say yeah we should keep doing it I had some arguments which were like it was profitable and getting cons to a profitable point is very difficult and cons tend to have natural inherent growth and become very highly profitable on the high end and I do think we were trending in that direction um and there were a lot of like Financial efficiency things that we I think did quite poorly with this time around we could have saved more money which could have made more money both at the same time all this kind of stuff but yeah all the work and stuff involved and there is still the opportunity cost and Min maxing the work and profit was never what LTX was about yeah and so I feel like you're right the con could have become a huge profit Center you are right but it wouldn't have been LTX anymore and that was a big part of I think it could still be I think it would be a very very difficult path to navigate yeah and potentially not worth it and maybe whale land is how we can keep that fun small I do I do like I I think it's pretty cool that there's a plan instead yeah oh oh yeah I think that's pretty cool yeah because just dropping it and be like guess we're never doing it again would kind of suck which I also didn't say yes I said we are not doing 2024. yeah um uh but like yeah whale then the fact that we will have a facility that we like know the people who own it means that the rate we'll be paying is I don't know nothing uh means that we can just we can price the tickets at something that we feel is is is the very least reasonable not what the market will bear yeah but like reasonable but also you know we need to make sure the time makes sense for our our team to put work into it and make it a really cool event um but not worry about pinching pennies so we could just make it a really cool event and just make it fun right oh Sean sorry I'm going to derail slightly I just Sean lmg in footprint chat just spoke uh I I wasn't sure if I should or could name him yeah it was like two weeks ago I think yeah so you told me that I can I also asked if I could give the background there and he said yes oh sure so this is whaler99 from The Forum yeah uh who's our new IT person at Linus Media Group um not even not new anymore I mean it hasn't been here almost six months now or something somewhere around that yeah I think it's here for a bit yeah it's been hard to keep that in yeah yeah I wanted to refer to him on the show as Whalen I don't want to mention that but yeah some people might actually know Sean if you've been around the Forum especially in the earlier days of the Forum um if you if you've seen Whaler 99 around [Music] um that's him so yeah I don't remember what I was referencing but I wasn't sure if I could name him and now I do know and that's that's Sean so yeah yeah so he actually like reports to Luke yeah so he's sort of used to as a mod back in like 2012 or whatever he first started working with the first mods yes like freaking it's like actually one of the ogeist yeah Forum people ever yeah um but yeah he just said whalerland yeah yeah so he'll be he'll be uh probably helping us out with getting that set up once he gets his poor like head out from under the water of like our I.T tech there you're gonna you're gonna like the new Disaster Recovery doc oh yeah it's like Wicked how many how many pages is it 200 200 it's more than 200 right yep yeah what yeah it's for everything oh is there a disaster Solutions what happens if uh and it's like very clickable so you haven't written that one to different parts of it and all that kind of stuff 210 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hell yeah heck yeah exciting yeah it's cool it's good anyways yeah so that's sad but there is the good news of uh whale lands more and more awesomer and I'm sure there'll be more details on that in the future there was a couple comments from some of the people who worked on the mom and pop computer shop video by the way uh Tanner who uh who helped coordinate everything is like the the writer for the video uh said that the store owner Keith was even funnier off camera this is so true I that's one of the things that drives me crazy when I'm working with amateur talents is they'll say something hilarious they'll be like okay free okay do that again and like it's never quite it's never quite the same yeah like that's something that takes a lot of practice um and is there something about just having a camera pointed at you just kind of stiffens you up right it makes you feel unnatural and overall he did great um but yeah he was even funnier off camera and Hoffman uh Fufu was the editor for it I cannot believe how fast Hoffman turned that around that was like a two-day edit whoa yeah no no no no no no no we this is one of the First videos that we've released post-production break that actually was shot post-production break we shot this at on um oh man was it Thursday of last week I I don't I don't remember exactly when we shot it uh cred uh it should be on my should be on my calendar I think it was I think it was Thursday of last week surely it wasn't Friday no it couldn't have been Friday uh yeah I think it was Thursday of last week definitely wasn't Tuesday and we released it like that weekend uh it must have been because the sponsor asked for a rush edit on it or something like that because we told Keith too we were like hey yeah it's gonna be probably a few weeks because that's generally how long something like that would take to make its way through the queue but uh yeah Hoffman said the footage was extremely hard to condense because there was so much good material and there was a lot more items that we didn't show we typically run audio continuously and Keith was so funny that occasionally while reviewing the audio you'd hear tons of laughter followed by David hurriedly trying to get the camera running um passing pedestrians kept trying to poke their heads in to figure out what all the chaos was about we also filmed the back of the shot of the back of the shop but wound up cutting it for time uh Tander had a big list of games but Linus kept making up his own rules on the Fly okay that's true I mean that sounds like a lioness thing yeah that sounds like a Linus thing too just question question was what were the best parts of the shoot that didn't make the cut I think some of the best ones were some of the haggling between me and Keith um there there were some I think in the Final Cut of the video Hoffman was going for a bit of a tone a tone of you know me mostly going along with everything but there were definitely times when I did push back more and and we did negotiate a bit more I think Hoffman did a great job though of keeping in all the most important gambling because that was by far when I was watching it I don't even want to spoil it but the one big really impactful role was like the critical role yeah there you go um yeah I'm gonna be I'm gonna be completely forthright with you there's only two times in my life that I have fainted or almost fainted both while being uh both while having blood drawn because I am what's apparently the technical term is uh a fainter which basically means that when your skin is punctured your body immediately goes into protective I must not lose all my blood mode and all the blood drains from your extremities and is like I'm gonna stay here now um so when when I'm getting blood drawn like my my hands go ice cold and they'll be like in there with the needle and it doesn't bother me I don't care but it's like they're like Hello can like it just stops flowing there's no pressure they just can't get it wow I do not have that problem yeah so anyway um I I found this out when I was really sick with somethings like back in the swine flu days or something stupid like that but very pre-covered the the old you know flu everyone was worried about um so it was back in those days and I was like quite sick like and it weakened State already and I had to get blood drawn and I'm sitting in the chair and I start to kind of move and the nurse poor thing she must have been about 85 pounds soaking wet basically goes whoa whoa whoa I can't hold you you put your head between your knees like and I'm like okay okay and I managed to avoid passing out and then the second time it was for some life insurance thing they had to draw blood from me and um I started to go dark and I like went over to I had my like LoveSac like giant bean bag pillow in the in the living room and I was in the dining room at the old place and I like went down and went on to the LoveSac thing and I like closed my eyes for a second and then I was totally fine I talked to the guy and he goes you've been passed out for five minutes and I was like oh really neat I didn't know that so that's the one time I fainted during this shoot I was in a near fainted state three times from just stress it was very intense there was more probably more physical there was more physical activity than you guys probably realized like watching a video like that because I'm climbing up on counters like I'm I'm doing a lot it's it's a different I had one of our one of our uh subjects for um the tech upgrade series that we do someone internal who sees a lot of footage what's up oh there's an ant huge one so yeah see you later buddy um who sees a lot of footage but doesn't participate in a lot of videos messaged me afterward after we did theirs and basically goes I don't know how you do this every day like I am white I I just I can't it's draining yeah it's it's doing on a lot of levels being on is is is quite exhausting and uh you know when you're working in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar people um you know a big part of the host's job is to make everyone else around them look good and look really talented as a host and so it's a lot of things for me to keep track of when I'm trying to drive a video like that forward and then the other big one is I didn't even know how much the sponsorship was I I had actually no idea so I had no idea what the running total was because I had a lot of other things to keep track of and so particularly um you know when I would stop and breathe for a second I don't think I drank any water that day because I like forgot my water bottle or something so that was probably a major factor but there were multiple times that day when I was just like okay is this shoot going okay is everything okay uh what is happening right now and the one time I actually started to feel Blackness come in around my vision was right before the throw because I was just I was so stressed like I I don't I think you know that I'm not much of a gambler no one in the hand is worth 500 in the bush for me yeah yeah we do I I'm not that kind of person and so I I played a bit of a character in this video you know the the gambling man I'm gonna rule for it yeah yeah but that is not my personality at all I think that's something a lot of people don't realize is from one video to the next sometimes I'll be playing a slightly different character because that's what the content calls for um and so I played you did it well I played the like Cavalier Gambling Man but that is extremely stressful for me I did notice that through the course of the video the games uh start becoming more and more skill based oh that wasn't intentional actually oh I'm sure it wasn't but I also I fully believe that your brain in the moment was like this game sounds more fun yeah maybe uh I mean skill didn't work out great for me at the beginning you saw that putt yeah I mean that just looked hard to do you saw the part you saw the darts so just because I didn't necessarily win you know what didn't make it into the edit was the pre-throw he wanted a practice throw I nailed the practice throw and then freaking flubbed you guys looked so bad okay if you tried that Dart set though you'd understand that's what I assumed while I was watching it they were done this is astronomically bad they were Dollar Store darts yes they had no weight not not that I'm like I'm bad at darts but like I know I just you had to whip them though yeah watching you guys do it I was like what there was no weight to them Keith I think it took him three times to get it to stick in but you didn't see that part because that wasn't in the Final Cut yeah yeah yeah man that video was uh it was a good video people should watch it yeah it was really stressful though scrapyard Wars had better darts we had darts and scrap yard Wars Maybe seems like the kind of thing we would do Channel super fun and I think had darts at some point definitely had lawn darts um you have more topics we've kind of already touched on meteor Lake we kind of like approved human trials yeah um the Rog Ally base model is coming it's much slower it uses the Z1 instead of the Z1 extreme uh I'm I'm planning to do a review because I've been using my Rog Ally a lot oh good oh this is really frustrating uh YouTube made a made a policy change allowing channels to change their names um without changing the display name on their Google account so hackers are now able to easily disguise what channel they've taken over frustrating attempts to identify and contact the Channel's true owner while changing a Channel's name we'll remove any verified badge associated with the channel forcing forcing creators to apply for reinstatement I don't that's a sentence fragment that's okay we tried however not all valuable hacking targets have verification badges such as strategy game streamer Das tactic whose channel was hacked and so thoroughly changed that it was only identifiable because his store was still up Das tactic is back in charge of his account now following assistance from YouTube One Challenge was trying to communicate with his community um because so much of his online life was connected into his hacked Google account though thankfully not his Twitter or Discord this is wild so this is what a channel that's hacked could look like now just completely unidentifiable unbelievable that's rough could Google now at least not make things worse I feel like this is one of those like one hand not talking to the other situations and that's probably the most optimistic possible interpretation of what happened with unity who has walked back the pricing scheme yeah they released a public apology and made significant revisions to their proposed pricing changes uh the recap is last week they announced a 20 cent per download fee on Unity based games that had made over 200 000 in Revenue a year and had over 200 000 lifetime downloads in response many Indie developers threatened to withdraw their games from sale and migrate to another engine for current and future projects their new pricing plan doubles the minimum threshold on Revenue before charges uh from oh it doubles the minimum threshold before charges from 200k to 1 million a year that's not double but yeah oh I read that in the pre-show and I was like what okay well basically it UPS the minimum threshold for Revenue uh Games published in the past under a previous version of unity will no longer be subject to the new feed which is how it should have worked in the first place how can you possibly unilaterally change a deal that's not how that works developers will also be able to choose between the fee or paying 2.5 percent of their gross revenue instead last week Unity claimed that they would assess how much developers owed through an unclear proprietary method leading to speculation of potential DRM and security issues now Unity says they will allow developers to self-report these numbers I just hope they follow through on all of this and we don't see any of that same kind of behavior again is it time to switch to windshield after dark Dan let's do it just walks past the camera what a pro marriage messages I'm starting at the top of potential sure I mean we can probably just answer most of them there's uh there's not too many this week okay yeah the potential ones are more like directed at you guys personally I think um okay let's start at the top here hey oh I just donated a bunch of my icebreakers because I couldn't stand how itchy they were on my smooth Supple skin on a scale of one to sand paper what's the itch Factor on the LTT Merino teas I'm happy with them four Merino teas but they are still Merino teas if you like soft fabric on your smooth Supple skin just get our regular teas they're great or better yet pick up one of the RGB ones that is probably the softest shirt on the store and it's available in more than one color now so yeah just go go go get that just load up those they're they're by far here I should probably just oh man I just realized we never even showed the photos for the for the onesie it's always fun seeing the team rod from the business team Sara from the design team Alama Day from the fashion team Dennis from the bothering me team [Music] lots of fun Adam what is this a group oh we do group photos now okay got a bunch of the business teams that's actually really cool it looks like a family photo that's awesome um so yeah the onesies uh the reversible bomber jackets from last week and the Merino t-shirt from last week so the one you want if you want just like the softest softest thing for your Supple skin is this oh I don't see different colors oh are they oh yeah okay yeah here it is in Gray so yeah it's this shirt it's so comfy okay are you aware of any Tech projects similar to VLC that have chosen to remain independent despite receiving numerous purchase offers and strictly refrain from tracking any data from their users honestly it's not something that I personally pay close enough attention to how many I mean I would imagine like OBS has probably received offers for purchase they remain completely independent and don't appear to be doing any kind of tracking of anyone's use even though like man the amount the kind of very valuable the kind of data that flows through OBS from the streamers themselves from any of the any of the things that are hooked into it like every merch message no no it doesn't actually because that's just a um like essentially like a web capture window or something like that right okay literally just a browser Source yeah okay yeah but I'm sure that they could I'm sure that if they were evil enough they could engineer OBS in such a way that the only way to hook something in would have to make it like plain text readable to OBS or something I don't know um but no OBS just is cute hey Linus I see you flipping around a Precision screwdriver care to show it off yeah I showed it earlier in the show so you might just have to rewind uh that might have been the pre-show actually oh oh well then you might just have to get a float plane and watch it there okay okay no hold on hold on get out of here is it in your other pants I appear to have misplaced it I'm sorry uh you will definitely see more of it in the future good morning Dale back when Alex had his Tech upgrade he mentioned that you got an order for 5 million face Shields from the Canadian government is that a story you can share I don't know that it was a formal order so much as it was that they were they wanted as many of them as they could get from anywhere and we had publicly offered to help and I think they misinterpreted our manufacturing capacity with those prusa printers that hey again you know we haven't forgotten shout out prusa for sending over uh I think they just overestimated our capacity for creating face Shields and it was you know we basically clarified and we sent as much as we could and um then we both moved on hi dll I'm a future teacher and was wondering if there is any Tech in its early days that you think will become the norm for schools in the future that I should learn now I would basically just keep my eye out on anything that your students are using like it's not even as it's not even in my opinion it's not even the like augmented reality and and AI that is gonna change things so much or that will be as day-to-day relevant to you as just things like understanding what Discord is and how it works and how they're communicating with each other and and interacting I think that um it's been a huge Advantage for me and Yvonne as parents to not just know how our kids are communicating but introduce them to things like Discord where we can be in the discords they're in and keep an eye on what they're talking to their friends about obviously that's going to be less relevant as they get into their teenage years but when for young kids keeping them safe online um it can be a real challenge if you don't know what they're doing um but I mean obviously that's not necessarily a teacher's role but I still think that understanding meeting the kids where they are is um more important than just trying is is more effective than trying to bring them to where you are hello my dudes will the noctua Edition screwdriver be available through noctua in Europe I I believe that is the plan um so I think I think their plan is to I have no idea how the finances would work for this but I think their plan is to essentially carry the screwdriver however that would look but you'd have to honestly the better way to get information about that would be to ask noctua because they know better than I do my husband has watched you since the NCIX days what is your opinion on Tech leaks do you think it's affecting buying of new tech absolutely I mean I I think that leaks can impact the demand for the older item I think that leaks can do a lot to generate hype and generate additional news cycles that can amplify the news around an upcoming launch sometimes I really do feel like leaks are probably intentional other times they really do look you know too early too much impact on the old product to be to be worth it and they do look unintentional sometimes I feel like leaks are um no matter the cost in terms of your own product lineup just to damage someone else just to make sure that no there's there's absolutely No Air Force hype growing for somebody else oh yeah let's let's leak something that's coming up I think it can be very tactical I also think it can be very accidental I think it can just be passionate people who are excited to talk about what they're working on in a bar and being overheard I um it's just it's just part of it's just part of the territory okay let's move into some potentials um let's see I just curated one of them out oh okay I will read that one instead um hey dll it's currently 4 a.m I just got Starfield bundled with a g502x mouse what was the best product in game bottling you ever got my favorite was Battlefield 4 with an AMD GPU by the way I love my uncle Linus bottle oh I think who's the like Batman bundle the Arkham Asylum one yeah yeah that was a good bundle uh but there were some really wild bundles before like I I got um I got Half-Life 2 with my Ellen Wonder 9600 Pro which was hilarious because by the time the game came out I had already upgraded my GPU there was so there was a while there where there was bundles of like four games and I think it got kind of crazy I think anyone who got Half-Life 2 got the whole Orange Box whoa I don't actually remember hold on Radeon 90 800 Half-Life 2 bundle Orange Box is am I gonna be able to find an article about this uh I'm pretty sure I got an orange box code I'm ATI offers bonus to Half-Life to bundle buyers okay here we go here we go you got classic valve Shooters until the half-life sequel shipped so maybe it wasn't Orange Box oh you got the valve Premiere pack okay that's that's I think it but then but then didn't Half-Life 2 come with orange box I don't remember Orange Box launched after half-life 2. and that included like portal and things like that too right portal TF2 that was way later than uh okay okay yeah maybe I'm mistaken Half-Life 2 was something like 2004. so maybe it was just maybe it was just the older games that came with it but there were definitely times when aside from official bundles stores would have like because it used to be physical codes right so they would have a ton of codes left over and they would stack of them they'd slip in like they they'd pile up bundles on products they needed to move so I I had taken advantage of stuff like that in the past as well yeah man game bundles used to be so sick so sick now they're just like eh yeah let's see what canceled video project you must most wish you could have completed and released and why did you have to cancel it um we don't cancel that much so much as we kind of reach a non-viable point and and don't move forward with it uh I'd say one that I'm I'm really disappointed we didn't do was the rackification of the land Center upstairs because our intention was to have that be kind of like what I did with the land Center at my house but run like a big radiator to the roof and bring back whole room water cooling at one point I had also wanted to plumb water um water cooling into the editing den and have all the editing machines water cooled off of you know just like Plumbing from the walls just like we did in whole room water cooling with the layout they have now it wouldn't make any sense anyway because they're all over the room instead of just down the two walls but I think that would have been super cool to like bring back whole room water cooling in a big way I'd like to set up something like that at the lab so they just have water available to cool things when they need it but also I think they probably don't need it quick disconnects on the desk yeah that would be sick yeah uh okay uh Hey LDL Linus a couple weeks ago you mentioned that you're more of a textured eater what is your favorite what is your opinion on Ben and Jerry's ice cream ah I am too cheap to buy really expensive ice cream so I curated this because I was like he's probably never even had I have tried it okay I don't remember like I've probably tried Ben Jerry's once in my life or something yeah it's like to 100 grams you can get a kilogram at the superstore for like the same price I just I I don't know I can't the the maximum for me is I'll spring for Lake Briars but like as soon as you get into like Haagen-Dazs territory French vanilla is like yeah that's pretty good it's pretty good it's pretty all right yeah I mean honestly my guilty pleasure ice cream is just like no name Neapolitan anyway so I'm clearly a Philistine like five dollars for it for a bathtub yeah exactly right uh hey lld was wondering what is all your personal favorite LTT store hoodie or a jacket that you've ever done personally probably the short circuit one PS bring back the swacet favorite we've ever done I know mine man I really like the tie-dye LTX 23 hoodie it's really good it's really good I am I am somewhat particular about I'm not a huge fan I like zippers um yeah yeah but it's it's really good though yeah that's the one in my backpack right now like that's the one I'm dailying right now what about you this guy really that's not really a hoodie but yeah it's it's an old jacket or jacket oh okay that's fair yeah that's a it's a really nice jacket it's like a really nice jacket I've shown it to people that are are like clothing people like and I've I've like just put it on I'm not gonna tell you like where I got it from or anything just put it what do you think because like you don't expect me to have super nice clothes out of nowhere um so I just try it and they're like wow this is like actually really good and they're like checking out what is it like wall lttstore.com baby I had I was at the gym yesterday and I I went uh to go into the pool after working out and I put my water bottle down on like where you put your stuff when you're changing to get into the pool and some dude walked by and was like that's a sick water bottle I was like thanks man and he's like is it a whatever and said some brand I don't remember what it was I was like no it's a uh it's an LTT and he was like huh so you're saying we need to invest more Marketing in our like top of funnel awareness maybe maybe yeah yeah all right yeah you might you might sell some water bottles to Jim Bros if they even know what it is excellent he's like it's huge that's awesome yeah it's like yeah sweet hey dll I know you play Supreme Commander forged Alliance forever but what is your opinion on Supreme Commander 2 the gameplay and story um I never played SubCom 2 because I heard it's bad so I I was a sheeple and I didn't play it sorry have things felt different for you or your staff now that it's been a month since the week uh plus break have you realized noticeable improvements from your new processes and content schedule I don't know why doesn't the team answer that there's a couple members of the team I don't know if Luke's gonna have a lot to contribute to that actually I don't know if Dan's gonna have a lot to contribute to that okay I guess I'll talk um that is exactly what my response was going to be too like nothing changed nobody talked to me as much I was more productive yeah yeah um I think that there's been changes but I also think that the public perception of the changes has been much greater than what the actual changes have been I think not to diminish the effort that's gone into the changes but we were putting in a lot of effort before I think that's one of the things that people are kind of there was a lot of changes used to ask for that were already in motion it's like hey you guys are not doing good enough hey you're like working the team too hard and I'm sitting here going okay which one is it yes we're working really hard and we're trying to do better and that's that was already what we were trying to do um and you know it's obvious that there were some communication breakdowns that were taking place I think that's the biggest thing is we we broke down a lot of barriers in inter-team meetings and we've we've added a lot of um I I'll also throw in here yeah we absolutely have our Communications problems and I know of a few that I'm working on as well yeah um but if you ask like anyone that works at any a company of a size that's more than like five people and you ask them like what problems does your company have oh communication's hooked it's like yeah things happen and I think that there are a lot of things that we can do better yeah of course there are for sure I'm not trying to like you know Dodge that there's things no and and that's the thing is like we've I don't think we've ever pretended that we operate perfectly smoothly internally I think that one of the things that we do do sometimes to our detriment is we are extremely transparent about our problems um and so you know yeah here I am here I am talking about yeah some of the challenges and uh some of the things that we're doing to improve and I'm gonna tell you guys up front like it's not perfect it's it's gonna take a lot of time um the the first week back honestly I think we had some of the most disastrous shoots that we had had in many many months um and not because we didn't have enough time just because we had a lot of new processes to work out and it is not simple trying to do what we do believe it or not if you know the solution and it's super easy and obvious you don't know the solution it's not that easy it's not that obvious there's a lot of moving parts and um you know it's it's one of those things that um you know I feel like people have to people have to experience people have to live to understand and so I don't expect everybody to understand it but um overall I I think that you know it's been motivating I think it's been exciting for people to spend more time talking to other people um which has been a personal source of frustration because it's something that I had been advocating for a lot and then all of a sudden now it's everybody's idea so now we're going to do this like okay sure it's like you should be talking to this team regularly it's like okay but we need like a week shutdown in order to like internalize them like okay yeah and you know what you know part of it too is that it's yeah it's not that simple it's just like a lot of the times sometimes it's process change yeah yeah I want to do this yeah and and sometimes someone can say something you go yeah that's a good idea and I should do that but until there's like a hey you know wake up moment you're just you kind of keep doing things the way that you did them before right and that's uh especially when people are heavily tasked yeah exactly and I'm and I've never claimed that we don't work hard never um we do so I'm optimistic that's what I'll say in summary yeah yeah there's kind of couple potentials left you guys want to answer that or should we curate them uh let me have a look oh well we gotta carry this one hey dll my hubby and I were in the LTX vid as two Gamers one CPU nice the PC is a windowless is in is in a windowless basement room with our server and run through a thunderbolt cable back to the gaming room any Tech tips on cooling without a pool yeah so um believe it or not that stupid radiator setup that we had in one of the parts of whole pool water cooling uh where Alex and I put one radiator outside it's just a simple car radiator with some rent with like a random Walmart box fan on it and then one inside and then a tube running through the wall that actually worked probably better to cool the room than what I just did bearing in mind of course that what I just did added net new heat that it then removed so I effectively did nothing but just taking that radiator and cooling it outside and then heating so heating the water inside with the hot air and then dissipating that heat to the outside worked pretty great and I actually had kind of thought at that time you know maybe this whole pool water cooling thing is kind of stupid and I should just do this because with whole pool water cooling I can't go sub ambient but with a waterproof fan and some kind of misting system I could so I could use like face I could use evaporative cooling as long as as long as water is plentiful in your area or something like that you could use evaporative cooling to actually go sub ambient on that radiator outside so I mean essentially it's always just how to move heat and water tubes are a really effective way to move heat however I will say this I I don't think that any of this is going to be cost effective so I would only do it if it's for fun uh hi team please tell a story about a time you have felt like a SIMS character I'm not gonna lie I don't I don't really get this why'd you curate it though I didn't I didn't curate it oh what should happen fine okay then go Dan yeah I don't I don't know yeah bright guy right now yeah why does he have so much light we don't have any light yeah I got three mortars just pointing at my face I can see nothing uh I don't know it was a it was a one that was an incoming I thought you guys might be able to what's and so what was that I don't I was like controlled by another entity um all the time constantly [Laughter] I always say that I'm piloting a toddler that I can't control go to gym strength increase yeah there you go eat I'm I'm controlled by societal pressures play chess intelligence increase oh it's fighting back uh last one I've got here hello from Bowling Green Ohio Linus have you liked the gr Corolla so far and what are your thoughts on Toyota's six-speed intelligent manual transition excuse me I don't have a lot of thoughts on intelligent Transmissions because I'm really not much of a car guy but the gr was a blast I didn't end up buying one we only played around with the Press car and did the review um I just I can't justify having more than one car and I'm not going to swap out the taikan for it given that I already have the taikan if I if they were both on the market today and I was shopping again it's pretty fun I don't know that I would spring for the stupid mobile but um yeah I don't have any thoughts on the transmission I'm afraid um um oh okay last one time stamp guy here okay I can't validate that but they say they are I've been designing a win show themed LTD screwdriver holder capable of housing all the bits thoughts on selling 3D printed projects on LTT store I'd actually rather not sell them I mean if if there's marketplaces where you can list it I think there's a pretty vibrant dude yeah there's also already some out there yeah uh LTD hold on I think there's like a surprisingly vibrant accessory ecosystem um there's been some cool ones posted on the reddits and I think in some cases that was people just showing off their cool project and in other cases that was people stealth advertising their etsies and stuff because this is definitely a thing oh wow yeah like check this out oh wait no not this one um stop we're off the rails here yep LTT screwdriver carrying case LTT stubby screwdriver case like this is this is one thousand percent a thing um yeah cool right neat we are gonna probably do our own at some point but you know for the time being it's definitely something that you can get and it's something that you know we are we are at the very least accepting of you know I don't think that we're going to be going out of our way to you know promote this because we might have our own competing products at some point or whatever else we don't want to we don't want to like rug pull anybody but um we're also not gonna We're Not Gonna you know be upset about anything we we think this is overall really cool yeah really really really cool and I think that's it that's it thanks for tuning in you guys and we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad Channel if you're just tuning in uh pretty late in the show here um just bear in mind the VOD might take a little bit because the show was interrupted so we have to take those two pieces of the vods place them together then upload and process so it's going to take some time especially on fliplane and that's actually like a lot of time yeah yeah okay okay see ya bye [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] I'm like so ready for bed right now yeah
