this is very meta and it has to be for this type of format because we're talking about talking so i i have a very small point uh but to make it uh i kind of had to do what i'm trying to tell you to do so the difference between having a point and telling a story so you have something that you want to say but you have to convey it to the audience in some way and this can be very difficult um so i have three examples from talks uh that i've done and and and i'll try to deconstruct the technique that i used in each one so the first one we're going to look at is a as a talk i did a few years ago and here i'm using a metaphor to create the language that i'm going to use in the talk and so the talk is is called trying to learn c sharp uh it's it's a very weird talk because i didn't know c sharp when i submitted the talk so i had to learn c sharp to do the talk and so i i talk about that process it's it's a it's a very strange thing it was an extremely hard talk to do uh for me and in it i i used words from learning a natural language so so i went and i i i found how do we talk about learning languages in general like learning natural languages and then i used those kinds of words to describe learning as c-sharp and so i'll show you some examples from that talk so there's a word in norwegian called and and there's also a word in danish called frucos but said with a danish accent and and in norwegian it means breakfast and in danish it means lunch which which makes it extremely confusing uh all the time basically either way you go you don't know what meal you're talking about and it's clear and what really hurts it is that it is very clear from the context that you're talking about a meal but but it's very easy to get confused about which meal we're actually discussing at this point um and and this is because it's kind of coming from the same kind of language background but the meaning of it has drifted and and this can mean that you think you understand what the the person is saying but it actually means something totally different than you think and this happens in programming languages as well so i'll show you two examples so here we have a list in java and in java it's called list but there's also a thing in c sharp called list unfortunately in java this is some kind of abstract thing it could actually mean some kind of linked list and then c-sharp this is what we would call a vector or what you in java would call an array list right which is confusing when you read it the first time because you don't know what it is what is a list like what it what is the underlying implementation and so here we have like a drifting meaning it means different things in different languages and you have to figure out what does it mean in this context and and here it is the same word because it came from the same place uh um but it doesn't mean the same thing and you kind of have to figure that out in learning a programming language uh and so you had one that was fun is that they have something that they call namespaces so in my talk i have this little thing in the in the corner and that is like the language i was thinking of when i was learning this thing in c sharp so how did i try to understand it uh so so here's an example from c sharp where they have something that that kind of looks like a namespace right but it's actually not like namespace at all and so now i have to figure out how it what it actually means and then and so this this is all i'm going to show you from this talk it's on youtube but the point is here i i used the metaphor of learning a natural language and mapped it to learning a programming language okay so then i have a different talk that i did recently at aku and here i tried to illustrate time by using popular culture and so the the top was called classic vulnerabilities and i i use popular culture because i wanted to remind people how long ago something was and so so i wanted to oh yeah i remember that song or you know so to give people a feel for how long ago something was because that was a big point in the talk to to illustrate that a lot of time has passed since something um so i had so i had these two ecosystems that i was talking about so you had systems programming and binary exploitation and then i have these timelines and so so you know we're going back to 2000 and then all the way up to two to 2022 but this is very abstract like you people have 22 years okay i don't know uh so then i go like okay so boomer said you know 2000 that was y2k and for zoomers taylor swift was 11 which makes everybody feel old but anyway um and then i had this weird transition and the transition was because it's old school like okay i tried many transitions here to make it like old school and one of them was like the the cube rotating i i couldn't do it it was it was too hard uh but this is from a screenshot from the song dilemma uh which nelly uh uh did with kelly rowland who was from destiny's childhood zoomers don't know who is but it has this wonderful like scene in it so if you were you know a teenager or adultish at the time you might remember that she is writing a text message in an excel spreadsheet on her fabulous nokia phone and this is something that people who were you know in techish things might remember from that time they got like oh that's a long time ago this is way before the iphone so then you get a feeling for when was 2002 right um then i have another talk and here i wanted to to change people's minds about something and and and and to do that i i needed to to to put them in a frame of mind where they had or what i was trying to do at least put them in a frame of mind where they remembered or they they uh they they've like experienced internally a certain situation and then i would flip it on them and so this talk is called the constructing privilege and and and then the first two slides i'm going to show you are the first two slides that i show in that talk um and and what i'm trying to do in those slides is evoke memories in each person in the audience of their own experience and then show them how the same situation could be experienced totally differently from by somebody else uh so the first one is going to the hairdresser and so i i asked people to try to remember last time they went to the hairdresser uh how they experienced it how sometimes they might be nervous they don't know how this goes this is going to look in the end can they kind of maintain this hairstyle things like that and then i say for some people going to the hairdresser can be very traumatic and then i and and then i i bring up okay so imagine that you are uh you are transgender and you go to the hairdresser as a child and you are presenting as something that you it's not you so let's say that you were assigned a female at birth and you're coming in and people all want to do the long hair and the everything and all you want to do is be yourself and you just want to cut it all off um so that's one experience that could be very hard for people to be enforced to go into that situation and reaffirm something they feel is totally wrong for them but at the same time also you have especially for for for trans men uh you've had several situations where trans men have been assaulted by the hairdresser because people think that they are going there and and trying to cheat the hairdresser because haircuts for men are cheaper than haircuts for women so both of these situations have caused many many trans people to cut each other's hair because they don't want to go into that situation because for them it is very scary and traumatic and so this is trying to contrast how do you as a as a cis person or a cis presenting kind of person or passing person how do you experience a quite ordinary situation and then contrast that to how it is experienced by somebody else uh in a different situation another example that i have then is is planning a vacation uh where where i i asked the audience to imagine you know how how you what you think about when you plan a vacation like do you like to go to the beach or do you travel to a place that has interesting food or things like that and then i i flip it on them and i say okay imagine that you are in a same-sex relationship lots of places in the world it's actually illegal for you to go they can put you in jail for just traveling with your spouse and suddenly a whole whole sections of the world are not not possible for you to travel to not for for for a vacation and not for business either and so so what i'm what i'm trying to to tell you here is that the difference between having a point and having a point is you having all of you have an idea you will have something you want to say you have something you want to communicate but there is a difference between having a point and telling a story and and and the difference there is trying to figure out how do i tell you what i'm trying to say and that means i need you to understand me to understand what i'm trying to say to get it to internalize it in your own mind and and that is is the the struggle i have every time like what is the thing like i need i have the stuff i want to say but i also have to have some kind of medium and that medium is is trying to reach the audience and and you kind of have to and sometimes it's really hard and it's super super stressful because sometimes i just can't get it until like i've been working on the talk i'll have all of the slides i have everything but i'm just missing that one thing too like it's it bothers me and i can get like oh my god what if i never i never get there but the the point is that you you are trying to communicate to people and so it's it's not enough to just talk because language is is just putting words into the air you need you need to make sure it is parsed on the other end you can't just like push it into the air so so this is basically the entire point of my entire thing the difference between having a point and telling a story is trying to figure out how to tell you what i'm trying to say um and thank you very much thank you patricia that was very interesting
