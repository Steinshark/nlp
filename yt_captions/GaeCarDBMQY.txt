before we get started this video was a core shot before social distancing was put into place so stay home stay safe and of course huge shout-out to our sponsor Micro Center for their wonderful online store which is available at the link in the description enjoy you guys hello welcome to a wonderful sponsor Micro Center here in Tustin California where I have a very simple challenge so at this point you've likely seen our coverage of the Xbox series X well today I am going to build the closest gaming PC I can to give us a good sense of what the series X will look like when it goes on sale later this year one of the most important components is definitely the processor which is why we're going with you Rison 730 700 X this is pretty much exactly what you will find inside the series X you've got these sames into core architecture the same 8 core design this should give us a very good sense of the performance next up we have the Auris x5 7 TI pro Wi-Fi not only will this fit in our case which I'll show you in a minute but the cool thing is we have all the features we need and it will fully support our rise in 730 700 X and all the other things we're doing am I too close right now is this is this uncomfortable for you to have to focus the camera this close we're also taking advantage of a one terabyte ARS pci gen 4 SSD now this is about as close as we're going to get what's inside the Xbox series X they obviously have a custom SSD but we are taking advantage of PCI Gen 4 and this is about as fast as it gets on the PC space right now next up we're taking advantage of some g.skill Trident Zinio memory this is great for rising builds we've used it a couple times in the past and it should be plenty fast for all the ex boxing we're about to do can't use ex boxing as a verb I don't think I can that sounds stupid probably not ok I won't do that anymore and so with her gigabyte Radeon 5700 XT we only really need one more thing that's because we have this the NZXT h1 so this is a brand new case which has a lot of similarities shall we say to the Xbox series X so they have noticed when we were shopping for components we left out a couple of crucial ones including not only the case but also our power supply and cooler however all that actually comes built into the NZXT h1 which is why it is a little bit on the expensive side but considering that we have a lot that's built into this guy I feel like it's fairly justice bye come on that's pretty close to the serious exercise maybe it's maybe it's a touch taller yeah it's a little taller but besides that that's pretty similar so obviously there are some differences between this in the series ex not only does it have us BC built in you have a window when you look it on back the components are well there's a lot built in here so that's actually something interesting I'm seeing here a lot of the cables have already been routed the section might be fairly easy to build into one sweep or a car ITX board and everything inside okay okay that's actually really interesting so essentially we can completely expose the sort of skeleton of the case so we have our power supply cables some instructions on how to remove the panel's even though you have to do that to even get in here in the first place now if you want a full tutorial on how to build a gaming PC we actually did that a little while ago what you guys can check out over here but for now let's build ourselves a series X Yoda comes to building a small PC like this especially in such a tiny case it makes sense that you need a very small motherboard and when it comes to an ITX 4 which is also compatible with X 570 you can see there's a lot crammed in here so now I do we have our chipset active cooler but we don't really have a ton of space we only have two DIMM slots obviously so for SSD we actually had some pretty solid cooling so in all eyes it's surrounded by this heatsink we actually have active cooling blowing directly on it we should definitely help keep things cool I feel good about this build and especially considering how nicely this case is designed I really can't wait to see once it's all put together how it actually performs I feel like we actually can get close to the series - we're definitely going to be behind in some areas but I think we actually might be able to get closer than pretty much any other PC build that you could get I mean it would be tough to get this level of performance in this small of a case so of course for a processor we are taking advantage of the Rison 730 700 X now there are some very slight modifications inside the actual Xbox series extra chip itself so they are using some slightly tweaked Zen 2 cores but as far as I know the performance should be almost identical and because you have a couple of options on the series X so you can either run it with or without hyper threading and at either 3.8 to 3.6 gigahertz it should be super easy for us to lock the clock speed and such and get the exact same CPU performance as the series X is going to work with now the memory itself is a little bit different than what we're getting on series X so with the series X we do have a combined 16 gigabytes of GDR 6 memory and that serves not only the CPU but also the graphics in the PC space you just don't do that the graphics card always has its own memory and the CPU obviously always has its own so we were you taking advantage of 16 gigs here it's a little bit more than Series X has to be totally fair but Windows does have more overhead and realistically none of the games that we're going to try are even going to take advantage of all this memory in the first place it's very much moreso of a more of a future proofing thing for series X but as far as raw performance goes I do think we should be in the right ballpark so what comes to the SSD this is actually something which it's a little bit of a mixed bag because this technically is faster than what you get inside the series X so all these are both 1 terabyte drives what we have here is something which is theoretically rated 2 up to 5 gigabytes per second whereas the Xbox Series X tops out at 2.4 gigabytes however they have done a lot of tuning to make sure that it has a very consistent level of performance whether or not this will be able to hold up to 5 gigabytes per second for hours at a time probably a little bit unlikely but actually what this cooler it should help a lot so I know Microsoft made a really big point about trying to make sure the series X SSD had the lowest level of late as possible to try to get specifically when you're actually using it as a substitute for graphics memory so because it only has 16 gigs if you want to go more and I'm assuming most developers that will take advantage of this you can actually take advantage of your SSD on the series X to provide more graphics memory that is not something we can do on the PC but with a very very fast SSD onboard I do think we have a really good shot of at least stimulating a lot of those load-times that we get on the series X so I have installed the motherboard the memory everything is here we have our all-in-one cooler which you can't see because as soon as you close it up it looks like a cable mess but well you will be able to see is where our graphics card is going to be vertically mounted so that is where a 5700 XG comes in no yes I'm sure if you've watched our video about the Xbox 3 sec's you'll know that this is not quite as powerful as what you're getting in that system now it is of course AMD based and it is our dna-based however this is our DNA 1.0 not 2.0 which means that we do whose things such as hardware ray tracing theoretically we could have put something like an RT x like 2070 or 2080 inside but I want to try to keep this as close as possible this is quite a large card so I guess we just slotted in something like oh wow yep that fits there we go it's funny so much of this case is designed around trying to cram as many components in this tiny space as possible and then you have the GPU which is literally like half sizes okay so with that of course we'll have all our ports on the bottom but we pretty much have the guts of our Xbox series X now I just need to put all the windows and the case panels on and see exactly what this guy is capable of I got to say that actually looks pretty cool so let's see just how powerful our Xbox series X PC is now of course standard disclaimer here while our CPU and generally speaking the overall configuration is similar to the Xbox series X the graphics specifically are not as powerful so one of the best ways to put this head-to-head is with literally the only game that I know not only the performance but also the actual spec of which is Gears 5 running on the Xbox series X so while we actually see if we can get the settings as close as possible and see if there's actually a massive difference this will not be as powerful but I'm curious if we can actually hit a stable 4k 60 maxed out why can't I click on do you oh you actually have to hit oh you have to open this to the menu I think that also textures and stuff okay well it's I'm 61% complete on installing my ultra textures I wonder how long that's gonna take with our ultra textures installed let's give this a try so for reference the Xbox series X runs everything at 4k 60 frames per second with full Ultra settings and a couple of additional settings that are simply just not available in this standard PC release so right now we are who not there so 4k Ultra we're getting about 36 fps alright so our grand total is thirty eight point nine at PS so it's not totally crazy considering the series X is around sixty but it really does just go to show how optimized that Xbox series X is and how much of a beast it is because when you look at this system which I don't know how much the grand total this was definitely double if not more than what the series X costs you're getting a lot of performance the CPU is capped at 209 frames per second the GPU is capped at 39 like it goes to show just how much Headroom these n2 cores have I'm very very excited to see what these series X looks like when we get our hands on it but when it comes to this PC sure it might not be as powerful as the console but I've got to say it looks really nice my biggest issue with it really is just the fact that with this window up front it's not the most aesthetically pleasing thing in the world and cable management considering that all of the runs are pretty much pre-populated where there's really just nothing for you to do means that it's not the prettiest looking thing in the world however I will say if you were looking to build yourself a tiny game PC just to turn it this way and to ever when you got yourself a series X early that one does anyone actually want to everyone to pretend the PC is a series X ok that's not the case anyway thank you very much for watching doesn't be sure to check out all the components we used and our wonderful sponsor micro Center in the link in the description until next time I'm going to go wait until I get my hands on an actual series ax and stop making clickbait videos about this but I've got at least a few more quick bait videos before the series X actually comes over
