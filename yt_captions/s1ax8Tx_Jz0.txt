- I brought in a bunch of my subscribers and gave them a chance
to win tons of money. Starting with this segment where I literally bought
a house and a Lamborghini, and I'm going to give this man a choice. Would you rather have a real Lamborghini? Here's a clip of it. I
literally bought one. Or would you rather have a house? This is the deed to the house. Here's a shot of me in the house. This house is insane. It has three bedrooms, two
bathrooms, and a kitchen. (water splashing) But here's the thing, he has no idea what the Lambo looks like or what the house looks like. What if this is
- Okay. Yeah. - a 2003 Lamborghini? - It's still a Lambo
at the end of the day. - Chandler, what do you
think he should pick? - As a fellow giant, you
will not fit in a Lambo. - What do you think he should pick? - I don't think it matters
if you fit in a Lambo 'cause you got a Lambo.
- A Lambo! Yeah! - 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. - Okay. House. - He picked a house. - Before we show you your brand new house, I wanna show you the
Lamborghini you coulda had. Conveniently enough, the
Lamborghini is right here. - Bro, you're lying - Oh my God.
- to my face, bro. - Dude.
- Bro, you messed up dude. - If I fit in this car. - Oh yeah, see, you don't fit. - But it's still a Lambo. - You could buy a house for
how much this car costs. - This is the Lambo you said no to, but let's show you the house you won. Alright, come on in.
Take off the blindfold. Congrats on your brand new home. - And this is mine? - This is yours. - So, my room, right?
- Yes. - Dude, people work their
lives for something like this, or don't even get it. - This house costs $90,000
more than the Lamborghini, so you did
- Really? - make the right choice. - Because of you and all
these awesome people, my family has this. I never in a million years - Yeah.
- would've dreamed. - We need to go to the next bit, you're making me too emotional. This next challenge is going to be the most physically demanding. Every second he hangs
from this pull up bar, I'll give him $100. And to put that into perspective, if you hang on this pull
bar for 10 minutes straight, I will owe you $60,000. - That's insane.
- You got this bro. - David, I'm going to kick the box. - [David] You got it. Oh boy. - [Group] 300, 400, 500, - Oh boy.
- 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000. - That's $1000! (group squeaking) - Wow.
- You've actually made six grand already. (group cheering) - Now I cannot feel my
legs that much, you know? - But $10,000 you can fix 'em. Karl, this is gettin' a little crazy. - Karl, no, please. - It's about that time. - Not like this, my fingers are slipping! - [Karl] Oh, here it is! - Oh, are you okay?
- Are you okay? - You good?
- Oh my God. - [Jimmy] What do you
think your final time was? - It felt like an eternity. - You actually did 2
minutes and 25 seconds. - Yo! - Let's go. - You made $15,000. - Yeah.
- Yes! - Congratulations on winning $15,000. He is here because he's a subscriber. Make sure you hit that button so you can be in a future video. - How many of these
necklaces can you buy me? - Like 100,000 maybe. - Okay, I think that's how math works. - Hey, Karl.
- Yeah? - What's this? - A bullseye. - This is a dart and
this is $100,000 in cash. And this is Donald. He's gonna take this dart, and if he can hit a bullseye from behind that $100,000, I will let you keep all this cash. This is real money.
This isn't an easy shot. Look how far away it is. I just gave away a house, and if he hits this bullseye I have to give away
$100,000 on top of that. And the video just started, at this rate I'm gonna
lose like $1 million. We need to calm down. - Yeah.
- Donald, throw that dart. Oh my gosh. - Bringing it back. (group gasping) That was actually-
- Oh my. That was actually really close. Unfortunately close does not. - First guy got a house. - Yeah, no, no, no. That was great. I came here and I got
friendship. A good time. - Not a house?
- No. - Alright. - We have an axe, a
sledgehammer, and a pickaxe. - Fortnite. - I need you to pick a weapon. - I gotta go with the pickaxe. - Pickaxe.
- Yeah. - It feels very versatile.
- Okay. - I feel good about this choice. - Alright, right this way. - Right this way.
- Okay. - Alright, Andrew, I'm gonna
need you to be careful. Don't get too close to the
Lamborghini with your pickaxe. Alright, this is a safe. - Sure is. - Okay.
- Yep. - You have a pickaxe, I have a safe, I think you can piece this together. You have until the end of the day to get all the valuable
things outside of this safe. - How did I end up here? Just had to be sure. - Oh.
- Wow. - [Group] Wow. - Andrew, I just wanna let you know. There's a lot of really
expensive stuff in there. I really hope you get into it. Alright gentlemen, this next
challenge involves all of you. - Oh.
- Okay. - Oscar, come on up. (group cheering)
- Oscar Meyer- - If you arm wrestle and
beat Chandler or Chris, I will give you $10,000. But if you beat Karl, I'll give you 2000. - What?
- Just kidding. Guys, you wanna flex for us? There we go. Okay. - Come on, man. What do you think? - Alright, I think Karl's callin' my name. - Why? - If you win, I'll let
you keep the $10,000. - I've never done an arm wrestle. - What? - What'd you do as kid?
- Like he could tell. - Do I have to? - [Group] Yes. - Chandler, give us a
countdown, but with screeches. - Three. (Karl laughing) Two. One. Go. (Karl yelling)
- Oh my. Oh my gosh. - Alright. - Yay, Karl sucks.
- Hey, Karl, here is $10,000, Oscar. (group cheering) - Oscar, I will give you the
option to do double or nothing, but Karl gets to use both his hands. I beat him with two hands,
he's not that strong. - Alright.
- Just so we're all clear, I'm gonna start workin' out after this. - Three, two, one, go! Karl. Oh.
- Oh, where's he just get that strength?
- Oh my gosh. Karl, he's getting you. - You're done.
- Run away, you have to go down now.
- Karl. Karl, you're done. - [Jimmy] Karl! - Wow. - You failed me. - Congrats on your $20,000, Oscar. Karl, maybe next video you'll win money. - Probably not.
- Let's go. (soft music) - Soon as he said expensive things, my adrenaline went through the roof and I think I can get it. If not, I'll be very sad. - This next one is honestly going to be the weirdest bit we've ever done. Don't hate me. This is Sam, and Sam, here's $1000. Would you rather have that $1000 or let Chandler punch you
in the face for $10,000? - Bruh, I ain't punchin' this. - Chandler, come over here. I didn't tell you the outcome
of this bit for a reason. Just trust me, go with it. - I really gotta punch this? - Just punch what I tell you to punch. - Okay.
- Trust me. Now that you've had some
time to think about it, Sam, would you rather have $1000 or let Chandler punch you in
the face for 10 smackaroonis? - Yeah, it was a really
tough decision, I'm not gon. Nah, I'm just kiddin'. He's punchin' me in the face for 10,000. - Really? Okay.
- Oh my God. - You guys stay here, you guys chat. - Is Jimmy psycho? - I've been punched the face
for less, I'll tell you that. - Chandler, you ready? - Yeah, I guess.
- Okay, here. Pull this curtain back.
- Shouldn't you be askin' him? - You?
- Yep. I said, "Would you rather have $1000 or have Chandler punch You in the face?" This is You, - Alright.
- punch him in the face. - Oh my God. (Chandler screeching) (manakin clattering) (Chandler growling) - That coulda been me? - No. - And now that Chandler has
punched You, here's $10,000. Let's move on to the next scene. - But he was dressed so well. - For this next bit,
I'm here at McDonald's and I'm gonna grab a random employee. Hey, do you wanna be in one of my videos? - Yes, I would love to. - That was a lot easier
than I thought It'd be. Alright, Orlando, come on over here. - Let's do it.
- Hey. - Just so you guys know, I grabbed Orlando from
a random McDonald's. - Were you in the middle of workin'? - Yes, I was. - So I'm gonna need Chandler
to blindfold you real quick. - Let the games begin. - And while Chandler's
blindfolding, come with me. I purposely made this challenge easy because I really want Orlando to win. This challenge is as simple as it gets. We have a McDonald's burger and we have a Burger King burger. What we're gonna do is this. (paper crinkling) Oh, which one's which? We don't know. We're gonna take the burgers out. - Uh huh.
- Okay? Right there. Boom. If you guess which burger
was made by McDonald's, I will give you $5,000. - You said made by McDonald's? - [Jimmy] Yes. - This one. - Oh.
- Aye. - It was supposed to be a taste test. - It's this for sure. - I love how it's a taste test and you didn't even taste test it. - [Group] Aye! - You just won $5,000. - Yes! - Congratulations. - I never thought I would
be in a MrBeast video. I watch all your videos. - So you are subscribed? - Yes. - Alright, hold up. Come over here, boys. You stay here. The purpose of this video is to give our subscribers a lot of money. You two figure out the challenge, and if he completes it,
I'll give him 10 grand. - Alright, so since he's a
subscriber, let's make it easy. - Okay.
- Three steps forward. - Okay.
- Alright. - Since you're subscriber, hit the button, I let the boys pick your next challenge. If you risk your $5,000
and take three steps, we'll turn it into $10,000. One, two, three. - Just take three steps? - Just take three steps.
- Yes. - Here we go.
- It don't matter how I step? - Nope, don't matter how. - Nope, just take three steps.
- And we're goin'. - One.
- Uh huh. - Two.
- Uh huh. - [Jimmy] Three! (group cheering) - [Chris] Whoa. Yeah. - Here you go, Orlando. You can head back to work now, - Alright.
- just with $10,000. - Thank you. - And here's some food, you can give it to the next few customers.
- Alright. Imma eat it on my break. - This is Karl. - Hi. - This is a bucket of dodge balls. And this is a tub of paint. The next contestants will throw dodge balls
covered in paint at Karl. Every time they hit Karl with
a dodge ball, they get $1000. Before I blindfold you, I want you to look the
contestants in the eyes. - Go easy, guys. - Never. - So all you're gonna do is you're gonna take your dodge ball, dip it in the color,
go ahead and go for it, and that's how we'll see how
many times you pelt Karl. So go ahead, have your first throw. (dodge ball thumping)
Oh. (dodge ball thumping)
Alright. - Ooh.
- Okay. - Oh.
- That's three. - [Group] Oh. Oh. - [Karl] Okay. - [Group] Oh. - Get up, baby boy.
- Alright, wait. Does it actually hurt? - No.
- Okay, I was gonna say. - It's so scary. - If you take the blindfold
off, will you not move? - Okay. - [Chris] Oh. (dodge ball thumping)
- Oh. - [Chris] Oh. (dodge ball thumping) - [Jimmy] Is that all the dodge balls? - [Karl] It's so slippery. - So you hit Karl five times,
and you hit Karl six times. Gentlemen, congratulations on your money. - Yeah!
- Yeah! Good job, Karl. - For this next challenge,
we are playing corn hole. If you make it in this hole, you get $100. This one is $1000, $10,000, $20,000, and if you make it into this
hole that is really far away and extremely small, I
will give you $1 million. The reason the third throw is this corn is because it's the
only thing that will fit in the $1 million hole. - It's a tight hole. - And this is Cam, he will be competing. How's it goin'? - I'm doin' great. Dude,
I'm just excited to be here. - You could win $1 million. You'll have three throws, you can make as much money as you want. - Okay.
- So we'll start off with this one.
- Alright. - You can make 100, 1,000,
10,000, 20,000, or $1 million. It's all up to you. - I think I'm gonna go for 1000. - Okay. Let's go. - Come on. - [Group] Oh. - [Karl] I shoulda moved it. - Okay, I mean, that's-
- Come on. (Chris grunting)
(Cam grunting) - I gave it everything.
I gave it everything. - [Cam] I did give it everything. - [Jimmy] Cam.
- It's okay. It's okay. - It just wasn't meant to be. - I still have the husk of corn. - You have the ear of corn. - I have the ear of corn. I think it'll help with aerodynamics if I just rip this thing down, just. - [Karl] A bite for good luck! - Alright, is that what
you're throwing now? - Oh yeah. - Wait, so what are you about to go for? - I think I'm just gonna
go over for the 100, just 'cause I-
- Nah. - [Chris] Awe. - You're gonna go for $100
when there's 1 million? - I feel like I'd have
to be a D1 quarter back in order to make any other shots. - What are ya scared? - I'll give you $100
not to go for the $100. - Deal. - Have at it.
- Alright. I'm gonna go for the 10,000
with the ear of corn. - Tomahawk.
- Okay. - Oh.
- Oh my God. That was so close! - Alright, well. Congratulations. - Thank you.
- Here's your prize. - Oh, thank you. Dude, I'm gonna go home
and I'm gonna frame this. - Awesome.
- I don't know how I'm gonna frame it, I'm just gonna nail it. - Alright, Andrew. Alright. They told me you think
you got this opened? - I think I can do it. - Okay. Let's see it. You wanna pry it open? - I sure do. - He's about to open the
safe. I wonder what's inside. - Yep. Open sesame. - Alright.
- Orbeez! - Orbeez, yes. Yes. You might be wondering,
why is it full of Orbeez? - Because it feels great. - You're twist-
- No. - Is that a bigger safe? A smaller safe?
- Wait, it's not just Orbeez. - It is. - Hell yes. - Oh man. - Yes, Andrew. - I already opened one
safe, I gotta open another? - You might think we're a jerk for putting a safe inside of a safe, but I just wanna remind you, there is some very, very
expensive stuff in here. - Man.
- Before I go, I can't remember if we put
two safes in this big safe, or if there's two safes in that safe. - Wait, what? - Nothing, gotta go. In the last dart throwing
bit, he didn't win money. Which is why this time we
made the target much bigger. And this is Brandon,
he's gonna be competing. - Yes, sir.
- So here's the dart. Brandon, if you throw from
behind this line, you get $100. - Awesome. - But if you throw from behind
this line, you get $1,000. You know what's cooler than $1000? - What's that? - $10,000. So if you stand behind this line and pop that ginormous
balloon, you get 10 grand. And if $10,000 isn't
enough for you, Brandon, - Yes, sir.
- we have one more. Behind this line, if you pop that balloon, - Yes.
- you get $20,000. - 20,000. - You pick the line you stand behind. - I'm goin' for the gusto. - Does that mean 20,000? - I'm goin' 20. - Now before you throw it, what would you spend the
20 grand on if you won? - My kids college. - Really?
- Medical bills. - Medical bills, - Yes.
- for what? - I had a kidney transplant - Really?
- and just got done with colon cancer. - Everyone, help me move the $20,000. - Heave! - [Jimmy] Right here works. - I think that'll work. - [Jimmy] I really hope you win, man. - Yeah, thank you. - If you miss, I'm probably gonna cry. - [Brandon] I'm gon' make it. - You got it!
- Let's go Brandon! (Karl gasping) - [Karl] What?
- [Chris] He popped it. - Yeah baby.
(group yelling) Lets go! - [Group] Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.
- Alright, alright, guys. Guys, guys, guys. We need to go check in
on the safe, come on. - Okay.
- Wow. That was way faster than the first one. - It was a little
smaller, but still a safe. - So have you opened it yet? - Just to this point, I
have no idea what's in it. - Okay.
- Alright. - [Jimmy] And inside is a lot of debris. - [] So it's a lot of parts of the safe. - [Jimmy] Wait, what are those? - Pictures? - This is Chris when he was a little baby. This is Chandler when
Chandler was a little baby. And this is Karl when
Karl was a little baby. I asked all their moms for baby pictures. - Where did you get? - [Jimmy] And under the baby pictures is, - [] You've gotta be kidding me. - another safe.
- Don't you dare, man. (group cheering)
Another safe. - Enough with the safe! - And guess what's inside that safe. - A Russian nesting doll? - No, probably another safe. - [Chris] Yeah. - Have fun, we'll be back. Chandler, I love helping
people that help other people. Which is why that's what this
next bit is centered around. Alright Mr. Atlas, come on in. Right here, sir. Right here. - I appreciate it. - So they told me that
you're playing for somethin'? - Yes, a charity. It's called Building Hope
Community Life Center. - So here's $1000, - That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. - and it is 100% yours. - Really?
- You own it. - Alright.
- Okay? - Yes, sir.
- We have another $1000 here. - Okay.
- I can give it to you, or I can pay it forward and
give the next person $5,000. And it's 100% up to you. - Let's pay it forward. - You sure?
- Let's pay it forward. - Okay. Come over here, boys. Welp, he played right into our hands. I'm glad he was chosen for this, because he is actually gonna get $10,000. We have a briefcase here and we are gonna give the
next person five grand, but on top of that, we
wanted to give you $10,000 as a reward for just being a good person. - Thank you so much. - And you can also have
this grand too, why not? - You seem like a good guy.
- Thank you. Thank you. - Are you subscribed? - I am. - Karl, could I have another grand? - There we go.
- There we go, thank you for being subscribed. - [Karl] Alright. - This has been a huge blessing
to us and our organization. Thank you to MrBeast and his team. Subscribe to MrBeast. - Howdy, Ben? You doin' good? - I'm doin' great. - Atlas was our contestant before you, and he decided to pay it
forward and give you five grand. You can head out now. Just kidding, come back. So, that $5,000 is from
Atlas, shout out to him. Now, can I see your phone? - Yes, you can. - We're gonna open up YouTube, we're gonna search MrBeast. Okay. It's nice to see you're subscribed. Every single MrBeast video you've watched, I will give you $100. - [Karl] Ooh. - As you can see under I adopted every
dog in a dog shelter, there's a red bar, which
means you watched it and you get a 100 bucks. Bring the briefcase. Here's $100. - Thank you. - I bought the world's
largest firework. Here's $100. - Thank you. - I broke into a house and left 50 grand. The other would you rather. I built the world's largest
Lego tower, no red bar. - [Group] Ooh.
- He skipped that one. - That was a good one.
- You don't like? - He redeemed himself by watching, I spent 50 hours in solitary confinement. - [Chris] Hey.
- And he watched that entire video. - Wow.
- 100 bucks. 200 bucks. Hm, he went out a hiatus here. - Yeah. Oh.
- Oh. - Didn't watch. Didn't watch. Didn't watch. Didn't watch. (Chris yelling) Not even, can 10,000 condom stop a bullet? - [Chris] That was a classic. - Even worse, he hasn't seen giving my 3 millionth
subscriber 3 million pennies. Alright, I've had enough. He didn't even watch counting to 100,000. - Wow.
- Now we keep your phone. - He got $600, but because
of Atlas paying it forward, he also got five grand. - He did good. - You can also have your
phone, I was just kidding. - Yeah. Hey, but actually, I need the
recording off of it first. I'll give it back to you in a week. - Sounds good.
- I love how easy going he is. - It is what it is. - Can we just have the key to your house? - Yeah, go ahead.
- Chris, you want his hat? - [Chris] I'll take his shoe. - I've never had a chain.
- Man, you tie these things tight, man. - Hey Brady, you want his hat? - How do you think we get all our money? - Alright, we should probably
stop robbing our contestants. This next one is simple. I have two bottles and Julian. And this one matches his
shirt, so we'll go with it. Now, if you land a bottle
flip, I will give you $1000. - One bottle flip? - [Jimmy] Go for it.
- Let's do it. - Hey.
- There we go. - Aye! Okay. I'm gonna let you do double or
nothing as much as you want. If you do it again and land it, two grand. Again, four grand. So, would you like to
do double or nothing? - Absolutely. - Go for it.
- If you miss you get nothing. - If I miss I get nothing? - Yeah.
- Oh. - Here we go. (group yelling) - Okay. You can do double or
nothing again if you want to and turn that two grand into four grand. - I don't think-
- That's two the amount. - I think I might stop at two. - Oh.
- Safe. Safe. Safe. - Safe!
- Oh, speaking of safes. We should go check on the guy. - Yeah, let's go do that. - [] Okay. Jimmy! - I heard he opened the final safe. Boys, come on, we gotta hurry. - [] Come on, man. - You can already kinda see what's in it. - [] That's true. Dude. Is that a- - Diamond ring.
- That's not a diamond though. - It is a diamond ring.
- That's not a diamond. - Yes. In the last would you
rather we had someone pick between a $25 diamond
and a $6,000 diamond. She picked wrong and I had
an extra $6,000 diamond. And that's what you just got. - Okay. - And this diamond is also real. - Dude, come on. - You just got $15,000 in diamonds, and $10,000 with a
pickaxe punch through it. Here's your $10,000 in cash. I'd hug you, but you're really sweaty. And in case you're wondering
why we gave him so much money, it's because he was actually subscribed. - Aye, congratulat...
- Thanks man. Oh, sorry. ♪ MrBeast six ♪
