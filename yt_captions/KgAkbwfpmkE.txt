okay ten months ago samsung launched the Galaxy S nine phones which didn't exactly set the world on fire but the S 10 that should be different and in this box we've got potentially our first look at some of the ways that this phone is gonna evolve over its predecessor okay to start with a pretty standard cardboard box wrapped in an excessive amount of tape this is quite normal for packages sent by a DHL I don't know why they do this and inside we've got a bit too much bubble wrap they've been seriously careful with this box I'm not sure why it is a clone phone it also comes with a screen protector but even though the s10 should have a super-tall at nineteen point five to nine aspect ratio this is even too tall for that the box looks pretty much bang on what we saw with the s9 plus same rough dimensions even the same fonts all the way through and he just slip off the top and then we've got the interior and this box feels really solid is really well designed as even got a subtle matte finish on it the phone is on top we're gonna come straight back to this in a second but first of all pretty much the standard stuff inside the box this QuickStart guide is from a past clone phone and this charger is probably hopefully going to be revamped in the actual s10 I'm definitely hoping for fast charging speeds at scenario where Samsung phones aren't exactly on par got a pair of earphones and then a standard USB type-c charging cable okay onto the phone itself and as with most clone phones its thicker and heavier than the actual phone will end up being not quite as slick or refined but there are a few interesting takeaways we can have from this we've got almost stainless steel looking edges kind of like what you've seen on the iPhone 10s I really like that item that looks pretty premium but also the colour you've got this deep ocean blue and alongside are green and potentially a pink - this is one of the primary colors the s10 should launch him it's also pretty likely that we'll see some sort of gradient finish on at least one of the models given that Samsung has been now testing them on their more niche devices and well everyone is doing them on the bottom you can actually see the codename here SM g9 7 0 0 that is what we're expecting it to be and taking a look at the side ahead Jack which doesn't necessarily confirm that it will be on the final phone but given the amount of fun Samsung has made of Apple for ditching it I think they'd be foolish to follow suit okay then we've got the cameras and this should be quite a significant leap from the Galaxy S 9 plus the S 10 plus should be coming with a triple camera setup with the same variable aperture that we saw on the primary lens with the s 9 plus and the same telephoto to be able to zoom in two times but with the addition of an ultra white this brand-new lens would capture a 123 degree field of view also now that the fingerprint scanner has disappeared from the back something can shift the cameras back to the horizontal arrangement they had previously which they introduced on the Galaxy Note 8 and in its place we're hoping for an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner to be present in the screen of the phone which brings us to the front and this is where you'll notice disparities to what the actual phone will look like with the budgets all these cloned phones they can't quite reproduce the punch hole display that we should be seeing but essentially with the s10 what you're probably gonna get is a little cutout with either a single or a dual camera in little pill shape in the top corner kind of like this now the cloned phone's camera obviously completely sucks but it was cool to see the different wallpapers that they've created lots of focus on gradients and parallax effects and I'm sure see some new wallpapers when the S 10 launches also the skin on this phone isn't quite right you might know that Samsung has launched something they call one UI and this is probably what's gonna be pre-loaded on the s10 and this will bring a whole number of improvements like less menus redesigned icons as well as software features like the suppose it bright night mode essentially Samsung's equivalent of pixels nitesite and this is genuinely something I can't wait to see if you combined the software prowess of Google's nitesite with the hardware prowess of Samsung's variable aperture being able to open up the aperture to let more light in a night you could get stunning photos I'm just super excited to see it in action anyway guys hope you enjoyed the video if you did if you could smash that subscribe button that would really mean a lot my name is Aaron this is mr. he's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music]
