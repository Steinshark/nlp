yes people are discontented with the bad storytelling but it doesn't necessarily mean that if you give them good stories they're going to live good lives the proof in the pudding is that if you listen to all these people people like the critical Drinker and and his ilk that have been uh critiquing the the new Lord of the Rings series even before they've managed to see it uh their reference point where their relationship with with the show is almost one of religious awe um they they for them the experience of the story has has become a Akin to a religious experience and so when it's wrong they react to it not as frustrated artists but as people who walked into a heretical church right and I'm saying this not to not to make fun of them um I I understand what's going on I think and it's uh it's it's a function of where we are in this civilization it's a function of the decadence of of Western Christendom in the level that it is this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] so hello everyone I'm really excited to be back with Nicholas kotar for those who follow the channel you've seen him a few times on uh having discussions about all kinds of things he is a writer himself he just published a novella called the son of the deathless in his Raven Sun series but we're also going to talk about this particular cultural moment of what kind of stories we can tell in the strange times that we are living so Nicholas first of all congratulations on the new book thank you it's uh the the pandemic killed storytelling for me or at least the active storytelling uh so this is the first thing I've written in first long thing I've written almost two years yeah well they you know the idea of people seem to think that they said you know you're locked in your house you know you're you know this is a good time to to do but it's not always because it was there was such an impressive we're in such an impressive State it's not easy to get those creative juices flowing let's say no I mean creative juices don't come out of a vacuum they come out of out of a uh a craft a ritual and when when the ritual is destroyed because everything about your life is no longer ritualized and it's you're stuck in this massive I mean it's it's the Doom right it's just around you all the time and you can't hide from it and that's that's not conducive so no yeah it didn't help and so um yeah tell us first of all baby tell us a little bit about what the what the the premise of the this new Novella is and then we'll move into our Strange time and strange storytelling sure uh the the story I think we're gonna talk we're gonna be talking about this I think a lot but it came it came at me in a very weird way um I used to think that we created our own stories I used to think that it was a matter of uh kind of sitting down and assembling certain pieces of things together you know reading Russian fairy tales coming up with a concept from that kind of weirdly meshing things and then allowing the story to come out of the structure um not necessarily I'm an outliner or anything like this but it your story is usually used to come out from from a fairly regimented and structured uh kind of approach to to writing for me but um right around covet time this probably would have been it's already more than two years ago now I was I took a course with our mutual friend Paul kingsnorth uh which which was called rewilding your words I didn't know what it what what was going to happen but I knew that it was something that I needed to experience just because Paul was such a compelling figure and I was really curious to see what would happen and I came in with the with one idea of what I would do I thought okay this is going to help me write more beautiful setting like it's gonna allow me to uh to make my writing more pretty basically and what it did instead was break me in in pieces um the course is wonderful uh uh Jonathan you and I are are members of uh are both teachers in a new program that we talked about uh on on a different podcast Saint Basil School of writing Paul's joined us there but um he's teaching a version of that of this uh course for St basil school and so I'm really excited to see how that's going to work because it's he what he effectively does is that it doesn't teach you anything about how to structure or craft your writing he teaches you how to how to be in tune with the natural world around you in ways that will then allow for a story to emerge that's almost a kind of duet between you and and the world that you live in so he speaks a lot about allowing the setting the place to be a character in and of itself he writes that way you've read the wake I think although you read beast beast yeah yeah well the the setting there is I mean the Beast is the setting in a lot of ways and although the creature does show up at the in the end it's a kind of incarnation you know of of the of the land that he is having this spiritual battle it's so key he has this very strong sense in his own writing of that um and what it did for me is it it opened up an entirely new and different way of accessing the what Tolkien would call The Cauldron of story that kind of uh common source that everybody takes their stories from but in a way that isn't structured in a way that isn't planned in a way that is very surprising and very odd and it fit for me at that moment because as the world was crumbling around me um a lot of people went the opposite way right they went to the Super regimented kind of Lifestyles and sometimes that came out in in the tenor of the way that they talked about it right you have to find structure in your side yourself you you try to write regiment everything around you try to find the reason why these things are happening you become rational you become hyper um rationalistic in either one direction or the other right we've seen we've seen both extremes during the pandemic um that is not good for story uh it's it doesn't I mean you could write stories out of that and in fact many of the stories that we're watching right now on Disney plus and all the other streams uh are coming from exactly that thing um I don't want to do that I had no desire to do that yeah those stories end up looking like utilitarian or propaganda they they tend to be focused on a kind of really clear purpose let's say in terms of the story yeah definitely well it's I mean Purpose Driven or theme driven storytelling is something that everybody does right so it's not it's not it's necessarily a bad thing but when your purpose um overwhelms the story uh I noticed it for the first time actually when I saw one division um there was there were a few scenes in there when the writers stopped writing a story and they started to write a lecture yeah and it was really it was really annoying it took me out of the story completely and it shouldn't have because that was such a experimental and weird um kind of uh story that one the one division was where at least it was trying to be I don't think It ultimately succeeded I don't think it was very good but um one of the things that went against it was that they didn't lean into the weirdness the weirdness became window dressing for for a very conventional story um that you know if I haven't watched uh doctor strange but I I've read about it and I know that that you were exactly right in your predictions about this being simply nothing more than than self-crowning like a kind of yeah it's really bad apogee yeah but it's interesting to notice how the let's say because I grew up in a in a product kind of Evangelical world and I wrote three plays that were within that context and had some Evangelistic purposes like that's not all they were but they definitely needed to have that inside the play right and every time I remember like I remember writing them and real and and writing it and realizing oh I need to have that moment yeah like moment in the play and I cringe every time I every time I think of it and now when I watch that's why I find it so difficult to watch Christian movies I had such a deep a deep uh experience with that because I wrote three of those myself and I produced them and we toured and we did all that and so it's like when I see it I'm like oh this is so painful but I never thought that I would see it in the Hollywood movies as much as I'm seeing it now so it's interesting because it's because it's bad screenwriting everything everybody knows this bad screener but uh there's something going on in Hollywood not I don't know if we want to talk about this too much but it's becoming clear more and more and so this is something that came out in Barry Weiss's podcast or may have been her sub stack but she talked about how and I'm not I'm not quoting this so if I'm getting it wrong I do apologize but she basically was quoting an Insider who said that after the George Floyd um riots there was a a mandate from Heaven yeah a mandate from not heaven uh that said get rid of all the old guys and uh make sure you diversify your core now the the issue is the problem is and the this Insider was very open about it I think uh I don't know if it's a he or she I believe he was anonymous uh made it clear that the pool of possible screenwriters is small as it is because the life of a screenwright in Hollywood is absolutely miserable you get you get paid almost nothing and you're working in you're working for these big shots that basically force you to do stuff and then put their own writing on top of yours they put their name on your writing right and that's that's something that you accept if you want to live that life but there's not a lot of people that do and of those that are already there there's not that great of a percentage of of a diverse population so in sort of shoehorning in the Mandate what's happening is not that these people can't tell good stories it's that they haven't had the training and they're put in positions of you know leader of writing room uh and they're trying to tell good stories but they haven't been trained in in the absolute basics of Storytelling so they're defaulting to what they're seeing in the New York Times and in the cultural uh conversation which is a top-down speaking interwagging Yeah but that I mean that kills that kills the immersion and story within as soon as it happens and it doesn't matter what side you're on yeah even if you agree with it you're not in the story anymore you've just been pulled out definitely so it brings us to our major point which is in this strange topsy-turvy times when even those let's say that those that would portray even themselves as being the margin are now becoming more or less than finger wagging like what kind of story can we tell and how can we tell this story well that was that was my thought you know and of course as soon as I had I thought I had to abandon the thought because if I start thinking like that then the story I'm going to tell is not going to be story forward but it's going to be theme forward so if I'm thinking I need to tell a story that's going to embrace the margins that's it I've lost the game right so this is this is weird dance and you know this your your creative you understand especially a creative within within a you know within the tradition bound um craft such as iconography there's always a dance between um what you want to do and what the tradition tells you to do and and what you hope uh you're able to do in terms of your personal uh input but also you you want you want to add something new just you that's also a dance with with the with the tradition it's it's weird it's it it's a very strange it's very diff for that moment when uh I think in particular when the premise becomes available to you especially after after Paul's Court yeah so of course was to was to be able to write the kind of premise that would be able to embrace the the margin that would be able to nudge people in that want them to think and feel but without preaching to them and I tried to write it but from from a place where I was where I had a very clear idea of what I wanted to happen right and it was a disaster it really didn't work I wrote a few scenes of this thing uh I had an idea of who the main character was I had an idea of who's what his motivations were going to be and I wrote it it was flowing beautifully and I put it aside for a bit stuff happened life Etc and I got back to it and I started to read it and I hated I hated it with a with a burning passion it was like this is the worst thing I have ever written and I've been writing for years now this is this has not happened um so I tried to remember all Kings North's um lessons I tried to let go of the story I I tried to let go of what I wanted the story to be I still had a sense of the of who the character was I had a sense of what the setting was the timing within the larger um within the larger uh world that I ride in and it took me going out into nature literally and being in the in the fresh air and not thinking not listening to podcasts not talking to anybody but just being in the world not the mechanical world of the city but out there because I live you know in cow country so it took it took me being out there for suddenly this thing to hit me and go boom this is where you have to go and it wasn't me you know I don't know what it was and I'm not the kind of person to say God spoke to me and therefore and then I sat down and I wrote this thing and it was it was a cooperation between me and God now I'm not going to say that but whatever that voice was it was there and it was outside of myself and it then then began the song and from then on out it it just wrote it just wrote itself and it's different from the from the other stuff I wrote in a lot of ways it's a different voice it's a different kind of um uh it's it's a different kind of character it's a different kind of approach to storytelling and I think I hope uh it's basically I embraced my my fairy tale telling instincts so instead of trying to tell an Epic Fantasy according to the Epic Fantastical uh rule book and there is a rule book of Epic Fantasy there there are steps that you have to follow there are things you have to do otherwise the reasons are like this is an Epic Fantasy I'll never read this again so I threw that out and I said no I'm telling a fairy tale and I'm not retelling a fairy tale I'm telling a new one which is what people used to do all the time and it used to be the center thing right it was the center of town it was where the fireplace was is wherever everybody gathered in the evenings of the village this used to be the activity of the center and now the center is downtown now the center is Facebook now the center is whatever political Insanity we're living through at the moment the center is the thing that has gone utterly Bonkers so in going back to an older form of Storytelling I hope oddly enough I'm now I think I hope embracing the storytelling tropes and techniques of the margin which means what for you what do you think that means um well it it started it starts off with the process of writing itself in allowing the story to not be entirely limited by the the tropes of what people expect it to be so it's a difficult thing to to balance the entertainment factor of a story because everybody wants to have a certain repeated pattern of course with the uh with the freshness the newness of a story that has never been told before but that has to have they have to be both you can't have a story that's so unique and so new that has that you know that's never been told that nobody can relate to um that's you know Marcel Deshawn that's that's uh that's and yeah yeah Eternal music that's all that's all the stuff that we've been we had to go through for the past 50 100 years right so you have to figure out how to how to do that but it also means um I think it means telling stories that are weird telling stories that are bizarre using imagery that doesn't necessarily have immediate associations in people's minds choosing characters that are fools choosing characters that are children and allowing the the the setting of the world itself that you're writing to become a character and to dictate what happens so this is really weird and it's very hard to do because a setting isn't a character has no motivations it's a thing but there are stories out there and they're very interesting things like Alice in Wonderland like the Gorman Goss Trilogy by by Mervin Peak like Lord of the Rings um where the setting itself is actually a character it it determines what what the human characters do within the story to a large extent it's not simply because there's mountains here and there's then there's you know a river there that you have to cross it's that the place itself has has its own spirit and that spirit will determine how the how the characters react as they walk through it that's not something you see in a lot of modern storytelling um because it's dangerous because you don't know what's going to happen and you have to be as a Storyteller you have to be more connected to Natural the natural world to be able to do that realistically because if you're a writer who sits in a Garrett all day and has never walked outside and has never had the experience of touching a tree and feeling what the bark of a tree actually feels like has never seen the changing seasons on the same road year and year out and how the how the trees change in their color how they change in their shape and how just being in the same spot walking the same path every day for 365 days means that every single day is different this kind of rootedness this kind of being in place I produces very strong storytelling in good storytellers I'm not including myself in the list yet eventually hopefully but it's what I'm aiming for and it's what I was trying to begin and it's what Paul kingsner does so well it's what Tolkien did so well he was a rooted man he was a man who was stuck in place right he didn't travel a lot he but he was very at what at one with his with his natural world not this you know jet-setting crazy world that we live in where you go on a plane every time you need to go to on vacation where you're sorry Jonathan I know that you're you're about to enter into that world yourself traveling so you sent me you sent me a quote by Martin Shaw who for those who don't know Martin Shaw he's a mythologist Storyteller from Ireland he's been kind of appearing in this little corner I guess of the internet because he's had some he's a friend of Paul Kings North and he's had some some uh intimations of Christianity and Orthodoxy something which he thought he'd never uh would have I'm going to talk to him in the next few months I'm not sure what what day exactly but it's gonna happen so you send me this quote by him and you said when the center is in crisis it is to the edges that we must attend and so I thought that sounded a lot like when I say something like watch the pools you know that the the carnival in the end will flip back into will bring back a kind of normal world but what is it that you think that this can do for us at this moment well it I think we're we are storytelling creatures we know that we talk about it a lot and you and I have talked about this repeatedly and I think we've become even a little bit too complacent in the idea that stories will change the world we simply have to tell a good story I don't think that's true uh as as much as I thought before and that's because we have a very educated and a very cultured um people now there's there are a lot of a lot of people that have access to high education and they're used to the kind of good storytelling that we're not seeing right now on television and that's why you're seeing so much discontent in so many quarters about about the the level of quality but there's a yes people are discontented with the bad storytelling but it doesn't necessarily mean that if you give them good stories they're going to live good lives the proof in the pudding is that if you listen to all these people people like the critical Drinker and and his ilk that have been uh critiquing the the new Lord of the Rings series even before they managed to see it uh there a reference point where their relationship with with the show is almost one of religious awe um they they for them the experience of the story has has become a Akin to uh a religious experience and so when it's wrong they react to it not as frustrated artists but as people who walked into a heretical church right don't don't recognize the exclamations or recognize the exclamations as being um exactly no that's a really good analogy it seems for sure that people that are freaking out about this new Lord of the Rings series are really acting as if there is a heresy in front of them and it has to be denounced it has to be expunged you know it has to be and and you don't have to watch the thing it's it's enough to know a few facts it's enough to listen to the uh to the character the actors talk about the thing it's enough to listen to the the the show Runners talk about the thing to be able to have all the necessary information that you need to battle the heresy because they're they're apologies they're not storytellers well some of them are but um and I'm saying this not to not to make fun of them um I I understand what's going on I think and it's uh it's it's a function of where we are in this civilization it's a function of the decadence of of Western Christendom in the level that it is at the Historical moment that it is so that means that if we simply I think if we simply revert to a kind of uh hero's journey archetypal story over and over and over again like we've talked about like Star Wars then the best that we can hope for is the kind of uh cultural dominance through merchandising and LARPing that Star Wars has managed to exert over the world yeah and if you you know if obviously most people know that this is the case if you don't read the book how Star Wars conquered the universe it's a fascinating history of the of the lore and and what happened it just gives you an idea of just how much this has a religious character for people who you know the kinds of people that build from scratch Stormtrooper suits or the Darth Vader suit not thinking for a moment of course the Darth Vader is supposed to be the figure of evil because it's not about that um so it's I don't think it's enough to have this kind of a watered down heroes or anything anymore although we do need to have the kinds of fairy tale structures that Tolkien talks about in in his essay on fairy stories they the the structures that lead to the EU catastrophe the the sudden flip at the end the way that we get there has to be weird now it has to be odd it has to be unexpected it has to be bizarre purposely right and in Russia you see this by the way in modern literature so Russia for because of the Soviet Union and because of um the predominance of social realism things like this the way that the writers responded to it was by writing absurdist um uh what's the technical term like super absurdist um magical realism yeah like Master and Margarita like Master Margarita exactly that's the first one but then it went even crazier with people like Victor pilavia who's a very well-known and very well-known author internationally and is a consistent bestseller in Russia and writes absolutely insane nihilistic crazy flipped bizarreness and people drink eat it up in Russia they love it because because they understand that he is a fool and he is very wise so our job now is very difficult because we could go that route we could go the root of the of the absolute negator uh we Master Margarita did that very well but in order to do that uh he had to rewrite the history of the Gospel in a way that negated Christ's Divinity that was the only way he was going to be able to tell that story in a way that would work so you have this incredible novel that that has a very problematic uh moral heart to it uh it's all about nihilism in a lot of ways yeah as a response to this kind of good versus evil inverted thing that the Soviet Union was was pushing down in everybody else's throats so we can't go there it's dangerous right because because if we're honest about what we have to do as storytellers we have these we have our listeners souls in our in our hands right cupped in our hands they if you're a good writer as soon as you've plunged the uh the reader into your world you're responsible for what happens to that person in that world it's it's scary yeah but it's it's true so you have to unsettle them you have to go to Dark Places you have to mess up their their very comfortable presuppositions about what the world is but you also have to do it in a way that reinforces the pattern the pattern of reality as you talk about all the time that's an incredibly hard thing to do technically a storytellers and that's the challenge that's ahead of us and that's what Martin Shaw is doing uh in in talking about his that quote specifically he writes really bizarre weird stuff that's very French and very like kind of prose poetry kind of stuff that's that's very on the verge of paganism Christianity inspired by um you know the ancient myths but also speaking them in a language that's understandable and if you allow yourself to enter into it it can be really very interesting and very transformative in a lot of ways hmm and so who do you see as being do you see Loris as being an example of that yes for example right yeah Loris is funny because uh on the one hand it's it's very it's a very conventional narrative it's it's it follows all the Beats of the saints saint life of a particular kind of Saint life but if you're paying attention um does it and if you're reading it carefully especially if you're reading it in Russian the translation is good but it doesn't it doesn't do absolute justice as Noah's translation of course can I can say that I'm a translator uh um there are some profoundly shocking moments in Loris there's some really awful things that happen in Loris um the the death of of his of his wife and child uh you know the inciting incident that leads to his becoming a snake they're described in details that nobody should ever describe when talking about women and children yeah um really horrifying stuff so that's one thing then there's also like he pushes the limits of what of what we consider to be saintly yeah when you have the pugnacious uh fools for Christ you know duking it out while walking on water walking on water yeah man that stuff is crazy I mean a lot of people are like this you can't have this this isn't this isn't right but if you've heard also The Verge on masochism which he brings his character to here sometimes you're wondering like is this just a kind of strange uh masochism like a kind of nihilistic masochism or is this an actual negation of self like when he lets himself get stung by all the mosquitoes and stuff and you're like what you know really yes and well actually that I think you may have taken that from from an actual life of one of the Russian Saints yeah um so that that has that has happened but even like that's the thing about the lives of the Saints too is that when you read them there's is some of that in there right we we tend to iron out the lives of the Saints or the medieval Legends we've kind of made them nice and clean even the fairy tales we made them nice and clean a lot of the versions of the fairy tales that we have now have have taken out all the strangeness that was there just a few a few centuries ago and that's been one of my ideas is to how can we bring back the strangeness or some of the things that are that seem off color to to contemporary morality or sensibilities but use it in a way that is revelatory rather than just a kind of shocking for Scandal or shocking right shocking like I've been thinking about like the Rapunzel for example but in the original Rapunzel stories Rapunzel gets pregnant in the tower we've expunged that completely from all the versions that we tell our kids but I kept thinking without that it actually is weakening what the story is about and the idea of the man who forgets the mother of his children you know in this in his fall and then has to hear her voice again in order to recognize her I'm like no we need to put that back in like is is there a way to put it back in even in a story for kids uh especially in a moment where kids are no longer like naive innocent and and innocent the way that we wish they were because they're well you say no longer but I'm not sure if they ever were they ever were exactly yeah so is there a way to put that back to put it back in which would reveal a higher aspect of the story rather than just be for shot but that's just that's edgy like for kids it's not that hard because you won't go as far but for adults it's a how can I say this like it's a it can be really tricky because they're well so much so much of the modern fiction is like is shock a lot of it has a lot of shock for shock value for sure so um those of you who are watching on YouTube will see that we've suddenly uh and magically changed our appearance um and there's a reason for that uh we had technical difficulties because we were about to say something so incredible interesting astounding yeah that nobody out there wanted it to happen um in actual fact I was running out of ideas and it was a really good thing that happened because then I had to go back and and uh yeah and read up on a little bit of jock Dairy da and stuff like that and a little evening of post-structuralist theory you know you know just a little bit of difference in my life you know there you go exactly what I need no but in all seriousness um it was probably a good thing because uh I was uh as we talked as we talked about before um I do like to allow my thoughts to kind of wander when I'm out there uh running around in in the wild which I do fairly a lot of because I train for a certain kind of sport called adventure racing which we will not talk about today but anyway um I was uh thinking about uh yesterday uh the idea of how modernity fractures Us and how um what what what the value of shock is to to let fractured people realize they're fractured and this is where we this is where we ended last time we were talking about how with this kinds of stories that we're that that were being subjected to the kind of stories that we're surrounded by um it's very it's it's difficult to avoid as a as a writer as a maker as a Creator uh to use it's difficult to avoid using shock just to get people out of a very comfortable buffered state that they exist in because the reality is that everybody is really seriously fractured as a result of modernity and until we realize that we are that fractured there really can't be any sort of integration or wholeness that can happen within the single person much less the larger society which was of course made so obvious by the pandemic and it's I think it's a mistake to think that the pandemic caused it uh the pandemic just made it obvious yeah just eccentricated it revealed something that was there yeah it accentuated but it also revealed how deep that fracturing went and I think it's important also to to emphasize that that fracturing really is within each individual person it's not just a matter of some people being revealed to have very dangerous ideologies that now must all be explained right it's not that everybody was an aunt it was a fascist and now the fascists have to be removed no it's all of us are are broken all of us are fractured and that's a function of the culture of modernity um and I was listening to this podcast uh yesterday and this will connect back to how the margins work with storytelling in a second but um the this was a really interesting conversation between two makers and one of them suggested that uh there's that the the connection between uh fragmentation or fracturing that's happening around us and the need for I for the search for identity is not accidental because identity he was saying in its root the word identity is connected to uh Oneness is connected to Unity so I was it's been this is a thought that's been percolating in my head and I haven't been able to fully articulate it yet maybe you can help me do that maybe we can do that for the rest of what's happening today but it's really striking to me that as lit as literacy declines as people's engagement with old stories declines as people become inundated more and more in the kind of commercialized visual culture that we have identity seems to slip away more and more from people and they and they grasp for it a lot stronger so if you're considering for example this really bizarre and strange and terrifying thing that's happening especially with young girls where there were so many of them are now reaching out and searching for an identity that is other because they feel uncomfortable with the fracturing within them What If part of the problem is that there has never has not been enough of a integration through a story that has been available to people in traditional cultures because the traditional culture has always embraced the journey to the toward the other through a search of identity by crossing the line between the center and the margin by going from the village into the forest but if there is no common tradition of Storytelling and if the stories that we do tell that are a proxy for that common traditional storytelling are the new Marvel or the new Star Wars then where are you are all of us going to find that internal integration if it's not being offered in Story the only other option for some people is surgery I mean this is a thought that that I'm grasping for and I haven't been able fully to articulate it yet but I think there might be something to it I think there might be something to the fact that maybe we just need a better unifying story that is shocking because we need to have that moment of shock initially to for for the person to realize that their internal world is incredibly fractured and if I can extend that a little bit what really disturbs me is that amongst people who do not like the idea of a unifying story or a common storytelling tradition people generally tend to be more on more in the liberal uh scale of things it is almost anathema to suggest that there is such a thing as taste that there is such a thing as good storytelling versus bad storytelling all they can do is say I have my preferences you have yours and don't you dare suggest to me that my preference is in some way inferior to yours it's just a matter of taste but not taste in the in the larger um organic uh objective sense of taste being determined by taste makers being determined by by cultural norms right it's a kind of personal thing that is in effect especially in the in extreme cases a kind of following of your passions so why this is why you have people who read 300 books a year that all of them have the same theme they all they're all basically the same plot structure they're the same character the same type of characters the same tropes they just keep reinforcing and most of them are trash it keeps reinforcing the same fuzzy warm buffered feeling that separates you from the knowledge of your own internal fragmentation um so I don't know I don't know uh well I think that oh so I think that your intuition about identity is definitely right that's for sure that's for sure and the way to understand it um the best way to understand what's going on is to understand how let's say how sin Works in us or how our passions work with us and so one of the things that happened so let's say we could you could say as Christians we could say something like our identity is full to the extent that we participate in the body of Christ to the extent that we are little Christ that Christ in us like all the ways that Saint Paul talks about like that is the fullness of our identity and so in a way it is it's the fullness of you but it's also transpersonal that is it pulls you out of your idiosyncratic you know uh self uh and so then you have within you you you have these pulls and these thoughts and these these passions that they they capture you and when they capture you they actually try to make you think that that's all you are yeah you know especially in the moment when you're when you're let's say taken by the passion it's like the passion takes over and that's what you are and so if you understand that at a and the those passions and those idiosyncratic patterns they have a they have an appearance and they have a mythological appearance right they actually have a an appearance in storytelling um it appearance in in in art you know and it's the demons it's like it's the mixture it's the Dark Shadows in the Eastern tradition these dark kind of Shadows or in the western tradition it's these hybrid Monsters uh that come to torture you right this all this this is this is a it's not like it like it's not completely objective like a scientific fact but it has a universality to it which which is which is pervasive and so what we're seeing is that's what we're seeing like we're seeing those little identities take over people and that's why they look the way they look that there is no yeah if there's no hiding anymore it's like the right right and that's what that's why the hybridization is happening especially in Western people like the Western people are are clamoring for that hybridization because they think in that mixing of things is going to be some sort of full expression of the self of the of the internal Integrity of the self which is so if you look at it from the side and and don't and try to just be dispassionate about it it's total Madness that's total Madness but okay so this this then extends so this is I have another thought about that because that's what you're talking about then is a kind of full um immersion in a dangerous other while without realizing it that you're doing it because you think you're searching for the self but actually what you're doing is letting in another another and that other will then subsume you it'll it'll possess you right and this can happen in stories too now so this is what's so interesting about the old uh storytelling tropes right the old storytelling uh Styles is that they allow you to fully inhabit in a safe space the idea of being the other because that's what reading is right if if you're reading and you're reading you are in the mind and behind the eyes of a character that isn't you that is a different sex there's a different skin color that's a different social uh status you are fully inhabiting as much as that's possible uh that person's experience and you're allowing that person's experience to to inform your own so you're simultaneously learning more about yourself you're becoming more integrated in yourself but you're also doing that by setting interesting and useful boundaries between you and the other while also having an experience of the other that allows for a very um into integrating type things so you it's you are a self but you're also other without losing self right well that's because yeah well that's because the space of imagination has a certain quality to it it's not this it's in the imaginary space is the Fantastical space is not the same as the space with which you identify just so so I think that that's that's hard for people it might seem like an obvious thing to say but it is it is real so like let's say storytelling it's not the only function it can have but like you said it can have an exploratory function but that exploratory function is one which is which is recognizing that I'm entering into a Fantastical space which is not my space which is not me whereas what one of the things that's going on in terms of the um so that's one aspect of Storytelling it's not the only one there is an aspect of Storytelling which is also my story like you you know the Trojan War is not a Fantastical storytelling right it's my story it's the story that I remember that I engaged liturgically and participated and that's the same with the gospel stories or the same with you know the the liturgical year as the story that we participate in and engage with but the more Fantastical type Stories the ones that are like like you said where you you take you take the role of another let's say they have a function but I think that what's going on and that's one of the reasons why Star Wars is becoming a religion is that we've made it upside down we've made this weird upside down relationship where we want to be some anime like you know anime character we want to be Luke Skywalker or we want to live in these imaginary worlds uh and we hate our own story like we hate our own history we hate our own our our own Legends uh and so you can see I mean it really is a an image of the of the end like it is an image of this upside down place where now everything is and then then that upside down place has many iterations many forms it can look like that strangeness of of Cosplay but it can also look like you said which is the fetishization of strangeness and a desire to take all strangeness into myself becoming become a hybrid animal you know fetishize uh uh you know and now we're seeing more like the race changing where people are wanting to be another race or you know it's like all of these types of behaviors can demonstrate the problem the problem the confusion or even the inversion between the idea of a of a story which is remembering my my con my connection and the story which is this exploratory dream like experience of you know of uh yeah of fighting monsters and doing so it's it's an inversion of hierarchy again oh yeah for sure there's no doubt about that it is that it's like a weird upside down place that we're standing in there are ways to flip it I think and I think that that's the space that we're in and that it's an exciting space actually to be in which is you know can we tell the Fantastical stories in a way that will surprise us back into our own story or can we tell the our our story in a way that will be slightly Fantastical but to shock us back into it you know I think that that's definitely possible right now well it's it seems to be the the best time for it I mean I've talked before about how fantasy as a storytelling um is a storytelling mechanism is just better right now because people have become saturated with the storytelling um approaches of realistic fiction and because in 20th century in the in the 20th century realistic fiction has become little more than a my story that is nothing that is almost nothing more than a constant regurgitation of internal fragmentation and yeah who would want to read that so yeah very small group people who are who very much you know appreciate that internal regurgitation because that's all they do all day yeah but you know for the rest of us um let's find something a little bit different yeah and so I think that like if you follow the the line let's say between someone if you follow the line also between like realistic fiction if you look at the 19th century romantic and the early 20th century realists and then you move into the surprise of of of Lewis and token and the inklings and this kind of weird the surprise it was already there like it is a continuation of the romantics to a certain extent yeah but it's an interesting idea like I really like the idea that token and C.S Lewis were kind of writing the Old Testament for us like an Old Testament for for for today which is that how can we now make that next step and I there are probably several Solutions but the one that I decided that we decided my brother and I was to tell a Fantastical version of our story in a way that is is in some way scandalous because it's like it's changing the character that's doing all this but it's hopefully pointing you back towards your own real legendarium like to our own true legendarium which you know in order to be able to engage with that legendarium you have to come to love it again and um that's that's the that's the trick and the trouble here and unfortunately uh it is it is a critical moment for that because as I'm as I'm looking at attempted expressions of this such as the new rings of power show which I've only started to watch um there this internal conflict is between Cree uh loving your old legendarium and telling it in a fresh way or rewriting the old legendarium to fit the bed better than you paradigm that conflict is very strong in that show yeah and it's it's very interesting to see it pan out and part part of it is just stupid storytelling choices but part of it is this is this insistence and I okay so I I'm probably getting trouble for for raising this in the first place but the idea of uh diverse casting is you can argue about this and you can talk about this actually much longer than people are willing to to do because most people either come come into one of two extreme camps one uh you're a racist uh two uh you're a woke garbage person right uh and neither the twain shall meet ever but uh there have been very interesting examples of of diverse casting in in films that I like very much in the 90s there was a wonderful Shakespeare adaptation called much to do about nothing by Kenneth Brana that used colorblind casting um and as a kid initially my first impress my first impression of a black guy and Keanu Reeves being Blood Brothers was like huh but like within the first five minutes of it passing I'm like okay this is I don't care because the actors are so good but of course this is Shakespeare and it's been adapted so many different times in so many different ways that there's a lot of space for it to be adapted in new and interesting ways so that's one possible way of looking at it the problem is though of course that the way the reason that most of the pro people for diverse casting are talking about this is the following you have this vast swath of young people who have a certain skin color and they read Tolkien and they see token on the screen and they cannot associate themselves with the characters on the screen or on the page therefore we must change the skin color of some of the main characters so that these poor children are able to associate with those uh imagined characters and inhabit this Fantastical space which is a proposition that is extremely flawed because it's ridiculous because it's a fantastic world like it's not right I mean it's not real like and yeah oh man my point is that it removes from the table the possibility that one can have an experience of another that is integrative and that is and that doesn't remove the experience of the self so that's that's something that I find problematic I'll leave it there because it is a very authority issue but my point is that you're right this is a very interesting moment because this show could have been something that started to reintegrate people on a large scale I think that the Peter Jackson movies started to do it even though they took they took a few um wrong turns in some of the interpretation but we'll look at General look at let me give you an example of someone who actually did that right now and and it's funny because it's not our lead it's it's the it's the guy that he's haunting me is so so Neil Neil Gaiman wrote a version of the the northern Gods Legend yeah and and it's perfect like it's it's super well told it's very respectful of the story it's basically a retelling of these Legends in a way that is celebratory that that has a kind of bombastic uh um feel to it you know it has this this energy to it and the of course the only reason why he could do that is because it's not Christian like it's a it's it's Northern and it's vegan and therefore it's okay to do that but yeah I mean the the technique and the style and the possibility is there for us to to take like we could do that for some of the a lot let's say a lot think of all the the wild stories from the golden legend or from Russian uh yeah Russian fairy tales yeah or the Russian fairy tales nobody knows these stories uh and they could be retold in ways that would surprise everybody the Middle Ages is actually an amazing Source because because it's the Dark Ages Nobody Knows the stories like nobody knows the legends of Alexander nobody knows some of a lot of these Arthurian romances uh you like I made a video on this Arthurian romance called silence you know which is so fascinating I mean like Merlin is in it is this like crazy man who laughs the whole time oh my God crazy Merlin is the greatest character ever I love crazy it's like it's like he shows up in the really ancient Welsh uh Legends the guy was nuts he was off his rocker crazy it's like so interesting yeah like a wild end of the forest and so it's like that version of Merlin could be retold could be told in a way that could be super fascinating for people to discover and but there's that's just one example there are many many other examples and so it seemed like it's a I I really do feel like it's a it could be an exciting moment and also because when they reach when let's say when the the people in Hollywood you know redo the Green Knight yeah they fail like I don't know what to tell you they fail because they're they're they're crippled with their their desire to to inject their message into it and so because of it they they don't do a good job well yeah because well it's not just their desire to inject a message it's these people like the director of the green I have a lot of respect from he's a very interesting person and I think he's trying to do something um well so the problem is that these people honestly believe um that meaning can only be made by the self without a reference point to an objective standard and this this calls this harks back to that graphic artists um that you talk to the the famous guy from Ben hatke his his um his absolute resistance to considering the possibility of there being a best story ever told because then it it means that my story the one I have to make for myself the meaning making mechanism that I have will be somehow will be somehow impoverished because there's something greater than me instead of seeing it as a possibility to align yourself as much as humanly possible to to an infinitely beautiful model it becomes a limiting factor because meaning must be made only within but you know what it's happening already it's happening it's happening on the edges on the margins they're you know the aforementioned Martin Shaw uh did a collaboration with uh with a now recently deceased poet named Tony Hoagland called cinderbiter which by the way if you have if you people haven't read it you have to it's a retelling of ancient Celtic uh folk tales in modern poetic form obviously this is marginal stuff not a lot of people are going to read it but it's life-changing poetry it really is and if you can force yourself to get through it it's really incredible uh Paul King's North stories are also marginal but they're that's what they're doing they're engaging with uh deep very profound real um objective realities that form they can't have the possibility of forming our internal reality um who else I had somebody else well I mean when I read that when I read Beast I was I was astounded it was like because I I you know when I was younger I was also I was one of those people that read a lot of modern literature and and when I read Beast I was like this is like tokien and decade like how did token come together and it's like Smash and I thought this is a real interesting possibility like to take James Joy like for example there's things in James Joyce which are astoundingly powerful and there's some things in James Joyce with her which are just like unbearably horrible I guess you know and so so you there are some Indulgence like the desire in modernism to unite form form and meaning even in the grammar and in the manner in like the structure like that's something which can be taken and can be can be used for very very powerful means because that's what you have well that's what T.S Eliot did so well that's what TS Eliot did so well in all of his poetry right so if you but again you need that shock right you need to be shocked into it because if you just come into it without uh without being prepared it wash over you it's too difficult it's too it's too structurally vast it's complicated um so okay well I just remembered another one that's doing it so Richard Powers is a is a Pulitzer prize-winning um author he wrote a book called The overstory now he used to be a guy who lived in Tech um and I listened to an interview with him between him and Ezra Klein who's somebody that's very much on the left and somebody that I listen to as a palette cleanser for me to to remember why I think the way I do just to remember how the other side oh Lord okay anyway um so Richard Powers is a guy who used to sit at table with the the uh Silicon Valley Tech people who used to honestly in all earnestness talk about just hold on a little more and immortality is within our grasp whether it's biological or it's informational I mean these are actual serious conversations that these people are having so like cryogenically freezing my brain Etc that sort of thing right the sort of thing that C.S Lewis described so beautifully in That Hideous Strength um you know and that by the way a lot of people are uh recognizing that this Kevin Kelly kind of technology has its own will thing is actually just an entry point for demonic Powers but um but Richard Powers was in this and he's he finally kind of snapped out of it and the reason he snapped out of it is because he recognized that my personal meaning making mechanism as he expressed it my way of making meaning and he's somebody who's capable of doing it a writer somebody who's who's extremely well read uh educated living in a very culturally Rich place the the Bay Area of San Francisco and California surrounded by the best the brightest people in the world and his meaning making meaning making mechanism broke down he was unable to make it anymore and where did he find it in as he calls it the more than human world he he went out into nature and he found in their presences that were greater than he in his mind of course that's you know what he's actually feeling um I dare say is an inkling of natural Revelation it's the same thing that Paul King's North felt uh when he was a Wiccan priest the same thing that Martin Shaw is now feeling when when you know as he says Jesus rescued me to the ground and when it wouldn't let me get up Jesus the the mossy faced Jesus that he that he encountered in the wild uh so what happens on the edges what happens on the margins is indicative of what's going to be mainstream in 10 15 20 years yeah if that's the case then let's get going and let's start writing into that space because soon it's going to be everywhere yeah no I think I think for people that are watching if you're an artist if you're a writer this is an exciting time you know and the exciting as we watch even as we watch the AI art you know appear as we watch the AI writing which will probably it's probably being used by some people without us knowing but it's probably it's all there 100 you know as we're as we're watching as we're watching this I think that it feels like as something is being exhausted there's definitely something else that is being born and we can get an inkling of that in in the things that uh and Nicholas is is bringing up so uh yeah so it's it's an exciting time artists get to it you know we need to we we have there are better stories and we need to tell them and very images we need to make them yeah but you know for us artists it's not as easy as just simply sitting down and doing the thing like there's there's there's things we have to do with ourselves um that that need to make it that will make it possible for us to tell those stories it's not simply okay now I have to do this I'm going to sit down and I'm going to create this thing we have to form ourselves we have to there there are certain things that we have to do um very intensely to our imaginations and to our uh internal fragment itself because we are fragmented too we have to work on that internal wholeness uh not in both a spiritual sense but also in an artistic sense um you know we we need to we need to have occasional fasts from visual culture we need to like stop watching stuff all the time on our phones and on our like seriously yeah because we're saturated there's no space in which we can we can allow for you know the richness of our imagination which is so good at connecting things outside of what it sees we need to like fill ourselves with beauty in all different forms you know if you're a writer go and listen to some music right uh if you're if you're a visual artist go read something that's that's outside of your normal um uh palette right immerse yourself in beauty in all different kinds of things but also limit limit how much you're it you are infusing your eyes with the garbage because there's so much out there yeah all right Nicholas so so tell people where they can find your stuff where they can find your novels you're also doing podcasts uh yeah let them know I'm doing too much yes it's true I I should apply my uh what I just said to myself and cut out half the things I do just just to allow space for for internal wholeness but you know I'm working on it yeah everything you can find everything on my website nicholascotard.com including uh the the new Novella that we talked about which is free uh it's on it's not for sale anywhere this is a an experimental thing I'm doing I'm giving it out in ebook format for free to anyone who signs up to my uh newsletter which you can do on the front page of my website so go and get it so go check it out and and for those who don't know Nicholas and I are also we've also started working together more explicitly and so we are uh we're we're working towards the Snow White story that I've mentioned a few times and in the hopes of maybe moving towards some really great uh fairy tales in the future Nicholas is also an expert on fairy tales he has a a wonderful podcast on Russian fairy tales that you can check out from his website as well and so there's going to be a lot of exciting stuff in the future uh you'll hear more from Nicholas and myself on all that very soon so thanks everybody
