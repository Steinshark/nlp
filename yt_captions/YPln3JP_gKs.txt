hey what's up guys i'm qbhd here and these are the new bose noise canceling headphones 700. terrible name that might be the worst thing about these headphones so when i first saw that bose announced these they kind of took me by surprise but the more you think about them and use them the more it makes perfect sense these are a prime example of competition driving things forward and making better products for us the consumers you'll see what i mean so the most striking part is of course the new pretty minimal design i don't love it i mean it's definitely a unique look it looks fine i think the look they're going for here is minimal and clean but i like that they're still matte black everything there's also a silver version i like that it's pretty lightweight still and i like that they're still over ear but they've kind of seemingly gotten rid of any visible hinges or any broken lines at all it just kind of looks like these smooth ear cups attached to one single stock but you can still rotate them around and it still gives you pretty much a hundred percent of the flexibility you had before the top band is still soft and the clamp force is still pretty solid you put them on and even before turning them on they've created a nice seal it's just definitely a very unique look i think the only thing i really don't like even though i totally get it is the adjustability for height as you can see is now just this smooth slide instead of the clicks you usually get from like every other pair of headphones so this is less satisfying but you know it makes sense with this really smooth minimal look but then pretty much all the new features that they've added are a direct response to all the headphones that have been coming out over the past year that have had all kinds of cool features that have sort of passed them up like if you look back the bose qc series that iconic quietcomfort headphone lineup has been kind of the same almost stubbornly for the past couple years even as we evolved just because they kind of settled in as the industry standard people knew that if you wanted noise cancelling headphones you just got those but then along came the microsoft surface headphones and the sony xm3s and just a bunch of others in the last year that really had all these crazy 2019 features that started to i think actually eat into their sales so they had to respond so now these new features we get in the 700s i'm just calling them the 700s uh many of these new features are just straight from what we just got in this new competition so the 700s now finally have usb type c where all the quiet comforts were micro usb uh these will now also they'll connect to two different bluetooth devices at once and can instantly swap back and forth between them love that you now have also a touchpad on the side of the right headphone with media controls so double tap the touchpad to play and pause swipe up or swipe down to change the volume up or down and swipe forward to go forward swipe backward to go back it's not cold enough for me to test if these like stop working when it's cold or anything like that but they seem to work pretty great now and then there are three physical buttons so on the right side there's the power slash bluetooth button so single tap turns it on and off and a long press goes to pairing mode and then the second button over here is your assistant button so you tap it and it'll pause your music and use the excellent built-in mics to let you ask google assistant things and then on the left side is a noise cancellation adjustment button so you can cycle between a maximum of 10 out of 10 5 out of 10 or 0 out of 10 noise cancellation and those presets are customizable and then the bose music app is all fresh and clean and it'll tell you exactly how much battery you have left to the minute and it'll let you dial in any noise cancellation level from 1 to 10 at any time which is super specific and you can change what assistant the assistant button triggers so if you have a samsung phone you can do bixby maybe you want alexa maybe you want siri that's your call what that bose app notably doesn't have is any sort of eq control so if you're someone who wants to have that extra bass or you want to add to messing with the way it sounds out the box these don't do it from the bose app and i'll say these sound just about as high quality as any bluetooth headphones have been and their sound signature the way they sound is unsurprisingly kind of flat like that's just the way both headphones have sounded for the past couple years with the quiet comforts if you're in it for that big thumping bass you might find these a bit lackluster or disappointing but you're rarely buying these for the big thumping bass you're buying them for the noise cancellation and they definitely deliver on that but it's not all roses there are a couple other things to consider that aren't just upgraded features so like i mentioned it has usb type c which is great but on the other side they have a 2.5 millimeter headphone jack instead of 3.5 so if you run out of battery or you want to plug in wired audio for some reason you have to use i guess their included 2.5 millimeter to 3.5 millimeter cable instead of any old regular audio cable that you have ready to go that's kind of disappointing the case also compared to the competition is decently compact but not the smallest i think the sony's would win again for smallest overall travel size because they actually fold but the bose case does have this neat magnetic flap covering the pocket to put in the cables so that's pretty cool but i also noticed it doesn't come with the airline adapter anymore this is the one that came with the sony's and they've come with bose quiet comfort ones in the past and i feel like just including this made me remember that this was like the default headphones that you listen to on a plane but they're not included with the 700s i don't know maybe they just assume you already have one overall though just as a package this is the upgrade that we've been waiting for from bose the sleeping giant of noise canceling headphones finally got poked enough times into making a move and delivering this a better overall product in pretty much every possible way from the previous generation it's better for us so the natural question a lot of you probably wondering is these or the sonys the mark iii's that i recently have claimed and a lot of people agree are pretty much the king of noise-cancelling headphones now which would you pick and there's a lot of good reasons now for each of them but here's what i will say the sonys are lighter because of their plastic they also fold down smaller better for traveling longer battery life and they're 50 dollars cheaper but if you're buying headphones for noise cancellation the bose are back on top as far as actual quality of noise cancellation the quality of the built-in mics is incredible and the overall build quality of the bose headphones is superior so for the money the sony might be a little bit of a better buy plus i prefer the sound from these with a little more character a little more fun um but i'm glad the competition has brought us yet another incredible choice that's what you get for having better products around so companies compete we win there it is hey thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace you
