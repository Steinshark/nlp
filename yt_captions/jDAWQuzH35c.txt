ladies and gentlemen I am currently away from home on a little vacation in Europe now actually a lot of you in the comment section have invited me to your hometown and I will tell you that I will visit Europe again and I'll probably hit a lot more cities than this time but I'm currently in Amsterdam and let me tell you something right now what ruins a vacation getting your luggage lost getting some train or flight delays maybe you have a really bad experience somewhere get scammed now turns out none of those things happened to me but I am in Amsterdam for Kings Day by total accident and today was kind of wild but none of that ruined my day what ruined my day is what I am going to cover in this video didn't just ruin my day it ruined my vacation in fact I'm going home immediately now that I saw this chess game and I would like to blame a subscriber by the name of Dan all of you any of you are named Dan this might be your game also might be Dan's game and if you're not named Dan you didn't ruin my vacation yet this was sent into me a day or two ago and I am still thinking about it and I'm going to share it with all of you Dan was playing Somebody by the name of Kum uh from Turkey both players get honorary Grandmaster titles because they got featured in a Gotham video that is the entire introduction for this game please sit back relax and um if you get motion sickness yeah you might want to keep a barf bag close for this one or you might just want to keep a barf bag close for this one because well we'll see so the game opens with E4 standard Behavior E5 here you can develop a knight or a bishop but another thing that's useful to do especially in the beginning when you're learning the golden moves of Chess is to put two Pawns in the center supported by the knights Dan does that anyway even though Black's second move is also fighting for the center with a pawn therefore making it impossible for white to casually stroll into the center with two pawns right because then black will capture and this is considered an inaccuracy because white will have a queen in the center and that will allow you black to do this now modern engines and modern analysis show you can go back and you know the position is about equal and it is what it is um but as a beginner you really shouldn't Play Moves Like D4 but EV evidently Kum makes his own rules because Kum does the exact same thing so both guys now have just four Pawns in the center see both guys got the how to win at chessbook by Gotham and they said and you know they saw that they have to put two pawns two knights two Bishops in the center so there they're just going to do it like the pieces don't actually interact with each other by the way you see this this is kind of how I was today in King's day I you know you can't go forward you can't go back you just kind of hope the crowd keeps moving uh absolutely terrifying and um I did think like what if there's a medical emergency luckily there wasn't although there was just not when I was there I heard a good amount of ambulances so anyway once these uh folks get tired of rubbing against each other um as the ddge do here in Amsterdam on Kings Day white plays this move F3 you know you're not developing a knight you're you know you're not Dan spent a lot of time on that move 12 seconds you know coming up with this beauty the thing about the move F3 is that it it straight up loses the game because the idea of this move is to defend the center pawn and upon capturing Queen to H4 check is absolutely lethal whenever you move your F Pawn you've got to be careful about this check because normally you can block but in this position that would result in you losing a rook whereas in this position it would not because the pawn is still protected so F3 technically doesn't make sense and in general when you're playing white you kind of want to take first in the center because when the Center opens up black will lose the right to Castle you will develop and attack the pawn and then your Bishop will come out Etc this is not the way to go now black plays Knight F6 Knight F6 is accidentally an okay move but it's a it's not a good move either uh because white can just play completely free Pawn here targeting the Knight goes from bad to worse because when black plays something like Knight D7 You'll Play Queen D5 and just be two pawns up life will be good but after Knight to F6 Dan thans for wild plays Knight C3 so again big battle here for the center of the board um still you know a flawed approach where neither guy is taking the other person's pawns but they're 400 so it's like a miracle they even know how to boot up a rated game on ch.com Knight C6 now I got to tell you km is impressing me quite a bit like two pawns two knights very principled very good stuff by km really enjoying this type of play White plays Bishop E3 so now we've kind of gone back to regular development both players are developing their pieces but for some reason I mean nobody wants to touch the center which I find very funny uh Kum now plays Bishop to B4 which is another very good move putting some pressure right with some attacks like here and um look this is a pin and it's annoying but the Knight is protected so if I'm playing with white here again I'm thinking to take or I'm thinking to at least Target the Bishops like a lot of the time when when when when a piece comes out and pins you just attacking it will get your opponent to take and yes black can take this Pawn black could have taken that pawn the last like six moves I think it's safe to say black is not going to do that um but anyway what you don't really want to do is make a pin worse so frequently if you're pinned a Last Resort should be double pinning yourself so you were pinned to your king now you're pinned to your queen which while the only difference being that you can now move your knight as in it's legal it's a bad move um and here km wakes up and you know every 400 rated player every 800 rated player 12,600 whatever has a moment in their career where they kind of awaken you ever seen like men in black or some of these like movies like Matrix and the you know somebody awakens they have this big moment this is like when you open your eyes and now all of a sudden Pawn takes Pawn it's a great move and the idea is very simple I think basically km was like oh white cannot take white pinned himself which means his Knight is immobile which means I'm going to take in the center and white responded Pawn takes because that was always the idea and see km went Tunnel Vision on this Pawn which is fine but when he took one thing you always need to keep in mind is Noob what opened up right and the queen opened up so now this is lethal and white just loses because white put pawns out in the center didn't develop the right way weakened their King pinned thems they did a bunch of blunders like a bunch of you know bad moves and black punished them but okay instead of that you know km finds This and like I said that was an Awakening moment there was a pin there and he took and then he took again and now he's just up a pawn but it's about to get a whole lot worse because he's probably going to take the Knight and probably get in Queen D3 is an excellent move counterattacking the Knight and in this position my man km detonates like I can't believe he played this move so the Knight is hanging right the Knight sees the Knight like most people here just play Knight C3 it's just what they play and then here they play Bishop A5 and the game goes on my man km plays Bishop F5 that is a brilliant move for the 447 rating that's an excellent move the idea being that anywhere you move the night now you attack The Rook so for example if white plays Knight F3 Knight to G3 is an attack on the queen uh and The Rook that's what I meant Queen and Rook at the same time you got to be a little careful like I guess you can also you maybe play Knight F2 but play Knight F2 the bishop is not protected so this this the Knight is trapped in the corner and white got a bishop that's the reason you actually have to play Knight G3 it's instructive it's a very common tactical pattern white plays Queen C4 getting out of the way and again is completely lost because of the move Pawn takes I mean my man my man now you know it's a you know you know it's one of these videos so nobody wins the game from here the only person that wins this game uh is The Spectator of this game which all of you are so Pawn takes D4 black is now up two pawns black is now for King bishop and Knight black is going to break into the position uh White completely disregards both attacks plays Bishop to D3 which is an interesting way of fighting back and I guess the idea was that pawn takes Bishop takes um that hangs check made in too by the way but I I don't think km would have seen Queen D2 check not because km hasn't played well but because this is such a rare thing that the enemy Queen could just walk into the territory of the opponent 10 moves into the game like this but it happens when you don't respect your king so uh D takes C3 played in the game right Bishop D3 was played so Pawn takes C3 black is now up Five Points of material km spent a whopping I don't know how much time that is 33 47 seconds on this move and now black is completely winning because after takes you take like this then you take the rook and then you are just dominating and if after uh DC3 your opponent continues with their plan like like Dan did C takes B2 is a really bad wakeup call because now you're in check and black is going to take a rook and make a queen so black is going to get 14 points of material in one move and that kind of sucks um and uh if white goes here and then this you know white will probably take here and probably get the bishop but at the end of the day black has an extra Queen so like Black's going to you know bring the queen back and just win the game uh or you know bring the queen in and just go for mate with but yeah C takes B2 is game over and um Dan's completely lost and then in this position Dan plays a move which might be historic um Dan plays a move which might be one of the most lopsided moves in the history of Chess so like I just said black is going to win a rook and get a new Queen so black is going to get n eight more points because the pawn will disappear right Black's going to get eight more points meaning queen minus one is going to be eight plus a rook so 13 points are going to go to Black Dan decides he actually wants 19 points to go to Black and he takes the bishop so with this one move Daniel loses a queen for a bishop which is 93 six loses a rook with a check so that's eight right that's that's 14 points and now this and um that that was impressive uh that was a uh that was a massive turnaround what just happened there so in the original version of this position like let's say B takes uh black was up 16 points in this version of the game after Queen takes B4 takes black has now up 22 points of material and Dan proceeds to make his problems even greater by not taking the free Bishop which I suppose he didn't see but rather going over here and he is now down minus 49.6 on the eval bar he is down minus 21 and if I let the engine think for a little longer there's going to be an m in the evaluation and you know usually around this time uh the opponent starts doing really stupid stuff right you know like Dan by the way to Dan's credit uh Dan I don't know was trying to use his Bishops you know he should probably use his Bishops by hitting himself over the head with them with some of the moves he's played but it's life and you know Dan could have hit the resign button Dan could have closed out of the app he could have you know yelled about the fact that chess is not fair and he's probably you know like knowing knowing the the prodigies that are from Turkey right now this probably a three-year-old like this is probably not a grown you know 40-year-old dude who runs like a cafe in Istanbul this is probably like a three-year-old child named kazm and Dan is losing to him and there's no shame in that cuz km is going to be a Grandmaster in 5 years um but k does not make any mistakes you know he plays Queen to D2 check he finds Queen to D2 um King F3 and then he and then he uses the second Queen and that's really like that's really the problem um if he's going to start using his Queen it's over and um King G3 is on the board now a couple of moments ago I wonder if there was a Checkmate in two there wasn't so here we have a fun challenge which is can you find all the checkmates in one um this is Main in one this is Main in one so both Queens going to F4 is mainten one and queen G5 is m in one I don't think there's another one because you cannot take on G2 even if you could there would be king H4 the problem is you have to take away the H4 Square you can only do that from these two squares so both of these moves Queen F4 by both and queen G5 or M in one km plays Queen C3 can you blame him it's a fork right Knight F3 wait a minute but Knight F3 loses the so now after this move black is up 26 points of material and mind you there is only 39 points of material on a chessboard if you add it up that's really bad but Knight to F3 proved to be a very clever move from Dan because after King G3 Queen C3 Knight to F3 kasm took the bishop and his Advantage went from Maiden eight m one Queen C5 he lost his Queen generally losing your Queen is bad in chess um not in this case the most insane thing about this position is black could lose the queen completely like just for free and still be minus six because you're still up a rook so you could lose two queens back to back and still have a completely decisive advantage that's how good the position is Rook F1 but at this point he goes you know what my Rook is hanging so I'm going to bring my Rook to the center of the board great and now let's start feasting on the pawns then let's bring our piece is over here then let's make a couple of Trades let's maybe trade Bishops uh a better way to play would have been Rook B8 the bishop is trapped just completely trapped nowhere to go but okay Rook E8 and now nice idea here from from Dan uh Knight to H4 I know Checkmate is on the board but I think this game was lost for Dan before it even started so the bishop is hanging um and Dan immediately gives a check which I appreciate uh not Dan km gives a check Rook to F3 and now km gets in here with his Queen yeah that's really really bad and um you know Dan has sort of proven in this game that he lives on the edge and um yeah he's big into uh big into Adventure big into excitement probably puts it on his dating profile uh and um yeah he in instead of playing Rook F2 he plays the more daring move which is King F4 which which loses in a in a million different ways it's actually quite fascinating if the queen just follows its trajectory you will just Checkmate here by accident like you will look around and play Pawn G6 and it's made like you just win by mistake you didn't even mean to win now instead of that uh instead of taking the Knight km plays Bishop takes Pawn I I mean again I don't really hate that move considering the Knight is still hanging Queen E5 is probably still m in a couple moves and Knight D3 and Knight D5 are all sorts of different checkmates and Dan now plays Knight F5 which Kum very promptly because he was just on that square just trades the Knight which is completely reasonable King takes F5 and so now you know what you do here is you just give checks you just give a lot of checks or maybe you play Queen E2 and you Fork stuff or maybe you attack the bishop but what you do here is you give checks you either give checks or you make moves like Queen to H4 which cut off all the king's space right you just look right I don't I don't like km's move here this a little bit of a disconnected move to move C5 um again you are up 16 points of material and you have an extra Queen and an extra Rook so I kind of don't really care what you do but I'm sort of educating you know like you shouldn't push a random Pawn if you you can't really explain that move maybe he just wants another queen okay God bless him H4 you know white does the same thing now um that's a free Pawn just in case you're wondering but you know kasm is like I want another queen I really liked having two queens no he didn't he lost it immediately but you know whatever we won what we can't have so C4 Rook H3 I'm I'm not going to lie to you I I I don't really understand what's going on over here but to be honest I can't really blame Dan cuz he doesn't have any pieces left so uh again the fastest check M here is to bring the queen all the way back Force the king to G4 and then either F5 or H5 is Checkmate in a couple H5 is the fastest King to F3 and now you remove all Escape squares and you give a check bait on the E3 Square you just need to not put your queen on a light square and you will be fine so Rook to H3 now again I would give a check I would take some pawns I would but remember this plan hey remember C5 and C4 yeah in this position km just continues by playing [Music] C1 okay fine I I guess I mean he didn't even think for a second on that move so I don't really know what the idea is but Bishop F3 okay now he will continue pushing his Pawn exactly there we go that's perfect Bishop goes to E4 now if you want to not get taken here I would recommend sacrificing The Rook you can also give a check the check removes this from this like when the king is out open like this you should attack the king you shouldn't promote your Pawn Kum plays C2 and he forces Daniel to give up the bishop and now Queen C2 check and I mean it's over right King to F4 now I would either take this Pawn but probably go for this Pawn because it's so close to the white king okay instead of taking on A2 Kum goes I really liked pushing pawns right so me like push previous Pawn so me going to push this Pawn too so me play A5 again not a big fan of this because you should just go after the king and you will win the game within the next five moves by accident but the good thing for him is um yeah Dan doesn't really have a whole lot like Rook to E3 here trades The Rook if you really want to make sure you never lose this game you might still stalemate because you suck but if you play you know you play Rook 2 E3 if you remove every piece from your opponent side of the board that's not a pawn you're going to be completely fine A4 F I mean I can't really criticize much black has played a fine game Queen fantastic now the Pawn's just gone cleared out of the way you know Dan's doing his best um but uh only one guy really has anything scary here um Rook H4 that attacks the Knight and my man km you would think blunders no he doesn't even blunder just doesn't even just perfect game right white plays G4 black plays A2 game is over Rook H3 uh and now now it's made in a lot of ways again if you want to simplify here just trade the queen for The Rook I it's it's literally not possible here to lose the game with black it's not but you don't you don't have to sacrifice you could just give checks you know you got a ladder mate coming um now clearly km just hates Queens uh because he just loses another one so Rook ag3 played white literally has four pieces remaining out of 16 on the board they're all right there and and Kum just could not be bothered to scan his pieces for safety you know this is now his fourth Queen he has had four Queens this is the fourth one and he loses the other Queen now again he can win it back immediately the The Rook rather uh he he does it this way fine Rook F3 and I think here km was frustrated because he can't push any more pawns really but again all you do is just you go with the Knight you go with the queen you go with the Rook Etc excellent Rook E4 finally back on track a lot of stupid stuff but all right G5 let's just go for ladder Checkmate EXC I love it we're bringing the Rooks now I know what you're thinking you're smart you've seen enough of these videos some drama some nonsense is going to happen and and I I think you can kind of see where we're going the king's takeaway Square uh rather getaway square has been covered and black is inevitably going to blunder something like uh I I you know um what what do people BL Rook D1 Rook C3 Queen A1 Rook C A8 right yes this is exactly how the game ended actually Rook d8 takes Rook E8 and in this position white one no no that didn't happen at all no black CL Rook D2 check Rook D2 King to H3 Knight A2 got the queen involved you know could have just got the queen involved but this is a threat this is coming now The Rook literally cannot go anywhere by the way there is no back rank threat so Rook G3 is played and you know black I don't I don't love this move by black but here Kum plays Rook G4 I mean I I I get it you know the idea uh is Rook G4 Queen G4 and takes and then white just doesn't have any more pieces left white has one Pawn left and black is going to make a fifth Queen because Kum just really into that stuff so Rook takes G4 and black plays King to f8 losing the queen so let let me let me just okay so km lost one Queen then a while later after promoting you know he got uh I guess technically he didn't get that other Queen taken but he proceeds to lose this queen too and then he loses another one the this Rook captured 27 points of Queens I don't know if you realize that that is the same Rook that came alive on the 19th move to take on F1 proceeded to move around in the game while black promoted took the second Queen for free just took a rook that Rook took 32 points of heavy pieces that Rook defeated three queens and another Rook and even still black is completely winning and up on the on the clock you think black has 5 Seconds right so now black starts pushing his other Pawn cuz that's really km's Mo Rook F4 and in this position the move Rook to D5 defends the pawn but instead of that Kum goes here and Kum proceeds to lose the final remaining heavy piece to the white Rook white has now captured 37 points of material with that Rook heavy pieces I haven't even counted Pawns then Dan takes the Knight and then Dan takes the pawn and Kum wakes up and wins the pawn back so now Dan has to demonstrate whether or not he knows how to win with a king and a rook and these are 400s that's a really difficult task these guys don't know how to checkmate with a king and a rook look Dan doesn't even know how to do it he's just mindlessly shuffling pieces around until casm just walks into Checkmate to the same Rook five moves ago the black king was out in the open in the center of the board Dan had absolutely no plan which is ironic cuz it rhymes with his name and then black just just walked his King he just escorted his King to the worst possible position and lost that white Rook captured nearly 40 points of material and it did it did capture 40 points of material and it won him the game now you see why this ruined my vacation get out of here
