Jake Paul is getting sued in a class-action lawsuit for promoting safe mode but there's a problem we don't know how much he got paid so today I'm going to answer that question and expose all the crypto scams Jake Paul has done because the list is long I've already counted five of them and we're gonna do a counter right here for how much money he's taken from fans because I may not think it's funny but I will certainly make it entertaining for you guys and look obviously this information will probably be helpful to the class action lawsuit against Jake Paul and so many people are probably wondering if I'm making this video to make sure Jake Paul loses this lawsuit and I want to be clear absolutely not that was never the intention it's just a happy accident let's get into this investigation five four three two one so in order to catch Jake Paul I first have to explain the challenge with catching crypto influencers on the one hand everything on the blockchain is trackable and publicly available which is a good thing on the other hand it's super easy to set up Anonymous crypto identities whenever you want to do something dodgy this is bad for us and it creates this strange dilemma where dumb influencers can be easily tracked while smart influencers can't be because they will just set up hundreds of different Anonymous wallets and eventually it becomes impossible to track what belongs to who and Jake Paul is sort of somewhere in between these two extremes he's not as dumb as you guys probably think he is but he's also not as smart as he thinks he is so even though Jake Paul is going to try to hide his various crypto accounts today we're gonna hunt them down and connect them starting with this one the public Jake Paul wallet the one he publicly links to himself via openc and says was his now before we go any further I just gotta say if you want more High effort high quality investigations into your moms don't forget to pump the stock Ice by liking and subscribing it's absolutely free and you can always change your mind but going back to Jake Paul's wallet there's actually some good info here as far as scams that we've already covered for example Jake Paul got paid 39.9 ethereum for the sacred Devils promotional scam which you can see right here it's worth a hundred thirty nine thousand dollars which puts them on the board which later linked up with a huge ring of nft scammers we busted actually Jake Paul got his fans into buying these sacred devils and they suffered near total losses he also funded another nft scam from this wallet this time his own project called stick dicks you can see him here funding the deployer wallet of stick dicks with one ethereum and he promoted it himself saying this what up you dicks the community I'm sorry violation the [ __ ] Community has grown like crazy over the past 24 hours we're almost at 10 thousand spermatosa on the Discord community and we are just getting started the result being very satisfied customers he also got Lana Rhodes to help promote it via Instagram which of course she had no problem doing because screwing her fans is part of the brand at this point investors and stick dicks also suffered near total losses meanwhile Jake Paul raked in 1.5 million dollars with stick dicks even while doing nothing he promised via the road map now I'm sorry to say that some of Jake Paul's fans were so excited about stick dicks before it rugged they decided to tattoo this scam on their body this was only months before the project was completely abandoned by Jake Paul this guy says y'all like my tattoo no no nobody likes it now before we go on here may I say that there seems to be something of a phallic Obsession the Paul Brothers have Jake Paul started stick dicks Logan Paul started dink doink I mean I'm not saying it means anything but apparently if you give these guys unlimited resources and full creative control both of them go straight to drawing dicks maybe it's just a self-portrait type of thing but look so far all this information is publicly available but now we're gonna move to wallets that no one quite has pegged yet and we're gonna do this by lining up some influencer posts the idea here being that you can find a crypto wallet if the behavior lines up enough with publicly available information for example we know that Jake Paul tweeted about safe moon on March 27th of 2021 and so if we check who got free safe moon at the time of writing we can get a short list for who might be Jake Paul for example consider this wallet which got paid 50 trillion safe Moon by the deployer wallet a day before Jake Paul tweets on the 27th of March now of course I've got to say just because a wallet gets paid around the time Jake Paul tweets doesn't mean it's him of course so what do we do well we have to dig for more clues so just following this wallet a little bit it later cashes out that safe moon for a hundred ninety thousand dollars and sends it to a different wallet that wallet is publicly tagged on openc as the problem child which is one of Jake's favorite names for himself so this is kind of promising right you've got this wallet receiving two hundred thousand dollars in safe Moon and then it sending that money over to something called the problem child on open seat but what if that's just a coincidence well the good news for us is as I said Jake isn't that smart so of course he used this same wallet for more than one pump and dump take for instance MILF token which he also promoted on May 17th without any disclosure that this was an ad he said I'm thinking about becoming a MILF at MILF token a few days before a bunch of tokens got deposited into a wallet which was later cashed out at that same problem child wallet this was sold for fifty thousand dollars which isn't a ton of money but further corroborates the evidence we have but again maybe you're thinking hey look this just all sounds like a lot of coincidence to me so let me give you one last piece of evidence we have on May 13th Jake Paul tweeted this everyone talking about yummy now once again we find transactions from an external wallet on May 13th getting tons of yummy token for free and then on May 15th he makes another tweet about it a year ago I talked about Doge three months ago I talked about safe moon now I'm talking about yummy and right on cue he gets paid once again and where does all that money go well the same place where he's publicly known as the problem child and here is where he cashed out these yummy tokens for three hundred thousand dollars and here's where I feel confident saying this is Jake Paul's wallet and his little scheme has become pretty transparent here's how it works every time Jake Paul is going to do a promotion he sets up a brand new wallet just for that promotion he then gets gifted a bunch of tokens and then that same day or the next day he posts his little promotion and this would have been a pretty good scheme except every time Jake went to cash out he did it all at the same wallet at the problem child wallet and that was his mistake because by building enough circumstantial evidence against himself eventually it became very strong not only that the wallet that initially funds his Problem Child open C wallet is publicly named on wearable and the username is exactly what you'd expect at Jake Paul the problem child of course now I want to thank Blaine Bootsie on Twitter for providing some of this research but look what's the result of all this well none of these promotions Jake Paul did were listed as ads which is a big problem for him and a big problem with the Federal Trade Commission not only that three of these coins could easily be considered Investments which could be a problem for the SEC but ultimately I don't know what will happen to Jake will he be held accountable for what he did for causing losses of his fans who knows but what I do know is that Jake Paul advertised multiple project to fans without disclosing he was paid to promote them his fans lost money while Jake was making somewhere in the range of two plus million dollars and if you want further evidence that his fans probably lost money on these projects here's what happened to Yummy after he promoted it here's what happened to MILF and here's what happened to safe mode and of course as two nft projects are both abandoned at this point so at the end of the day Jake Paul's fans got screwed while he got rich but I guess anything to get that back right we'll see how that excuse holds up in court
