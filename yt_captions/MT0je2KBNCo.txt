money art the future i want to understand it all and what better way than the nexus of all those things nft nyc 2022 that's right ladies and gentlemen home of the most single men in one place since joker hit the big screens this event packs more undeserved wealth in it than the panama papers you just kind of have random dudes walking around with jpegs worth of house and speaking of houses i haven't heard so much of the word utility without any utilities since the texas freeze hit my house last year and yes those are some cheesy jokes and maybe some of you think i should leave it to the professionals but just remember sometimes that professional is amy schumer i don't know what nft stands for i'm assuming it's looking out not [ __ ] tonight is that is that correct do i have that right i mean yikes imagine paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a board ape just to get caught a virgin at your biggest event of the year and believe it or not this is actually as good as it gets ape fest was without a doubt the biggest part of nft nyc and that's really what all of it was about basically the parties whoever had the biggest nft projects got the biggest stars and the only way you could get into these parties was holding the nft token so finally holding on to your nft actually has value and depending on what project you were at this paid off in different ways if you were at a mid-level party like doodles you'd have people like pharrell but if you were at the big boys ape fest you got a-list celebrities we're talking eminem and snoop dogg performances and then of course going down the list you also had more low tier more budget nft operations with more budget celebrities people like this dupe snob that's right ladies and gentlemen this lady thinks she's getting a picture with none other than jyn and juice and actually she's getting a picture with juice and gin i mean that's got to sting after you post that to instagram this is the tactics of some of the lesser nft projects who couldn't afford some of the bigger stars and so they hired people like this uh snoop dogg impersonator to drum up excitement for their projects and you know what it got me thinking is that what nfts are all about are they just the status symbol are nfts just a litmus test for how rich you really are and if so who's going to care about them besides rich people it made me think that the number one challenge for nfts at events like this is really just convincing the rest of us the poor's why should we take these digital jpegs seriously when most of them are designed to price us out and i have to say so far the sales pitch on these things isn't going well as this reporter showed get your nfg's here get your nfts go cheap park price price anyone get your enerties now don't be shy when the man with the bargains has passed you by nfts anyone anyone nobody cares nobody seems to like nfts we didn't find anybody who actually had anything positive to say about them that doesn't mean they're not here but just goes to show what a crazy minority people who like these things are now it's true that nft enthusiasts may blame the lack of widespread acceptance on many things for example some of them may just say they're early and nobody gets it yet maybe it's just all the really cringy moments nftnyc produced that i haven't even mentioned yet things like this i'm getting drunk on truth it's truth and freedom [Music] [Laughter] and look maybe you're thinking that's not so bad maybe it's all these haters of nfts that are the real problems but all in all i don't think it's any of those things i think the biggest problem facing nfts is actually not the cringe not the haters it's that right now the purpose of a lot of these projects is very vague i mean beyond the whole like set it as your identity and wait for the dollar sign to go up it's not really clear why you would buy one of these things maybe for now you could argue that it's these all-access parties that make it worth it but i don't know if that's really going to cut it because there are cheaper ways to see snoop dogg than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and i think that's why you saw a lot of these nft projects this year promising to do a bunch of things outside of nfts like doodles for example announced it would be in the music gaming animation consumer product space all at the same time for some reason meanwhile a competitor cool cats is planning to launch a video game so is board api club by the way but all of this just kind of feels like these projects admitting that their nfts aren't really going to cut it justifying those big price tags and if they're not if the nfts aren't the important thing then what is it's very hard to understand and nft 2022 didn't exactly help but then again there's always next year how much have you invested in nft so far to be honest over six figures
