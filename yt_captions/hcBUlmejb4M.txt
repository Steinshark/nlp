ladies and gentlemen bullying is bad and perhaps the single most bullied individual on planet Earth is the Martin bot on.com Martin bot is rated 250 and he's potentially the worst chess player who has ever existed or not some time ago I made this video where I gave Martin 30 queens and still manage to defeat him and it's my most popular video to date but now in April 2024 Martin has come back and it's one of those incredible feel-good stories where somebody was bullied at one point in their lives and now they are thriving there is a NextGen Martin bot on.com and it's oo is uh oh and today I battled him and I did everything in my power to win but there's something special about this video since next gen Martin is futuristic I played Martin in a futuristic chess experience and I'm talking about this inside of here is chess up 2 this is a futuristic chessboard where you can play online games offline you can play Bots you can play humans you can play friends or enemies that are 10,000 mil away and you can learn things chess up 2 will fully integrate with chess.com and all of your games will be saved in your profile and ready for review it also has a touchcreen and built-in Wi-Fi so you don't need to download another app and as you'll see in the game I play it as peace recognition technology the board knows what piece is standing on what square whose move it is what legal moves there are and when it's check and Checkmate this thing is on Kickstarter for a limited time and only for the next 3 weeks you can save $100 if you pre-order it now I have one of the first prototype chess up twos that exists anywhere in the world but the final version will come out later this year likely in November now let's make the craziest transition to me defeating NextGen Martin bet you didn't see that coming Gotham chess in a suit ready to play on the chess up 2 this is a pretty special video I'm going to be playing chess in a futuristic way and I'm playing against a futuristic opponent the chess up two snaps on at the click of a button and the board comes calibrated so when you first set up the pieces see there's a lot of lights going on put the extra Queens off to the side and then watch what happens when you do this and this and this and this the board recognizes each piece literally recognizes what piece is on what square that is the technology look at this it's filling up and you ready for this boom it's ready to play you could set the board up wrong and it won't let you make those moves in games you could obviously play offline against the AI you can play on chess up itself but this is the first time ever that one of the chess up boards specifically chess up 2 connects seamlessly with chess.com and I am going to be playing this month's special bot NextGen Martin I think what I'll do is I'll start the game with E4 the Kings Pawn I played this against them last time wow he plays the Caro against me that is uh that is very interesting I'm going going to play I guess D4 and because Martin is a newly transformed Powerhouse of a bot I don't really want to get into a crazy positional uh crazy tactical game like normally what I would do is I would play the move Pawn to F3 here and as you can see there the board is choosing the moves highlighted one more thing you know about these kind of techy boards is uh and just in general any sort of tech I always try to break it so if I start making moves for my oppon oent then it's not really going to work right if I put the Knight there it's going to start flashing right as you can see if I make moves for black um if I make an illegal move for myself like Bishop there it also starts flashing that it's illegal okay there are a lot of possibilities but I think the most principled way to play is the advance caroan with the move Pawn to E5 now we see there um next gen Martin is playing the advanced caran with Bishop to F5 there's a lot of very sharp and complicated lines against this like the tall variation which is Pawn to H4 it's me highlighting the pawn right now but instead I'm going to play Knight F3 which is called the short variation and I am going to play a more slow kind of positional grinding game so let's play Bishop to E2 and now black can break with the move Pawn to C5 or maneuver with his Knights and we do in fact see Martin moving the Knight to the E7 Square this is very cool by the way like I do have to make the moves myself uh but that's about the only other manual labor that I have I'm going to play castles it's a normal move and now he says it's tough for me to play in real life because I'm allergic to Wood and also I've been alive forever okay fantastic the knights are out black now has multiple Pawn breaks there's a lot of different lines here uh for white one of the most principled is this actually weird move Pawn to A4 um which tries to restrict Black's Queens side space plays Knight to G6 trying to get out his dark SC bishop and move his F Pawn it's it's going to be a slow maneuvering type of game and uh I actually like to play this move A5 as well I like to take away all the Queens side space from Black's Knight and yeah clearly Martin just totally unconcerned uh now going forward again here would probably be inaccurate cuz although I do Target this Pawn which I'm now highlighting by playing on to A6 this very cool wow I could just do this for like 10 minutes that could be the whole video um he won't take right he's not he's not going to be um he's not going to accept that uh pawn and the weakening of his own Pawn structure so maybe we play Rook E1 Rook E1 is anticipating that at some point black will play the move Pawn to F6 for now he's not doing that and he said castling is called the Martin special which uh does not make any sense because that is not what castling is called now the question is do I move my Bishop do I move my knight or do I move my my Pawn um or do I play the move like Bishop to D3 in fact I kind of like the move Bishop to D3 I think if I play Bishop to D3 He will probably I don't know what he's what he's going to do against this move actually I I I kind of like this move because normally uh yeah you don't really want to trade this bishop for black for my Bishop I think uh so now I'm going to take back and uh yeah I think my queen is quite active and I have a nice position yeah of course he's going to play Pawn to C5 so if I take the pawn this Knight will come here still might not be that bad uh but there's probably no reason to allow it now I could consider excuse me pushing this Pawn to A6 although I'm not really sure I want to do that um I have multiple possibilities um maybe that very well is the right idea I also can maybe play this pawn two squares to C4 to open up the center quite a lot but I I don't feel like opening the center too quickly because I'm not fully ready for a fight now I can defend my center with the move Pawn to C3 he would take I would take and then I think I have pretty good control of his position um so maybe maybe I do that maybe I play Pawn to C3 touch my king there by accident I hope that didn't like disrupt the board he play he says it's fun playing chess you should play a few thousand more games and then you might be able to draw against me okay so C4 Martin uh locks the center but I I do think this gives me pretty good attacking chances like now I'm going to focus on this side of the board right he kind of close things down over here so now the question is how am I going to like I want to slide over one square also kind of want to slide back diagonally I mean it's it's very very tough uh to make a decision here on what is best I I unironically have no idea uh what is the best move it could be going all the way back it could be yeah like I I think I'm going to go all the way back I think I'm going to come here CU I want to go out over here on this diagonal okay yeah and of course he does in fact play B5 an important move so Martin is going to try to play B4 right he's going to try to play B4 now if if I play B4 myself he's going to take me on pant and then he's going to try to like make something happen on that side of the board because if the board locks I'm I'm dominating over here now one thing that comes to mind here is to play this move Pawn to G3 or Pawn to H4 just play H4 Gambit a pawn and just start an attack before Martin is able to consolidate on the queen side um but it's a pawn at the end of the day and it's a it's a huge decision uh I can also put my my Bishop on D2 and prevent him from playing B4 but I think that's kind of a shortlived solution uh I'm not sure very tough very very tough decision here G3 H4 looks very appetizing though I must say so I'm going to go for it I'm going to play G3 and try to March my H Pawn up to attack his King now Martin immediately as I weakened myself strikes back with this move F6 but I thought this was a bad move because I thought I would be able to control him a bit like first of all I can take and maybe take the pawn on E6 I can take this pawn and then I can take with my Rook uh then he's going to try to create some sort of counterplay and maybe trap my Rook which I don't particularly like I can ignore him and just play H4 um and maybe even H5 after that uh but even that seems a little bit dangerous for me take take yeah very tough to say what exactly Martin is trying to do so let me take this Pawn what's he going to take back with what's his big decision there oops I have this backwards he takes with the Rook interesting why but don't I have Bishop G5 like I can't I play Bishop G5 and then no I guess he saw better than me maybe that's why my queen needed to be on the E2 square but he does have a weakness and that is something I can work with I think I also can move my knight to A3 and then reroute it but I I think I need to act now so another move that I have is Knight to G5 which attacks the pawn or Bishop G5 they both they both look okay I don't know which one is better um Bishop G5 he'll move his Rook play something like H4 yeah very very tough to say don't know let's go with let's go with the but Knight G5 he has E5 maybe no don't does he a can he really get away with playing like this I guess he's a bot right so he could get away with doing whatever he wants let us indeed begin with the move Bishop to G5 targeting his Bishop targeting his Rook rather uh and he moves it forward and counterattacks my Bishop but Pawn on E6 is so weak I feel like I have something here I just can't exactly nail what it is now I don't want to make the trade because then he just takes with his Queen but I was thinking about this move H4 it might be the last move I make in my life but um yeah he plays H6 which is a move that I was expecting and he's making me make a decision now with my I can trade but that sort of plays directly into what he's been trying to accomplish but at least then I can develop my other Knight and also come back and then the question is who actually benefits from a trade of Bishops in this position tough to say also can I can I take the pawn now on G6 on on E6 probably not but it kind of looks like I can but maybe I can't but maybe I can Rook all the way down to take the pawn is a attacking his Knight but then I suppose he can counter me somehow this is a very very complicated situation I think I'm going to go for it I think I'm going to play Rook takes pawn and we're just going to says it's okay to lose a pawn or two keep playing also Martin just said he asked me if I have any hobbies and he said that he has a hobby of collecting towels they made this Martin bot as weird as they possibly could all right Pawn takes H4 I calculated this and I I think I'm doing okay here I think right here I I took his Pawn I'm going to get my knight into the game and I don't think my position is bad like the only question is am I getting my freaking Rook trapped but I don't think so I actually don't think so h I could take on H4 but I don't want to open up my king if I play Knight takes H4 I feel like but maybe Knight H4 and then Queen G4 is possible I no I don't I don't I don't believe it is maybe for now I'm I'm okay with this Pawn existing here uh and I think I need to get my other Knight into the game I don't think we have another Choice the only other option is Queen back to E2 to try to go down there to E6 uh and that that does activate the queen for sure that is definitely a queen activation move but is it the priority in the position right now the answer is I have no idea because it's chess um let's play that I'm so scared cuz I know who I'm facing let us go Queen to E2 now the queen is on the open file right he does play Knight f8 so this is already progress we're kind of making Martin go backwards here which I which I do like a lot um I had a crazy idea here to sacrifice my Rook obviously it's only thing I know how to do but I don't think I need to I think I can just back The Rook up to the G4 Square take a deep breath not rush anything and just kind of move from there uh alternatively I can sacrifice my Rook but I don't think it's necessary so don't have to do that back to G4 and I am attacking his Pawn so now I am threatening to take the pawn which is why Martin takes me very nice um I thought about not taking it again I just thought about getting all my pieces into the game as fast as possible so my my rook and my knight and everybody can get a turn but I also don't see anything particularly wrong with just taking the pawn back although he is going to get a few developing moves like he's going to be able to bring a few more pieces uh I can take with the pawn as well I'm not crazy about taking with the pawn because I feel like I'm weakening my king but who knows maybe it's not so bad maybe it is I take with if I take with the Rook he has Bishop to D6 and then he's going to bring his Queen to F6 and that looks very very very dangerous for me so maybe the alternative is Bishop D6 Knight to E5 but that also doesn't seem particularly appealing so let's take with the pawn I'm not crazy about this move I feel like I'm Queen E8 is a either a really good move or a really terrible move I actually don't know what typee of move it is if I'm being completely honest it does not look that smart it really doesn't uh I okay and now it's probably time to get my second Knight out I I I don't see anything else I can put my other I can put my knight in the center of the board like Knight to E5 but I there's no backup so let's play Knight to D2 and now my Rook is coming and maybe we have a decent position okay Queen H5 but I thought now I have some possibilities wait a minute his Bishop is hanging he he G okay so the bishop is hanging and my Rook is hanging which which is a big deal I was originally going to play Knight to E5 in this position and I thought Knight to E5 was a reasonable move looking at it now I still think Knight to E5 is a pretty reasonable move I have not been able to refute that Knight E5 he'll play something like Bishop to D6 and then maybe I play like King up to G2 I just defend myself and then I can play like Rook H4 as well after that okay I think that might be the plan I think we're going Knight to E5 is it touch move okay I mean I I I think there's nothing wrong with Knight E5 but I did just get scared of his Queen infiltrating Bishop to F6 mhm I don't have this discovered attack I can't take on G7 and take his Queen doesn't work but I might have Rook F1 setting up something like that Rook F1 and then I take with the Knight maybe that doesn't look that bad I also have Queen G2 maybe in some lines could be not bad I feel like I'm very close like I'm I'm very close to accomplishing something in this position um I also have King G2 again but the threat right now is to take my knight we're going to try to trade his Rook I've decided I thought for a little bit and he decides to take my knight makes sense um now if I take he takes with the rook and he has some more threats after that which is a little bit annoying um did I just blunder Rook F5 Rook F5 does he have Bishop takes D4 an in between move a Martin guy is is too strong now oh ah I don't like this I really don't like this I miss that if I take take his Rook on F5 he has Bishop takes D4 sacrificing the bishop and if I take the bishop he's going to take with the rook and uh yeah I'm definitely I'm definitely under pressure and I'm not having a good time okay let's play Rook takes F5 now he's going to play Bishop takes D4 oh completely missed this move this vuk oh now it's telling me I'm in check look at that and you can see it's got a red square I can take with the pawn I can't take with the Rook because then I would lose my queen or I could move my king and then I could take with the Rook after that but they're all bad I could also bring my Rook back but then I have to take with my king oh none of it works out in the end that is uh that is that is quite brutal maybe we bring the Rook back and then no if I take with a king after then it's uh he has check and he Martin's too strong Martin is too strong oh now I'm a pawn down I have some active pieces here but nothing particularly nothing particularly appealing I I mean maybe I can fight back somehow but like I can't activate any of my pieces I can't even threaten Checkmate on E7 because he will just yeah I don't know he kind of he kind of cooked my spirit here he going to play Queen C2 I'm going to be really mad if he can play Queen C2 okay luckily he can't just totally bully me but now he's trying to put his Rook on the E8 Square straight down there which kind of yeah I don't know what to do I mean I can play Knight to F3 and put the Knight on E5 but then he's going to play Knight E6 on the next move so maybe the only thing I can do is just to play like Rook G4 and um he also keeps saying we're best friends which is like it's the absolute worst it's like you're losing to somebody who has four brain cells who just keeps referring to you as their best friend and you're just not like you don't even you don't even know who they are really it's really tragic stuff like Martin has brain damage and no brain damage all the same yeah Queen F3 he's going to bring his Rook he said you don't want to trade can we still be friends oh my God I can't get my knight in the game I can't even play Rook G5 I wanted to play Rook to G5 I can't even do it now oh boy and he's going to put his Knight on F6 oh this is horrible this is horrendous I I can't play Rook F4 because then he's going to move this guy to G5 wow what can I even do I just got completely dominated in this game like I really thought I had a chance for a second okay I don't have any moves he's going to play Rook f8 next Rook E8 what if he went here see then it starts flashing that it's illegal that's not the move that he made yeah rookie eight now he's not letting me bring my knight wow what a master class from Mr Martin truly just an excellent game that he played if I move my queen up then he plays Rook f8 I don't have any moves he's taking my soul Rook H4 I does he blunder I can't even offer him a draw they have me stuck in this simulation playing on chess up two and I can't even offer Martin a draw I can't even all right let's go back because that was I couldn't make that move before oh God oh my goodness yeah this is uh this is the end I'm going to go out with a bang uh I'm going to get checkmated probably oh no surgical methodical technique from Mr Martin I can I can take on F6 it doesn't do anything I can sacrifice my rook and try to give him some checks but all right all right let's go for it we're going out with a bang we're sacrificing a rook Martin is going to take us and then we're going to take here and now we put him in check so his King is in danger now he plays to G7 this what a magical board by the way I just got to tell you he pretty cool uh now I have absolutely nothing just literally nothing at all uh yeah I and it's a AI so it's not going to make a mistake the last chance I have is if I play Knight to G3 and he doesn't take my Pawn I think not touch move though Queen D7 doesn't work I guess Queen D7 does work because it allows me to preserve my queen but then I'm just going to lose on the next move okay let's get our Knight out he but he's going to take yeah and that's the end fun and now it is over it is over this is absolutely hopeless but I'm not going to resign I'm going to give him a check again to show you how cool it is that the king lights up and uh then I'm going to play this move King F2 oh he can take my Pawn with check of course he will oh Lord oh my yeah all right uh well maybe here and I'm safe he could take that pawn with check now um all right I think we are going to go out losing all of our pawns getting brutally hunted across the board Martin gives us a check we play King to G4 and I think it's just a matter of time until Checkmate arrives gives us this check [Music] uh King F3 I don't see mate yet oh there it is Rook to H2 now the good thing is because I'm playing Martin on the chess up two I can just turn the game off and pretend like I won I don't even have to click the resign button now Martin's next move is simply Rook to F2 checkmate he's way too powerful but the good thing is I can just do this and now I win that's how this works right anyway I hope you enjoyed this video the chess up two board is super super cool and like I said in the introduction it's going to come out later in 2024 it's a very cool way to play against bots play against people play against friends play against uh people that you know that are thousands of miles away and preferably not play against nextg Martin bot because he is a scumbag and and he is way too good at chess but I think we'll count this as a victory that's all I have for you today make sure to check out chess up two and get out of here no seriously get out of here
