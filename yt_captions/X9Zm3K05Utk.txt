last year I did a newsletter looking back on my 2021 year that was fun so I thought that I should take some time to look back on 2022 and discuss some things that I have been thinking about first things first I want to personally thank you for supporting the channel at the end of 2021 I had about 150 000 subscribers which I still think is a lot how many YouTube channels out there have 150 000 subscribers but since then the numbers have grown even nuttier over 240 000 people subscribed to the channel in 2022 and now I'm on the cusp of four hundred thousand this is insane this is madness I'm just a deer in 2022 people spend over 3.5 million hours watching asianometry videos it boggles the mind to think that I am able to reach so many people around the world and it always tickles me to see the channel pop up in the most unexpected spots for instance recently some friends of mine went hiking in Indonesia and they made some friends from Sweden and those Swedish Pals knew about the channel what a coincidence stuff like this makes me happy 2022 saw the most popular video that I have ever done why the Soviet computer failed this one got over 2 million views and most people watched deep into the video even many months after its release to be honest with you I have no idea why it is so popular maybe it was the recent Russian invasion it did take an unusual amount of time but mostly because I was working on other things ahead of it I was proud of the work but really it was just another video I am working on another Soviet technology video like right now procrastinating on it really by working on this video hope you will like it how the rich ate South Korea number two was originally titled South Korea's business corruption problem I'd been working on it for a while after posting it I was disappointed in its initial performance and changed it to the current title based on a suggestion made by a friend of the channel on the Discord it took off after that I think Wendover did great work on a similar subject props to them why Russia can't replace tsmc I remember working on a video about the Soviet Union semiconductor efforts and going to bed but I could not sleep at about 3 am I got up and went to my office and finished the video in the early morning with the Russian invasion fresh in my mind I was constantly thinking about China Taiwan and tsmc I worked so to put these thoughts aside the sad fall of a Philippine steel giant I don't often read YouTube comments but the idea for this video came from one Mr commenter wherever you are thanks for suggesting it and to you guys it's proof that I do listen to your suggestions and the debt field collapse of Korea's day would grow I have long wanted to do a video about Daewoo but I ended up finding so much history I remember while writing this it just kept getting longer and longer and I kept muttering to myself this is too long nobody's going to watch this crap amazing to think that it did so well each video is special to me I can remember where I was when I researched and wrote them but that's a list of 2022 videos that people seem to enjoy note the lack of semiconductor content throughout 2022 I noticed a shift in interest in my viewers away from semiconductors to new topics the semiconductor stuff does get a consistent level of views but not so many breakouts as before I think it is a reflection of what has been on people's minds recently last year I wondered what would happen when the chip shortage ends the chip shortage is now largely over and I think people have moved on I think what people are really interested in now is energy whether that be natural gas shortages in Europe or what cutoffs from Russia will do to the world economy or the ever distant dream of nuclear fusion for the channel oil is the new semiconductors semiconductors still jump back into the news occasionally but I note that the topic has been politicized which means everyone has an opinion about it now I find it harder to make points without being called biased or even a foreign agent we're just talking past each other now a lot of people ask me in person or via email how I do what I do I thought I should explain a bit here there's nothing special about how I work I try to research and write every day in between my real job about four hours in the morning at a local Starbucks with edits done in downtime while I am on my commute videos are produced and edited at night before I go to bed just before midnight I work with a few researchers who help me collect information especially in languages I don't know but like I said I script almost everything myself I remember reading an interview with Tony Gilroy the Creator and showrunner of the Fantastic Disney Plus show Endor in it he talks about season two it's just a supreme drag to hear people who are in the movie business and being well paid and doing what everybody wants to do but it's a lot of work man it just never ends every day it just doesn't stop I can't imagine what I'll do other than curl up in a fetal position when this is over I want to live through it we want to maintain the standard we want to stay as obsessed this is exactly how I feel about this channel except this channel is a TV show that runs indefinitely I am constantly thinking about the channel new videos ideas wording new sources finding image and video content it never stops and I find it hard even trying to convey the amount of work it all is I post two videos a week as soon as I upload one video I used to allow myself to take a break for the rest of the day but nowadays I'm either uploading at midnight and the next day is already here or I must immediately move on to the next one last year I mentioned burnout I managed to hold on for 2022. cross my fingers that I managed to stay motivated through 2023 as well I'm really happy to be able to meet people in my earlier videos I told people that if they were in Taipei that they can email me and meet me through the channel I've been able to meet some really great people whether it is the New Zealand Taiwanese who researchers Antarctica or the young Taiwanese American deliberately going against the grain to study electrical engineering your experiences have been enriching and I appreciate it I still tentatively invite you to reach out via email for a coffee chat if you are in town though with work being how it is I can't always make it happen due to busy schedules oh and I had the chance to give my first in-person talk at a Taipei Hacker News Meetup late in 2022. it was fantastic and I love speaking with so many of you at scale I don't have any more meetups planned in the future but you never know another year for the channel so what is next like as with the year before I want the channel to continue exploring new topics New Concepts and strange new histories of various things in Asia and the World At Large just a hint of some of the videos coming in 2023 an early history of AMD an overview of image sensors and a profile of the asml of Gene sequencing and yes I still intend to work on that bubble tea video thank you for allowing me to entertain you it is one of the great privileges of my life and I hope you can stay with me for this coming year alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to
