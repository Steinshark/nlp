[Music] this video is sponsored by best buy hey what's up bhd here so this is kind of funny all the years that i was in college i never actually made my own like best college tech or back to school tech video i graduated from college seven years ago and it makes me feel old saying that out loud but back then i was just watching everybody else's back-to-school tech videos and then trying to get my own stuff together but fun fact uh the school i went to the college i went to actually as part of tuition gave every undergrad student the same hp laptop which was kind of a nice perk it was a thick workstation everyone had the exact same one so as steven students we didn't really do back-to-school computers but we did do back to school everything else all the spicing up the workspace and the the dorm room and everything around that computer either way i might be out of school now but i finally get the chance to make my own back to school video so i want to do it now in 2022 when the options are better than ever so i got 10 things for you and this video is sponsored by best buy which just means that all the stuff i'm going to talk about is also available at bestbuy.com all the links are going to be down below in the description and you can also go to a best buy and actually try this stuff out in person too which is pretty dope so first of all a computer so i'm going to give you three options i'm going to have a windows option a mac and a budget option so now something i didn't tell you earlier at the school that i went to the uh all the engineering and business major students all had the same hp laptop but then all of the music tech and visual arts majors all got the same macbook pro so it was just different software depending on what you have to do i don't even know if this is still true or happening there but the point is if you're not going there and getting a laptop for free as part of your tuition uh you might want to get a new computer to match your new work so in the windows world i'm going dell xps now college is already expensive so it's a big extra expense to add a high-end computer on top but the way i think about it this is a computer i'm hoping to use for at least the next four to six years straight so it's an investment in the future for sure so the xps 13 is one of my favorite laptops it's world class easy to recommend here but i'm gonna go with the 15. this xps 15 if you can splurge is getting you an even bigger potentially 4k oled display higher end rtx gpu great keyboard great bigger speakers and this thing you can expect to handle some pretty demanding workloads not just games in between classes but potentially also getting some pretty serious coding rendering whatever you cut your teeth on at school getting all that done so this is a good one now in the mac world the m2 macbook air feels like the solid no brainer i consider the m1 macbook air because i did keep it around and it is cheaper but again i think new chip plus getting the new screen new design the ports magsafe and all that is well worth it plus getting the new model has you future-proofed and getting pretty excellent performance across the board the mac versus windows choice in college is mostly basically comes down to software not just games but a lot of times literally just whatever you're majoring in there's going to be certain softwares that just work with certain types of computers so that's important but i think yeah no matter which one you get you're getting a good one but i do have a third option uh it's more of a budget option and i'm also pretty jealous if you are studying something that can make this work but consider a chromebook so the galaxy chromebook 2 is my favorite chromebook right now of course it's just chrome os so you're doing everything in web apps note taking emailing collaborating etc but if that's you then this is a lightweight well-built chromebook that should have your back now no matter which machine you choose i have one mouse recommendation and that is the logitech mx master 3s so this thing is quietly released a few weeks ago which is fitting because really the biggest update over the mx master 3 is it's quieter it also has a higher max dpi honestly this is the most versatile complete easy to recommend mouse for me and it has been for years i've used an mx master for a long time at this point i even think you can game wirelessly with this thing so yeah easy easy ad there if you're looking for a mouse now if you happen to be taking the right classes and you're in the right note-taking situation that a stylus and a tablet actually works for you first of all i'm jealous but then second of all uh the ipad air and second gen apple pencil are excellent now there are a bunch of combos that will work for this too samsung's galaxy tabs and their styluses are really good and there are lots of great note apps on android as well but i'm going with the ipad air here and the second gen apple pencil that snaps right onto the side as the safe bet every time i review the ipad i always give the pencil a shot just for kicks obviously artists get a lot more use out of it but i also found that taking math related notes specifically when there's all kinds of formulas and structure to them trying to keep up on a computer with a keyboard just doesn't cut it for me so i always have to write this stuff down but having a virtual notebook that is pretty sick the newest air has the m1 chip there could be an m2 version soon by the time you see this i don't really know but i also don't think it matters too much because ios 16 is still ios 16. all right new smartphone for back to school yeah sure why not galaxy s22 or really anyone in that series but i think specifically the base galaxy s22 now that we're sort of in the middle of its cycle is starting to see those discounts i reviewed it back in january and it still holds up as one of the best all-around phones that's the thing about the phones that come out in january we tend to forget about them later in the year but s22 still has some of the best cameras the best displays excellent battery and really good software plus the dex features are super dope if that happens to work for your setup maybe you have a monitor already and you just plug that straight in that could be cool too so can't really go wrong with that as a new phone also my daily driver lately has been an s21 ultra which is a sort of interesting fact i don't know if maybe that's worth a separate video maybe leave a thumbs up if you want to see a breakdown of that but yeah s22 now i've got some desk accessories here that i also really like that i've found you know you're going off to college for the first time you've got your dorm desk set up you want to get some stuff going to customize it that's what this is about that's also desk accessories that's a tongue twister try saying desk access desk accessories desk accessories but this is the college dorm where i made videos for a whole year and shared with a roommate i think i did okay nice setup but these are easily best if you have a device like an s22 for example that wireless charges so this audi light desk lamp has a wireless charger at its base it's a fast wireless charger and it also happens to be a really nice little led lamp three brightness settings no flicker you could go that route or just go straight up multi-device wireless charger for the dorm bedside this one from belkin is a go-to pro tip if you have an apple watch and it's the series 7 or later make sure you look for a wireless charger that specifically supports the watch's new 15 faster wireless charging speed it does make a pretty big difference and then last but not least headphones so if you're going off to college and this is from experience if this is the first time you're going to be studying or doing homework in a noisy environment noise canceling headphones can be a complete game changer so that's why i'm putting sony's wh-1000xm4 on this list i consider putting the mark fives on here but i think as a deal the mark fours sound just about as good but they fold so they fit easier in a backpack they have almost all the same features and they're less expensive so the mark 4s are still awesome i highly recommend them maybe the only downside being that they're not waterproof but this is this is your new study hack but the only reason i bring up water resistance for my student athletes out there is you can't really work out and sweat a lot in these and trust that they're going to last a long time so you probably already have a go-to set of workout headphones but you know going off to school might as well upgrade so the beats studio buds have been great for me the shape the fit the features the sound pretty much everything about them they are also ipx4 water resistant of course and there's just been so many waves of me going back and forth between recommending and not recommending beats products over the years but these are definitely on the really good side the shape is so important they stay in my ears for everything short of like sprinting or jumping and landing hard on the ground but it's rare for my ears for something to fit this well so yeah go get you an upgraded pair of workout earbuds you won't regret it and that is it there you have it my first back to school set of recommendations ever let me know how i did but i couldn't wait to make this video so i was pretty pumped about it but that's ten things to send you back to school and hey shout out to everyone who graduated this summer best of luck over the next few years and may they be filled with tech and thanks again to best buy for sponsoring this video everything i talked about you can find at a best buy and of course all the links will be down below this video to check out as well all right catch you guys in the next one peace you
