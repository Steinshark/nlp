ladies and gentlemen welcome back to T Steel chess 2024 it's the first major event of the year and it's off to a crazy start today we had yet another defeat by a major player in the event it was a very decisive day of games standings are shuffling up and down there are upsets abound we're going to get into it right now that's the introduction and if you're just getting caught up with the tournament the past week has been Recaps from it here we go we start with the Challenger section it's Daniel d a uh player from Belgium actually the highest rated chess player in the world uh who considers Belgium uh his home base and it's Hans Neeman Hans nean has lost two games in a row he lost to elen rubers and then he lost to Mar Andrea maritti from France that was a crazy game d plays E4 H sits down he's looking for a fight he wants to get back on track he's not a guy that's going to lose two games in a row and go easily into that uh good night some people when they lose two games they want to stabilize they just want to play E4 E5 that's it's actually what the Soviets used to do they believed in just getting a draw stabilizing and Then REO you know uh re replanning from there I don't know what the right word is anyway uh yeah Daniel D just plays a C3 Sicilian which is just about the most dead thing that he could possibly do black plays D5 brings this queen out now actually notice Hans spends 4 minutes on the second move I imagine again not because he was uh uh finding his way back from the toilet but he was thinking of the most provocative way to play he plays it like this we have D4 Knights come out Bishop comes out and this is an endgame line dc5 where black is going to remove White's right to Castle and basically try to win this Pawn back over time while white is just going to defend it and say you know what you can't you can't have the pawn as you you can tell from from D's time management uh clearly uh very well within his element this move E5 not the most popular move E6 is more popular long castles with a check is more popular uh Knight D5 is another possibility to take the bishop damaging wide structure but Hans plays it like this with Knight to D5 he's trying to be as provocative as possible he's saying you know what you can have the pawn I mean I'm going to annoy you I'm not necessarily going to try to win it back King C2 and listen Daniel is like two moves away from completely stabilizing and having a very very very promising position Hans plays A5 and he spent a good amount of time on that move nearly 30 minutes were spent on A5 basically right now the position is at a critical moment despite it only being 10 moves because the SS played in such a provocative way like the C3 Sicilian has a has a reputation of being very solid but at the end of the day it's it's up to the players to determine how they're going to play it it's a very critical position cuz white has uh an extra pawn and he's going to develop very quickly and actually put some serious pressure on black if black is not careful B5 played by darta and Hans plays Bishop F5 check before committing one of his pieces if you block there is Knight to B4 check so the idea being that you win the Knight back win the the piece back with with this Fork among other things like Knight takes E3 followed by the move E4 which is a fork or just E4 right away way so Hans has to go uh Daniel plays King to B2 and now Hans grabs the bishop his Knight is still hanging and he plays Bishop C5 whoa the idea of Hans was to completely sacrifice his Knight wow BC BC and black has a pawn for the piece a pawn he's looking at a second pawn and the king is a bit weak now in this position Bishop C4 is the best move for White and the idea is that you actually walk your king into a check and then you play here and apparently white is much better apparently black just has nothing black can play F6 you play Rook e one if black keeps the bishop on this diagonal you actually have Knight takes E5 which would lead to a fork so that is the best way to play after all of that but instead of that uh D plays Knight takes E5 he just grabs himself a pawn and he does it this way it was better for him to play Bishop C4 first but he does it this way Hans gives a check and wins a pawn back and now as you can see has some very meaningful pressure that's why white should have spent the move and kept this back here Knight C4 Bishop H6 this is an insane game that is hanging on a knife sge but the computer still prefers white Bishop E2 Castle Rook D1 and now Hans plays a A4 G4 Bishop G6 and King B2 this was like the like the major moment in the game around here um where I think the biggest Advantage existed long-term stockfish gave this like a plus one and a half so darta could have gotten a massive advantage and Hans would have been under severe pressure he could have been under serious risk of losing yet another game in a row but what ends up happening instead is the material balance is uh is White having an extra Knight for Black's two pawns and then after A3 Rook D5 you're going to see there's a lot of complications being created here Hans despite being a full piece down is basically threatening mate white has to sacrifice a rook which he does and we emerge with the following position you may be wondering why the Knight wasn't taken it's cuz this was hanging he decides to keep the bishop and when it's all said and done material is two knights for a rook and a pawn and this and Hans was potentially Al at risk of losing a game here three in a row it would have been but the players decide you know what we've had enough we agree to withdraw that is your appetizer of the day Hans nean very very I wouldn't say very very close but if D had played Bishop C4 on the 15th move he could have there could have been some really promising stuff here and again the the O sorry the point is that this idea of Rook d8 just it's not it's not working if white just stays patient and apparently as you can see from the evaluation one and a half and and only growing so D misses a chance can you imagine if Hans would have been 0 and three but the rest of the games that I'm going to show you today oh my goodness oh my goodness this game was a bon Cloud we're about to see a giga Bon cloud in this game E4 C5 vidit versus Ali Vera fuia we have a nidorf sicilian that's big because vidit is a D4 guy I mean if you look at vid's database I I believe he he plays D4 like all the time he plays into a nidorf sicilian he plays H3 which is called the Adams attack not like The Adams Family and now there's many lines here for black alyza plays Knight C6 and the players get this type of position where clearly white is going to be under some Massive Attack right Rook C8 and there are some naughty intentions over here whereas white will try to attack over here White's going to be under attack on that side of the board plays King B1 getting off the the C line Queen C7 and now vidit thinks a little while and plays A3 all right spends about 10 minutes he could have played G4 he could have played Bishop E2 he could have played Bishop G5 there's a lot of moves here plays A3 now black cannot take on C2 because even though it looks promising there's nothing he's going to have to back up he's going to have to play Knight to C6 and then vidit will probably play G4 G5 try to play Knight D5 and then here vidit got hit with Knight takes C2 and that's crazy because I have absolutely no idea what on Earth the follow-up is I mean everything is protected well oliv Resa plays Queen C6 and the incredible thing is this has actually been played before everything we are looking at has been played before the idea of Queen C6 is twofold pressure on this diagonal on these two diagonals and also D5 you see is in a precarious situation his Knight is hanging but the king is defending but he can't move his King back and since he can't move his King back D5 is on the way cuz King is right here so vid plays Knight D2 he spent 17 minutes and now the only moves ever played in history in this position have been D5 about 10 games grandmas games and after Pawn takes Knight takes Bishop C4 black opens up the king and then you trade the queens and then it's BC Bishop C4 Knight C4 Rook C4 and in this position uh White has a little bit of long-term pressure despite being a pawn down Ali Reza plays Queen A4 check and vidit puts his King in the center instead nobody has ever played Queen A4 Che and that is for good reason because even though Ali Russa spent 31+ 11 42 minutes on Queen A4 check it was a bad move that's what happens sometimes in chess you overthink it King D3 and he sacrifices The Rook ripping open the position now I'm going to turn this off because stockfish will spoil our fun we're not going to see this you are going to have to sit in vidit shoes and bravely have your king in the center of the board as the other side tries to rip it open D5 if you take you actually might lose because your queen has to guard your Rook what do you do do what do you do you got to go Queen F5 this is insane if takes actually Queen C8 is mate for white this is insanity all right but King E2 is the move that it chose D5 was a violent move he now runs his King back de and he still can't take because black is defending twice Queen G3 alyza goes here and just continues firing RS the king castled went to B1 C2 D3 E2 E1 back to its home Square now castling is not a possibility and the attack is still roaring forward vid's got a really buckle down here and he's got to be careful but the good thing for vid is he is up 32 minutes on the clock oliv resua showed up and decided he was going to do some crazy stuff today H4 vid trying to fight back he's now got to remove pieces he's like the less pieces oliv Resa has the better it is for me okay I'm upper Rook yeah do the math I am upper Rook Bishop G5 F4 from Ali RZA and now a key move from vidit he gets rid of the pawns he sacrifices his bishop and now black cannot attack as easily he can't attack as easily because he's got no pawns so now it's vid's turn to fight back Ali Resa with a minute on the clock Rook f8 you may be wondering why he didn't defend his Pawn he could have he could have but was a little bit too slow I guess he didn't like he didn't like H5 so he decides I'm going to do this and I'm just going to defend this end game I'm going to defend uh exchange down end game Rook versus Bishop with a passed a pawn but this is vid's bread and butter he's a very good positional player Rook D4 defending himself getting rid of this but his time is ticking and now vidit vid's below 10 minutes 6 minutes on the clock we're in a deep end game I mean we we got three pawns each this is the closest that Ali res has been the whole game and look at this beat D5 what's V going to do he's got four minutes on the clock he's got 2 minutes on the clock the nerves must be so high Rook B7 1 minute on the clock we just went from a position where vid had 30 ver 2 30 ver 2 to 2 versus 1 and A2 this is nuts could he possibly be screwing this up rook C8 Rook B7 B4 vidit makes a move with 8 seconds to go Bishop takes B4 because he gets 30 seconds bonus he makes this move with nine seconds to go A5 V plays Rook G7 Knight E5 and now the final move of the time control the 40th move he brings his King forward which he made with six seconds on the clock and there's the bonus time and this end game is winning it's winning because a rook versus a rook versus a bishop endgame purely is not winning but with more backup it is winning since you can get a pawn in Balance you can win a pawn you can trade the right pieces and ultimately you can promote one of your Pawns Knight G4 check King to D4 Al the res just resigns he just resigns cuz it's impossible for him to guard his G Pawn he's going to lose it um what's funny is that here the evaluation remember I I removed the bar it's about plus one 1.7 it's not hopeless it's not hopeless uh but here Knight E5 King E3 apparently alira had to play bishop f8 and then he had to play Bishop C5 check and then go somewhere else with the B I mean the defense was super weird according to stockfish and I'm not even sure it was fully convinced so because he's losing his Pawn he just resigns he can play King F5 but then there's Rook F7 check and then King E6 you can even take and uh and take you also have mate you have Knight G5 so yeah Knight F6 G4 would have just led to being a game over so he resigns Aliva fuja loses again second time in three rounds he just lost to J and June he had a nice bounce back Bo but he goes down against vidit vidit now just a few rating points away from from being the highest rated Indian in the world's very close him and Prague speaking of another Indian on fire Divia deshmuk in the Challenger section versus Liam vck we have a a very imbalanced opening a reverse Sicilian and English Knight F3 and Divia starts advancing on the queen side with A3 B4 Bishop B2 Rook C1 Knight A4 every move follows the Knight is going right there there it is vck tries to attack but there's not a whole lot going on there now look at the Queen A1 oh my a sniper from the corner C file is up for grabs A4 B5 on the way as well Liam strikes in the center take take Rook C1 plays F6 Diva plays Queen E2 we go we go to an end game Rooks and Knights versus Rooks Knight and Bishop Rook D1 and now Rook E2 Rook C7 Liam really wanted to win because I got to tell you like this was really unnecessary white is going to play against this majority she's going to play against this three on two but Liam deliberately goes for Knight versus bishop and not just Knight versus Bishop he gives up the pawn like this so now diva is going to attack this and that and that for the end game and Liam is going to try to you know grab some Pawns of his own but Bishop C5 is a really accurate move by her she's a pawn down but she's going to get to the seventh rank first and what do we know about the the end games putting your Rook on the seventh or second rank violent stuff Rook B7 now he says let's trade she says all right no problem Ken Divia who is the 150 Point Underdog in this game not to mention the title Liam vck is a grand master can she put on a masterful performance here to get the job done in this end game he's trying to defend we're very very close to a draw very close to a draw C6 Rook B6 Rook C4 some chances whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa here a apparently this was all correct but you have to play King F7 if C7 there is Rook C5 but Rook A6 King E6 and the king gets close to the pawn Rook A7 there is G5 and the thing is this is close but it's never promoting and white is too passive now White's Rook is just stuck that was apparently what he had to do he had to allow white to be awn up but the way Liam did it is he now plays Super passively look at this amazing move Rook B four sacking a rook to try to sneak the pawn through Rook C8 Rook B6 and now it's a very different story because devious King is active and she advances utilizes that pawn as a deflecting mechanism she's breaking in and it's over she wins a masterful end game advancing her Pawn up the board and there is absolutely nothing Bret can do F7 f8 is a queen X-ray on the seventh rank he resigns what a win for her that came out of nowhere this was the position I mean it was it was relatively straightforward she was pressuring the whole game when when the position was clearing out she had Bishop versus knight so she always had some long-term Advantage a massive win for her a second very big win in the event she can be very pleased with her performance I got I got some more games for you Anish giri is leading the tournament can he build on his lead versus nck Abdu satov we have a pet defense and then after this I have gukesh versus max vadam can gukesh also get there with a first place tie or will Max win a third game in the event and play spoil spoiler as the hometown hero he's only 2625 I mean only right but compared to the other players now interesting line here chosen by ner backck massive sideline D4 Knight C3 are the main lines he plays C4 Anish plays Bishop E7 and now Knight C3 the idea is to damage your pawns but to have a little bit more space so we have take take and then the side Castle this way on opposite sides so we're going to have a battle pressure right over here and Anish is going to do whatever he's going to do puts a Pawn on H6 look at look at look at look at that I mean that looks so good but black is fine black is fine Anish thinks for a bid plays C5 very committal decision 20 minutes spent on that move offering noer the opportunity to capture this Knight and basically Anisha is saying you know what I have weaknesses but I'll deal with them Bishop F6 Bishop H7 a mechanism to deflect the king either toward the danger or to weaken the F7 pawn and now we go here and we do that to utilize those weaknesses that anise just made playing the move C5 you put all these pawns on dark squares you want to trade your dark squared Bishop not your light squared Bishop you put all those pawns on dark squares you have light squared weaknesses at an elementary level and I Anish knew what he was getting himself into but now black has to suffer black will suffer and again a bishop surrounded by the same color pawns what's the bishop doing the pawns are doing the job the bishop is doing right so Knight D2 King B1 and now how how will NRE do anything here can he do anything here look at Anish Anish is doing exactly what he needs to do fighting back against the light Square control if CB then ab and actually Anish has attacking Chances with his Bishop now his Bishop was coming alive right so clearly there is some stuff there Rook E8 but he's also leaving this Pawn to die right the queen can take the pawn on D6 Queen E6 Knight E4 Bishop E7 and now look at this move Queen D5 very nice idea not rushing just looking to create some long-term problems cbab now he throws that in cuz there's no attack F4 F5 it's been a light squar type of game for nerre the entire time take take and Anish is basically Bally saying no you're not experienced enough you're not strong enough you can't beat me all right Anish has been as high as number two in the world and he's a perennial top 10 player no just outside that I think no actually nowadays might be well well he he's like top 15 but you know again it's very much kind of like a new school old school let let me buckle down and play defense look at this nice move B4 fixing the structure and and creating long-term problems for an Nish who's trying to bring in his King but so is Norbeck King D Rook D7 just advancing I told you light squared strategy for a long time seizing those light squares King d8 now look at this be it's a beautiful idea how do you break through here how do you break through if you take this we're going to have to trade Rooks that's too quick you give me too much activity noer finds C4 the black position is too tied together too stuck in the mud and now if a niche takes this you could try to sneak through but it's actually better to now take the idea of C4 is to deflect the B Pawn from the defense of the a file and after take take take take take King C3 and King C4 white has an outside pass pawn and this is an endgame master class because black will now have to defend that pawn and in that time this space Advantage will prove lethal the oxygen tank will run low and while black is defending you will sneak in get that pawn and get those pawns and this game lasted a couple of hours after this as Anish tried to defend himself but he couldn't because exactly as I am describing his oxygen is sucked completely out of the tank King D5 there is absolutely nothing to be done C4 King D5 right back you win this and now you can take on A7 and Win It methodically but it's even more brutal if you play G5 this structure breaks through take F6 look at that that is so beautiful G5 would have been a gangster way to end the game black can play F6 but then you will take take you will take take you will take and black is too slow because you make it to the pawn in the game we got Knight A7 Anish tried to sneak his Pawn back very important check otherwise it would have been a draw King C7 and now G5 anyway Pawn take F6 same idea Pawn takes Pawn takes King E5 King D5 Knight C1 Anish giri resigns because he's actually just going to lose the pawn end game and no Abdus sador has just handed Anish giri his first defeat of T Steel and I got one more game for you this game gesh versus max vadam another English just like in the diva game and Max plays something called called the Von it's called the I think it's called the Von Scara or like Von Henning Scara anyway the point is with the Knights on the board this is a very common position CD CD players agree to a draw after some moves Queen D4 there's e d if Knight D5 there's Queen A5 check and black gets a lot of development and is completely fine but this is just straight up the loss of a pawn CD CD check take take this is a Gambit white has six pawns black has five that's it black is just straight up down a pawn it's actually not as stupid as it looks it's actually not as stupid as it looks and watch how not stupid it is Knight F6 Bishop B4 Bishop D2 castles Knight F3 and now not developing but he just straight up gives away the bishop he gives away the bishop and plays here black is down a full Pawn no questions asked not only is he down a full Pawn like it's a center Pawn this opening doesn't make any sense how is this acceptable well it is and apparently as you can tell from Max's Play It's All prep Queen E7 E3 he hasn't stopped to think Max started the game with a 100 with a minute and 40 uh oh my God oh my God an hour and 40 minutes 100 minutes we have gone to the 14th and 15th move of the game he's still not thinking GES is down he's down 55 minutes home M clock Max could leave walk around the entire Netherlands Village and come back Rook C8 and now he plays Queen D2 rook d8 and he could have made a draw he could have repeated moves but he said Rook D1 he is down an entire hour an entire hour on the clock and Max is still not thinking we plays Queen D6 Max plays Queen E8 19 moves he's not thinking he's not late for anything nobody promised him a date after the event I don't know if he's in a relationship or not nobody nobody promised him anything after the event like this man GES is down 70 minutes I have never seen something like this and Max is still not thinking Queen A3 Rook D1 Bishop D1 Bishop C4 I'm telling you the only reason this makes any sense is because in the time that white is trying to Castle and claim the extra Pawn Advantage black is just bothering you black has so many open lines that it's very difficult to play this position with white that's why his Queen is getting booted around right Queen D6 Bishop E2 Bishop C4 B3 all right B3 he still hasn't spent a sec Bishop B2 who catches down 80 minutes this is the biggest time deficit I've ever seen Max plays Queen E4 now he's threatening Queen here Queen C1 20 minutes on the clock for gcash Queen B4 check finally finally he spent time finally 24 minutes 24 moves of prep gash is down to 20 minutes can you imagine how insulting this is to your intelligence while your opponent is blitzing everything out Queen B4 Queen D2 takes takes Queen B5 and basically black says you know what let's play an end game I'll take this Pawn I'll go back this is what we have to play oh my God oh my God gkes has 16 here's the blitz he's playing Blitz now so the opening pays off Rook C8 Knight A6 Knight C5 it's a dead draw I mean you talk about incredible preparation by vadam what just happened B4 and now oh so if the Knight moves like let's say there Rook D7 is a really big problem so max counterattacks the Knight okay the Knight sacrifices because you're going to win this Knight back take take here check here Rook B7 and now Rook C1 aha okay black is a pawn down but just like in the diva game there is a correct way to draw Pawn down right there's a correct way as we saw like there's some weird techniques to to get the king in and but and the same here so max decides all right I'm just going to push my pawns as far as I possibly can and I'm and and I'm going to make a draw kukes plays F3 by the way he has more time cuz he made it to the 40th move and Max is doing an excellent job just like breaking apart gesha structure everything's good this excellent move A5 and he's just going to win these pawns the reason why he's not rushing with Rook G2 is actually Rook A6 Rook here and then F4 is winning for white so two versus one but two connected passers is a win and Max's well on his way to claiming the draw Rook A5 this is a totally drawn position because the white king cannot cross the f file so nobody can win this Pawn black can draw this game by playing King F6 and King G6 so Rook A6 King G5 even though the pawn can come forward Rook E1 and then I will get to that pawn and will make a draw so King F6 put the King on G6 cut the king off on the f file if King E2 Rook F4 if King E3 Rook F1 and it's probably just a draw and then here for reasons that are completely inexplicable Max vadam plays Rook G1 allowing King F2 and King G3 I don't I don't know what I don't know what ghost He Saw but I I guess this is what happens when after 25 moves you haven't thought at all psychologically it's a major win for black to get this position from the opening like you are up 80 minutes on the clock you haven't had to think and then on the 50th move for a reason I will not ever understand for for the life of me he plays Rook G1 and I guess he thought he was making progress but now he is just straight up losing the end game the computer doesn't even realize it it white is up two pawns and if black trades Rooks he loses but he can actually lose the pawn because of this this is a very drawable endgame if your king and Rook are in front of the pawn and if they're not like they should be on the short side so if the pawn is here the black king should defend on the short side if the pawn is here you should defend on the shorter of the two sides you should be on that side you should be close to the pawn there's a lot of technique but he's caught off horizontally so the black king cannot even he can't go back this is a draw just so you understand the King on E6 is a draw because you're close this is just winning for white and it's winning for white for a very simple reason he's going to push his pawn and he's not going to allow the king to get close close G3 Rook F1 King G4 and now he can just play Rook A5 if Rook G8 he plays here and then he plays here and o no no no no no no no no no no see it's even tricky here the pawn has to be on G4 so I already messed that up what he needs is the pawn to be on G4 first so let's just say uh Rook G8 Rook F2 uh here here King G3 Etc the king is here and something like this this is winning because you advance behind the pawn and let's say there is like this right so what you do is you get the Rook to H6 you get the Rook to H6 because it enables the king to walk up and push the pawn and it prevents the black king from getting back the defense is hopeless if the white Rook can get to H6 if the black king gets to F6 G6 it's a draw so King G4 Rook H5 he's trying to get that exact same setup King H4 the king gets close but it doesn't matter because I'm constantly threatening this King F4 Rook H6 and Max vadam just resigns because he can't actually stop the pawn from getting any closer Rook G7 is nice Rook F6 King E5 rook f8 and the king is on the long side so he you just lose Rook H7 King G3 is a draw because the king gets back but King G5 is winning because if the king gets back the king is leading the way and the pawn is just going to promote little bit complicated as you saw there even I rushed and the pawn had to be on the uh G4 square instead of the G3 Square so it's possible to screw up this endgame but it's crazy that he got this far and he was so close and he just had to put his King there the King was cutting off the access and then he just in instead of that he he just and I GES wins GES wins wins and not only GES is winning the tournament nck catches an by beating him and gukesh wins and three guys are tied for first Ali Resa loses again but yet he's still half a point out of first place and uh on the other side on the other side it's it's as follows Salem with five carabal four and a half four and a half Mar Andrea maritti very close to winning today again uh I believe he drew his game he almost won a third game in a row which was completely insane uh yeah that's all I have for you today get out of here
