everyone has bad habits whether that means biting your nails or stress eating a dozen donuts at midnight morning filmmaking has its own unique brand of bad habits and over the last decade of working in media I've noticed that a few of them tend to be particularly common and I see them being made at all levels of the industry from beginner to season Pros luckily by identifying them they're all breakable and if you manage to break them all you'll be in the top percentile of filmmakers when it comes to productivity output and finances so in this video I'm going to go through the top five bad habits I've noticed are especially common for filmmakers including myself then I'm going to go into some strategies and resources for how to break them all one by one and I'm a giant book nerd so at the end I'm going to mention one book that's helped me more than any other when it comes to fighting my way through bad habits so if you're into reading as much as I am stick around for that [Music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years of working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer before we get into it let me just start by saying that I'm by no means a perfect filmmaker and the only reason I can even make a list of bad habits like this is because I've been guilty of all of them myself I still struggle with literally all of these problems on a near daily basis but the big difference between now and when I first started noticing them is that I'm aware of what's happening so I can look the bad habit right in the eye and move on once you can identify them you'll be able to tell when you're falling into a negative cycle and then just do the work instead so please don't think that I'm some sort of Zen filmmaking Guru who gets up and shoots gold every day we're all on the same hard to navigate path together here okay so let's start with the logical beginning which is starting of all the bad habits the one that hurts us most in the beginning is being so bogged down by fear and apprehension that we don't ever start not starting a project is born out of fear of failure and we protect ourselves from that fear by not doing anything if we don't start then we can't fail so we stay safe and end up doing nothing it's the same reason we're scared to do anything whether that's quitting smoking or starting to go to the gym or whatever it's a totally natural human tendency that's much safer in the short term but will make us feel so much worse in the long run for filmmakers that means having lots of ideas or outlines but then never taking the next step if we look at Hollywood it's full of people with ideas for movies but not many working screenwriters the difference is that the ones who succeed get started the same is true in anything creative including documentaries the way through is to understand that no one really cares about you which might sound strange but should actually be really comforting we all think we're being judged for every little thing that we do but the reality is that people are too busy thinking about their own lives to notice that your first film didn't get in Sundance or that your latest YouTube video didn't perform very well you'll also forget all your early work very fast and the mistakes that you make only sting for a short time and you learn from trying so whenever you find yourself staring guiltily at the film ideas section of your Apple notes or wherever realize that the only way forward is with action the next bad habit is really common and is probably the fault of the advertising industry as much as your fault you're making you fool of yourself and that's the urge to buy your way to success if we only had a newer computer or a better camera or a brighter light it would all make sense we think the illusion is hard to get around because ads are everywhere but that's all it is an illusion buying gear is easy if the answer was just to get more gear there'd be a lot more filmmakers in the world and a lot fewer used gimbals on Facebook Marketplace I do a lot of one-on-one consultation calls Linked In the description and recently I was on a call with a new filmmaker who was so hung up on a cinematic result that he hadn't spend any time developing his story which matters way more than visuals you do need some gear to get started but after that it can be more of a distraction than anything now I love gear and I know it's easy for me to say all this when I have mountains of this stuff but trust me it's not going to do the work for you or make the work any easier if you really do need something because you're out shooting and you notice that you can't do what you want then by all means get it if you want a specific shot rent something and if you think you'll use it a lot buy it gear is good and useful but it doesn't do the job for you only a story and actually taking action can do that moving on you might notice that I talk a lot about networking on this channel but what I really mean by that is community lots of filmmakers operate in isolation because let's face it reaching out to new people is rough but this isn't the right approach in my experience you need people to know who you are what you do and to know enough about you to feel safe bringing you on a job and by people I mean other filmmakers producers directors production managers anyone the more people you know and the more people you have in your community the further you'll go in your filmmaking career here this doesn't have to be like sleazy schmoozing where you fall on people like a seagull at a film festival or cocktail party or something though that can be effective if you're the type of person to just go for it all you really have to do is to get to know people and if you approach them like a sane normal person it doesn't have to be weird in terms of who to look for there's no right answer here your community can and should be varied people at your level at the level above you or even way below you anyone who's out there in the world trying to work hard at what they do is worth knowing that's why I take meetings with a ton of different people from Network Executives to students still finding their way but you do need to reach out and form connections because they probably won't just fall in your lap now people love saying I hate networking or I'm not good at selling myself but this is really just a fear of rejection the same as we talked about in the first point most of us don't actually hate meeting new people what we really hate is the idea of being embarrassed or ignored so if you keep in mind that your networking anxiety is all just fear-based I found it's a little easier to tell that little voice in your head to shut up and just send the email I mean I don't love cold calling people either but I'm moving across the country right now and I'm currently sending dozens of emails a week to people I barely know it's not what I choose to do with my free time but there's no way around it you have to put yourself out there so make a list of 10 new people at any level that you can email and then do it and then do it again for the next habit I want to touch on one of the most awkward moments for filmmakers and that's pricing yourself show me the money looking for most of us the natural tendency is to aim low because we're terrified that the client might reject us if we charge too much this is really just imposter syndrome you think like who am I to be asking for this kind of money so you Flinch at the last second and cut your rates by 20 but this is actually the wrong approach to take because you make paying clients think less of you by under charging they'll think you're not good enough and they'll start to wonder why you're cheaper than everyone else they've talked to now I am not saying to charge a thousand dollars a day when you have no experience because that's not going to work either but you probably need to raise your rates sooner than you think I personally hate raising rates or asking old clients that I've worked with in the past for more money to do the same job can be really painful but it's all part of the process and if they value your work they'll understand and if they legitimately can't afford it they'll tell you and then you can decide for yourself whether you want to work for them or not in the long run they'll respect you more as a professional than they will if they see you as the low budget option finally I'm going to talk about perfectionism which is the last bad habit I'm going to talk about today and the natural Counterpoint to the first habit of never starting perfectionism strikes us when we're on version 65 of our final edit and rather than release our project into the world we indefinitely tweak it and keep it hidden where it's safe it's fun to shoot it's safe to tweak Luts in post but it's scary to share something with the world and say this is the best I can do right now I've personally abandoned many projects on hard drives because I was too scared to show them I didn't admit this of course I just told myself that they weren't good enough but it really comes back to the same fear we've been talking about this whole time those projects were what they were and they may not have been my best work of all time but they still should have been shown you might think your perfectionism is protecting you from criticism but what it's really doing is hiding your development and activity the truth is that clients and networks want to hire active filmmakers not people with full hard drives and tons of ideas an unreleased project is almost worth the same as no project apart from the experience of actually filming it which is admittedly good but these ghost projects won't help you advance and attract more attention of the people who matter just like we talked about how Hollywood is full of script ideas it's also full of nearly finished scripts but no one is rushing to hire the writer with 50 second drafts on their computer they want someone who's actually finished something it's easy to tell people about your big project but it's much harder to actually show it and I'm sorry to say there's no way around it you absolutely have to show stuff if you want to progress the solution is to set deadlines and then stick to them when you start thinking about postponing that deadline ask yourself if it's really going to make a meaningful difference or if you're just scared and it's fine to be scared we all are but the successful filmmakers push through that get the thing out there learn from what didn't go as well as you wanted then move on to the next one before I wrap up as promised I want to talk about the book that helped me most with these problems which like I said are pretty much all rooted in fear and that's this the art of documentary by Stephen pressfield I know I've mentioned it before on this channel but this book is Tiny and really easy to read and it has chapters that are super short the magic of this book is that it gives all our excuses a name by calling it resistance according to pressfield resistance is anything that is stopping you from getting what you want and everything I just mentioned in this video is resistance in one form or another scared to start resistance nervous about asking for more money that's resistance too have a nearly completed film that you can never be happy with resistance this book was a game changer for me because by having a word that describes all these feelings it allowed me to notice it and then move through it almost like a mindfulness practice whenever I run into a setback or fear I just tell myself that I'm hitting resistance and then tell it to shut up and move on I've read this book a few times Now cover to cover and a lot more times than tiny little chunks I'll pick it up whenever I notice resistance and it's always a massive help so there we go five bad habits we all suffer from as filmmakers and some ideas for how to break them if you like talking about things like this or if you love finding the perfect book as much as I do you'll probably also like my free monthly newsletter that always have a few reading recommendations on top of gear talk and travel stories career advice and a bunch of other things it's always different month to month and it's totally free so if that sounds like something you'd be into check out the link in the description hope you found that video helpful and maybe it helped you identify your own bad habits and give you some ideas on how you might start working on them none of us are perfect but with work and patience we can make progress over time which is the only secret to long-term success see ya [Music] foreign [Music]
