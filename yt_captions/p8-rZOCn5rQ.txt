i can't remember if i've asked you my current soundtrack yeah what do you have for your breakfast no no what did you have for breakfast favorite programming language uh oh it's haskell of course what's your favorite programming language bbc basic what's that because i learnt it when i was six or seven years old at primary school and it's the only one i've really learned so stylistically java is probably my favorite um i use that for many years but now i mostly use python but i'm not quite as competent as i'd like to be with it favorite probably php because that's what i'm best at messy python like obvious obviously no like i've been using python for it was the first like real language that i ever properly started using in like 2007 something like that i was in fairly early on python and uh it's now how i think to the point where i can't actually write pseudocode if i try to write pseudocode i write python by accident best language best syntax anyway oh my favorite oh my new favorite programming language is python because you you can do really anything with it it's uh yeah it's pretty amazing oh i don't know about favorite uh they all have their pros and cons i i work a lot with javascript do you have a favorite programming language c yeah definitely c c python php what's your programming language of choice here uh c but yeah mainly yeah you program at all um a little bit yeah programming language of choice would be uh python so you stop stop whether i'll build windows pc or apple back no not anymore sadly or happily or sadly i don't know favorite programming language is false although i can't actually program it very much but that's the one that i like the most so what is your favorite programming language uh probably php favorite programming language i you know i've i have said in the past that if i remember ruined on a desert island i would prefer to have c uh if i think about what i program on a day-to-day basis i probably most often use awk and i often use python for things where awk isn't big enough you know it doesn't scale up to bigger things and after that it's kind of a toss-up javascript okay i hate me for that you're not the only one there we've had a few of those what's the reason for that why did you like it so it's just like i used to hate it it was just then i did an internship doing front-end web development and i actually really really like it now and using like the the newer versions like es6 and that stuff i really enjoy it what is your favorite programming language and why common lisp because i can do anything i want in it can you tell me what your favorite programming language is and tell me why um well i quite like lists but i don't know why it's a bit stupid um i end up doing a lot of matlab and i don't want to like matlab but it's just incredibly useful so what is your favorite programming language well i think the better question is if you could only take one programming language to a desert island what would it be i'm guessing it's going to be c oh yes i'm in total agreement with but i don't totally agree with buying about every single thing i really don't but i'm with him on that one you know if you're told there's one and only one it's got to be able to do low level and it's harder to do high-level object-oriented stuff in c but you can do it if you want to it would have to be c which is your favorite programming language so anyway favorite programming language at the moment the programming language i'm running a lot in this 6502 assembler i wouldn't say it's my favorite my favorite programming language for uh i guess it's javascript at the moment it's just you do so much with it it's hard to i don't know if i use any other ones what's your favorite programming language basic obviously because it's basic and people can understand it more importantly kids can understand it that's why i love it i could understand it as a kid i got to grips with it programmed in other languages from there on um but from here my point of view at the museum it's just a great language for kids to get involved with and if they like it move on from there uh what is your favorite programming language and and why what do you use most gosh i mean the last um stuff i was writing was in a mill filter in exim which is probably not something you've ever heard of no that's new to me what what's this it's it's a language put together by a guy here who wrote a mail system that we still kind of use so it's it's very recognized obscure and local but but basically basically i proud kids grandkids etc to use python do you program at all uh yes i mean a lot of the projects involved programming and image processing what's your favorite programming language well to be honest i yeah maybe i'm mostly used to using matlab and i use that a lot in this project to integrate all bits and pieces programming language is 68 000 assembler because for the sega mega drive it's a native language for it favorite programming language and why it's getting more difficult actually i think but uh i still like c-sharp the best um i think that uh if you're programming windows which of course not everyone is and people need to be versatile if you're programming windows it's much easier to get user interface up and running in c sharp it's got loads of libraries and it's also a statically typed language which i like oh my favorite programming language i'll go with probably an unusual one which is labview it's a graphical programming language it's actually called g the thing that drives it is called g which i absolutely despised when i first started off but um starting to get to grips with it but love it now so yeah good what'd you do what'd you do in it just so it's basically you have icons so you have a front panel and a block diagram so it's like a circuit diagram which is maybe why it appeals so for example you would have a graph let's say you drag a graph and that will give you an icon or graph icon and then let's say you had a signal so you would um on here you'd have something that acquires the signal that you know connects to a date acquisition card then you would feed that into the graph and then the signal would appear but then you have a whole palette of different tools like fourier transform spectrum analyzers that you can apply so um but you can also do for loops while loops conditional statements all that it's it's it's and what you have to think about is not so much the functions but the data flow which is different way of thinking so yeah it's it's both that it's that deeply ingrained in how i think but it's also that neat and like parsimonious of syntax yeah python's wonderful parsimonious now that's there's a word i've never heard and used in is that actually literally literally a codeine oh yeah it's a good pun actually accidental pun yeah
