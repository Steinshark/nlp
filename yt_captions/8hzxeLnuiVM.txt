ladies and gentlemen if any of you have ever gotten into chess you've probably played against the chess bot they're very nice ways to practice without actually risking raiding or experiencing anxiety well every single month chess.com has put out new Bots at the beginning of this year there was mittens of course and now in April 2023 they've actually made a bot of me but not in the way that you would think you see chess.com decided to turn me into the Mario bot except I'm called lario lario fell down a warp tube in the chess Kingdom play against them and help him on his journey in defeating the evil Hauser so basically I'm Mar I'm lario because I think of you know Nintendo or whoever owns Mario is gonna get me in trouble and he car I'm I gotta I gotta go in and take on uh Hauser and then there's also Boshi which is just hilarious because botez there's uh fabiji Fabiano caruana and uh Andrea boethas is a princess nectarine and in this video I'm gonna play against my body and I don't know maybe I'll play against like maybe I'll play the the other Bots too I I I I will start with the black pieces against the Boshi bot um hi let's have an exciting game says the bow she bought this is weird uh I'm gonna play The Dutch defense F5 uh and the way you play the Dodge defense is you put wow Bishop G5 okay you play Knight F6 uh and then you try to play why why is the bot thinking Boshi let's get this party stuff what I'm gonna take toward the center keep my structure develop and Castle it's 400 ELO but uh why hasn't botas hung her Queen yet uh what that's a really good move this bot is 400. I'm okay okay okay there's the 400. all right I thought I was gonna lose to the boat that's bought I was getting really nervous all right all right all right let's uh develop and pressure the center uh let's Slide the bit doesn't really matter which way we go I want to keep this like a 12 there it is there it is I was gonna say I want to keep this to a 20 minute video well I mean at least it's playing like Alexandra botas would play uh all right B6 I'm gonna undermine the center here and then I'm gonna put my Rook and I'm gonna play Knight here now I'm fully developed my Center is solid Free Pawn take that bring the king out let's let's do it uh is the bot smart enough to run the king to safety with this coming I'm playing Queen C8 okay it runs that way that's not great let's activate the Rook on the open file again I don't want to sit here and spend 10 minutes against each of these Bots and clearly they are not like really 400 I mean if they were 400 they wouldn't have had such a solid opening but I think I will be promptly Boshi what did my king ever do to you is that what is that does Yoshi say Boshi I mean uh just disregard that that I haven't had my coffee yet um Queen B4 and queen C3 is probably made I've got the triple battery and uh we can pre-move a mate all right you won by Checkmate that wasn't bad that wasn't all right um new game fabiji uh I'll play fabiji with white I'm excited to play against you and not my brother for one but I am your brother I am the other bot well this is okay now I'm gonna play D4 I'll play a London how about that a lot of you a lot of you nerds out there like yourselves a little London system all right black plays here that means he's okay he's Landing my London the way you deal with this is you kind of turn it into a Queen's Gambit did you know that now you do and then you put the Knight behind the c Pawn to apply some pressure uh with the cool oh wow fabiji is worse than the botas bot incredible I had no idea who picked my outfit at all what he just gave me two pawns what is he doing what what fabiji bro fabiji on that good stuff I don't even know um I'm gonna go here and set up a discovered attack but oh my God he just helped me do it what is wrong with him you know what I'm gonna promote to a bishop how about that I'm promoting to a bishop against the bot there we go and maybe maybe he'll let me smothermate him you think I think he's gonna take my Bishop but you think he's gonna okay almost uh I I'm I'm still trying to do it I kind of smothered mated fabiji oh my goodness that was terrible what what the hell was that I beat Fabiano bot in like a minute oh my goodness I mean listen it's okay to last a minute and then chess Fabiano that's not good all right uh I'm gonna play Princess nectarine and we'll end you know maybe I'll play my own Bob play the Hikaru bought as well play it uh and uh maybe I'll play myself with white this bot is 1200 and it started the game with A4 well I mean look at least they modeled the opening repertoires correctly like yeah I could see Andrea doing that um well when in doubt reverse London with the Queen's Pawn okay I love how it's just like playing normal now just played A4 no problem all right reverse London uh exactly what I just did uh you don't have to play like this but I am and you know chess is a game of unlimited possibilities I'm gonna play Bishop before normally there's no need to commit to this pin because you can be attacked uh pawns can't go backwards so now my Bishop will just live here uh and of course the best friend of the d-pawn uh is the C Pawn so it's good to walk them into the center together like this and then I'm gonna put my knight here and then I'm gonna PP on the pp uh AKA put pressure on the pinned piece it's time for you to step into the ring with me oh that's a reference to Andrea boxing all right I'm now pressuring the the Knight on C3 there is a fork here but the bot probably won't well that's actually not a terrible move uh let me go here and see if the 1200 bot will find Bishop B7 I doubt it basically it's gonna go here I'm gonna move back oh I mean they lit they must have programmed the boat has bot to be like you know when your queen is hanging just leave it there that's incredible wow oh no did you just capture my yes yes I did okay folks is it better to lose a knight for free or a rook for a bishop it's better to lose the Rook for the bishop because you're gonna get something back and the difference there is two versus three nothing uh okay uh in this case of course it's better to move the Rook but then the losing the pawn uh oh my God it went here and then it didn't take okay so the way we're gonna win this is we're going to simplify all right we're going to trade the bishop for the night uh we we don't really mind we can we're happy to do this that doesn't really do any damage to our position uh and then we're gonna maybe trade these two and we would love to trade a pair of Rooks that would really be ideal because with one Rook only white can never do any damage uh with two Rooks white could do some damage uh all right um I'm also happy to trade in the center this is the best move okay excuse me played if take take I'm happy uh of course I'm also happy to get rid of wise pass Pawn and just make sure your king is kind of protected at all times I'd like to get in maybe and and push my uh I can't really do that because my knight would be hanging so I'm gonna move the Knight then I'm gonna infiltrate then the Queen's gonna beat up everybody because I have a queen and I'm only playing a princess check check that was not a good move and now I can take everything I will take all the pawns and then I'm probably not going to uh oh like it's it's yeah I was gonna say I'm not gonna take all the pieces but um I am literally taking all of those Bots pieces like I'm gonna try to take ever like I'm gonna try to get this too wow wow I am beating the Andrea botes bot by 20 points of material and I'm I'm gonna promote to five Queens I'm gonna make five Queens in fact I'm gonna pre-move it and then I'm gonna bring my pieces back to their home squares like this and then I'm gonna go like this and then I'm just gonna promote I'm gonna let's go let's go just don't stalemate yeah most important thing all right all right you you can go now thank you thank you it's been good it's been fun thank you very much yup uh-huh I'm promoting what am I missing I can do Bishop Bishop Knight oh that would be cool oh wait no no I can't I made too many queens because I would have to get rid of these two pieces well whatever the king's into that stuff all right Bishop Zoom back and the Knight we need to make a knight we need to make a knight how do I do that I need to make a knight let's check and then promote to a knight there we go and I'm gonna make one final night and life will be good there it is I've got the whole Squad here now do I have Checkmate and one in this position I feel like I should I have to cover that square but if I go here then there's King G5 do I not have a maiden one that's very sad Queen F6 there it is okay incredible all right that was the worst bot by far all right uh well let's play Hikaru bot uh I won't White against Hikaru but I mean Hauser Hauser Hauser all right I'll play E4 I mean I think I think they're gonna program Hikaru bot in a way that well let's play the A3 Sicilian you think he knows anything about the A3 Sicilian oh we're gonna play our Gambit let's see take take oh he doesn't he he didn't he didn't let me do what I want is he gonna get his Knight trapped No it should be two okay terrific now I personally like I can't see them making a Hikaru but okay I was gonna I can't see them making a Hikaru bot like really terrible because I can see Hikaru not taking too kindly to just being programmed into a 1400 level bot but uh I don't who knows I don't know all right I'm gonna Castle I guess I want to take a little bit more space and make sure my queen side say G5 oh my oh my okay C4 is this another prank am I no castles is a bad move okay I'm good enough to understand that castling in that position is not a good move um because you just played G5 like what are you doing right now I'm gonna put my wait a minute is it a good move now I'm getting scared I'm getting real scared because I don't know like what I'm playing like am I playing a am I playing a bad bot or a good bot you know chess.com has given me pretty pretty strong PTSD with mittens so I don't know okay we're gonna take and then we're gonna take on G4 I think all right he takes and I take everybody is swapping juicers here all right we're keeping even I need to reroute um I'll drop back that night looks really loose so this is called a reroute I'm gonna play Bishop C1 I also have Queen H5 and Knight takes C5 that kind of looks good I gotta tell you is he gonna go here all right wow the bot saw that well it's a bot so I don't know why I'm impressed uh oh wait wait is that just a fork was that like another whoa whoa whoa It's a fork always look for checks boom I want to Rook against tikaru look at that it's a crowding moment of my life right here uh well now I'm up a rook so it doesn't matter anymore I could just do whatever uh no you it's very very bad way to play chess but um so the way I'll win this is I will of course simplify or I will go for the attack that's the two ways to win a chess game uh simplify or go for a a big attack in this case I think I can simplify but I'm also like infiltrating and again I'm up a rook so uh how do I get my Rooks in the game I think F4 is good just don't get your queen trapped you know just make sure the Queen's not trapped Rook lift a Hikaru of course is one of the most defensively talented players on the planet but I think has bought probably does not share such a quality although I might get my queen trapped again I I have no idea all right rookie one I need to use my Rook I'm not using my Roca cam very happy to see the trade uh Rook H7 okay Queen trade boom easy get the Queens off you got an extra Rook maybe you won't beat the actual Hikaru but you will definitely beat uh bought Hikaru um we can play no we can't play G4 okay we just need to let's crack open the position Pawn break on the queen side we're infiltrating if the bot takes two weaknesses we can now pick up uh and life is good now I'm really concerned about my own bot because they made the rest of these Bots a little terrible all right let's sack the bishop we simplifying everything let's go Rook a seven chop it down boom Oh it's giving me the bishop boom there it is love to see it make a queen and uh I'm not gonna promote a million times I respect this bot check check check oh whoa whoa um how would Hikaru do the chat it's just made into I don't have to do any pre-moving okay all right folks nice 4-0 against the plumberbots let's give my bot the white pieces and see what he plays this is live it's a me Laria here we go uh they have to name it lario because if they named it Mario they would have gotten a Nintendo lawsuit all right go um oh whoops my dream is to become the internet's Plumbing teacher okay I wanted to give my uh bot uh uh yes I want to start a new game how do I start a new game hello I wanted to give my bot white I play as black there we go all right D4 okay yeah we like that I'll play symmetrical Queen spawn what are you gonna do oh oh look at my butt my butt is so good it's so hard to make money here there's no gold coins anywhere I mean okay all right relax uh let's play a Queen's Gambit declined oh chance to use the new course and if you're watching this in the first two days this video comes out of course it's 50 off let's go yes wow the bot is playing like real queens I love this they made my bot so strong thank you chess.com I love this man I'm gonna trade the dark squared Bishops I'm gonna Castle this is real stuff my bot is playing a real opening oh they made me um so I'm such a I'm such a happy camper oh my bot is so good not what this is insanity my bot is playing really well for an 800. oh my goodness I'm a little bit spooked this is craziness okay I'm gonna play Queen E7 now I've gotta apply pressure to this Knight to untangle my position but my bot is super good wow uh uh Rook G one oh okay my bot was super good but oh no now I'm winning the pawn in the center all right I just want to see will my bot play the Karo Khan that's all I want to know I'm attacking the center when your opponent's king is in the middle you can open it up I'm gonna take and I mean of course I I had a feeling I was at some point going to completely take over the game but that happens when I play humans too so check will my bot find B4 wow very impressive very very impressive otherwise I was completely winning now I'm only a little bit winning Let's uh break so I can activate my Rook wow wait this is crazy I thought the bot was just gonna throw all the all the pieces on the Bots actually playing very well look not anymore Bishop through is not a good move um oh my goodness all right we're just gonna take her okay I'm gonna take all my and C5 here we go um Queen trade talked about this maybe trade the Rooks too okay it doesn't want to trade rugs but I have two past pawns so should be easy G5 is the best move to create counter play as a human as a bot I don't know it's just am I just gonna shuffle my pieces back and forth okay rookie three that's not a good move because of this I lost the bishop okay wow uninspiring performance I must say by lario uh Bishop B7 check King F2 I'll take on H3 a guy we'll take on H3 and play Rook H1 maybe I can mate my bot maybe I can play Knight G4 and that's just checkmate yeah nice what do I say when I lose the game must be broken I'll be blowing in the cartridge okay I'm gonna play my bot One More Time the video ends if my bot doesn't play the Karo Khan all right if my bot doesn't play E4 C6 the video's over get out of here
