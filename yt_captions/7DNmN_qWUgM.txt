what we got here is a UV which we use for the 3D reconstruction it's an octocopter and has a still image camera on it and here you can see the controls with a live view we're using this system for 3D reconstruction so we are flying up there taking images and from this images we do something that's called structure promotion and basically make a 3D reconstruction out of it stru from motion is basically you find some Salient points in the images and then find them in more images from different positions and with this information you can basically see where the images were taken and also extract the 3D structure out of that this is a bit like when people use stitching on the mobile phone I mean it's related to stitching because there also you find the correspondences but you really get the 3D structure which is very different for stitching you don't want to move your camera for 3D reconstruction you have to move your camera that's why it's called structure from motion instead of having two cameras like a stereo RI you move one camera from one to the other place and to other places and use this information to extract the 3D and then this images are streamed down to the computer where the intelligence resides basically so you take these images do the structure for motion and get an rough idea what the structure looks like from there on the system can decide whether or not the user requirements are fulfilled and if they're not fulfilled it will decide where do I have to take more images so that it actually get what the user wants so a complete 3D reconstruction with a certain resolution certain uncertainty and this is then done automatically so it plans where it should go then you can launch the MV it flies to those positions takes this images and updates it 3D reconstruction with that information then it can improve it s and make a new plan and decide whether or not it's fulfilled now it's semi-autonomous I mean you have this planning strategy which you basically tells you where you and it flies around but you can intercept at any point of a pipeline before you lunch Launch the M during the execution there's always you always have the um control with you and can intercept at any point the the only thing you have to um also do uh tell the system is what is interesting in the scene the system itself does not know that this here is a scene where this represents some of the vegetation around the rock you want to reconstruct it's taking an image and then judging from the image where the vegetation is basically here these markers are just used for GE reference not for the Reconstruction itself and you take images of this here and then we also learned how these different structures have to be treated differently because the rock is smooth and kind of easy to reconstruct well this high frequency structures you could call that the vegetation is really hard to reconstruct for that you have to treat it differently and our program basically learned how to treat it differently and uses that to improve the 3D reconstruction already in the acquisition on site during the flight over here we have already taken some pictures of the scene these points you can see here and also where actually the pictures were taken from and with that information it knows okay over here for example there are some regions which are not nicely covered and then in PL some use that actually these parts are covered as well normally you can then just click Start and then it would go around and move and take these images for you you always have to take care that it sees all the objects for example there might be kind of power lines or small structures it might not see itself so if you see it plans in there you of course have to change the plan for them so it's not like totally autonomous we wouldn't do that so there's always a human supervising it and saying but it's really hard if you just have this plan here and want to execute it without the automation it's really really hard it takes a lot of experience and even then you won't be able to get exactly the position but for the system it's very easy and it just helps you to get where you wanted to have it the hardware is basically off the sh but all the software was developed in inhouse basically so the whole component with the 3D reconstruction the planning and the execution then is always then sent back to the UV so we're basically here dealing with the intelligence of the system not the hardware itself we're working in yuntu with um partly open source partly um software that was developed in source and is commercial and then we you programming language is mainly C++ but we also have Cuda for um accelerating it on the graphics card here you can see a reconstruction on the top is basically with algorithm which learned to treat different kinds of um structures differently and here in the bottom is what happens if you don't use it your reconstruction becomes very Spar only the really smooth surfaces like this rock here survive the vegetation is basically missing everywhere but with the our soft you can see even here underneath this trees here which are included if you just fly above it it's well reconstructed here because the system decided all right over there there's an overhang I have to take pictures to actually get that in it doesn't know that it's really vegetation it just knows the structure that is in the image is hard to reconstruct and I have to treat it differently it has actually no semantic meaning in it so it doesn't know vegetation as a word or anything it just know knows that it has to treat it differently this software is kind of generic so you just train it on whatever task you want and also for like reconstru um construction sites you can use it and then evaluate how the construction site changed over time or other thing you can change just for ancient buildings so basically the purpose is reconstruction whatever you want to reconstruct you could do that as long as it's some kind of static object we'd like to thank audible.com for this episode of computer file and if you visit audible.com computer file there's a chance to
