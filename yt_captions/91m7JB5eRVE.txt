hello welcome my friends to Austin stupid corner of stupid things so recently we took a look at a very very dumb item at our local electronics store where the employees helpfully pointed out the worst computer that they currently sell the HP fisher-price special now it's not actually officially a fisher-price wait until you see what's inside this it is it bad it's real bad so what do you get with a $400 HP all-in-one well not not much actually it has an external power supply this thing is basically the same power of like a netbook and yet it has an external supply but as an internal DVD drive I am offended right now we have you to open this thing up and I'm offended hope you guys are ready for often salty Evans actually I will say I'm kind of digging the white keyboard obviously it's a very cheap membrane keyboard that's actually not bad and it looks kind of nice I'll give them some props it does come with a twelve dollar keyboard in the Box sings a small I can just pick up with one hand designed reliable and ready for you so which one of these do you think it'll actually none of the above none of the above do you see how thick this thing is do you see how big it is they could have fit this just like here a Kensington lock in case you were worried about anyone stealing your I will say I'm actually a lit of a sucker for this white I mean it doesn't actually look terrible as far as the color goes it just looks like a like a toy like the bezels are so run back we have that fancy ripple pattern we have a Kensington lock headphone jack HDMI that's aggressive 2 USB 3.0 the power adapter Ethernet as well as 2 USB 2.0 and over on this side we've got an optical disc drive a DVD writer no less in case you wanna can't do please though so oh I mean even if it could I don't think it would play them alright let's let's plug this thing in I really want to see how this is so just trying to get it to open up the windows setup screen is taking a very very long time you've been here for like 3 to 5 minutes it's not moved from the screen it turned on I got the boot logo it's just a moment I will tell you however actually did miss one thing if you look on the bottom we do have an SD card which is very exciting also take a look at the stand it has a lot of adjustability I can go from here to here wait that's black look at this case our keys see this that's black that's supposed to be black right now you see it's just great I will say the most impressive thing about this right now that speaker actually sounds pretty good speaker actually doesn't sound bad hey let me just show you something so just in case you can't see clearly on the computer this is what black should look like and this is the black of the actual system you see thought how bad that is this might be one of the worst looking displays ever Oh important set up time I've got at least five more laps on the scooter for this one it's very strange because there are actually a fair few all ones available like I argue that in most stores people are buying all the ones more often they're buying full-size desktops but this is one of the only all ones that does not have a touch me oh don't do that do you see how much the whole screen flickers okay so we finally are up and running inside windows so first of all let me actually take a closer look at the speck on this guy so we have a dual core AMD a 490 125 we have 4 gigabytes of RAM a one terabyte hard drive we do have AC Wi-Fi LAN plugged in via ethernet and our Radeon our three graphics this this is rough man alright I'm gonna install everything I can we're gonna try to get this thing as speedy as possible I've got a lot of things to uninstall so after letting this sit overnight and get all of its updates handled there are a couple of things that really jump out to me in fact you can see it right now very very frequently it just sits at incredibly high CPU it's like 71% just doing nothing right so one of the things about the system is that with such a slow dual-core processor something as simple as the hosts process for setting synchronization can peg the CPU almost entirely I get it cheap computer but the problem here is that it's not that cheap $400 is still $200 more than I think this thing's probably worth but I did tweet out I did ask if anyone had any questions about our wonderful HP all-in-one alright so let's see how long Twitter actually takes to load mind you I'm on Ethernet right now so okay that's uh it's coming it's not the worst thing I've ever seen dry humping no Kyle hackintosh look I'm not gonna hack and touch this thing I don't want to make the world is an iMac here technically MMI not yet I know it's got four gigs of RAM I don't even know if it would its don't you need eight gigs for the most recent version of Catalina what do we do the whole degrees that sounds terrible I don't do that oh my god you know what I don't even think I can watch a video of crisis on this thing right no no it's not I have four gigs a single-channel memory with like no well that's easier than installing it it won't even install I bet no we opinion for one gig of ram g-force 1600 GT this actually might work look I'm gonna do this for the PC master-race but I'm not happy about it all right here we go Crysis warhead let's do it it's only six gigs oh man that's a kinase all right look at that it's allocating disk base eight and an incredibly rapid I can't say anything nice about this thing okay let's see how long it's actually gonna take because theoretically we're on Ethernet oh look at that five minutes wait a minute that's actually pretty good wait are we really gonna install this in less than three minutes it's a spotlighting hard but you know what who cares if I can get like three frames per second crisis I will consider this to be a success yo eyes on 710 down to be fair that really has very little to do with the computer and entire love the fact that we have a gig connection here but still look TC master is right I got a rep I got to wrap my true colors ye-qing unacceptable man I am offended let's I mean come on any computer could get through the loading screen right you know what I don't even think this is as powerful as a Core 2 Duo realistically it might be close I'll turn down low but I'll turn it a little bit gonna work gonna work come on 99% oh it works I mean this is 16 frames per second but this works oh okay how's the stutter all right let me turn some settings now I'm gonna crank it all the way down this actually works though so we're minimally 800 by 600 so don't think that oh look I'm up to 22 frames per second now this is the jittery Asst frame rate I've ever felt it like bouncing between 30 and like two it feels like this is crisis you know what's something I really noticed here the screen is terrible like the black point I got never seen the black part of the screen be the same as the great part of the screen like there's no difference whatsoever like it's so like the lack of contrast is crazy look I think this is really straightforward is it is it a great version of crisis no but does it actually technically work yes actually I'm not gonna say impressed but surprised it's definitely way I would put it wait you can't ask questions on Twitter can it fold no why are you asking Twitter you're like right here you'll have to ask questions on Twitter oh hell no so let's to play The Witcher 3 nope nope please don't play fortnight on it no problem for and I definitely won't work edit a video with it so you may have caught a video I did last year where I bought my very first laptop and tried to edit a video on it it was a complete and total disaster so now I'm not doing any more edit challenges I value my sanity more than 35 seconds of your entertainment I apologize that may have been rude to be but you played Crysis Crysis is fine oh wait here's a better so I asked open ten tabs in chrome think we can do 10 tabs I should probably tell chrome first ok so I have installed Chrome and right now we're sitting at 2.5 of our 3.9 gigs of memory used so let's just start opening tabs so I have a YouTube page up with a video which is paused or a two point eight gigs of RAM so we have broken this is just tab number three oh three point one and we're peg CPU ok next let's go Apple calm that's a should be easy enough website to load Apple say it's actually pretty well optimized ok so we're at three point four gigs it's not a good what four tabs in we're almost maxed we're at the point of this video where the verge yes the benchmark hey man sweet shout-out to mr. Ken Billy doe on Instagram we're up to three point three gigs is this an insightful wonderful video full of information that you wish you knew five minutes ago no me neither if read it wants to load okay okay so now that grandma has her msn what's your final tab FoxNews no stop it's not the grandma special let's go to uh CN n no no we're still loading so MSN actually look we're not done with MSN yet it's still 100% CPU usage okay we're loading all right cnn.com for our tenth tab system is very slow at this point we're almost full of memory wait you decided to do CNN anyway yeah what would you what do you want me to do The Weather Channel oh okay we don't really want to talk about the virus Austin there's no there's every we wanted to we want to keep positivity up on the channel awesome look we're all positive right now we have a dumb PC that we're doing dumb things like trying to open ten tabs on Weather Channel is loading this news subs for positivity why is that the first big I feel well the weather is looking great all right sunny with a chance of death we have 10 tabs loaded so our CPU is permanently pegged at 100% right now we have three point six gigs of ram used can I actually open up all these tabs now okay that's what that was here that one's here that one's here oh look actually I think it worked I mean it's probably caching these but every single tab seems to be doing it oh it had to reload that one oh no I can't keep them all and look look how long it is when I switch between them it's not terrible look at that fast this is more multitasking than my mom will do in like a week well no matter what we do the CPU was permanently pegged at 100% just having all these tabs running in the background so yes technically it can run 10 chrome tabs but barely and Iran is not happy with us and of course Josh in here with do the speakers bump though I'm Austin I'm Mike we are the test drivers we put tech through its paces Mike today I really want to find out if you love great speakers see flip the animal but first we have a test drivers bonus exclusive on the Xbox series what it's almost like there's a link to that in the description of this video incredible some galaxies brain right there I think you said enough about the speaker but I appreciate the ad spots this video is brought to you by my brand new podcast please download it thanks I would see you returning me to I would love to see that as well overclock there's no way this thing will let me overclock and if it could it'll catch on fire if I catch a fire yeah any red footage no watch YouTube it aka oh I'm down with that okay let's find an 8k video and let's work our way up I'm watching your ads Marquez I hope you're grateful all right so we're watching an 8k mkbhd video we're going to start out 480p and see if it works okay next let's go to 720p where does it where do you think it's gonna choke I think is gonna hit 1080 and stop I think 1080 is probably okay yeah okay so 720 oh well it's a little jittery okay next let's go 1080p can I do 1080p oh oh no it's done during its battering look it's jittery I also give a minor pass a teeny what happens we go 1440 I definitely choke here ain't 1440 is kind of hard to play I'm not liking that not so it's buffering it'll be it's kind of playing let's no no no they're just let's just let's try to answer the question as soon as possible they just couldn't rate to 8 K of course I am dude you're staying it alone there we go there we go if that got work it's not gonna work there's no way it's gonna work oh wait wait wait calm down calm down oh I do it's name is 8 K is a hard no on this one 1440p is a hard no on this one check Amazon for upgrades can I open this PC it's not meant to be taken apart that's for sure the thing is though is that I don't think there's anything to really upgrade besides maybe I could swap out the hard drive for an SSD because it's got a single channel of memory right and honestly there's not really much that's worth upgrading I guess an SSD wouldn't be terrible if you want to just crack it open and pull the hard drive out but I feel like look I'm lazy I don't have to tear this thing apart I know what's inside is not gonna be exciting you could theoretically open it are you just trying to like pry it apart right now I don't think it's that poorly built a lot of people asking for Linux Linux should work yeah yeah Windows 10 fine the thing is though is that this PC is meant for your grandma your grandma doesn't need Linux your grandma doesn't need Windows your grandma needs an iPad that's not a bad point look I don't trust grandma with this man I'm just I'm just saying well if I'm real this thing right here is probably what you need for grandpa a bass iPad it is cheaper than this thing a bass iPad will run you about 300 bucks whereas this is $400 I would definitely agree the only thing is those if you want a bigger screen I feel like one of the advantages here over like something like a laptop is the fact that it's got like a 19 inch screen or something I mean I guess glasses I can't believe his official opinion how about the webcam should we try the webcam oh look I look like I'm potato man okay wait can't turn the HDR HDR OTO there we go that's the move right hand kind of change settings here Pro Mode Pro Mode remote wait video quality 480p or do I want 360p 360p I want 480p I want my extra pixels oh we can change your brightness oh that's it those are your settings that that's your Pro Mode right here we're recording hello my friends and welcome to the webcam on my HP all-in-one lab as you can see it's in beautiful 480p standard definition which we really all know the resolution of mr. can I stop making this video yet all I'm saying is that if you get it that iPad is cheaper and you can FaceTime grandma not this port thank you very much for watching this episode of the off a YouTube channel you try to subscribe over here over here or you can check out some other videos over here until next time I'm going to go not use this computer ever again [Music] you
