new zealand's biggest company by far is a dairy cooperative with 14 billion usd total revenue in 2021 fonterra group is the country's juggernaut a dairy company does way more than milk and over the years fonterra has evolved and grown along with the new zealand dairy industry to become a globe spanning food giant in this video we're going to look at new zealand's biggest exporter and a cornerstone of its economy the wikipedia article on the company gives a good start on its history new zealand has a competitive advantage in milk production the grass grows there at high quantities for nine months of the year which makes cattle grazing cheaper than in other locations the united kingdom established its new zealand colony as a friendly economic frontier that can produce and ship dairy and meat products back to the imperial homeland for its urbanizing population to consume these dairy exports first began in the 1840s with a shipment of cheese to australia volume significantly increased with the introduction of refrigeration in the 1880s now you can ship perishable goods thousands of kilometers to britain and the rest of the global market but mostly britain from the very beginning the country's dairy industry has been mostly made up of cooperatives cooperatives are owned controlled and run not by external shareholders but rather the operators so the dairy farms themselves the first dairy cooperative was established in new zealand in 1871. 50 years later in 1920 some 600 cooperatives owned 85 percent of the country's dairy processing plants the new zealand government felt that having so many individual cooperatives would make it difficult for them to sell and market their product thus in 1923 they established the dairy produce export control board to control all dairy exports and gain economies of scale this organization would later become the new zealand dairy board or the nzdb it held a legislative monopoly with the exclusive right to market all export dairy products the cooperatives would handle the collection and processing of the milk the nzdb would do the shipping packaging transportation quality control promotion and so on over the years however the scattered industry had undergone several waves of consolidation by 1935 those 600 cooperatives had merged and turned into a little over 400. in particular world war ii and the uk's demand for imported foodstuffs supercharged the new zealand dairy economy the kiwis provided 70 percent of britain's cheese and 91 percent of its butter spreads during the war the british would continue buying new zealand goods after the end of world war ii this guaranteed market fueled that industry's growth however new technologies in dairy processing and transportation encouraged yet another bunch of mergers by the 1960s those 400 cooperatives would become 180 and so on then in 1973 the united kingdom entered the european community the britons had previously guaranteed access to new zealand's milk and meat exports at good terms but the ec move significantly curbed new zealand's privileged place in the british market to prevent a collapse the new zealand government increased their support of the agricultural sector by 1984 such support made up about 30 percent of total sales but this approach was not working the new zealand economy was struggling with high inflation high debt high input costs and uncompetitive goods the government responded with a strong reform program across all industries removing the industry's protections and exposing it to the global market as expected the new zealand agricultural industry suffered greatly previously dairy farmers sold their milk to the nzdb at a bundle price that did not reflect a proper return on investment government subsidies encouraged the overuse of fertilizer and the cultivation of land that had been unsuitable for sheep and beef so as a result the country had overproduced on milk when those policies went away many farmers went bankrupt or had to sell their land to stay afloat land prices dropped farm prices reached a 23-year low and profits shrank but the upside was that the market shrank to a more manageable size the dairy industry's new round of consolidations allowed the remaining farmers to achieve scale and become more efficient farms transition to portfolio approaches no longer exclusively relying on dairy farming by cultivating different crops and offering new services like tourism and recreation the nzdb however retained its monopoly on dairy exports but in the wake of losing its privileged status in the uk market the board decided to pivot and diversify into international markets this is challenging the richest and most developed countries have very protected dairy industries for instance tariffs on milk imported to japan or switzerland ranges from 360 percent to 800 percent milk in general is a low margin commodity so even relatively low tariff rates can have devastating consequences to the bottom line the new zealand government has gone to bat for its dairy industry consistently negotiating multilateral trade agreements with this in mind new zealand's participation in the big export market would eventually lead to its big final restructuring in 2001 with the creation of fonterra at the end of the 1990s there would be only four cooperatives left in the new zealand dairy industry new zealand dairy group kiwi dairy tatua and westland the latter are very small so we are basically talking a duopoly by now the nzdb's legal monopoly of the dairy export market was becoming a bit of a problem it made sense back when there were hundreds or even dozens of small farms but now the industry had vastly consolidated and the big two cooperatives were getting antsy and impatient with the nzdb they wanted more say in the production processing and marketing side of the industry for instance milk itself is a low value good so you can make more profit by processing it into yogurt which can sell at a higher price the conflict sprouted up about whom the benefits of such sales would go to the nzdb itself or the individual cooperative that supplied its milk outside observers also felt that the nzdb's export monopoly position hindered domestic competition too new zealand's domestic dairy consumption was small so any new cooperative needed the export market but this was gated by the nzdb and its shareholders in other words potential competitors this tension within the industry grew to the point where its contradictions could not be sustained any longer finally in 2001 a merger was proposed between the two largest cooperatives and the nzdb itself the cooperative's shareholders approved the merger the government soon followed with the dairy industry restructuring act of 2001 removing the nzdp's export monopoly and blessing the birth of the global dairy company or fonterra cooperative group today fonterra is a vertically integrated cooperative group with vast operations and sales offices around the world 96 of the milk that its 13 000 farmers produce is exported together with producers in australia and the european union fonterra dominates the international dairy industry the company has grown beyond being a simple export outlet for its new zealand-based farmers fonterra has become a legitimate global food company on par with nestle dannon and other global giants this means being capable of offering and supplying a large variety of diversified food goods to customers all over the world thus they create and sell a variety of value-added dairy products these include milk powder cheeses butter cream flavored milk yogurt and ice cream in search of additional growth the company has started investing in and coordinating production outside of its native new zealand for instance the company has invested substantial resources into latin america namely chile fonterra jointly owns one of the country's big dairy companies invested along with the investment arm of the chilean catholic church of all things this is in part to guarantee regular milk supply during new zealand's winter months and also to dodge trade barriers that prevent the entry of dairy products sourced out of new zealand 2001 would be a special year for new zealand milk for another reason china entered the wto ever since then china has imported more dairy than it has exported much of that imported dairy has come from australia and new zealand china has grown its own capacity for generating dairy for instance since 2001 dairy production has surged from just 10 million metric tons to 39 million in 2009 this makes china the third largest milk producer in the world behind the united states and india the chinese are also frequent consumers of dairy growing fast off a small base in 1996 they consumed about 8 kilograms per capita by 2006 that had grown to 25 kilograms driven by trends in refrigeration and improving lifestyles increasing chinese consumption of infant formula over the years comes off a low base but is also due to various economic trends that encouraged the use of infant formula over breastfeeding chinese exclusive breastfeeding rates have drastically declined since 1996. this is in part due to new mothers finding it challenging to continue breastfeeding after returning to work and also in part formula companies very aggressively marketing infant formula to mothers despite international recommendations not to do so domestic suppliers were taking share and fonterra risked being caught on the outside looking in so in 2005 fonterra entered into a jv agreement with leading chinese company sanlu group taking a 43 stake the new company's revenues grew well and the company became a leading provider of milk powder and infant formula you probably know what i'm getting at here melamine is a chemical used for plastics it has many useful industrial uses however it is not suitable for consumption but because it is rich in nitrogen it is sometimes added to food products to increase the apparent protein content this is obviously illegal in september 2008 the chinese government announced a major recall of milk products found to have melamine in them the issue compounded when other dairy products ice cream yogurt and just regular milk were also found to be contaminated babies died and three hundred thousand babies became ill the chinese dairy industry took a massive financial hit sanllu itself went bankrupt was fined seven million dollars by the government after its bankruptcy and four executives were put on trial fonterra lost its entire 150 million dollar investment this was a horrible tragedy but it is a little ironic that the scandal which fonterra had been involved in albeit as a minority partner would in turn spur sales of foreign imports including fonterra's own new zealand-sourced milk products chinese dairy imports went from 871 million dollars in 2008 to a billion dollars in 2009 and 2 billion dollars in 2010. chinese dairy imports from new zealand in particular grew very well 2009 imports grew 82 from 2008 and 2010 imports grew another 122 on top of that sales did take a bit of a hit from a 2013 recall when the company found bacteria contamination in its away products but today fonterra makes a great deal of revenue from china contributing a significant percentage of annual profit the country is very strategically important for the company new zealand's domestic market for dairy products is too small so fonterra needs to be able to export into overseas markets in order to grow and allow the farmer shareholders to keep their jobs fonterra wants to be able to compete on an even footing in a free open market and that is not how i would describe the global agricultural market at all it is heavily distorted with subsidies to farmers tariffs and domestic politics such things have been a consistent thorn in new zealand's side during two decades of multi-country agreement talks for instance japanese markets are consistently closed to outsiders thus new zealand is a country very incentivized to strike individual free trade agreements with other countries for instance new zealand is one of the few western aligned countries with a free trade agreement with china new zealand has also struck agreements with hong kong the hong kong china new zealand closer economic partnership agreement is hong kong's first outside of mainland china and interestingly enough new zealand has another free trade agreement with taiwan the economic cooperation with the separate customs territory taiwan panghu jinmen and matsu very carefully worded this is the case for every country with a big agricultural area but the new zealand dairy industry's high dependence on export agriculture influences how its host country handles its foreign relations with the rest of the world as one might have noticed throughout australia's recent tensions with china a second outcome of fonterra's dependence on middle-income countries for the majority of its export income is that the new zealand dairy industry for all of its marketing about cleanliness and premium quality needs to be a low-cost leader such low costs are hard to achieve in new zealand where a few things are particularly cheap and environmental regulations are somewhat strict and so it has leaned heavily on its farms outside of new zealand this naturally causes tensions with its host government upon which it relies upon for opening up export markets in the years ahead the company will have to work hard to correctly balance the needs of the market its host country and its shareholder operators while fighting off cow competition in the global marketplace alright everyone that's it for
