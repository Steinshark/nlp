why binary wouldn't it be much easier if they just used decimal numbers yes it would this is a fascinating story and it's one where what we've mentioned already when you and i started racing around bletchley park and talking about tommy flowers he is if you like right in the middle of this story why binary why not decimal it's caused me to think about it because if you think back to the pre-electronic era back to victorian times think of charles babbage and his famous difference engines they're of course just like the old-fashioned mechanical hand-driven calculators only a lot bigger so the question was can you on a mechanical gear wheel grind 10 teeth very accurately and equal distances apart so you don't get slippage you don't get naught slipping into being one yeah so it was a mechanical challenge so 10 cog teeth doesn't sound like a massive feat to deal with no it isn't but they could do even more what i'm trying to say is even earlier than that they could do more than that there's been tv programs on greek antikytheras that could predict solar eclipses absolutely finely machined teeth so yeah 10 was pretty straightforward for babbage and yet he still had complaints from his gear cutters because the large-scale automation manufacturer wasn't quite there in babbage's time and he moaned like mad at the invoices the bills he had to pay to his gear cutters so that was the big problem in the mechanical era things however did change enormously when we got not just to the era of relays but when you say i'm going to be purely electronic then back in those early days 30s 40s you were talking about thermionic valves once again that's vacuum tubes for those of you in north america who haven't watched the earlier videos what do you have to say to yourself there well if i use those as a logic element on and off you've got your cathode which boils off electrons you're anode with a big voltage on it sucking off the electrons up here and in the middle there's a grid and by putting what's called i think a bias voltage on the grid if you put a heavy negative voltage on the grid it repelled the electrons back to the cathode plate and didn't let them through so you switched it off so that was how it worked yeah but you needed heaters to boil the electrons off the cathode heaters power these things valves are so power hungry it just isn't true so on the one hand you are getting this ability to do electronic logic elements but the power consumption was a a problem all the time one reason to use binary overwhelmingly is it's perfect for the logic but i think the bigger question is when you start counting things when you start doing the arithmetic does it still make sense to bust yourself to use decimal because it's what we're used to well yes and no i think is the answer to that the good thing about using decimal let's say that first of all is that you need fewer digits yeah but binary is a lot longer than decimal obvious example of course is log to the base two of ten equals three point three two two and if anybody wants to produce a t-shirt with that one i might even buy one what it tells you is how much more circuitry and components do you need if you go for a binary computer than if you go for a decimal one that is just telling us how many more digits we need exactly how many bits would you need to represent 99 in binary well i know that eight bits is two five six yes but that's two seven bits it is one two eight exactly so that would encompass 99 right right so 99 requires seven bits so how does that relate to this magic 3.322 answer a two digit decimal number two if you multiply it by three point two you end up with 6.644 number file stuff you round up you take the ceiling of that which is the smallest integer directly above it you times the number of decimal digits by 3.322 that gives you the number of binary digits but if in doubt you have to round up because you must have a whole number of bits so straight away you can see therefore that the the thing that electronics engineers loved about binary was that it's simpler to build now that is so important but they also realized that you would need 3.3 times as much circuitry if you did binary so there was some argument that said well even though binary is right for the logic in a computer is there anything to be gained by still sticking to decimal for the arithmetic bit for counting numbers up not just for doing logic operations so you could have kind of two areas to consider one is the actual storage of the numbers and one is the operation of the computer right yeah that's right and i think the person who really you know wants respect for him goes up all the time tommy flowers of colossus fame was absolutely on top of this he'd done digital logic for early digital switching experiments in the 1930s and he knew all about this stuff two of his engineers who've written up in jack copeland's book gil haywood and harry fensome said tommy was always explaining to us every valve you can save is that much less power that much less heat to worry about if we use by quinn by what by quie by quinn we can save a hundred odd valves and buy quiet or buy winery base five two things five is magic for tony traffic because we're coping with five-hole paper tape that's one good thing about it the other good thing about it is you know from the valve circuits we design that if you're gonna count in far in binary you only need two voltages you can keep them miles apart that's easy five below ground potential five above 10 volts spam nothing is going to make -5 look like plus five right but the more we try to pack different levels in and we have to pack in 10 levels you know what happens these voltages drift you start getting the voltage representing a6 drifting a bit and it looks like a seven but he said my studies show that if we just use five voltages we can keep them stable enough that they don't get confused so he came up with this idea of biquinery basically two things linked in pairs the left-hand one did zero to four the right-hand one also did zero to four but knowing that it was on the right hand side actually represented five to nine he said we do that chaps we save i think it was a hundred and something valves and it's worth it because you've got to reflect the power consumption of colossus was six kilowatts you didn't want to go higher than that i mean i don't draw a comparison here to the data center video it's funny that it's kind of come full circle in a way absolutely you know sooner overcome the problems and like steve ferber's stuff you know with the arm chip being low power consumption great to do it but then people just want more of them anyway and you still need a data center you still need massive backup power supplies of your own and you need cheap electricity you could say that the great advantage of of that is that when you're not in a data center the low power demands and so on make these things possible there's no way i want that thing replicated using thermionic valve technology not even by tommy flowers i do not want third degree burns in my shirt thank you very much and much of the material i'm using here i'll give credit where it's due at long last this book by jack copeland is really good because it's talking about the colossus era
