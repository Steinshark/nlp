Apple just demolished the competition at least if you ignore the price not only is the Vision Pro looking basically revolutionary when it comes to headsets but the new M2 Ultra chip in the new Mac could be equally promising at least if it's raw size is any indication 24 core CPU 76 core GPU not to mention a 32 core neural engine I mean how on Earth are they accomplishing all of this in a single chip how have they managed to do this without the price for the Mac Pro skyrocketing and how are they justifying the apparent lack of support for add-in gpus and confirmed lack of support for memory upgrades oh yeah did I mention that it's not all good news naturally we've ordered one of each anyway so we're going to be giving you guys the full rundown once they arrive which is why I need this Segway to our sponsor the ridge Father's Day is coming up and ridge has you covered with one of their biggest sales of the year don't miss out on this opportunity to gift a unique and functional Ridge wallet or key case check them out at the link in the description and make Dad proud we're starting with the obvious eye catcher The Vision Pro is this the most technologically advanced piece of consumer Tech ever maybe it's basically a wearable computer and while Apple has been vague about a lot of things they never mentioned meta or The metaverse Once and they didn't really show off any VR games so we don't know if we can call it a VR headset what we do know is that it's Apple's first product capable of what they're calling spatial Computing wait isn't that just a fancy way to say augmented reality or ar yes yes it is and with the utterly mind-blowing price of 3 500 US Dollars Apple has got an uphill battle ahead of them justifying this thing but then again maybe you'd be a fool not to buy one according to Apple it can replace your TV your monitors and even your sound system that that is quite the claim but hold on to your keyboards haters because they might not be that far off the Mark at least if you live alone first up it contains Apple's first 3D camera for capturing spatial photos and videos dual driver audio pods that can use audio Ray tracing for spatial audio and outward display that reveals your eyes through the already impressive internal display which is a micro OLED with 23 million pixels what it also contains a ton of sensors to keep track of not only your eyes you can supposedly select icons and objects just by looking at them but your head your hands and your environment with precise tracking and real-time 3D mapping plus did I mention that you can look into the headset and have it scan your face into a digital person Ona looks like meta's cartoony avatars are even more DOA than they were already to do all of this apple needed both an onboard M2 processor that's running Computing related tasks through vision OS that's Apple's new AR operating system and they needed their new R1 chip which is dedicated to all the cameras sensors and microphones that make the headset work in virtually real time Apple's claiming that you're going to experience only 12 milliseconds of latency when using the device which if true would mean that the experience should feel basically instantaneous when they're boasting the ability to recreate the world around you in real time using lidar scanning and true depth cameras from the headset you're wearing while it supposedly runs cool and quiet man even at that price point and with the fact that you have to have a tether running to a pack I'm pretty blown away and while I still think it's worth noting that you can get a great computer and a monitor and even a basic VR headset for less than three grand considering the cost of Apple's other devices with M2 family chips it's actually kind of compelling to enthusiasts to might have bought an xdr Pro display anyway and it's doing all of this wirelessly with about two hours of battery life with support for hundreds of thousands of apps on day one insane almost as insane as the fact that we might be losing GPU support on the Mac desktop for good I mean don't worry they say the shiny new M2 Ultra chip has the power of seven afterburner cards so who would want an RTX 4090 anyway and besides you know you've got so many other things that you want to put in those seven pcie Gen 4 slots why a GPU I mean should we just be grateful that unlike the new Mac Studio it at least has pcie expansion maybe it also has a 24 core CPU that they claim runs nearly twice as fast as the previous gen 28 core Intel chip and support for up to eight displays all of which can stream 8K prores video now they haven't outright stated that there will be zero support for dedicated graphics cards but based on the lack of reference to them when directly talking about the versatility of pcie expansion and the fact that they acknowledged in the keynote very technical stuff like the fact that you are locked into the up to 192 gigs of memory that you configure right from the get-go no memory upgrades it's not looking great just like the price per usual the top spec machine is going to cost you an arm and a leg with all the bells and whistles so the better chip max memory and eight terabytes of storage you're looking at just under 12 000 which oh wait only a thousand bucks per month for a year well that's much better but then you tack on a display your add-in cards maybe wheels for the case and you're looking at even more than that even the base unit which does at least have respectable Hardware this time around starts at seven thousand bucks with that said the old Mac Pro started closer to six grand and could Skyrocket even higher if you kept adding memory so considering all the inflation we've seen over the past two years maybe it sounds pretty reasonable We're Not Gonna know for sure just how much better or worse it's going to be than having a few dedicated 40 90s but you can bet your butts that we're gonna figure that out once ours arrive so stay tuned and I guess we're gonna have to have some gaming comparisons too they pushed metal three support pretty heavily and even brought out hideo Kojima to help influence developers to please jump on board and start porting games to Mac they showed off their new game porting toolkit and you know what I Gotta Give Them credit I am all for this and hope that everyone using an Apple product can benefit from it I mean just because I'm a PC guy doesn't mean that I want to sit on my computer and laugh at the Apple plebs for not being able to run many games outside of Minecraft and The Sims this is a really good thing overall I'm glad to see apple treating gaming more seriously and I hope to see developers porting more and more games in the years to come especially if this new M2 Ultra GPU can push real FPS and it's not just Apple hyperbole now if you're not interested in a desktop that costs as much as a car or a house down payment they also announced the 15-inch MacBook Air and at just 11.5 millimeters thick with a no wedge design they're claiming it's not only the world's thinnest 15 inch laptop but also the world's best 15-inch laptop despite it not actually being available for another week it starts at thirteen hundred dollars which is a lot of money but only two hundred dollars more than the Third 18 inch has a display with support for a billion colors that reaches 500 nits of brightness supports a 1080p webcam and offers up to 18 hours of battery life huh that last Point quite a few folks here at LTT have actually switched to MacBooks just for their objectively Superior battery life and this seems like it's going to be well just more of a good thing and apple kept things rolling with a few OS updates for both Mac OS and iPad OS we were all waiting for the big announcement at the end and then they just kind of glossed over the usual iPad OS updates like lock screen customizability a new Notes app it's supposedly great for PDFs a new health app and last but not least the ability to set multiple timers at once we truly live in an Age of Wonders that's right Apple's finally giving the people what they want it just took three five maybe ten years no big deal as for Mac OS it looks like the new update Sonoma is getting a bunch of features that were already present on iOS and iPad OS like screensavers and widgets you'll also no longer have to say hey first you can just say her name which feels a little rude considering that our future AI overlords may remember the way we treated them we talked a little bit about how Safari is the world's fastest browser and we'll be getting profiles like we've already had with Google Chrome for a while now it's got a weird Apple refuses to admit when someone else comes up with a good idea then they just wait a few years implement it and then don't mention the competition at all kind of like how I've gone through this whole video without mentioning our sponsor secret
