previously on coffeezilla this case isn't an ordinary one for all the crypto you've been talking about lately you've overlooked the biggest fraud of all what do you mean have you ever heard of a coin called tether no seriously what do you know about tether that wasn't rhetorical oh sorry i was trying to be cool well stop it it's cringe okay okay um wait what was the question again never mind i'll just tell you imagine for a second you had a money printer a real one so basically the government correct but imagine it's not controlled by a centralized government imagined it's owned offshore unaudited unaccountable that's impossible no one would ever accept that currency tether is that money printer only a few days ago one billion dollars worth of tether was printed out of thin air before that a billion more it's in circulation today i think i need another drink sorry explain this from the beginning how does tether work no problem but you're gonna need a lot more than one drink oh oh man what happened last night i need some coffee oh no no okay come on stephen what time is it oh boy all right we gotta gotta make this video already uh come on remember why you do this okay okay come on we can do this we can do this hey guys welcome to hey guys welcome to come on come on stephen got a video to make okay hey guys welcome to a special episode inside of the 10 million dollar studio today we have a very special episode if my head would stop pounding for a second sorry you wouldn't believe the night i had even if i told you but none of that matters okay look because i got to get this video out after all i always remind myself why i do this for the fans so today we need to talk about tether tether is suspicious maybe it's not fully backed they're creating more out of thin air and then using that to buy and accumulate bitcoin because there is no transparency in tether that's the problem is they were issuing tether in whenever it was needed out of thin air it was not backed by dollars there might be a fair amount of gambling mentality coming into that trust tether is a cryptocurrency that well the best i can explain it is either deeply misunderstood or the biggest fraud in the world in this video i want to lay out evidence and let you decide for yourself is tether a fraud legally i can't say that it is you know but if it is and that is a big juicy legally compliant if it's about to be bigger than bernie madoff for context bernie madoff's victims lost 64.8 billion dollars the current value of tether is 62 billion and at its current rate of growth it climbs a billion dollars every four days by the time you're watching this the value of tether will be more than madoff ever had in investor funds now if it's not fraud and that is possible this video will be about bureaucratic incompetence and lies now maybe this is the first time you're hearing of tether or stable coins and you're thinking i don't hold any tether so i don't have to worry about this video right i'll just hold bitcoin but here's the problem even if you're not invested in tether you are exposed to the fallout of a tether crash whether you realize it or not see tether is the backbone of liquidity in the crypto market it's one of the main ways people buy cryptocurrencies and it's the largest crypto by trading volume even bigger than bitcoin so if tether disappears overnight all that liquidity disappears and the price of crypto could come crashing down all crypto not just tether so that's my quick soft pitch for why tether is important and why you should sit here and listen to what is probably going to be a very long video which at times will feel like the accompanying audio book to this image all right before we get started i want to do some real quick housekeeping and address some criticisms right off the bat this video will be labeled unfortunately as fud by most of the crypto world this is an acronym crypto fans use to dismiss criticism it means fear uncertainty and doubt but the way crypto influencers use it you'd think it was more like an enchanting spell to keep the mean old bear market away here's how the average crypto youtuber will respond when you show them this video but there's also more fun the latest fun i should say i'm gonna dress the fun i think it's just fun and also why i think uh we should ignore it it's all fud all the time bad fud i do not like that fud i do not agree with that fud i will ignore that fud look you don't have to agree with my opinions on tether or conclude that it's a fraud in this video as i said i'm happy if you decide either way all i ask is you keep an open mind and watch the whole video before deciding you were right all along number two this video is not attacking crypto as a whole i'm still invested in multiple tokens and i plan to stay that way it's because i'm invested in crypto for the long haul and i think in the five to ten year time horizon this won't matter if it does matter well we're all going die together boys i mean that's all i can say but that said i do think it matters in the short term i think tether matters a whole lot and the bigger tether is allowed to grow unchecked the greater risk they pose to the crypto ecosystem as a whole all right with those things out of the way let me explain tether as fast as i can okay so first things first what is tether first we should distinguish that tether limited is the company that produces tether coins tether coins or simply tethers are what is known as a stable coin in crypto they call it a stable coin because that's exactly what it's supposed to be stable one usdt for example is always supposed to be worth exactly one dollar stable get it now technically stable coins can be pegged to anything you can have a stable coin for a euro you can have a stable coin for gold you can have a stable coin for anything and stable coins are useful for a lot of reasons they let you get around regulation easier you can keep us cash on foreign crypto exchanges and many other fancy things but back when tether was created in 2014 it was the first of its kind early on this was tether's number one claim every tether is always backed one to one by traditional currency held in our reserves so one usdt is equivalent to one usd and how it was supposed to work in theory was that you would give tether one dollar and they'd minch you one tether you could then go spin that tether on crypto or whatever you wanted and if you ever wanted to redeem that tether you could go back to tether limited the company give them your tether and they'd give back to you your one dollar and then they'd burn that tether token so it doesn't exist anymore thus maintaining the exact balance of money in tethers reserves to the number of tethers that have been issued in theory that's how it's supposed to work here comes the first sign of trouble see people started to notice that actually in tether's terms of service heather doesn't actually have to redeem anything if they don't want to it's literally in writing right here tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of tether tokens then again if you didn't believe me even more specifically tether reserves the right to redeem tether tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities in other words if you decide you don't want these tethers anymore and want them redeemed by tether as was always intended they do not have to give you your money back but look look look i can hear you guys already i'm sure you're saying look this is just fud just fun ignore it everything's fine as long as the money's there right thank goodness tether is a transparent company that publishes their reserves daily only wait a minute this section has been changed see going to the wayback machine back in 2017 tether promised that their reserve holdings are published daily and are subject to frequent professional audits whoops it's actually been half a decade and there hasn't been a single audit so i guess the boys decided it was better to scrub that from the website real quick and change it but don't worry guys some of the executives at tether are willing to assure us that there's no cause for alarm the money's there i agree that could be handled better but um i can all i can say is that money's there i promise you that money's there we promise you that i'm sure that's the thing crypto fans love to hear you know the same people who made their rallying cry don't trust verify yeah i'm sure promises are basically the same thing right but don't blame tether it's not their fault see if you keep playing that call we were just listening to you'll hear the real reason for the lack of an audit and you know we're constantly looking for solutions to to make that more transparent it's not that easy you know there's so much negativity surrounding it that nobody nobody wants to touch it auditors don't want to work with us other people it's just i don't know what quite what to say about it i mean it's like heisenberg's uncertainty principle everybody looking at it actually affects the system that's right if you look too close at their funds they may just vanish heisenberg's uncertainty principle maybe it's more like madoff's uncertainty principle but according to tether that really is the reason they haven't been audited in six years it's that securing an audit from a top auditor is difficult they simply can't find one but that actually isn't true the truth is they actually had an auditor someone ready to do an audit someone named friedman llp but in 2018 tether bailed in the middle of the audit complaining that friedman was being too and i'm quoting here excruciatingly detailed um yes you heard me right the reason an offshore digital dollar printer can't get an audit is not because they couldn't find one it's because the auditor that actually agreed to it was asking for too much information sorry guys no audit today too busy changing the financial system look audits are too time-consuming according to tether but don't worry even though tether doesn't have to redeem your crypto bucks and even though they've never been audited despite saying they would be it's actually the least of your worries see you should get really concerned when another shady company enters the picture with ties to tether that company is bitfinex and i know what you're thinking another stupid name that's confusing and i get it writing the script it's kind of like trying to explain the plot of a christopher nolan movie and not the good one just bear with me okay bitfinex is a crypto exchange like coinbase and early on it was the most popular crypto exchange where people could buy and sell cryptocurrencies pretty soon people got pretty suspicious of the ties of tether and bitfinex bitfinex was the first and main exchange where tethers were traded for a long time so people began thinking if let's just say somehow the largest crypto exchange and larger stablecoin were somehow in bed together that'd be kind of bad because after all an exchange could collude with that stablecoin to get to a place where they're basically infinitely printing tethers using those tethers to go buy bitcoin on the exchange they own and it'd always be worth a dollar on that exchange use them to back those tethers or convert it to usd and then you just never redeem the tethers huge pile of cash from absolutely nowhere crypto certainly wouldn't be new to such a complicated scheme mount gox and quadriga cx were both crypto exchanges that use their ownership to profit and ultimately rip off a lot of people they both eventually went bust so people were understandably concerned and they asked directly are bitfinex and tether owned by the same people and of course bitfinex and tether replied with the tried and true strategy of everyone who has nothing to hide they lied here's chief strategy officer phil potter denying this saying the tether and bifidex i just banked at the same bank so people that people that are confused right now basically tether is phoenix right uh no it's not but we bank with the same banks ah this has to be the worst excuse of all time oh we just we bank at the same banks no relation we just see each other in line with drawing huge sums of cash no we just say hi to each other across across little cubicles it's ridiculous look fast forward to 2017 of course the truth comes out after the paradise papers are released you know those like major league of offshore shell company documents it turns out one of the companies leaked in that was tether and it was revealed that in fact bitfinex and tether weren't just in bed together they were owned by the same people that's right phil potter and juan carlos divisini both had their names on tethers incorporation and here's phil potter later revising his lie we bifidax are majority owners of a bit of tether this is true but tether is a completely segregated entity um dollars are all there isn't it so funny that he always has to reassure people hey dollars are there now at this point i think it's becoming obvious that the owners of bitfinex and tether aren't exactly your typical executives so i'd like to introduce you guys to exactly who's behind these two companies which are basically the same company they're owned by the same people because at its heart this is really a story about trust can tether or bitfidex be trusted we've already established multiple lies but now let's look at the background of these individuals i contacted a man named bennett tomlin for this he investigates fraud full time and is currently writing an entire book about tether i asked him to break down the background of these individuals and here's what he told me bitfinex was founded in uh 2013 by rafael nicolet by day was a help desk technician and by night spent his time looking on bitcoin talk for ponzi schemes he could participate in famously he lost a bunch of his bitcoin in the trend in shavers ponzi scheme which was later brought down by the department of justice and then he tried to start his own high-yield lending program where people could lend him their bitcoins and he would use what he called arbitrage to earn them a guaranteed two percent per week on their bitcoins after people were not interested in giving their money to a ponzi schemer he decided to start bitfinex he was later joined at biffin x by juan carlo de vacini currently the chief financial officer for both bitfinex and tether who previously was a software pirate he got in trouble for selling pirated microsoft uh software and that was a lot of money wasn't it like that he got in trouble for no it was a relatively small amount uh it it's a currency conversion factor makes it seem bigger than it was it was like i want to say it was like 18 million lira which at the time converted to i wanna say like a hundred thousand usd so it's a relatively small fine for that yeah and so then they were later joined by uh phil potter who for a long time was the chief strategy officer of bitfinex he came from the new york financial scene he was once profiled in a new york times piece where he bragged about his wealth and how much money he was making and very shortly after that he lost his position at morgan stanley and then tether was started by initially a different cast of characters led by brock pierce brock pierce was a famous child actor who starred in films like the mighty ducks he's more known for fleeing to spain with indicted child sexual predator mark collins rector where both of them ended up getting arrested in a house full of child pornography he started initially realcoin which became tether along with a couple of other people who he had previously worked with including jonathan yantis who helped him at ige which was a company that started surrounding farming mmo items so they would hire out people in various countries to earn these items and then would sell them secondary market yeah and then realcoin was bought out by bitfinex and became tether and when it was incorporated had basically the same executive team as bitfinex what can you tell us about paulo who later joined the team apollo is a little bit interesting because he doesn't have the same kind of past that some of these other characters do him and his wife claudia who is the chief operating officer for bitfinex both joined in i want to say 2015 they both had a previous history as fintech developers and as far as i can tell they seem to be competent fintech developers uh the most interesting thing to me about paulo is one that it's him and his wife working together for bitranex and tether and two that so there was a document leaked that at one point bitfinex leaked that showed that paolo was one of the directors for dell chain which is the it's a cryptocurrency focused offshoot of deltek bank which is where tether now banks and so it seems that paolo might be connected pretty deeply to tethers bank tell me about stu hogner their general counsel so yeah stuart hogner is the general counsel for bitfinex and tether he has a history in cryptocurrency and also in online gambling he was the director of compliance at excapa which was a online poker company most known for being the parent company for ultimate vet ultimate bet got in trouble because they were giving some of their players a god mode that allowed them to see the other poker's players cards which would obviously be an advantage if you're trying to play poker so that happened uh well stu was the director of compliance for excapa and then shortly thereafter he left this is all shocking because these are the people sort of facilitating the currency that is the backbone of crypto um it's like the leading liquidity provider and what you're telling me is these are not savory individuals for the most part that's exactly what i'm telling you this is starting to look bad huh but don't worry it gets way worse around 2017 okay people began criticizing tether sort of seriously for the first time and it started with someone named bitfinext on twitter bitfinex has been by far the most vocal critic of tether and i interviewed him to ask him what made him first suspect something was wrong starting in late march 2017 i noticed unusual trading on bitfinex that seemed to match the trading that i saw on mount gox when mount gox lost banking i was alert but had nothing concrete about their banking situation until april the 5th 2017 when bitfinex attempted to sue wells fargo their lawsuit indicated that they bitfinex and tether had no banking at all and despite this tether continued to issue tens of millions of dollars of tether despite bitfenix and tether being unable to receive transfers i suspected fraud and started my twitter account now in response to this criticism tether panicked and even though they would never end up getting an audit they decide to release a third party attestation to show that they really had funds in reserve to back up their tethers 400 million tethers in fact but real quick note an attestation is not an audit an audit is a detailed forensic look of your accounts and attestation can be as simple as a peek into your bank account to see that the money's there for a very short amount of time this is what that attestation looked like now at the time many saw this as proof that tether was in fact backed it sure looked like they had 400 million dollars in the bank and everyone in crypto also had good reason to want to believe this as well everybody was making money to put it frankly after all the more money tether printed the higher bitcoins price would rise so it was in everyone's interest who held bitcoin or crypto for that matter to keep the gravy train going the only problem was with this attestation it turns out that some funny business was going on see it was found out later in a new york attorney general investigation that something very shady had happened tether had convinced their third party to conduct his attestation or snapshot on a very specific day september 15 2017 with noble bank on september 14th the day before that happened tether didn't have an account with noble bank on the day of the snapshot or at the station tether opened a bank account where they supposedly had reserves all along and bit fedex the other company which they have nothing to do with transferred 382 million dollars into that account that night the attestation was done and everything appeared in order but no one knew that the funds supposedly backing tether arrived there that day suspiciously the price of bitcoin also suddenly fell by around 40 to 50 in the two weeks prior leading some to believe that someone was selling bucket loads of bitcoin the price recovered immediately after the attestation and was the largest four hours of buying in bitcoin's history on the same day don't forget that only minutes ago phil potter claimed that tether and bitfinex were completely separate entities but tether is a completely segregated entity dollars are all there but now we find that they're actually co-mingling funds but even this ruse didn't save bitfenix and tether completely they may have warded off public opinion for a little while but their critics were growing louder than ever the friedman attestation was worthless and i called it as such at the time but a big shadow loomed over the project that not even their critics could have seen coming you see around this time bitfinex and tether were having banking issues it wasn't uncommon for crypto companies to have trouble finding banks to work with after all some of the users of cryptocurrencies especially early on were quite sketchy so banks didn't want to get involved nonetheless if you're a crypto company you need a bank to receive wire deposits so bitfinex decides to start relying on something called crypto capital now this company probably deserves its own video crypto capital but suffice to say they worked with a lot of let's call it um needy clients you know people who couldn't go anywhere else besides a sketchy non-bank to bank with people who needed their money moved without anyone knowing where it was from i mean i just say it like money laundering basically to put it into perspective for the types of people crypto capital were working with the colombian drug cartel were later implicated with crypto capital so we're talking some seriously sketchy uh business partners here but look bitfinex is desperate they need banking so they start working with them depositing hundreds of millions of their clients funds with them and for a while things were going great and smoothly but this time it would prove that bitfinex and tether were the ones who would be duped because they trusted somebody see the feds were onto crypto capital after an illegal escort website called backpage was busted guess who was implicated well you guessed it crypto capital and when the feds came knocking everyone's funds got seized i mean we're talking the shell account funds the ones holding bitfinex's clients money reports say that at this point bitfinex had 850 million dollars frozen in this giant international money laundering case and i mean this is huge according to internal documents in june 2018 bitfinex told their point of contact at crypto capital that over 80 of client funds were controlled by crypto capital translation that's it we're insolvent if we can't get access to those funds that we deposited with crypto capital we don't have the money so bitfinex is even more desperate than ever they can't find a solution they're about to blow up just like so many crypto exchanges have done in the past i mean after all there's no way to magically patch an 850 million dollar hole in your balance sheet right absolutely wrong suddenly bitfinex realizes they have something no one else has ever had in their position a flying lamborg no i'm just kidding they have a money printer and this money printer also has massive private reserves so rather than go bankrupt bitfinex instead takes 400 million dollars from tethers reserves and suddenly they can meet withdrawals and not go out of business they basically bailed themselves out is what i'm trying to tell you right now and meanwhile even though they're still short tons of cash they proceed to lie to the public and issue a statement saying bitfinex is not solvent and a constant stream of medium articles claiming otherwise is not going to change this now again they are insolvent they don't have the money but are we really surprised that they're lying yet again meanwhile they're still trying to fight the bad press of all of this and so they decide they need another attestation to show that their reserves are solid to do this they get another bank sorry i know it's like a rotating cast of banks just go with me this one's called deltek okay funny enough one of the executives is actually the creator of inspector gadget which is totally random and weird but at this point i could probably tell you anything and you'd believe me in this story because it's so insane but anyways they get this at the station from deltek and once again they get back up to their old trick see on november 1st 2018 tether had deltek give a public announcement that affirmed that tether now had a balance of 1.8 billion dollars in reserve they had grown a lot by then still making them backed one-to-one however after dell tech confirms this november 2nd tether pays bitfinex 475 million dollars you know to help plug the hole that's still in bitfinex's balance sheet and kind of make them whole again of course it naturally follows if you just took 500 million dollars from one company and handed over to this one tethers not backed the next day after they claimed that they were back of course they lied because it's these guys right so shady but of course nobody could have possibly known that at the time and we actually didn't find this out until the new york attorney general's office released their investigation this means that what bitfinex and tether set out to do succeeded which is deceiving their customers to buy more time this means unequivocally at least on november 2nd and who knows for how much longer tether was unbacked by us dollars and around this time interestingly tether decided that maybe it was time to move the goal posts again so what did they do well around 2019 yet again tether's website suddenly changed without warning after spending five years claiming to be a hundred percent backed by usd they change it to this every tether token is a hundred percent backed by our reserves not by us dollars which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and from time to time may include other assets and receivables from loans made by tether to third parties which may include affiliated entities collectively reserves every tether token is also one to one peg to the dollar so they're saying it's still pegged to the dollar now we don't really know why though because they can basically loan an insolvent parent company or co company money as much as they want to bail them out so what exactly is receivable if that company goes under it's a disaster but look look i i don't want to bog you down in explaining to you how completely insane that is uh it's pretty obvious the much more obvious question i think we can all ask ourselves now is who in their right mind would trust this company at this point tether and bitfinex owned by the same company have repeatedly lied omitted and misled people and we've only done a basic history of what's happened so far 2021 hasn't been much better for them either the new york attorney general's office investigated tether for two years and as a part of a settlement they were fined millions of dollars banned from new york and the attorney general couldn't be more clear they say bitfinex recklessly and unlawfully covered up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines tethers claims that its virtual currency was but fully backed by us dollars at all times was a lie which wow that's i mean that's quite the statement so i bet you're asking yourself tether finally fessed up right like that that must be it that must be where this story ends but you'd be right in a normal world but this is crazy land right instead tether decides that to pretend basically this was all good news and in yet another lie but this time from their uh general counsel stu hogner they said that the ag's office made no negative findings whatsoever the tethers were not fully backed that is completely wrong literally the new york attorney general said tethers claims that it was fully backed was a lie stu hoechner the general counsel says oh they never found anything made no negative findings that tethers were not fully backed uh so look tether and biff and x even when caught lie by the new york attorney general still lie about what even that says now of course manny might declare any kind of settlement for tether at all a win i mean at least they were shut down and everything fell apart right so that that might be true to some extent but don't forget if this is a complicated fraud scheme it wouldn't be unprecedented for regulators to fail to shut it down for a long time remember this guy bernie madoff himself was discovered early on by independent researchers but the sec investigated and cleared him multiple times before the fraud unraveled but regardless of what you think about whether tether is guilty or innocent here one thing is clear tether's money printer is running at an all-time high at the beginning of this year there were 20 billion tether in circulation right now there's 62 billion they've printed 42 billion tether in like six months and are all those tethers backed is tether unbacked well i don't want to say too much right i'll let you decide i have my opinions on it but either way this story clearly isn't finished now the last revelation we need to talk about in this whole debacle has to be the infamous pie chart tether released revealing their reserves breakdown for the first time previously they had hidden what their tethers were backed by after they left the dollar standard but because of the new york attorney general's settlement agreement they had to publish this they were forced to other people have done full breakdowns of what all this means but the big headline here is that tether has according to them huge amounts of what they call um commercial paper 49 of their total reserves to be precise real quick by the way i know the number you're seeing says 65 for commercial paper but that's a breakdown of the cash or cash equivalents which only makes up 75 percent of tethers reserves so in tether's total reserves commercial paper makes up a total of 49 which is 75 of 65 i know the way they presented it is confusing so i just wanted to clarify what is commercial paper says everyone in the room uh well it's unsecured debt it's debt that if they default on it you don't have collateral so in theory i believe commercial paper is supposed to be only lint to like a rated um institutions like you're you're going to give it to like apple or microsoft or you know someone you can trust to not fail because your debt is unpacked but who is tether giving that money to we simply have no idea 49 of 60 billion dollars which is roughly um way more than any human can ever spend theoretically tether could almost lend anyone unsecured debt get an iou and according to them that tether would be backed meanwhile how much actual cash on hand does tether have just about three percent pretty incredible for a company that claimed only a short while ago that it was uh always one-to-one back by traditional currency held in our reserves now every tether is backed one to .03 by traditional currency held in its reserves but now that you're up to speed on tether and their history maybe it's time to stop talking about the past and instead talk about the future and its implications and this comes to the opinion part these are my thoughts okay so this is not fact here two things seem true to me tether leadership often lie and have a long history of being shady the second thing is that tethers absolutely massive it has passed and how much money they're actually holding not only that according to the financial times tethers commercial paper holdings immediately place it as quote one of the world's largest investors in the u.s commercial paper market rubbing shoulders with the likes of fund managers vanguard and blackrock and dwarfing the investments of tech giants like google and apple another quote further down the article is even more alarming quote until last week we really hadn't heard of them said a trader at a large bank it was news to us to put tethers absurd size in another way that illustrates how weird this is they are currently the biggest company in the world in terms of assets per employee in the world by far according to linkedin tether has 13 employees but 62 billion under management that's almost 5 billion per employee literally it is the biggest fintech company in existence right now tether is huge which leads to an kind of obvious conclusion if it's fraud big if it's going to be really really really really really bad how bad i mean it's hard to know crypto influencers mostly you know the fud ones uh try to very hard to paint a rosy picture pointing out that even if tethers 100 on back tether is only worth 60 billion compared to the entire crypto market which is like 2 trillion and they would say you just kind of take 260 billion out of 2 trillion it's not that much however due to tethers special role in the market i'm not sure i agree tethers collapse isn't just about 60 billion winking out of existence because tether is the number one medium of exchange for people to get in and out of crypto which means when that liquidity suddenly disappears it's gonna be a lot worse than people think will bitcoin and crypto survive yeah probably will it be pretty will it be just 60 billion dollars probably not now of course there are alternate timelines to consider as well you know maybe tether never collapses maybe after years of incompetence lies in deceit they righted the ship they're changed people only time will tell but just don't say i didn't warn you well did you tell them i tried to what now now we wait [Music] please wake up and smell the coffee
