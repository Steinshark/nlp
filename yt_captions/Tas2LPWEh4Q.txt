welcome to the stoah the stoah is a digital campfire where equal hear and dialogue about what matters most at the night's edge what's happening now [Music] so check-ins yeah I'm excited just sort of like a calm excitement so welcome to the stoah I'm Peter Lindbergh Stewart of the stoah stoah is a place for us to go here and dialogue about what matters most at the knife's edge of this moment and today we are lucky to have my buddy Jonathan pujo join us at the stoma jonathan is a professional artist writer and public speaker who gives workshops and conferences all around North America and he carves Eastern Orthodox icons and other traditional Christian images and his excellent YouTube series called the symbolic world that explores symbols and images that are floating around in our culture so today Jonathan's going to talk about the ecstasy of 20/20 and he's gonna share his kind of thoughts about what's happening all the craziness that's happening in the world and then we're gonna have a discussion so anytime Jonathan's talking if you have a question that comes along I've just write in the chat box and when we get to the Q&A portion I will call on you and you can answer your ask your question to Jonathan and if you want me to read it on your behalf because this is will be on YouTube just indicate that in the chat and then I will do so so that being said I will unmute you Jonathan and hand it over to you all right it's nice to meet everybody I'm happy to be for the first time on the stove I've been hearing a lot of great things and you know I've been following Peter kind of from afar I think I was on his podcast awhile ago and obviously read some I was writing as I'm sure most of you have very very astute person so I'm happy to kind of be in this little inner clique that he's developed to talk about meaning and problems with meaning and just the madness of the situation and so as everybody as everybody probably saw yesterday well you two days ago actually two days ago on the 4th of July Kanye West announced that he was going to run for president of the United States and it's just very interesting because in January I think I was in January early 2020 I went or I late 2019 I forget when Konya put out his album I actually started talking about Kanye West quite a bit I did three videos on him and it was actually the strange moment where that there was a Newsweek article written about my take on Kanye West for some reason and it just plays in everything nicely plays into what is happening and my contention for the past few years is that we are in we're at the end of something you know you can see it how big as big as you want to see it you know whether it's the end of Western civilization whether it's the end of one cycle of Western civilization the end of the Enlightenment the end I don't know when a for sure there's some there are many images which are showing us that we're at the end of something and the the breakdown in meaning the breakdown in unity the and then also the inversions the fact that things keep flipping on one side and the other is a sign that we are you know can you imagine like a wheel that's turning and as it turns if you can imagine the wheel gets bigger and bigger and bigger or you know the bigger it gets at some point the wheel is gonna start to wobble and is going to start to to lose its coherence and that seems to be the point where we're in and in the ancient the ancients had a vision of the world every culture had the same vision that where they saw themselves as that's a center or an identity of some kind and then as you moved out from that identity you had progressively stranger and stranger people obviously more people who were more appeared stranger to you because they were more different from you and then as you moved out and out you reach the monsters which were you know these things that didn't you how you didn't have name names for the things that appeared to you as an unknown and then the further you went and you reached the edge of the world where you would see what appear to you as upside down behavior the Greeks of course had the the Amazons were the ultimate example for the Greeks because the Greeks were extremely let's say male-dominated and so they had this image of something at the edge of the world described at the edge of the world was the opposite of them and which was female dominated female the the women were warriors and the men were barely around or barely important in that society and so that that that type of inversion can play put many roles like it doesn't necessarily have to take on one form it can take on many forms but it it has its image in the the vision of the world like this kind of cosmic vision but it also appears in our society as well in terms of a fringe element of our society and I've used the carnival as the ultimate example where the carnival aesthetic seems to embody mostly this fringe you know the the idea of turning faster and faster the notion of the freakshow that note all these images of the carnival the clown the the acrobatics the whole idea of turning and turning and turning and so I the fact that things are so unstable is that's when we're starting to see these these elements come into play now the problem with the the breakdown is that there are also movements to try to clamp down and those two end up happening at the same time and the danger that we that we fall into is to want to take one side or the other we seem to think that we need to decide which side were on either we're on the side of those who want to break down the world or on the side of those who want to clamp things down and kind of hold on for dear life you know and and create extreme versions of identity and extreme versions of of holding in and so we're gonna see that it's gonna it's gonna get worse I just want to warn you it's gonna get a lot worse but we've started to see this kind of playing out and 2020 so when I made that video was when I made that video about Kanye West in 2019 or early 2020 I told everybody I said hold hold on for 2020 because it's gonna be crazy but I have to admit that I didn't expect so much to be happening in so little time but at the same time I'm not completely surprised and so what we're seeing is we're seeing this test of identity now people don't realize how a disease or how the pandemic was a test of identity or was a question of identity I think maybe people can now start to perceive it as they might have perceived how people's let's say even their alignment in terms of what they would do for the pandemic ended up being more on political lines rather than anything else you know because the facts are so fluid and they keep coming at it from all these directions people ended up taking taking political lines for medical in with medical and medical veneer let's say but the reason why it's such a question of identity is because there's an analogy and it's a scary analogy but there is an analogy between the person and the the body politic there's an analogy between a human being and a society and so just like and and you you can try to break that analogy down but it you it were made to experience that analogy and what ended up happening with the pandemic was ended up being a question of walls it ended up being a question of where do you put the walls and that was as we've been discussing that you know you had Donald Trump saying build the wall and then you Justin Trudeau saying diversity is our strength it's like these two opposites like one is build a wall the other is no identity you know just identity no identity this this insane type of rhetoric that we could see coming up on both sides of the political aisle well the pandemic put that right into your body and it made it it linked the whole meaning crisis into our bodies and so the question became where do we put the wall how hard do we make the wall and is the wall where is the value of the wall right and so because you could have said well do we close down borders for countries do we close down borders hierarchically in terms of we see where the breakouts are and then we shut down walls in different places or do we shut down walls all the way down to the individual and we separate everybody from each other and so that is if you want to understand a lot of the debate that was happening that was part of the large debate that was going on now the one that ended up winning seems to have been the one where we separate everybody from each other and we create as little as little fragmented bits as possible and we shut down everything now shutting down everything is is interesting because the things we shut down are a lot of the things that people use to let's say to manifest their their communal aspect you know obviously we shut down meetings we shut down churches we shut down stores we also shut down sports sports is a huge deal and it's bigger than a lot of people think because the there is a certain type of person which really needs to identify which really need to identify to have an enemy and to have some kind of fight and sports is is actually a great way to channel that so that you will actually then you avoid conflict because you give people the possibility of saying this is my team I love my team those that other team we're gonna beat them you know and so it's a it's a it's a less dangerous way of fun obviously you can get out of control we can see that in in England with the hooligans and stuff but it's the less dangerous way to funnel identity and conflict then let's say a social conflict but we took that away we took that away from everybody and so everybody was just in their home separated from each other completely apart and then something happened now it could have been other things but the thing that happened made sense in terms of the obviously the political narrative that has been that has been prevalent in universities that have been prevalent in in society in general this idea of a kind of neutral kind of a kind of rule of the margin you could say and so we identified someone we watched him get murdered and that's really when's the last time you watched someone actually get murdered we don't watch people get murdered we swatch it on TV we watch movies but most of the time those images are taken away from us like most of the time we're not permitted by media or whatever and for some good reason to watch someone be killed but for some reason this this video became extremely available for everybody to watch a man be murdered during eight minutes and then then there was a catharsis explosion because what happened in that murder what happened in that murder is exactly a catharsis it's exactly a classical catharsis because what we were asked to do especially the white people like especially the the especially the Westerners were asked to identify with the victim like obviously you want to identify with the victim because you you see this man suffer and you're like I this is unbearable I can't stand watching someone be tortured to death and it's driving you crazy but then you're also asked to identify with the killer and you're supposed to do that at the same time you're supposed to both identify with the person who's murdered and identify with the killer and the the I'll give you an example of another place where that happens it's in the story of Christ that's another place where that happens where you're supposed to both identify with Christ being killed but you're also supposed to identify with those who killed Christ and so it was exactly a catharsis and it led to a a ecstatic explosion it led to an ecstasy and then people rushed into the streets to protest to commune to commune in the name of this cathartic moment to commune in the shadow of this and all the images we saw the chanting the kneeling the the there were some crazier images in that there people being whipped there were people washing the feet of others there were all these religious expressions of of communion in the name of this cathartic moment and in the name of of inclusivity you could say I don't know how to name the value you could call it inclusivity something like that and there and then there was scapegoating it's just inevitable there was scapegoating in the sent and it's weird scapegoating because if you look at how the event played through like if you're trying to stay cool it was hard to stay cool during that time but if you looked at how the event played out you could see that everybody agreed that this was horrible everybody I don't think I ever I don't think I saw anybody who thought it was not horrible I mean I saw I saw that the man was arrested that the other people were put on I think they might have been arrested - I don't even know but I know they were for sure fired and then everybody denounced it every conservative every liberal every politician at every level denounced it then every corporation denounced it I received emails from every single corporation that exists you know denouncing what happened and but for somehow some reason there was still this idea that we all of these people everybody basically who hated what to see this happen were the resistance and we're that we're that we're the resistance to the evil system and we need to find those that are responsible for the evil system and because they're the system then we can purge them and we're totally justified in purging them because we are the victims and if we're the victims and the culprit then even better reason to now find those who are more responsible than us and purge them from the system and so it was it was just a classical scapegoating and it was a weird scapegoating - because it was kind of like it was like it's always like this these weird these like shadowy figures that we never hear names of it's like this evil system with like evil white supremacists that are managing it but it's like who are these people I mean I guess Donald Trump is one of the people who is kind of seen as the the one to two point you but in general he was like a very much a kind of weird scapegoating and so it really did lead to a pseudo religious event and I and and one of and the final marker of the pseudo religious event is the human sacrifice the human sacrifice is the clincher which makes it a religious event so and you have to you have to see the human sacrifice within the narrative of the people who are operating the sacrifice so it's not even about being objective or whatever or the so certain group of people or as people on a certain side or people in this certain side of the political aisle said that you cannot go outside you're not allowed to commune you're not allowed to get together with others you're not allowed to to meet if you do that you are killing your grandmother you are killing people if you come together and then they said you should come together not because you're not killing people but because we are subjecting this to a higher value this is a higher value protesting racism is higher it is the ultimate value under which we are ready to sacrifice all other values underneath it and we are also willing to sacrifice people and of course it's worth it conscious no one said we're doing human sacrifice but the pattern of human sacrifice was exactly being played out in their own narrative and so that is why everything looks so weird and so religious because it it played it followed a very religious pattern now of course it's it's a frightening it's a little frightening in terms of pattern because it's not clear how it's going to play out it's not clear how the catharsis is completely resolved I'm not sure how it's resolved in the story in the story of Christ there is a capacity for resolution right there's a capacity for forgiveness there's a capacity to come into full communion with each other I don't know if in this religious moment there's really a capacity for absolution if there is I haven't seen it yet like I haven't seen the capacity for absolution and so it is a little frightening to watch this happen and so it's gonna continue it's gonna continue because it this year is way for it's far from being over there's still an election and now you have this fool character Kanye West who really does play the role of a of a fool who is now tossed in the game so what he so he's the real trump card way more than Donald Trump he is way more a trump card than Trump and so and then and it's funny because people are saying he's there just to steal the votes from Biden but I don't know he might be there to steal the votes from Trump because he is he who knows because people he is presenting himself as like a conservative Christian who's married to Kim Kardashian I just want you guys to realize how insane the situation is and so he's he's he's flying under the banner of a conservative Christian but obviously you know I don't know he's doing an album with dr. Dre and he is and he's hanging out with Kim car - and he's married to Kim Kardashian and so who knows whose votes he's gonna take I don't know but for sure like there's gonna be some more madness in this year coming along so I wish I could offer solutions to what we're seeing but right now a basic like and just look and and watch with my jaw like just fall in and and hope for the best cool ready for some yes sure yeah so we already had some questions in the chatbox just throw your questions for Jonathan I'm gonna warm him up with a few so if you should recall when this whole cool good thing came online there was this meme that said the virus broke woke and it's sort of like it was quiet you know the the woke stuff for a bit and then just boom crashed online is like whoa broke the virus and it was almost felt like the virus will have a superordinate goal that we could kind of like instrument fly like you know rally behind together but then didn't happen and I really liked your frame with the higher-value thing and it seems like you're you're kind of like what is it inclusion but it seems like anti racism is this just one value and so is that are we rolling behind right now what's the media and that's not just anti racism it's very important to realize that black lives matter and black lives matter very quickly put on a very very large black trans live matters black lives matter the organization is not just about black lives matter it is about it is about the diversity equity inclusion that's what it is and that's why they made they hurried up to put out a a black trans live matter because they wanted to signal that it is about inclusion and it is not just about not just about racism there's that there's a there's a bigger aspect to this thing that is not just it's not only captured by racism mm-hmm so what I was gonna say is it is it a positive value like inclusion or is it like a negative value like you know not this like anti racism or something and you think it's more of a inclusion positive value that's that's being gestured in this ecstasy well it's inclusion inclusion is not a positive value necessarily it can be positive and it can be negative and it's like every it's like everything everything in excess is is dangerous and so absolute inclusion not one of us one of the things that I've been trying to explain or hope people understand is the role of the margin and what marginality is and it's let's say the power of the margin the function of the map margin and the dangers of the margin now one of the dangers with the inclusivity proposition that is being presented is that we want to include everything equally in an equal measure and so what we want is we want the exception to be equal to the rule and that doesn't work that type of inclusion will break the system it'll break everything because in order to in order to take something marginal and try to make it equal to the rule the only way to do it is to flip to make it upside down is to emphasize the margin is to make the margin the rule it's the only way to do it because naturally it just it just doesn't it's there are things in the world which are just naturally marginal that are just that are just freaky that are just things that happen once in a while that are that are and and they have a power which is useful in the world like they're they're useful for a society that we have these that we have the freak shows that we have the the things that are that are strange on the on the edges but if you try to make so here okay so let me phrase it in a way let me phrase it in a way that is that is easy to understand but is scary in its implications and so you have a country right and this country has a limit right and then on the outside of that country then you have everything that is strange all the strangers all the foreigners now they're innumerable and they have they have multiple identities there they have an indefinite amount of identities because the outside is always bigger than the inside and so what happens when you want to make the stranger more important than that which is inside or if you want the stranger to be equally included on the inside as the inside then you it things get loopy very fast because you end up having you'd end up hat because the then one who's inside has a natural has a natural advantage on the inside because they're on the inside they're part of the group the part of the identity doesn't matter which which type could be a knitting club or it could be a soccer club or it could be a country or a sadly it can also be things like a race or things like a religion it can be all kinds of things now if you want now to include everything you have to do it in a way too you have to prioritize that which is outside because that which is an aside inside naturally has advantage so you end up prioritizing that which is outside and then things get crazy loopy things start because then what is this thing it's all gonna fall apart it's an it's inevitably gonna fall apart I always kind of joke like if you have a knitting group and then and then there's like you know I don't know like Betty has a friend in her knitting group who comes to the knitting group but she doesn't really knit right she's just there to hang out or maybe to talk to the others cuz she likes people and that's totally fine but then what if you you want her to be equal to all the other members of the knitting group it's gonna get really complicated cuz then she said well I don't want to knit I want to do something else like I want to play play bowling or something so it's like okay well once in a while we'll have a bowling event because we want to include you in the group but then at some point it's gonna start to break down you know anyways that that's that's the problem of the of the that can be that's the danger of equal inclusion it just you just can't just can't work in terms of a system hmm so we're gonna pivot to some questions a lot of good questions popping up but ask one more this Konya have a chance to win yeah I can't I don't say my goodness there anything's possible right now anything is possible I don't know what I to be honest for all my love of Kanye West like I've followed Kanye West since 2000 since his first album 2004 I think and I love his music and I think he's a fascinating person but I hope he doesn't win but anything's possible at this point Kim Kardashian First Lady the stores gonna wait to see who it endorses for 2020 so this whole tight it might be easy the rain you had a question as related to Kanye actually maybe we can double click on that one yeah well I'd be curious maybe others are more aware than I am I I don't spend a lot of time on social media I haven't followed Kanye I just hear indirectly about him I also didn't watch your videos so if there is other interest in the group I was just curious if you wanted to summarize any of your analysis and just say anything else about what role Kanye's playing and everything that's happening so so my so my contention in general about the fool is that the fool is the one who's who turns things you know so the image of the clown is perfect he's on the ball he's rolling a ball he's juggling and so the fool is the one who turns things and so when when things are going well with the fool tee it tends to do is to turn things upside down right to show the upside down to something so the king is all pompous and is is is extremely proud of himself and so the king will lift up the his skirt and will point to the thing that's hidden right he'll point to the to the to the hidden things which are in the shadows let's say and so the clown is always kind of turning things right and he's emphasizing excess caricature all of that now the problem is that when the world is upside down then what's the role of the clown when everything is already topsy-turvy what does the clown do well the clown keeps turning the clown will turn things and so what I've been trying to point out is that when the world is is upside down watch the fools because the fools are the ones who are actually going to turn things right-side up who are going to turn things back towards order and so I saw that ready in Kanye a long time ago in 2004 he did this song called Jesus walks which was a really strange song because it's a song about about street life and hustling and all these things but then he's he he talks about how jesus walks with the lowest basically so he's saying you know he's talking about he needs to go do a drug deal and he's gonna leave his mom to do a drug deal and he says I hope that Jesus walks with me and so he's connecting like the highest thing with the lowest okay um so I was really keen watching him since then and now he he basically became like a conservative Christian he had a conversion experience and he's now he's all like pro family pro he's he's all about he's become super conservative and he's not the first one for who that happens I've been watching certain characters in in in the past few years one of the examples I give is Gavin McGinnis who obviously he's been really really kind of thrown around in the media but as a character he was interesting because he found advice news and he was he was a he was a punk he was a punk pervert all this stuff and all of us at some point it's like the whole world became like him what does a punk do in the whole world is punk rock and so he actually he's like I can't stand this and then he started to point back to the to the to normalcy got married had kids became a Knights of Columbus you know started wearing buttoned up shirts and it's like he was just it's like the when when the the world is exceptional the exceptional points back to the rule it happens very naturally and so Kanye I think that that's what Kanye is doing so if you look at his tweet it's crazy because he says we need I forget the exact wording but it's like we need to follow God and to find our unifying principle or whatever and that's why I'm running for president of the United States that's Kanye West who's writing that like you know the guy the guy who would dress up in a big teddy bear suit that guy that guy is saying we need to go back to God and find our unified prints of and so that's what I mean when I talk about the fool kind of watching the fool at the end because the fool is the one who's going to bring back to bring back order I mean whether you agree with the order he brings back or not the finding the point to watch it as a phenomena is to just see it happen like Kanye West is more conservative than Donald Trump that's how weird this world is help I understand a little bit what I was talking about Jeff any follow-up questions ring no thank you Jacob you had a question it's my mic working yeah hi Jonathan so my question is to do with what what is the relationship between the the current movement and the Christian substrate in the kind of unconscious layer and just one more piece I want to attack on to this is if we're kind of stepping back to like the mid 19th century around like Nietzsche and if this movement has kind of Marxist foundations and what's the relationship between the Marxist foundations and Christianity as well with Marxism kind of coming out of the same substrate so any what I would I've tried to point to is that the modern world is basically the breakdown of Christianity and so I mean it's there historically that's what it is you know it's the the rise of scientific atheism there are the rise of just a basic cultural atheism you could say or secularism and so what happens in that what happens in that breakdown of Christianity is that Christianity starts to pull apart and so certain aspects of Christianity start to manifest disorder in a disordered manner and so there is an aspect of Christianity which is an mentioned to the little one right attention to the poor and a desire for a form of I would say it that way I would say attention to the poor attention to the margin-right Christ goes out finds the lost sheep yeah there's all these images in Christian Christianity obviously just the Beatitudes are a lot about that and so that value in itself is good but it's it's dangerous if it's just taking taken on its own it's very dangerous and that's what I think one of the aspects of Marxism is it's that it's it's a it's it's a desire for what we know it's like it's a utopian desire it's a desire for a certain aspect of utopia and their their vision of utopia is a kind of equality utopia and then there are other utopias and we saw them in the 20th century which are hierarchical utopias and so those two are gonna are that those two are what led to World War two a hierarchical utopia and an ending in egalitarian utopia and we're gonna see it happen again because we never dealt with it and it's the same movements it's just hilarious it's not funny but it's hilarious because you you want to you go you go online and look for an T for images from the 1920s in Germany to be surprised that that's one of the one of the things that led to the to to where Germany ended up was the very same questions that we're dealing with now and people are really struggling because there's a desire for a secular utopia and so the idea in the religious context is that if the highest thing is the highest thing so I say it's like I say the highest thing is the infinite or the highest thing is being or the highest thing is love right being loved infinite then it's not a are you in terms of morality I did something beyond the value in terms of morality morality will flow out of it but but it's not an absolute it's not it's not a value and so what we're seeing now is exactly that it's and so that there is definitely the BLM is definitely Marxist like the founders are Marxists their desires are extremely Marxist in their formulations and they're using I don't know how conscious it is but they're definitely used using kind of religious imagery to get people on board and to get people excited about about their project and so I don't but there is no there is no happy ending to this to that story like this there is no happy ending to what - what DLM is asking for it can't end well so relatedly Amy you had a question yeah thunderstorm here I hope you hear me yes I got a question about the kind of I would have been noticing about this kind of there's a relationship I see between text and image in the pseudo religious moment and I was wondering and that there's a schedule calls for iconoclasm to destroy images in the form statues and also to worship certain new text white fragility like the best-selling focus in the United States right now so I wonder if you have any thoughts about that yeah well one of it when I talk about the end of something one of the images of the end is the is iconoclasm that is when something breaks down you you want to break down the memory of it because you'd the image I often give is if you if you buy a house and you when you move into the house you find that people have left pictures of their family there the first thing you're going to do is you're going to remove the pictures of the people's family so that you can settle in now that has normal implications but it also has very our implications if you play it out in terms of social social questions now one of the things that happening now it's not that we're it's not like a switch of house but it's actually people who are trying to break down the identity of the family break down the identity of those that have held the house until now and so when you see iconoclasm it's that it's definitely a it's a transition it's it's a transition towards other statues it's a transition for you to put then other ideals up there for people to to venerate so and some of the stuff that they're pulling down maybe should be pull down it's possible like there's some you know there's there's some dark stuff in the us-south maybe I don't know you know it's not I'm not it's not it's not my thing I'm Canadian I'm french-canadian I have other markers you know there are people there are like there are people here there's Kuna been here in Canada and there are statues of him and there are some dark aspects to his story but to be honest I don't think it would be a good idea to pull down his statue because he did found you know large swaths of the North here but there are dark aspects and so one of the way that I framed it too is the the idea of hiding the nakedness of your father and so in the world of all identities are no identity is perfect all identities are broken because they're not they're not let's say they're not God right and so all identities have a broken is to them and so in order in order for them to hold together one of the things you have to do is you have to hide their nakedness and I take that from the story in the Bible where Noah the father the new father right so there's a flood everything's destroyed now there's no way he's gonna be the father of everybody else right the whole world is going to be is gonna be related to Noah and then he gets drunk and he passes out naked in his tent and one of his sons sees him naked and makes fun of him because he's naked and then he's cursed because of that now his other sons go in and they hide his nakedness they cover his nakedness okay so you have to understand it as in order to preserve an identity you have to to a certain extent hide the nakedness of your father the the problem is always knowing when is it too much like when are you hiding too much but everybody does it right imagine you have a basketball team and your star player has some negative aspects to them well you don't want to be publicly telling everybody about the bad habits of your star basketball player because you won't you don't want your basketball team to be dismantled and you don't want to lose and it's the same for any team any church any school any group and so we need to hide the nakedness of our father but at some point and so at some point you have to stop if it's too much right because we saw too much of it like all the priests abusing children and then people covering up for them all the coaches and using children all that kind of stuff is when you do it too much now the problem is that if you hide the nakedness of your father it's still there the scandal is hidden but it's still there and at some point at in the end it's going to appear it's going to show itself the system is going to play itself out the weakness of the system that you hid at the beginning is going to be its downfall at the end and it's going to be what the aunt that your enemies used to destroy and it's just inevitable it's just gonna happen that way and so America has sins in its origin it has hidden sins and the hidden sin is that that which they declared which is equality fraternity freedom in their founding they hid a sin which is that it wasn't true for everything that they infants in saying that they also hid their own sins and now they're coming out and they have been coming out but it's it's hard it's hard to avoid that happening at some point now I don't know when it's supposed to happen but it's a hard for that to not to not happen but it and we have to be careful not to point fingers because this what I'm telling you is true of every system and it's true of every family and it's true of every any organization has hidden sins it's just part of a system okay so we have a lot of questions we're gonna get all of them but we've got Dominic you got a question Thanks hi Jonathan hey can you point us the stories in anticipation of the inclusion or exclusion of those who don't choose the side of either the breakdown on the clampdown if I can find those that don't choose either/or it usually ends up in the stories usually don't look they don't look very pretty they don't end up in a so okay I'll give you I'll give you an example where both sides are shown next to each other okay so it's in the story of Exodus in the story of Exodus the Israelites leave Egypt and when they leave Egypt they gather all the rabble with them so it's basically you can imagine that as these slight as these Israelite slaves are being freed and are leaving Israel a bunch of people are like well I'm getting it on this and so they like gathered a whole bunch of mixed people and who knows like who they were but just a bunch of people and so they come into the desert and then the the Israelites complained that they don't have what they need they complain they complain and then at some point they complain too much it doesn't matter for what idea is that they complain too much and it says in Scripture that it's the mixed multitude that complained too much and you can understand why that would happen because if you're if you don't feel like this is yours like if you don't feel you're part of a group then you have it's easier to complain because you're not covered by the advantages of the group as much you have less cover from the advantages so it's easier for you to complain and it's more it's normal that you'll be the one who complains the longest who're complains the most right and then in Scripture what happens is God ends up giving them what they're complain about but he purges the edge of the camp and so there's a / like a fire that burns the edge of the camp okay and that's some scary stuff man I told you it's scary stuff now right after that story like the chapter right after that story there's a there's a balance to it which is that Moses is married to an Ethiopian witch like in let's say in ancient thinking the Ethiopian was like the ultimate foreigner right we don't even know exactly who what actual people they were referring to but it was like referring to those people really that live like on the edge of the world like they're so far we don't know exactly like they're very far and so he was married to an Ethiopian woman and yeah the idea is that she was dark like she was dark-skinned you can see it in the story that she was dark-skinned because Moses his sister complains about the fact that he's married to a foreigner and Mary Trini Theo Pia and then because of that she gets a disease which is that she becomes too white her skin becomes white like snow and because she becomes white like snow she has to be excluded from the group and she has to be cast out of the of the camp because of that so you can see the two problems like you could call it an excess of mixture and an excess of purity and those two things happening you know one after the other and almost being like like a call upon each other because you can imagine that after the mixed multitude problem the reason why Miriam was complaining was because what we just had this mixed multitude problem now Moses is married to a stranger so it's like it's one led to the other and I would say that in terms of what's going on right now we need to be attentive to that especially because things don't ever go just in one direction they're gonna go in one direction and then they're gonna snap back like when Nazi when Hitler was elected in Germany they were on the verge of a communist revolution it didn't just happen like a gingered just happened when everything was fine it's like you pull the pendulum here it gets pulled in the other way and it's hard to know which way is gonna win like it could have been the other way maybe the calm maybe Hitler could have failed in his coup and then the Communists could have taken over and and and Germany could have ended up you know sending people to the Gullah like who knows but that's the problems that one calls the other so I hope that story is at least one example of those two extremes and of appearing in the story maybe great you had a question that we could to piggyback on this one yeah hi Jonathan thanks so much for being here um my question was about um I I don't know what your perception is but my perception is that most people in secular society don't really understand secular society to be like broken up watered-down Christian commitments and I was just wondering if you think that that sort of ignorance is like exacerbating this sort of dangers that these pseudo religious events pose for us all yeah I totally think so I think that that are they are the fact that we despise history and we don't know about history is really a call for all of this to to keep getting worse because we don't understand what's happening everybody is moving from one side to the other and nobody nobody knows what's going on and so it's not so it ends up having a being a caricature of liturgical events a caricature of the surgical feast a caricature of of like the ancient celebrations that people used to have but no one knows what's happening and so the idea the idea is that these patterns like this is why I like for example like I'll call out someone like Steven Pinker which is that people are saying people are saying oh look at these these you can see it people some of the kind of atheist types you look at these events and they're like oh here again is a horrible manifestation of our religious tendency you know and so they decry it they're like oh this is horrible that we shouldn't this is just another example of this kind of horrible stuff but the problem is that it's not gonna go away because you say that you know those patterns are in you those patterns are part of you they're like the example I was used is you can complain that people sleep because they're not productive but they're still going to sleep you can say if you didn't sleep you would be more productive but it doesn't matter it still gonna happen the question is how does it happen does it happen half as early and chaotically and we end up scapegoating and sacrificing people and and like beating people in the street or do we have a ordered version which is what religion offers which is what you know which is what Christianity offered but other religions offer that as well give a place to funnel all those desires into a kind of dance where instead of actually killing each other or dancing together thank you so much hey Erin Rogerson you had a question I feel like that question was just kind of answered but you hi Jonathan you mentioned sports have sort of a healthy way of channeling tribalism in a way and I was saying does religion in some sense have the same effect and did religion evolved to combat chaos and are we returning to a pre religious time of collapse and chaos in some ways well I think religion what religion does is more complicated than that it's not about combating chaos it's about integrating it all together and so one of the things that I did I talked about it's like Christianity for example like Christianity is a religion where we look at someone who is nailed to a cross what the hell I mean it's not a just about breaking order it's about integrating the whole thing right it's about integrating the entire thing death to all the bad stuff to how do we integrate the whole thing how do we bring it all together and and you know as much the order and the light as the death and the darkness we have to be able to kind of bring it all together or else it's going to appear in in kind of other ways now this is why this is why the people who try to combat the chaos you know let's say the Enlightenment that's why they have a shadow that's why they have a speaker Pinker says a counter enlightenment it's just so hilarious as if you can avoid it like as if you could have just the Enlightenment and not have the counter enlightenment that's just not how it works that's not our systems work and so the counter enlightenment is just get stronger until it explodes and then we have insanity and we have crazy manifestations so so yeah so I think it I think religion offers more than just order it offers an integration but it can be tribalistic to like no doubt I don't want to pretend that it's not and it can have tribal it can become tribal and it can have extremely it can be dangerous of course you can but it's all about choosing do you think which one is the most is the least is the least going to destroy everything thank you all right so we read this on Stephens behalf how could the absolution play out in a culture that seems to believe that no one is redeemable cancel culture what are the alternatives I don't think I don't think that it can work I don't think it's gonna work I'm really look I hate to say this but it's the only way for it to work is scapegoating that's it that's the way for it to work and and it seems like we're already we're seeing a lot of that but it can escalate seriously escalated to the two minutes of hate I mean that's that's the only way out of it because the the only way for the like the white liberal to get out of their of their let's say guilt is to find someone who's more guilty than them and then turn around and scream at them right there's no other way and so that that will you know that will like pileup if you watch the the Cultural Revolution stuff like the Maoist stuff you want to see where this goes it's insane you'll have your people be dragged dragged out into public and publicly humiliated publicly I mean I don't know how far it can go in North America but it's it's it's scary stuff and with the alternative like the alternative is is confession the alternative is sacramentality the alternative is real community you know that's that that's the the that's the alternative like one of the roles that let's say like it for example I'm Orthodox like that's one of the roles that confession plays a confession is the way to to acquire absolution but it involves accepting a form of hierarchy so I do have almost at the top of the hour can I sneak in one more question yeah I'm totally fine I'm having fun so it's fine cool so yeah on the Orthodox piece see Viking like came in two questions here so one question is what do you think of our buddies Jon's religion without a religion or religion that's not a religion to however you phrase it and then the other one because I'm baptized as Orthodox Christian and then you were talking about um you know this this reversal of guys like Gavin McInnes or maybe 360 and kind of like Roush we were talking about take apart as that was a wild one he joined our our religion and then and there's out early you know this phenomenon the ortho bros you heard these these yeah that's this rising up um so yeah and so the what's the death of jonah and here's your thoughts of that and what is your thoughts into orthodox christian in the role that it could play and this is sort of like ecstasy yeah well I I think I don't obviously I don't agree I don't agree with with the religion that's not a religion I I think that I think that there are certain aspects of humanity which are inevitable and if you don't take them into account because you don't like them they're just gonna come back it doesn't matter you can't avoid it you can try but they're gonna come back and so and so I understand Ahn's fear like his fear of narrative for example like I understand his fear of narrative because because it can be exclusionary you know because it's identity because it does create identity and he creates exclusion so I understand his fear but there is no way around it there's no way around it it's going to come back and so so for example so like John John talks about how he doesn't want narrative but he does have a narrative right he spent 30 hours in his podcasts giving us the narrative of his religion without a religion which is the narrative of the breakdown of Christianity and the the rise of the Enlightenment and now reaching the end and now like another post enlightenment world so there is there is a narrative and there's something of the Tower of Babel in what he's trying to do which is the desire to create a tower that includes everything that doesn't have that doesn't have an outside and it just it's just not possible now the idea is to find a way to is to find a way to have an outside or to have a margin which has a role in which you can encounter and that you can engage with rather than just try to not have one or not have a narrative or just be the margin or just be it's like you need to have the whole you need to have the whole thing so I don't think I don't think I don't think that it can work I mean it can it work individually like to help people out yeah I think so I think so I mean I'm sure John has helped a lot of people and I've seen a lot of people really feel like he's helped them through the meeting crisis and everything and so so like I take anything that helps people get out of it is great I think it's wonderful so I agree but I I think that I think that as a let's say as a movement or as a kind of social thing let's say this way that's aid in evolutionary terms uh if you have something which is too general something which is specific is gonna come like a needle it's gonna burst your thing and that's it and that's the same so so if you don't want to have a narrative and you create this this kind of amorphous like emergent thing without a narrative then those that have a narrative are gonna come in and they're going to slash you to pieces and they're gonna take over your territory and it's just gonna happen yeah so has for orthodoxy look and what role get orthodoxy play I think like for me I can just talk for myself look guys I could just talked for myself like I feel like I felt like I feel like whis and Christianity lost the plot at some point that they lost the hire aspects the mystical aspects they lost the the kind of system of traditional of sacred language they lost they kind of lost it and so as our own system breaks down so now I talked about this idea of the of the foreign or that makes the mixed multitude or the thing on the margin so you actually need that stuff you need a little bit of it especially when the system is exhausted you actually have to go outside and get some fuel from the outside and so my sense is that orthodoxy is sufficiently strange but not too strange in order to to revivify some aspect of the West you know and so I think that it has a lot to offer and it has a lot a lot to offer people who who want to be Catholic or won't even want to remain Protestant or whatever I think that it can have a lot to offer because it has enough strangeness that it doesn't feel like the evil system that you want to fight and it had it has like that it has the the the appeal of the Orient you know that kind of that kind of cliche of like the golden turban wearing you know like that imagery that you saw you know pop up in romanticism like the east full of treasures it has enough of that but it also has enough connection that it's not completely odd like it's not completely off you're not just being an idiosyncrasy in society you know that's one of the things that I struggle with kind of that I call the California Buddhists is that it's so India Singh Craddock to be a Buddhist in America that I mean you can do it it's good it might help you but it's it's your beak you're still fragmenting thing it's still participating in the fragmentation by doing that so that's what I think that's one of the things I think orthodoxy can offer I don't that make sense mmm-hmm and it's a very very beautiful religion if you look into it just experience to go to church check it out do you think it's on the rise too exciting I noticed more people are talking about it oh it seems like it's hard because it's it's hard because we're all in our bubble but for sure in my perception I've had a lot of people interested and you know interested in the mysticism Christian just interested in Christian mysticism reading the Church Fathers I think that like I think that some of the key Saints some of the key think thoughts in orthodoxy offers really good solutions to the problems like I I really think st. Maximus the Confessor offers one of the best solutions to the problem of emergence of the of the relationship between consciousness and phenomena or the relationship between meaning and you know what kind of genre Vicki talks about the problems of relevance realization I think that st. Maximus offers the the most integrated solution both bottom-up and top-down approach at the same time so from the top you have name identity which kind of comes down and acts as an authority but from the bottom you also have the notion of the coming together of the elements so it's like the joining the fitting together in love happening at the bottom and then also the naming the head this image of the top so it's not just top down but it's also not just a kind of puzzling emergence where it's like okay you use that word but I don't know what you're like how does it come together you need those two to happen at the same time so we're past that hour do you want to sneak in one more question or should we end here it's up to you guys I'm attention yes so there's a good question so we'll ask this one he wanted they read it on his behalf as mojo and Peterson and I'm curious to get your download on that your thoughts on how Jordans doing if you watched his recent video with his daughter so with points by Jordan Peterson in yourself do you believe that the role of symbols and myths could be recognized and integrated in science as we know it today the sign inside room or does the boundaries of science have to be broken to accommodate symbols and myths so okay the way that that myth and and religious imagery is going to be integrated in the science is through the science of of the human being it's through looking back at the human being and not not ignoring the experience of consciousness right and as we look back on consciousness as we try to use caution is to look back on it then all of a sudden I think that that's the way that these that science can see the it won't be scientific right but it can see the the reason for these stories in these patterns and they and these myths and also understand that science itself is always submitted to purpose there's always a reason why you do things and once you when you ask what that reason is that's when you start to see these stories come back in and so it's not in the D it's not in the analysis it's not in the thing but it's the reason why you analyze which is subject to two mythological storytelling right it give you an example right so we developed the atom bomb but we we just develop an atom bomb we didn't just develop an atom bomb we were in a war and we had these enemies and there was a race who was gonna get the atom bomb first and so finally the Americans took some of the enemy scientists brought them to themselves and then created this atom bomb so that they could defeat the last remnants of the war and win the war without that story there's no atom bomb there is none why would you make an atom bomb you'd have to be pretty insane to make an atom bomb to be honest you need that narrative in order to to justify the research and so that it so I'm gave you an extreme example but it's like that for everything we always have a reason to study things yeah that's really really well put so I think we'll end here do you have any closing thoughts for us at the Stoller well thanks I I'm just happy to see people trying to figure things out and to ask the hard questions and to also be willing to talk about things without just letting ourselves be polarized try to see both sides try to understand at least the reason why the two sides appear let's say in debates and so so I appreciate it and I wish you all the best if you give any thoughts on unstow Susan actually because you know a lot of people say they're like proto Christians I'm not sure if you yeah how many thoughts I do have a thought on my thought on sources is that stoicism only works if it's integrated into Christianity for the same reason as what I'm talking about in terms of the religion without a religion I think stoicism offers great practice great advice great moral teaching but because it never offered a narrative then I think that it just it could win and that's why I didn't win and I think that once stoicism became integrated within the Christian story then that's when it actually took on its best fruits that's when and that's why when people look at early Christian saints and they say well that's just a stoic I'm like yeah I don't mind that I don't have a problem with that because but it's a he's a stoic because this is integrated into also a cosmic story and a social story and and and a communion a reason to commune and that's what makes that's what made the stoic that's what made stoicism flower in the Christian age so that's what I think of so this is right cool so thank you so much my friend for visiting the stoah we hope to have you back so I'll make a few announcements on upcoming events we have like tons so just go to the website to store that CA but there's two tonight
