alright guys welcome to a camera comparison between the brand-new Asus zenfone 6 on a 20 Pro and the WOM +7 Pro and right now I'm recording footage from each phone's front-facing camera so let me know you think the video quality as well as the audio quality to set the scene a little bit I'd call this the contest of the affordable flagships so first up we have the Asus zenfone 6 which up 499 pounds has been a bit of a hit with this rotating camera system we'll be comparing that with a new honor 20 Pro which at 549 has an impressive sounding quad camera setup and thirdly the 1 plus 7 pro which at 649 still undercuts most flagships and has a pretty great camera setup considering it okay so front camera video and because the Asus can use its rear camera as the front camera 2 it can record in 4k resolution compared to 1080p on the other two not to mention we're comparing that phone's main sensor to the small front facing sensors on the other two phones so dynamic range wise it is a mile ahead none of these ferns have optical image stabilization on the front so you get a pretty equivalent amount of shake when you're walking about there's a pretty similar disparity when it comes to taking selfies the highlights are much better controlled with the Asus well the other two phones seem to add a load of contrast to your mask the lack of dynamic range which is quite standard for front cameras the other benefit of the Asus here is that you can also use its ultra wide camera on the front and it's really wide all three can do portrait mode on the front but I did find that one pluses edge detection wasn't amazing versus the other two but is definitely crisper than the honor okay the playing field becomes much more level when we flip two rear cameras because whilst the zenfone has the same setup by the way the other two devices have far greater ones in fact all three have a pretty equivalent 48 megapixel primary camera all three have an ultra wide lens but only the one plus and the honor have a 3x telephoto lens and the honor goes one step further by also introducing a dedicated macro camera which I'll come to both the zenfone and the bomb plus can take 4k video at 60 frames per second and just generally if video is important to you then things are looking good for one plus the combination of its lens and color processing gives really great definition to the grass in this video clip although it does have a slight tendency to exaggerate the red hues as you can see here all three are pretty well stabilized though this clipper here is completely handheld if you wanted to zoom in honor really comes into its own the oneplus doesn't allow you to use its three times zoom lens in video and the zenfone doesn't have a zoom lens at all in a similar vein oneplus also doesn't allow you to use the ultra wide for video although this might be a feature that will come via software update also take note of how the zenfone ultra wide is just that bit wider than the honors for stabilization at 4k resolution even though the Asus has no oh is I'd say that either that phone or the oneplus does the best here it's really striking result all things considered of course this gets even better if we lower the resolution to 1080p and if anything I'd say the Asus outright takes it at this setting all three phones can record slow-motion footage at 240 frames per second and well one plus is miles ahead here the zenfone and oneplus can also take 480 frame per second slow motion whilst the honor can do short bursts of 960 although it is using software interpolation to achieve this so it's not quite as good as the real deal I also took these three devices out in night time which is where in theory the honor should really come into its own with its megabyte F 1.4 aperture if we zoom in on this bus over here you can see that on the honor you can quite easily distinguish the glowing text on the back and also what the colors do look great on the oneplus grain is definitely creeping in there's a similar story here all three look pretty good from a distance but when you crop in you'll see that this clock up top is most readable on the honor and that whilst the zenfone looks a little soft oneplus is noticeably noisy if we flip that asus camera around again it pulls ahead as you'd expect compared to the other two front cameras the Zen phone's rear is a little less fazed by that fading light the same is true for photos you're getting almost DSLR quality selfies here even at night time as that light dips further you can see that the honor is the most affected it's lost any kind of definition in my beard but just remember that for strength lies in its rear camera and when taking night mood photos it really does light things up you can see that whilst night shots from the Asus have a pretty realistically dark moody vibe the other to focus on brightening the results although I got to say oneplus is dynamic range in clarity really impressed me here with low-light photos we almost have the opposite result two low-light video oneplus is the cleanest sharpest camera one thing that the owner can do is use its telephoto lens while taking night mode photos although what it gains in the ability to losslessly zoom in it loses in the relative quality of this telephoto lens in low-light the honors crazy wide aperture only really comes into its own in super low-light conditions but when you do get there it is miles ahead at the other two it can see things where the aces and the oneplus and my own eyes are barely able to it also has a really bright flash whereas this looks like an area of relative weakness for Asus daytime photos and for all three phones I've turned HDR mode on although it's interesting to see how the three phones managed to make identical subjects look so different honor has a little more warmth which I think benefits most of these shots and the slight extra contrast brings out textures in surfaces like the floor I'm sitting on here but yeah the general takeaway here is that for simple daytime photography you can't go wrong with any of these three each also has a portrait mode but because the oneplus zooms in for portrait shots you have to step further back to take them the flip side of this is that if you did want to take really close-up portraits then on the other two phones you end up so close that you can almost distort the face plus one plus is colors here are really balanced alright so each phone has an ultra-wide as well and you can probably see the ASIS with its mega 125 degree lens so the phone can capture the most compared to the other two with one one seven in terms of dynamic range and they're all alright although all three lose a fair bit of quality when switching from the main camera whilst both the 20 Pro and the 7 Pro have three x telephoto lenses the asus has nothing so for capturing objects further away asus falls apart quite quickly oh yeah and another key advantage of the honor is it's dedicated to megapixel macro camera yes it's only two megapixels but it does mean you can get closer to subjects than almost any other phone out there and not to be overlooked detail so if we take some of the photos and crop in 15 times you can probably tell honor gets the most object texture because of its tendency towards contrast but oneplus has the cleanest looking shots overall if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
