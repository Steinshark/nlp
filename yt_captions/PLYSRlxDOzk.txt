ladies and gentlemen at the time of recording this video July 29 2023 Magnus Carlson is the best chess player in the world and he's widely regarded by many as the greatest chess player of all time so when Magnus Carlson teaches you something you really should internalize it and try to put it to good use which is the purpose of today's video I will be sharing with you the Magnus Carlson chess opening versus the Sicilian Defense and how I studied it I learned it from him and how I've used it to defeat Grand Masters Grandmaster is the highest title that you could achieve in chess so me beating four grand masters with a Magnus Carlson specialized opening is going to be quite a sight now the lore of this of Magnus Carlsen Sicilian Defense is when he played it in 2018 versus who is a Polish Grandmaster Magnus played Knight to C3 versus the Sicilian Defense and his opponent played Pawn here Magnus took and brought out his Queen early volunteering it for an attack then did this put his Bishop on this square and castled queenside in in general the point is to move the knight move the move the pawn here take take bring the queen back and go to battle and in that game Magnus did exactly that he played F3 a little bit later he created an attack on his opponent on this side of the board and he went on to win the game now I took his opening and I put it to good use I played four grand masters from all over the world and I'm going to share the results of the Magnus Carlson chess opening exactly the opening that he plays exactly against Grand Masters let's learn I played Pawn to D4 I was playing Grandmaster Tron Min from Vietnam he took my pawn and it's exactly the same position as Magnus had in that game right we go back to the opening that we just saw in his game against vaitashek it's the queen on D2 it's the exact same opening position so let's learn from how Magnus does it G6 was played in this game uh I put my Bishop on B2 my opponent played Knight F6 and we castled and I went here now the game plan here is black attacks you on the queen side you try to attack over here there are obviously some discrepancies sometimes black does it a certain way sometimes black plays a6b5 sometimes like moves the queen sometimes like the bishop right he played A5 there's multiple ways of meeting this move A5 trying to play A4 and open up the Rook even at the cost of a pawn uh the best move is Bishop to B5 but in this game it was Blitz I just fired back with A4 it's okay to move my Pawn in front of my king I'm not allowing my opponent any progress and now B5 is no longer a concern because I will just take it but many people react to this by firmly planting their Knight on the B4 square and basically saying look I'm going to attack you over here and I played okay no problem King to B1 sliding over getting off of this diagonal over here potentially covering some squares my opponent played Bishop E6 and Rook to C8 so he he he's brought his forces to the queen side now it's time for me to put my knight into the center of the board to potentially get rid of the bishop to relieve the pressure he goes Knight D7 looking to reroute his Knight into an attack and also open up the bishop but that night move Retreats and removes a little bit of Defense from the king so now it's my time to strike with Pawn to H4 this is exactly how Magnus drew it up this is the whole point of the Magnus Carlson Sicilian Newcastle Queen side your Bishop stays on this diagonal safeguarding the center and your queen side Knight and now Pawn to H4 if my opponent plays H5 unfortunately that doesn't stop much because G4 is very powerful he can take I have no plan to take back I'm just gonna go here and then if he takes it's gonna be bad news Rook H5 Queen G5 and it's just a monstrous attack and you see the eval there completely winning for white so it's very bad news if you play H5 but I got news for you it's also bad news if you allow H5 so the pawn is now knocking on the door I'm going to be taking on G6 and opening up my Rook uh my opponent put his Queen on B6 after spending 40 seconds look at his time usage 40 seconds spent and for good reason it's a very unpleasant position now at this point I can already begin the demolition but I was a little bit concerned with the queen here I figured also I haven't moved my Bishop so I block the Queen's vision and as you can see that was a bad move but it was only a bad move because of the ridiculous Knight to D3 cutting my communication with my knight and if I took he can take here and his attack is actually now equally strong it's very difficult for me to do anything he will happily trade off material with me uh and then he's going to bring his rook and I'm going to lose so I should not have played Bishop to B5 I should have kept my foot on the gas but it's a learning experience I should have taken and tried to attack him but I did this and he didn't realize how to strike so now I went for G4 the idea of Pawn to G4 is to join forces with my rook and bulldoze him on the H file Queen and Rook vs a bishop playing defense not going to be good enough he took I took rookie 8 take take and there's Queen H2 and there is absolutely nothing that black can do look up my time Advantage this is a three minute Blitz game a three minute Blitz game and on move 20 Queen H2 I have two minutes remaining and he has 37 seconds because his position is absolutely critical he cannot defend against the attack Pawn to H6 and now I could have galloped in with Knight D5 which attacks the queen but more importantly Bishop G7 he cannot go here my bishop and Knight defend and after this it's Queen H6 and it's game over in a couple of moves but I was a little bit nervous I was playing a grand master I decided Queen to D2 what am I famous for my friends I'm famous for one thing and I it's that and that one thing is sacrificing The Rook bulldozing the king's position trying to get my queen in there if he takes he declines but it doesn't matter The Rook drops back defending G5 F4 it's an avalanche my Rook is not just playing offense it's also playing defense and my opponent in this position ran out of steam everything is guarding everything else the night guards the pawn the pawn guards the night the knights got each other the bishop guards the night the regards the Knight and he ran out his theme in this position and in this game according to game review uh I had a very very nice performance and I did it purely because of the Magnus Carlson Sicilian played an 84 accurate game and I was estimated ELO 28.50 now you'll notice the Magnus Carlson Sicilian works against D6 but in this video I'm going to share with you that it doesn't just have to be D6 here's another game that I played against a Croatian Grandmaster and he played E6 the incredible thing is you can apply this to your repertoire everywhere you just have to play it slightly differently you cannot always play the same way for example here against Pawn to E6 it's better to do this it's actually better to block your Bishop because your Bishop is going to go here because you're trying to fight for the dark squares and if you go Queen D2 it's considered not as good because after Queen D2 the bishop is coming here right we don't want that so Queen to D3 A6 Bishop F4 so I play this in a slightly different way but it's still inspired by the Magnus Carlson Sicilian Knight to C3 Queen D4 and queen back he goes here I Castle he develops the bishop and it's a very it's a very very very complicated position we Castle on opposite sides what happened in the last game F3 G4 H4 more of the same here it is that is a declaration of hostility against my opponent I want to play H5 and play F3 G4 G5 he's gonna play here he's gonna play here it's gonna be very uncompromising stuff Queen A5 and now I could have just played H5 but I decided you know what he's a little bit congested there what's he gonna do with the bishop he dropped out of my position and my attack continued now very big decision he could play H6 but if he plays H6 I have many positions where I could potentially get to the G5 Square and trade that pawn so he decides he's not gonna play H6 he's gonna go here but a couple moves later I play H6 and now he's gonna have to weaken his position so he plays G6 but my friends Queen to G3 was not just an attack on the on the king look at this incredible geometry I teamed up with my Bishop to sneak in right there to go like this and Bishop C7 that is why you play on the dark squares that is why in the other Sicilian you put your Bishop here but in this Sicilian because of the opening setup and the Swiss cheese of dark squares Queen G3 infiltrates Bishop C7 and I don't have to Checkmate him but I win a rook for a bishop and now I'm winning after 15 moves against yet another grand master now the game's not over and you're gonna see in this game he fights back that's the nature of the game I played E5 I shoved this Knight backwards and I played F4 but that gave him time to play B5 and I talked about this already he's going to play B5 Rook for a bishop is a good advantage but your Rooks are end game pieces and right now this rook's presence is not felt this Bishop's presence is about to be felt so I played Knight A2 dropping out of the attack he played A5 and I played Rook H3 which was actually more of a defensive move because I'm trying to trade his Queen with no Queens I'm probably not going to get checkmated he goes back to E7 with no pieces on the board I'm probably not going to get checkmated he could have played Bishop to B6 first but he did it like this and I dropped back and I played King B1 and now I'm consolidating I've traded a couple of pieces the pawn here is a thorn his King is stuck in the back Rank and in all end games these pawns could be loose and this Pawn is an asset for me Rook is going to rotate over he tries to continue building up an attack but now the bishop infiltrates same exact bishop move by the way you'll remember in the last game I played Bishop to B5 to block some of the queen side we have the same exact Square same exact piece knight B3 and now A4 and I seal the position so now there is going to be no water getting into the position there's not going to be a flood in my roof or in my basement walls Knight to C4 I just go here the position is blocked and The Rook is now going to be felt Rook C1 C3 take and I'm gonna break through on the C file also this is a very nice position none of his pawns can move literally I've frozen the pawn structure which is a massive massive deal here very different type of game than last time but but a different flavor of the Magnus Sicilian Rook to C8 I played G4 because you never know if I'm gonna try to play F5 and now my opponent played Knight to E3 that was a rush decision 15 seconds on the clock he was hoping for Queen takes and queen to C2 but unfortunately uh I just took like this he took I'm completely defended Rook to C4 I could have even probably taken but I force a queen trade and after 35 moves and the infiltration threatened Rook C7 he resigned none of his pieces were able to get active and he didn't move any of his pawns since I played H6 so you'll notice in this game he managed to develop his pieces came back I did this and he never moved those pawns again I locked the position I outmaneuvered I plugged the attack with Knight C1 Bishop B5 Knight B3 A4 and I won on the dark squares and with the infiltration early Queen to G3 and Bishop to C7 very different type of Magnus opening but right it's not exactly the Magnus Sicilian but it just shows you how despite the different variation and the different ideas it's a similar type of starting idea from the opening and there's more here's a game that I played against another person this person closed their account okay this person closed their account they decided to uh to to to log off after this game was played I actually have a clip of this game somewhere um this was a very different type of game in this game my opponent played Knight C6 so I wasn't able to play Pawn to D4 this is just a slightly different version but now we play Bishop to B5 okay we can't play against E6 and D6 but now we played Bishop B5 and I've had games where opponents play like this and I take and then I play against the double pawns I trade off my light squared Bishop I play D3 I've also won a couple of nice games like that but none against 28 2900 level Grand Masters um so I decided to include this game because right my opponent went here Knight F3 they kicked out my Bishop and this was a very very very crazy game uh my opponent got really hostile with me early with Pawn to B5 that's not a very common move but neither is Bishop C4 going back to D3 is a little bit more common so you get out of the way here in this game I decided to attack my opponent's Rook and Rook A7 and here I went a little bit crazy uh this is not recommended I I I do not condone my actions in this game but it was still fun to sometimes be very aggressive in the opening I played Knight takes D4 Pawn takes D4 and rather than retreating I played Bishop takes F7 check now um what I had calculated here was King takes Queen check his king is not gonna go up he's gonna block I'm gonna give another check and then I'm gonna take the pawn attacking that rook and that Rook all of that is right everything he takes I give a check if he walks up it's mate if he walks up it's Maiden two I just sent him back to F6 but if he goes here I play Queen D5 track now he's gonna block because he doesn't want to go here and get four right everything I said was correct he goes here I go here now it's a fork what I had failed to realize during the game was I actually cannot take that Rook so I I miscalculated I thought he would move his rook and then takes and everything but he can actually trap my Queen by defending his rook and if I take he can go here and suddenly this is a huge threat because I can't take his Queen because it moved so I would have to play this bishop G7 counter-attack the queen he would go here I would take attacking the queen he would go here and now my queen is trapped so I didn't see that I I I saw enough but guess what he didn't see it either so I took his Rook so from a Magnus Sicilian I sacked my Bishop lured his King out checked him again and forked his Rooks but I failed to realize that despite everything I calculated being correct my queen is going to get trapped and uh and we don't like that very much so uh but he also didn't see played Knight F6 I castled and now I'm simply winning after 12 moves because of the favorite opening right I'm playing the Magnus Sicilian looking for Pawn to D4 if I don't get it I do it in a very non-compromising way he could take my Bishop I'll take and then I'll play Pawn to D4 but the way my opponent did it it allowed me to create this ridiculous board geometry and swoop in for a rook Castle quickly and now it's just about converting the position so I've got to take the center and I've got to develop all my pieces and I have to simplify he played Rook 2 f8 trying to Castle by hand and get the king to safety I played Pawn to D3 and just like in the game that I that I just played right look at how the patterns overlap dark squares dark squares what do I do bring out my Bishop because I'm ready to go Bishop C7 and Bishop D6 the same middle game Concepts apply in multiple games he plays D5 I played this is a very nasty move to deal with he attacks my queen and I centralize and my opponent just resigned in this position plus three but decided to resign because there's a lot of pressure you can't escape there's pressure here I'm gonna play A4 on the next move there's just absolutely nothing you can do absolutely nothing you can do I'm gonna play Pawn to A4 and rather than even proceed with the game my opponent realized my Bishop's dead these pieces are gonna get traded F4 F5 A4 takes rookie one rookie three Rook F3 too much 17 moves white wins with this other variation remember I told you there's gonna be a fourth game well there is I played yet another grand master uh Pawn to E4 Pawn to C5 It's a grand master from Lithuania this is uh very strong 2850 level uh I played Knight C3 we've seen D6 we've seen E6 we've seen Knight C6 I've people have played G6 against me uh Asics it's very not also very uncompromising Sicilian this is one of the nicest games I played in this video uh obviously the very first game that I played the pure Magnus Sicilian with this and getting all of these ideas on the board F3 like this was a fantastic game I was very proud of this game but this was also a very nice game it was a title Tuesday game and again we do the exact same thing okay now against this one in particular okay against this one we put our Queen here can we play Queen to D2 and play it like a Magnus Sicilian yes there are slight differences though slight differences black never played D6 so black could play E6 you see and remember I told you how here E6 Queen D2 is bad it all overlaps you learn from one game you you go oh he never committed his d-pawn so I'm going to put my queen here and now this is the idea when he plays Pawn to G6 okay trying to go here I'm gonna fight his Bishop on this diagonal not the Magnus Carlson Sicilian way but like this bishop D2 castles Knight to D5 and Bishop C3 you have to understand the different ways of playing against the different setups okay so in this video we've covered everything we've covered D6 we've covered where to drop back the queen against E6 we cover where to drop back the queen against Knight C6 we cover Bishop to B5 and sometimes you take if they go here you play Knight F3 and you try to develop and then versus the A6 Sicilian this is what you do Bishop C3 and the general idea here is that you are happy to make trades for example blackened Castle uh You'll Play something like King to B1 or Bishop to E2 and try to play for H4 but you don't mind making some trades here and then you try to create some sort of attack now in the game my opponent took my knight hitting my queen I took with a pawn if Bishop takes that's obviously very bad for the position over there my opponent played Knight E5 if I play this it looks like I'm winning the Knight but I'm not he attacks me here I come back and uh he can always go here or take and try to block so I did this now his Knight can't go to G4 and now I'm gonna go here okay castled I kicked out his Knight he did this and I removed the bishop so now my opponent's king has no Defenders so what do I do G4 pure exact game plan that I have tried to implement in every single one of these games every single one of these games I have Castle queenside I've tried my except except uh this one where I castled kingside but it was a very different position so my opponent plays Knight F6 okay now what do I do Knight F3 Bishop D3 King B1 I decide I'm gonna go G5 because the Knight cannot actually stop me because I will go here I'm going to strip the defense away and play 92 Knight G3 and just keep going so my opponent realizes that and has to go here I got news for you that's not stopping my attack he hasn't made any progress I played G4 he could have he probably should have played faster on the queen side but he went here now he's pushed back and here comes HP she can't stop me the attack is roaring forward Pawn to H4 now if he tries to play something like H5 of course I gotta take I cannot allow myself to be blockaded the something like this would be a disaster I have no attack now I mean I'm still trying and maybe I'll maybe I'll get there in the end but if he plays H5 or H6 I'm gonna take he plays F6 I'm gonna try to get in on the light scores I'm gonna play H5 right so what does he do Bishop G4 yeah that stops me from playing H5 but what's my new Target very simple move Bishop P2 what's he gonna do right so in this position he plays Queen D7 his Queen is coming to defend the king the queen is not equipped to play defense the queen should not be playing defense I can take now I'll just go here you could take guess what I'm gonna do move my knight move my Rook the queen should not be playing defense because both my Rooks and my pawns are just coming straight down the board my king is safe and sound over here in the vacation home nothing to be done let's go back what do I do I can take I should play H5 he never stopped my attack same exact thing as in this game in game number one I played H5 and I'm just knocking on the door just knocking on the door anybody home H5 right so what's what's he do what does he do if he goes here he's gonna lose a lot of protection over here and I can play F5 in the future so he decides it's time to create a counter attack it's too late I take my attack is way faster he has to acknowledge me now my Rook is taking away all the squares now I give a check why do I give a check Now options for black to hear on password I win the queen F6 I take and I keep attacking King goes to f8 I infiltrate on h8 or H7 King f8 Rook H7 is vicious so what does he play F6 what do I do I don't rush Knight F3 why this is weak I'm bringing my rook and the best part about the reason why the attack works for white is because he has no counter play at all times during my attack I'm thinking can he do anything to me no no no no so what does he do runs with his King which piece have I not moved yet my Rook I'm threatening this my knight is going to come in Rook G4 Rook H4 all of this good stuff yeah look at him he's creating some counter play Rook C2 so what do I do pawn to C3 that's the end of the counter play he's out of options Knight H4 Pawn takes Rook H7 Rook h8 Bishop to D3 to remove the bishop he plays here I take to open up my second rook and now it's just about breaking down the defenses Knight to H4 he goes here and I play Bishop to F3 now technically the computer found something more violent but it doesn't matter I take on G6 take take Queen here very simple and straightforward Rook to G1 Rook the G1 was not the best move he could have deflected my Rook away according to the computer I should have played a rook Gigi one but he resigned in this position because he didn't see a way to defend his Knight he plays Knight E7 Queen F6 Rook F6 It All Leads to Checkmate in two moves ladder mate in the center of the board a completely ridiculous attack look at conducted from start to finish from the opening we put our Bishop on D2 correct gameplay put the knight in the center trade off for the dark squared Bishop like this prevent his knight from moving forward and the second we had a chance G4 G5 H4 remove the bishop push the pawn take give a check develop bring the Rook defend against the threat chop it down hit the bishop in the pawn defend against the bishop Knight to G6 just a full on Avalanche and this happened in multiple games the same thing over here prevent my opponent from getting what he wants centralized by Knight H4 H5 stop the attack G4 chop it down Queen H2 sack The Rook infiltrating this is all coming from the Magnus Carlson Sicilian and this was kind of a master class well I would like to call it one maybe you have other opinions of how to learn chess openings from the greats Magnus Carlson in particular taught me how to play this I studied some of his games and I did my own research I I analyzed some games from from other Grandmasters that have tried to play it versus certain setups and now with E4 C5 Knight C3 and Ponte Ponto D4 I'm winning something like 65 70 of my games which is a crazy crazy score line so I have been dominating ever since studying the Magnus Carlson Sicilian and this approach applies to any opening that you'd like to learn that some famous grand Masters play you could be the French defense the benoni nimso Indian it could be classical games it could be modern games this was the Magnus Carlson Sicilian this was how Magnus taught me how to play an opening and I'm happy I could share it for you with you I'll see you in the next video get out of here
