okay so you might remember last month that we took a good long look at the iphone 12 and 12 pro but the iphone 12 family is a little bigger than that so welcome to the absolutely minute iphone 12 mini and the colossal iphone 12 pro max the two extreme ends of it this is the minion boxing in case you're interested you get the same stuff in size with the iphone 12 so charging cable and insert the phone is adorable it's literally like the iphone 12 had a baby but i want to focus on the pro max for three reasons one i'm just generally someone who likes big phones with big butt batteries two my main phone for the last six months has been the eleven pro max so this is the natural successor and three because for this year in particular the pro max is not just a big version of the pro like it has been in the past this is a phone that can do more this is more like the iphone 12 ultra so i was probably excited for this literally the moment it dropped through my door i grabbed it legged upstairs fumbled around with my camera whacked my lights on and just dived straight in i think within 40 minutes of this entering the premises i'd completely switched over to it because like it's always exciting testing new phones i completely love my job but it's especially exciting when you know that it's a phone you're going to be using as your main phone so anyways as you'd expect it's a wider and taller box than the normal 12 pro actually very slightly thicker too being a pro phone you get the pro black packaging and the color accents will match whatever color option you're getting so in my case gold and i gotta say the gold here on the rims and surrounding the cameras is spot on i love it but the actual gold on the back plate itself i kind of wish i had a bit more life to it like in a lot of lighting conditions i would always struggle to call that gold and that's kind of it there's nothing inside that you don't already get with the normal 12 pro however the more i've used this phone the more i'm convinced that this is the one to get the pro max is so much more of a better phone than the pro that it never really makes sense to get the pro with just one tiny little asterisk the one fear that i did have about the 12 pro max right from the very start has kind of come true see one of the big changes with the entire iphone 12 lineup is this new flat design not pretty much flat not slightly curved just bang bang flat and it's not lost on me you know every time i take out the iphone 12 even a month on i still think to myself yeah that's a pretty swab looking phone but at the same time it is kind of confusing because if you look around you'll notice that generally speaking tech is moving towards curvature towards adapting to the human form and just feeling really organically woven into our lives you'll notice how phones now are softer and smoother how earphones are now built around the actual shapes of our ears how cars are more streamlined and comfortable the iphone 12 design kind of feels at odds with that and to be honest it's not a big deal on the smaller iphone 12 but it's just that the iphone 12 pro max is a combination of sharp design the dense stainless steel rim that the pro phones get and the fact that it's not a small phone in fact this thing has the largest physical footprint of any iphone ever thanks to an even larger 6.7 inch display versus last year's 6.5 and the buttons are also higher up so there might be a bit of extra hand shuffling involved every now and again it is a bit slimmer than last year but yeah i mean there has never been an iphone whose presence is more felt okay here's the important thing though the iphone 12 pro max is worth it so normally when apple releases iphones you might know this they tend to just release the entire lineup at once this year they didn't do that they released the first two phones in october the second phone's just now and from a business perspective i think it's a really smart idea it gives apple time to make sure they have enough stock of each but also it gives them two separate waves of coverage so that each one of these four phones gets its own time in the spotlight but what has meant for me is that i've been using a phone that i probably wouldn't have otherwise picked i would have just gone for the big one but instead i've been using the small one and having had that time to properly use this before switching to the iphone 12 pro max has made me realize that there's an absolutely enormous difference between the two don't get me wrong i've been sort of happy on the 12 pro i'm getting 5g signal in places i wasn't expecting to it's so fast but in the end it is a small phone with a small battery and when you factor in the extra drain that comes from having 5g on it it doesn't last nearly as long as the iphone i'd come from and yes the cameras are an improvement but not what i'd call next generation just a whole load of small refinements so thankfully the iphone 12 pro max is the upgrade that i wanted i've got a full battery comparison coming very soon so a sub for that would be absolutely grand but importantly it lasts long enough it's enough that i can use my 5g i can enjoy videos on a big screen all day and not have that voice in the back of my head telling me aaron aaron don't forget the powerbank yes there is a larger display here to power but the battery is proportionally even larger and because the screen is larger while the bezels have remained about the same size it's a more visually impressive phone as in the screen to body ratio is higher you've got a speaker system that sounds a little louder and fuller thanks to just having more room to be able to push sound out of it's kind of weird that apple didn't mention this and finally we have a camera system that does feel next generation like for me the iphone 12 pro max camera is a bigger jump over the iphone 12 pro camera than the 12 pro is over last year's iphones or in other words the difference in camera quality within the 12 generation is bigger than the difference between the 12 and the 11 generation you've got more zoom 2.5 times optical zoom instead of the two times you got on every other pro iphone although the difference that this makes i've got to say is subtle it basically means that you can get to about 12 times zoom with the same quality as you used to be able to get to 10 times width we've also got sensor shift stabilization otherwise known as in-body stabilization so usually the way it works with cameras is that the lens has the ability to move slightly to kind of counteract the shake of your hands this takes that a step further and moves the camera sensor itself although it is kind of a weird feature to have on a phone because the main benefit of this on cameras is that it allows you to swap lenses freely and still keep your stabilization but obviously being a phone you're not gonna be swapping lenses very often so it leads to three perks but they're all quite subtle one is just the fact that it kind of helps to counteract the fact that there is a bigger heavier sensor on this phone than all other iphones two it's slightly better at also adjusting for jittering so if you're filming while sitting in a car for example that gentle rumbling motion seems to be a bit less noticeable here and the third thing is that because your lens is now locked in place and it's just the sensor behind that's moving it plays a little nicer with third-party accessories like gimbals or clip-on lenses but by far the most important improvement is the fact that the main camera sensor is almost 50 bigger than the one on the normal iphone 12 pro and this in itself brings five separate benefits one slightly more detail the fact that it can process more light now means it can gather just a bit more information two the extra light you're getting makes more and more of a difference the darker you get and so as you get to night time it is the difference between hmm that photo's looking a bit rough to yeah actually it's kind of comfortable it can also shoot those night mode shots a little faster in an environment where the iphone 12 pro might need to be held still for 10 seconds this phone might be able to do it in three number four it's got even better dynamic range so here for example if you look at the really bright area inside the light bulb the 12 pro max can control the highlights a bit better than the 12 pro cam and finally most importantly for me is improved depth of field so you can take photos without using portrait mode and still get this lovely separation of foreground and background i think within 10 minutes of using this camera i decided okay we've got to do a full comparison versus the best smartphone cameras out there that video is actually coming to you tomorrow now there's one more important thing here there's nothing to do with specs or cameras or software the software experience is it's basically the same it's ios 14 and i do like it i love the new siri and how it doesn't take up the entire screen widgets are a nice touch but still fairly limited versus what android can do probably the biggest thing for me is actually just picture in picture you can watch your netflix shows while browsing instagram for example but here's the kicker i've already said that i think the iphone 12 pro max is enough of a jump ahead of the pro to be considered apple's ultraphone it's competitor to the ultras from samsung and huawei but unusually this phone doesn't really carry the ultra price premium now bear with me here because apple's pricing is a bit all over the place around the world like in india this phone is something like 30 percent more expensive than the galaxy s20 ultra that's the kind of price gap that's quite hard to justify in the uk these two phones are exactly the same price to the penny in which case i would say if you're considering the iphone 12 pro max i can recommend it and then you've got the us in which it's almost 30 percent cheaper than an equivalent samsung where for a lot of people that then becomes a complete no-brainer so the price of apple products versus those of other companies it varies a lot based on the country but the one thing that's quite consistent is the fact that the price of the 12 pro max versus the price of the 12 pro apple's own phone is not a big price jump if you look at samsung or huawei their ultra flagships are both something like three to four hundred dollars more than their baseline flagships the gap between the iphones is a hundred now that doesn't necessarily mean the 12 pro max is amazing value versus samsung but what it does mean is that if you find yourself considering the 12 pro i think it'd be wise to either save a bit and go for the normal 12 with very little compromise or just go all in and get the pro max you get a bigger higher resolution display you get better audio you get better battery life in a generation that let's face it kind of needs it thanks to the introduction of 5g and you get more of a camera improvement than apple often makes between generations so if you're wondering this is why i never made a full review of the smaller pro literally the moment i saw the pro max get announced and the fact that it was only a hundred dollars more i kind of already suspected i was going to come to this conclusion anyway so i just decided to wait until i had the pro max so i could be sure if you enjoyed this video a sub would be incredible my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you tomorrow you
