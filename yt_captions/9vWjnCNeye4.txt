ladies and gentlemen today is one of the greatest days in the history of chess the mittens chess bot has returned to chess.com it's currently December of 2023 which is crazy because it really feels like just yesterday it was January and we were all suffering under the catbots that ch.com put up mittens was an international sensation and for December ch.com brought back their best of 2023 series which was a bold move because they should have done Santa Bots like they should have done Christmas Bots holiday Bots you know but instead of that it no problem we'll take mittens and in this video I'm going to play mittens once again because farming this idiot ginger cat for content is the only thing that I can do and then if you enjoy I will make it play against stockfish again I'll make it play against torch it's going to be a great month mittens is back thank the chess Gods more content for me more content for you let's jump into it here we go oh my goodness very exciting oh also if you are going to The Fan event in Toronto on December 7th look out for an email we had to change the venue it's going to be nearby it's like 5 minutes away from the original venue um because too many people signed up so too many of you want to attend this event and so we had to get a bigger venue you'll just check your email all right if you're if you're not going then none of this is to you all right mittens my old Nemesis never wait I get oh okay meow I like chess he I exist at this chess board through all times and realities amazing they had 12 months to come up with different voice lines and they came up with nothing um I'm going to play D5 the Queen's Gambit from mittens I foresee everything around you deteriorating I'm going to play the Queen's Gambit declined which is a very solid opening and now I think I'm going to play why is it trembling trembles he he he okay I'm going to play A6 idea to take right so the idea of A6 is to take this pawn and then defend with B5 very quickly White NOW takes you to basically say well now this move is obsolete but then I say you're obsolete you idiot cat don't talk to me like you know me right that's pretty normal uh and now you know you can just develop I like to play C6 and then develop my Bishop it pins me I don't care I play C6 so that after takes takes my Pawn is not unguarded anymore and now I think there's a handful of ways to play this position personally I like to counteract the uh the pin I think that's uh that's solid uh and then you can play Bishop E6 or you can Castle I don't really think there's a huge difference you're going to have to play these moves regardless the bishop will go here and the Knight will go behind the bishop because these are all the you know squares for your pieces now white is considering an E4 break uh White is also considering and has now played the Knight to the center it's a very common move uh I I think I'm going to go here I doubt mittens takes oh I have seen many whimper in the [Laughter] darkness well taking with the pawn is really bad because I would be opening my king even though I am attacking the knight uh I take like this I guess mittens is trying to play F4 get this powerful attacking setup against me yay I predicted the move of the 3500 level bot woohoo yeah uh so now white has potential attacking possibilities it's okay to trade off your dark squared Bishop if you will then replace a lot of your structure with dark squared pawns which actually white is very very close to doing um the position is still pretty balanced because the move f 5 for example just pushes my Bishop back although now the move Knight D7 is no longer possible because this is trapping my Bishop like if this I just go back right but white has possible attacking chances here I don't want to take just yet I think that's kind of an overc commitment but I don't really know what to do and I feel like if I was playing a game I would need to uh you know I'd need to act Queen D6 Queen B6 Knight D7 Rook E8 all possibilities can I undermine the center and then like maybe take I mean this move doesn't look ridiculous but I'm not trying to get into a tactical battle against the bot so maybe I play Queen D6 and then C5 I doubt mittens continues like yeah so okay wow it it it's oh oh oh it wants oh dear oh dear oh my it wants this and then it wants to mate me uh that's bad is it bad what if I just go Rook e eight like who cares I'm not afraid you you idiot you don't scare me it did it anyway oh God check here check here where's the mate there is no mate there is no mate I'm just going to go C5 there's no mate I'm not afraid of you stupid oh oh god oh boy so what but now you're Queen stuck I don't I don't understand I don't get it I if take okay I mean I'm I think I'm going to go to C8 cuz I think I want to put my knight on D7 I think I'm going to go to C8 and there's no attack what mittens can't do anything oh it's it just goes it just it just goes here that's it's that's all that's all okay and then if I take I mean it's not going to take with a rook because then it loses the Knight it's going to take with a pawn so I'm chilling oh I'm not chilling cuz it's going to put his Rook on this fight maybe I got to do I have to make a run for it if I take take it opens up this which is really bad and it's about to put its Rook there and hunt oh my God oh my God but what if I make a run for it first oh that's also really bad because then after this King d8 there's this oh boy oh I'm I'm cooked I'm cooked I think what if I play Knight C6 Rook e one Knight E7 with the idea of Queen h8 Knight oh oh I'm oh look at that oh I'm going to safeguard myself I'm going to ju what is that what it's trying to open up the E file check I can still can't I just can't I make a run for it now I'm going to run I am I going to am I going to run maybe I won't run um Bishop D7 I still don't exactly see how I'm getting mated by the way oh oh I just missed that's a key detail and now the Knight can take which will prevent me from escaping okay well then I have to do this and I guess I just got to run right it's going to take my pawn it stopped me from from escaping and now when I go Knight E7 to defend myself now it's going to take this pawn and force my king that way amazing we love we love it it's good oh boy oh boy The Rook lift could have played either of those moves actually it just brings The Rook excellent justifying its entire plan by the way really impressive I don't know how this got so bad for me I mean I might have to analyze it afterward um okay now I just lose it can it's probably going to like Sack or just take yeah it could just take and that's mate that is just mate that is just straight up I just I just got obliter oh my God oh my God yeah it looks like you won he he he idiot stop talking all right how did that get so bad I mean I played just a completely normal opening this move must have just been really wow wow and how how how does this stop this plan G6 I thought about playing G6 I didn't play G6 because I thought that it would sacrifice like I just thought that's not or or F5 I thought and then you know it opens up my king I thought this looked too scary stockfish is not convinced but I just thought that looked too scary and then once I allowed this I am I am cooked I should have went to D7 too apparently which is uh that's tough to see the computer wants this so I can defend my Pawn because it sees this plan by white to just like play Rook D1 and okay well you know what mittens is not going to you know I'm going to play it with white um I want to play it with white and it you know can I play it friendly mode I want to play it on friendly mode Let's play an English I'm going to play an English opening play an English okay it's going to be a nice and long game Knight F3 okay play for the center both Knights I feel empty hardly here at all and yet I am here forever I'll forever be awake that's terrifying let's play G3 and put the bishop on G2 it's very common the power of my waves will never be broken yep you impose orders as you think of them I've already seen them I think that is a new voice line it doesn't have a voice line they should put a voice though because that would be terrifying so now there's a there's a way to play this position with D4 which which I think is very principled yeah and then after take white can actually take with the queen walking into this attack but your argument is that the Knight blocks the bishop and the queen is able to just rotate somewhere um black probably wants to play D5 I can probably play Bishop G5 or I can play Rook D1 I'm going to play Rook D1 And Delay the development of this bishop okay black plays that move which is very normal I think I'm going to go B3 be Rock Solid maybe put the bishop on the diagonal and now the question is do I put it there or there I mean that move just Knight C5 no no Knight C5 probably um and then I don't really see what my plan after that is so let me be patient I really I have a great position this is the best position I've probably ever had against mittens I'm now just fully developed I've got all my pieces in the center right and so what if now I just play King H1 King G1 like I just straight up Don't Do Anything Can I can I get a draw against mittens I really just want to play King H1 King G1 but I feel like maybe I shouldn't what if I play like Rook C2 I just don't do anything I'm just going to do nothing is it gon to it's attacking me right away history is just a series of freakishly impossible improbable events you will become one of them soon oh my God oh my God Queen E3 or queen D2 I kind of like this move I don't see wow it's just IM it's just it's just immediately attacking me like right it has no remorse I played one move I played one move that did not have an idea and right away it's taking over the initiative so it activates its Queen the queen is attacking my Rook it has a possibility to play Knight G4 I kind of want to retreat here Rook D2 I think I'm getting my queen trapped which you know I'm a bad player but I'm not that bad of a player maybe I just go Queen C1 then is it going to go no no it's it's definitely not going to go here CU that gives me that and if it goes there okay 90 so what what you think I'm afraid of you I am but you don't have to know that should I go here and stop stuff from happening oh God it's so ugly to have to play that move okay it takes so what Fair Trade Fair Trade and okay why does that scare me I'm just not going to let you get my Bishop like my position is yeah yeah this is the this right here this is the sign of a bot that doesn't know what it's doing I am officially cooking this bozo all right this thing does not know what it this thing is not going to know what hit it maybe I should play Queen B1 I got Knight H4 but then it's going to take and open open up my I I I don't like that I was thinking to trade Knights should I trade knights with it what if I what if I do what what what what uh oh wait is there Bishop to G5 okay it goes Knight G5 goes Knight G5 no this is good this is good I'm Not Afraid unless that was designed against my plan in which case did I just like completely walk into mitten's plan is that F4 looks interesting I think my last move might have been a mistake oh it really might have been a mistake because now it's got stuff like this oh I really don't want to go here but I'm going to and I'm going to try to get it out of my position with E4 okay why is that scary King H1 what am I missing King H1 so what but but I don't see the attack I will soon climb to physical existence what oh because it's a bot oh yeah that's scary yep E4 all right so I'm blocking out this bishop I mean I it looks like I'm doing something smart yeah like sometimes it plays these moves and I'm like it doesn't know what it's doing I don't care if it's a bot it's stupid what about this move Knight B1 look at this I'm trading so who cares about that move Queen E1 what do you're you're nothing what so you can't go here I take the Knight okay F5 sure yeah makes sense but can't I just play like Knight C3 take Knight takes Bishop takes Queen takes maybe Knight C3 and now I'm I'm going to put my knight on D5 wait a minute I I I might be I might be in completely good shape I just got to get this Rook out of here but this is this is really strong what about Bishop C1 looking for a little exchange Yoni I don't even say the what am I even I'm so shocked by this how about Bishop A3 no it's protected that's stupid Bishop C1 trading the the bad Bishop for the good Bishop ooh I'm making it make commitments that's that's good in relationships it's bad if you're mittens G4 maybe lock it lock the lock the door G4 lock the door oh man that's that is that is a big decision though I can also take and maybe try to trade the Queens this is tough guys but this is this could be the game this could be the game where I go from a boy into a man G4 oh this is so I'm going to do it I'm going to lock the door against mittens it doesn't know what it's doing it's just shuffling that move literally does nothing that move does nothing because it can't even go D5 this could be this could be my moment this could be my moment I got a shine Queen E2 look for a trade maybe Zig the bishop back here Queen E2 nice and steady nice and steady what's the idea there is no idea of this move I it it there's no idea there's no idea I'm just going to go here and here there's no idea behind Queen H4 see it's just moving around it's just going back oh my God the Mist Contours of the board are very oh guys guys this is actually crazy I want everybody to to to to stop for a moment and appreciate greatness you are witnessing a man who on his own may not lose to mittens this is crazy this is actually crazy if takes then takes the big question my Bishop is really bad and that Knight is really good but is it worth committing to that right now take take Queen G2 it might be because I don't know what this bishop is ever going to do to me if I take and play Queen G2 takes I'm doing it I'm doing it and I'm trading if I can get a couple pieces off the board I won't lose now it's going to go here it's going to want to it's it's going to want to keep pieces on the board Rook G1 it's going to go Queen G6 right maybe I turn my attention to this Pawn Rook D2 that's a big weakness I control the squares in front of that pawn that pawn is a major weakness now the Queen's going to try to get out now do I bring the bishop there or around that way oh that's a that is a tough question I'm going to keep the bishop locked on that H4 square and double up the Rooks I'm going to double up the Rooks where's the bishop going where's where's mitten's Bishop going where's that light Bishop going this this is crazy can I walk my king to the other side of the board can I do that do I have the unmitigated go for such a if I play King G1 what if I just get my start getting my king out of there real quick what if I what if we repeat moves will it repeat moves with me oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my oh no I'm G to get a draw get bittens I'm G to get a draw against bittens this is the best day of my life this is the do mid yo can we game review this real quick oh my God oh my God I just played on even term terms with the cat game review come on hurry up hurry up I have it I have it set on the maximum depth that's why it's taking a long time so I'm just going to entertain you by talking really fast I got 91% I got 91% accuracy oh my goodness here I'm going to I'm I'm going to minimize this window I'm going to minimize maximize whatever I can't speak right now I just drew mittens I outplayed mittens oh my goodness the English opening is goated if you need to make a boring draw against the cat with an ELO of one you got to play the English and yeah the the the I mean I just played like a really solid game and then you know this was fine and then and then mittens took over and I just played solid and you know it tried to instigate with me here I made probably my biggest mistake of the game game which was this no it wasn't even that bad wow and then I played F3 this was okay mittens made an inaccuracy and right around here I was like how is mittens going to beat me like it's probably going to play F5 and try to open up the position but then this I think this was really clutch by the way yeah look at this top engine move rerouting the Knight because I really I I know the Knight would be really really nice on those on those squares and my knight doesn't have a future here so I I rerouted backwards and okay this was a mistake akake yeah but you know you see the stockfish wants me to take I I I I could never I feel like as a human that's really tough to allow black to get two open pieces at the same time but I played Knight C3 and then yeah and then I mean I just okay yeah this was a mistake but I don't really understand why it was such a big mistake and then finally I was like I did this and I had a like I I wondered if I could play H4 sack the pawn and just play like this but but why can't I do that cuz oh okay apparently I can computer thinks I have a big Advantage after H3 wait Rook D2 Bishop F2 and at the end I'm just better wow I'm like slightly better it's like0 4 3 but uh I'll take the draw it's like drawing like Magnus I mean that is insane oh my God yeah and it's giving me an accuracies for repeating the position which again like but that's nuts I completely neutralized it it couldn't move its light squared Bishop at all I traded my light squared bishop and put all these pawns on light squares it had a backwards Pawn which is a pawn whose neighbors have advanced Beyond it and it's kind of stuck and you know I'm controlling the square in front of it five times but I do wonder how do you pursue the advantage here after something like Bishop to G5 A4 interesting and then Rook D3 no it's not so clear I mean I it looks like you have to achieve this move it looks like the computer basically needs to play H4 and then Bishop H4 is not possible because of Rook D6 so I just completely dominate on the light squares I prevent all of Black's Pawn play and then I that's crazy that's crazy um I want to end the video here I you know I really I'm just going to say I think I think I or or should I play one more time should I play One More Time ah all right let's see how quickly I can lose against it I want to end on a good note but let let's just see what if I play really aggressively I'm going to play E4 I drew mittens that's so crazy I'm going to play the C3 Sicilian let's see D4 this is all Theory uh Bishop C4 here is a line but I'm just going to play this I'm going to play CD and and Knight C3 it's a very very solid boring system um I've never seen D I don't think that's a move uh Bishop C4 just developing Knight takes Pawn takes is nothing scary Castle maybe there's like Bishop B5 let me play Knight C3 if takes then takes I guess there's like a line where they could take my knight and then give me this bad Pawn okay that's exactly what it's doing yeah but even here I can't I like go and attack I'm just going to this is just going to turn into a video where I beat mittens every single time I play against it you know that's what it's just going to be Queen G4 Queen H5 this this looks better let's go I mean we're confident right like let's do it what are you going to do you stupid cat you stupid cat what are you going to do huh how you doing Bishop B3 Bishop D if Bishop D3 would is going to play G6 and then what I play Queen E2 and then it's going to take it's not going to take my Pawn it's not going to take my Pawn it's not going to take my Pawn because if it takes my pawn it gets mated it's going to play yeah and now I got to play a move like this it's not going to go here there's no way that's too dangerous see it knows it knows what's good for it I can play C4 I'm I'm suddenly like full of confidence like this bot can't touch me we're not the same species all right this is a cat and I got that dog in me all right that's what we're doing I don't know why I'm turning into an Italian but that's what we're doing C4 kind of want to just give the pawn away but I don't feel that brave just yet it's going to go Bishop here or there that's fine Bishop H6 Bishop F4 I I mean I like overprotecting the center Pawn but yeah I mean I I definitely don't I can't be calling the shots in this position because I have such a big Pawn weakness but I think I should you know attack that's that's going to be the way that I maybe bring the bishop back to B1 or to E4 to E4 or 2 E1 let's go to E4 mittens is going to double Ah that's annoying that is annoying how do I get in can I play like H4 H5 I really don't want to go back it's such an ugly move I'll do it and if it goes here I'll go back to E4 we'll make another draw watch I'm going to make another draw it's I think it's going to go here and then I can't really protect my Pawn huh maybe Rook d C1 Bishop C4 Bishop C4 take take take a if this there's this move I think which is a problem is it going to go Rook D4 then I can't protect my Pawn what the what what about Rook C3 you just going to go back to I don't I don't understand but okay I mean I don't know why you would give me the dark Square can't I play Bishop G5 now what was the point of this what Bishop what I don't so but what about the Rook is he going to go back oh oh oh it just doesn't matter that's I'm just a complete is what it is and uh now I got to solve this problem oh and I got to solve that problem now too which I just created for myself aay oh boy you know I don't I'm not even mad about ending it on a bad note cuz I I'm I'm I'm happy I mean seriously I can't believe I drew it on equal ground that was awesome I'm like hikaro basically I'm just going to go here and let the game and and let the game end yeah it's it's it's bulldozing me it's not it's not going to give me another opportunity like it wait a wait a minute I'm not losing The Rook what what what huh what why did it lose its Queen what what oh wow there's no mate look at that the bishop is going to get oh my goodness what and is there like Bishop D3 what is but I can defend right I'm not I'm not losing am I losing it's just going to win an end game against me I'm so what is going on why did I give up its queen that was so unnecessary oh if I go to m it it's going to go here if I play G3 it has check no but no I'm escaping right G3 check King H3 Rook here oh it's going to change the move order it's going to oh it's G to play H5 and I'm not going to be able to get out oh it's G to check me oh that's brutal can I stop that if G4 I just get laded I'm just going to get lad good old fashioned ladder mate let's let's let's Let It demonstrate the queen is G the queen stops my Escape oh this move is even more brutal if I play Queen F3 attacking The Rook it's discovered check on it's discovered attack on my queen if I play Queen G4 it's check and my queen stops my Kings a that's that's nice all right you win you win you win that was impressive that was impressive my friends mittens is back but you boy got a draw my day is made I my day is made my week is made I'm going to bring stockfish I'm going to bring torch I'm going to play I'm GNA put oh my that I mittens versus mittens here we go it's going to be a great month welcome back play the bot see y'all in Toronto venue change check your emails that's all I got for you get out of here
