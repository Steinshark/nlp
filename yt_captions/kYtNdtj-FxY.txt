why didn't we order like five more shelves Ken we should have had five more shelves I don't have to build a switch with this goo on it so I am a big fan of the switch light in fact this is my daily switch which is the super cool yellow and really what I want to do here today is very simple create the ultimate Nintendo switch light blue this is a very stocks which all I've done is install a tempered glass screen protector and I have a 256 gig micro SD card inside Oh No dropped it yeah okay first off we have a bluetooth adapter for the switch one of the biggest flaws with a switch and that goes for the light as well as the standard switch is the fact that there's no Bluetooth audio even though it has bluetooth so with this little guy which is home espada we okay why did you get the good one I think that there's another brand that's better though Kent did a video on it okay let's let's find out this may be a slightly dubious quality oh you see I see USB audio right here okay and is now pairing so let me grab my bluetooth headphones I'm not gonna go earpods pair pots on a switch is dumb I mean it sounds great it sounds exactly like any kind of normal bluetooth headphone it makes sense dude this feels totally fine I mean especially considering you we have the low latency headphones this is a great way to get Bluetooth on your switch however oh this is just the beginning of our ultimate switch light build which should be clear is not an ultimate switch because that has more things that we can't do like video out and what not what you can do on this switch light but besides that this is the ultimate switch light which is my favorite switch anyway this is fine there is no video wow I got the next best thing which is this is just a screen magnifier is this just a way to play fortnight I'm a bigger like zoomed in screen although this for night huh that is for night well I mean I guess I know it gamer playing next how do you use this do these just clip on oh wait you know what though this might not work with Queen Jesus with a bluetooth adapter you know I need to have in the middle [Music] put it over the adapter I guess there's no buttons on the bottom I'll actually look at that it actually clips on okay we'll make a progress here Jesus Christ oh that's Wow wait this actually is not bad dude it's not bad it's a little different in person versus know what you're seeing on the camera right now is pretty accurate to what I see so just for reference this one looks like with it that's what that it's a pretty big difference right I'm telling some with my pickaxe right now okay I lost mmm the switch ultimate project going very well right now what's our next item whoa the charging and cooling service what's this how's this service this product has a six thousand million up our battery please charge it to the type C charging cable when charging press the switch button to start the fan so this is a grip slash cooler slash external battery for the switch and switch light yeah how much was this forty dollars so the best thing about this product is normally for building the ultimate we have a lot of really crazy things to tack on to the switch more like whatever console people they did all your work for you that is literally all of them and what what the [ __ ] is this so we have a kickstand okay we have a USB C port on the back to fans and then we have a USB C port here as well as a power button oh what the whoa oh go do that a few more times it will break it or I started feeling weird that feels okay alright and now hit the power button Oh Oh things are happening whoa yeah loud that is so essentially this is blowing on the back of the switch and the actual sort of intake is right here so then now let me try to put my adapter in here I feel like it's not gonna work though oh no it doesn't even fit it's got a little lip on it so i have to use wired headphones is that we try to tell me right now like I'm a peasant with a normal non ultimate switch I will actually say this grip feels a lot better than the standard switch light which to me while I like the portability it's always a little kind of crampy on my hands but that that feels really nice you think it's go reach I think it's like yeah okay okay so now I have to gently set it down on the table don't touch it ever again mm-hmm what is that Oh a switch controller wait this is for the pro controller yes wait how many things my clipping onto it though it's all gonna be too thick right oh this feels terrible that's it so I've got it clips to the back now this is all gonna explode it if I touch it just the wrong way okay okay okay so I've got it tight oh the chunky boy are not done yet I'm not done yet can I do this upside down I think the laws of physics are against me on this one that is literally everything can I get a large roll of duct tape please what's that what are you bringing in you're just making my life more difficult Rober up she's not gonna help he's gonna yell at me until I mess it up so I now have a magnified screen with a six thousand milliamp hour battery and a fan and grips which I'm not using because I have a bracket to connect it to the pro controller this is dumb I'm gonna give it a try I'm actually kind of impressed that the stupid low piece of plastic is holding all this weight I will say if you want a forearm exercise really present how that looks from the front yeah this is not that bad right you know I've got to say while it would I would get a little bit more magnification as the screen was farther back I actually feel like this is a more sort of comfortable distance for it then the actual stock thing because now I can actually look at it normally before I want to do this which looks weird I think we found some good things here however none of this is remotely ultimate this is all dumb you want to make the ultimate in this switch well I mean if you've watched youtube over the last 18 months you know exactly what I'm about to say time to hydro dip disclaimer I've never hired it to my life and it's probably look terrible so we begin our hydro dipping excursion we're actually going to take a little bit of a shortcut so while technically you should probably just take apart your switch however we're going to not do that yet as you can actually buy third party shells on Amazon for like what 15 bucks yeah now there are a couple of ways of doing it if you want to be the cool youtuber and make the really cool thumbnail you'll spray paint in here but I don't want to get spray paint all over my desk so instead we have a what he call it's like the hydro dipping film so we actually have ordered a wide variety of films I'm not sure what should we use like this weird like coats Rick and Morty I can't read what that says I'm Batman oh look at that Oh our switches gonna be so cool let's see giant Doritos oh no that's a thumbnail right there alright let's put our supercool flames on Ready Set and oh look at that okay there is water on top of it is that okay maybe alright here goes nothing so I'm gonna ease it in here oh no that's not nope nope that's not gonna work alright we're gonna try to do this very quickly so straight down so I can freeze that at all that's terrible okay cool no or didn't work OH [Music] [Music] so attempt number one didn't exactly end well it's almost like I rolled a fruit by the foot on the switch however we've had a breakthrough and that we're morons we were putting the hydro dip film on the wrong way so you're supposed to put it face down which makes sense when you think that the material goes look ok first time hydro dipping it's fine we're gonna build the ultimate switch light today and oh it actually like unrolls itself so 60 seconds oh we can already see look at that it's already kind of like warping and everything ok give it a good coat here we go that is the correct way of doing it and here we go oh it fell apart ok that wasn't too good of a coat even coats man oh ok alright shall we go I haven't feeling good okay here we go and that's not bad I mean no look part of its pretty good look that's fine right it's so sad that was so much better than the first one look at the difference we went from one to two but uh okay thankfully Ken thought ahead and we have one back-up plan to make this even more ultimate than this disaster so we're going to cut sorry let's cut out the part that we just did the hydro dipping so if you just I'll just step over here so people can see that part we're gonna pretend that never happened okay so the next step is we're going to be doing a clear shale conversion for our Nintendo switch light now some people might try to paint the the switch however what we're doing today is we're going to make it clear because this is the way to do an ultimate switch light is just to do it clear so I hope that this is easy to take apart it seems to be easy so far so because the switch light is fairly new and these shell replacements have just come out as far as I know there's currently no tutorial on how to do this so I'm just gonna figure it out I make a progress see I've opened a thing or two there we go hey we now have the inside of our switch light this I think should be a pretty straightforward swap so you can see it doesn't look like anything too crazy on the back we do actually have some yellow components which should show through nicely but it's pretty much just this yeah this sort of metal backplate so roughly that's what it's gonna look like once we have the clear shell on I actually don't totally hate the idea of yellow on the front and clear on the back so you see how I like my microSD flap I could just remove this mechanism and just put it on here that look okay right with a little bit of yellow and clear mixed yeah okay I'm gonna do that yeah look at that there we go so now we have our yellow power button volume rocker game card slot and micro SD let's get this thing on now oh wait a minute what told you what should do right now boom look at that oh yeah whoo look at that dude this is actually cool I mean I knew I mean as of course the owner of this video and the person who put this title up here I knew it was gonna be good I'm not surprised in a neat way right now let me throw in my micro SD in the game card and make sure that this all fires up and then we can reassemble the ultimate switch and hopefully it still works hey I mean it'd be weird if it didn't turn on cuz I didn't touch anything on the inside come on that looks pretty good right right hey yeah look Katie Katie see how great our shell is huh it's like almost like you can't even tell we did any thing so we have the ultimate Nintendo switch light with a magnified screen giant
