hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about electric cars and electric bills now i've got a lot of people asking me hey jason now you have an electric core what's your electric bill like and it's an interesting question a strange question but if you absolutely must know last month my first full month of owning an electric core my electric bill was 46 dollars and 71 cents now that tells you absolutely nothing and what i think is interesting about this question is people don't ask me hey jason now that you own an electric core what's your gasoline bill like because really you're just replacing one form of energy for another and i think something that people get confused that they don't quite understand is how much cheaper an electric core is to drive now i didn't say electric cars are cheap teslas are not cheap electric cars are not cheap used yes you can get electric cars for a low price not necessarily use tesla's but used electric cars whether it's the leaf 500 e there are cheap electric cars out there the goal of this video however is to talk about the energy cost how much does it cost to move an electric car from this spot to this spot and the reason why it's cheaper for an electric core to move from this spot to this spot is not because electricity is cheaper than gasoline in fact gasoline is very cheap right now in the united states the reason why it's cheap to move an electric core from this spot to this spot is because it does it so efficiently and that's what we're going to get into in this video and talk about the actual cost difference of driving an electric car versus driving a gasoline car all right so who's stoked to do some math so our first question is how much does it cost for one full charge of the tesla model 3 so i have a tesla model 3 performance and how much does it cost to fill it up from absolute dead zero battery to full in other words one full tank so the cost per tank or full battery size we're looking at what is the size of the battery and then we're going to divide that by its charging efficiency so the tesla model 3 performance has a 75 kilowatt hour battery pack we divide that by charging efficiency now we're just going to use a conservative estimate of 80 we don't actually know what it is it's probably a good bit higher than 80 but a nice conservative estimate so that our numbers aren't wrong they're just airing on the side of caution and you know going to be a bit conservative so we multiply that by the cost per kilowatt hour now if we go back to my electric bill you can see that i used 467 kilowatt hours of energy and that cost me 46 dollars and 71 cents that makes the math very simple because 467 divided by 46.7 equals 10. so yes there are some fixed costs and some variable costs in there but overall if we just look at the total amount of energy used divided by the total cost we get a charge of 10 cents per kilowatt hour so we multiply this by 10 cents and that is going to give us the cost of one charge which is going to be nine dollars and 38 cents now how much does it cost per month well that depends on how much you drive the average american drives about a thousand miles per month i drive far less than that because i just sit in my office and doodle on this whiteboard and never leave the house but regardless let's say i were to be a normal human and drive a thousand miles per month we know the range of the vehicle is 310 we multiply that by the cost per tank which is nine dollars and 38 cents and we get a monthly cost of about 30 a month if you're driving a thousand miles per month and then if we multiply that out using similar math for a year it's basically this multiplied by 12 counting for the the decimal places that are included within that we get 363 dollars per year that's to go 12 000 miles per year in the tesla model 3 performance now i wanted to compare it to a similar vehicle and we'll get into other scenarios with cheaper cars later on in this video but the video the vehicle which i chose to compare it with is the julia quadrifoglio so the alfa romeo julia quadrifoglio they are similar in price similar in horsepower similar in weight actually the julia is quite heavy about 3 700 pounds 3 800 pounds the model three around four thousand forty one hundred pounds uh similar in size they're very similar vehicles in fact it wasn't my original idea to compare them i'm an unoriginal human i just chose to go with it because it happened to be what was on this motor trend issue which was sitting on my desk so the julia versus the model 3 performance okay so another interesting point the julia actually has a range epa estimated range of 306 miles versus the tesla model 3's 310 miles interesting that they basically have the exact same range but regardless either way we're looking at the cost for a single tank of the julia and so it has a 15.3 gallon tank and we'll say premium gas is about three dollars per gallon pretty close to the national average right now for that premium gas and that is going to give us a fill up cost of 45 and 90 cents significantly more expensive than the tesla as you can see then we're going to look at the cost per month so we have the number of miles we're going to drive in a month a thousand we divide that by its combined fuel economy rating which is 20 miles per gallon we multiply that by three pretty simple math here and we get a 1 5 0 for the monthly cost and then if we were to multiply that by 12 we get 1800 a year 1437 dollars per year more than the tesla to drive the exact same distance now yes things will change so if it's cold outside the tesla's not going to do quite as good but remember we also do have a little bit of a buffer here with this charging efficiency and you know if you're flooring it in the julia you're not going to be getting 20 mpg if you're flooring it in the model 3 you're not going to be getting 310 miles of range so you know just playing with averages here epa estimates where you're going to be 1400 per year cheaper to drive the tesla model 3 performance now if you go with epa estimates they actually say the julia is gonna cost you twenty two hundred dollars per year and that the tesla will cost you five hundred fifty dollars per year so they actually say the difference is even greater sixteen hundred fifty dollars uh estimated difference in energy costs between the tesla model 3 and the julia quite significant overall now remember at the beginning of this video i said the reason why electric cars are so much cheaper to drive than gasoline-powered cars is not because gasoline is more expensive than electricity it's because there's so much more efficient so let's assume our julia would be equally as fuel efficient as the tesla model 3 performance so instead of a combined rating of 20 miles per gallon it would have a rating of 116 miles per gallon so if we take 1200 and we divide that by 116 we get 103.4 gallons used in a year we multiply that by three and we get about 310 dollars per year so as you can see if the julia was as fuel efficient as efficient at moving a box of metal from one spot to another spot it would actually be cheaper per year than a tesla model 3 because gasoline you know energy wise is actually pretty cheap right now so to move it the same amount of space if it had better fuel economy the same fuel economy as the tesla it would actually be cheaper on a yearly basis but because the model 3 is so so much more efficient at moving a box of metal from one spot to another it's significantly cheaper to drive so another way of thinking about this is that the epa says one gallon of gasoline is equivalent to 33.7 kilowatt hours so the tesla has a 75 kilowatt hour battery pack we divide that by 33.7 and we get about 2.2 which means the tesla has about 2.2 gallons of fuel at a full charge so basically no fuel the only reason it's able to go so far is because it's crazy efficient now if you're actually paying super close attention you're like wait a minute if i take 116 the tesla's combined fuel economy rating and i multiply that by 2.2 that's going to give me something closer like 260 miles not the 310 that the epa says it should be getting and part of why this is because this does not account for regen so if you have region occurring which every time you slow down your vehicle the combined fuel economy rating of course includes city mileage if you have combined fuel economy rating here and you have regen occurring your vehicle is going to use more than 75 kilowatt hours on a full charge so whatever distance it drives on that full battery charge it's actually going to use more than 75 kilowatt hours that's just how much the battery holds but you'll regain some of that every time you come to a stop so your actual amount of energy that you have to go whatever distance you're going is dependent on how often you're using regen so under that cycle the epa is going to give you an estimated 310 miles of range all right so now let's make a comparison that makes more sense on a national broader level looking at averages so we're going to compare the tesla reason why we're continuing to use the tesla is because the model 3 performance efficiency wise kind of sits in the middle of the electric cars out there there are more efficient cores there are less efficient cars 116 mpge isn't all that unreasonable of a combined rating for an electric core on the flip side for our gasoline car we're going to assume a core with a 12 gallon tank and 30 miles per gallon i chose 30 miles per gallon the national average is 25 miles per gallon in the united states but that of course includes trucks suvs which people are going to be buying anyways but we're just going to give it a little bit of benefit here and say let's say you get 30 miles per gallon instead of 25. now the national average fuel price for regular gas is dollars and 35 cents crazy cheap and it's probably going to be the thing in this video that dates it so much is the fact that i'm saying gasoline costs two dollars and 35 cents uh so it's very cheap at the moment so to fill up the tesla with electric national average price of 13 cents per kilowatt hour 12 dollars and 20 cents this will be less if uh the electric core has a smaller battery pack like a nissan leaf or bmw uh i3 things like that that'll be you know about half that uh but regardless filling up a regular car with a 12 gallon tank that gets 30 miles per gallon filling it that core up 28 dollars and 20 cents so even with gas extremely cheap filling the car up uh is you know about double the price and about double the price monthly 39 dollars per month versus 78 dollars per month 472 dollars per year for the electric car with national average electric prices versus 940 dollars with a 30 mile per gallon car per year uh with uh you know getting uh gas at 235. now if you're to use premium gas national average is currently 2.90 so as you can see that bumps the price and if you were to assume gasoline were to get more expensive which electricity could also get more expensive but we have had you know certainly four dollar per gallon gas in the united states in recent history so if it was at four dollars a gallon look at how significant that change is so if you were to look at on a yearly basis 472 dollars versus 1600 if you were to own that core for 10 years 11 280 if gas was four dollars a gallon it's not so perhaps that difference will be somewhere around 5000 thousand dollars over ten years now yes you could come up with all kinds of hypotheticals that could happen to either core uh why one might be more expensive than the other over the duration of ten years now the battery could fail in the electric core the engine could fail in the internal combustion car there's plenty of little items that could go wrong on that combustion engine there's plenty of little things that could go wrong on an electric course so anything you know it's not necessarily which one is going to cost more long-term that we're talking about in this video it's from an energy standpoint how much does it cost to get it from this spot to another and electrics are far far cheaper but you don't have to take my word for it you can kind of do it yourself based on what cars you're looking at buying so if you're looking at buying two different cars here are the equations all laid out for you in order to determine how much would each of these cars cost per month from an energy standpoint so for an electric car you're taking the number of miles that you drive in a month dividing it by that car's range multiplying by the battery size divided by the charging efficiency in this case i used 80 just because it's a simple conservative estimate that means you'll probably be at least close enough to the right answer and then you multiply that by your electricity cost so what that cost per kilowatt hour for you that will give you your monthly cost to compare it to an internal combustion engine you take the number of miles you're going to drive in the month divided by the internal combustion engines combine fuel economy rating multiply that by the price of gasoline and that will give you the cost per month so you know you don't have to use this specific scenario you can come up with any scenario you like as you could see if you were to have a car that had 60 miles per gallon that would reduce this cost by about half meaning you would match the electric course so if you were to buy a gasoline car for that had 60 mile per gallon fuel economy and fuel remained at 2.35 cents uh then you could get similar price uh as far as moving that car from one spot to another as an electric car now again that's dependent on energy being cheap on gasoline being cheap so a lot of variables here but you have the tool to play around with it uh curious to know what you guys think about all of this love to hear your thoughts in the comments below thank you all so much for watching
