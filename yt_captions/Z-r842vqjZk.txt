ladies and gentlemen it's currently early September 2023 and one of the most unimaginable collaborations is taking place me with Magnus Carlson no not not not really he's a lot cooler than I am but chess has partnered with supercell the creators of Clash of Clans and Clash Royale and for this week only there are Clash bots on chess.com and there's a big event that's going to happen on September 7th 2023. of course you could be watching this in 2024 2025 who knows if YouTube will still exist then uh in this video I'm going to play the strongest clashbot on chess.com the Archer Queen uh and the Archer Queen has an extremely powerful uh ELO the other Bots are Barbarian and you'll see that the board changes which is super cool uh giant Goblin Valkyrie hog rider Witch Wizard and Pekka we've beaten them all when you play the Archer Queen the board splits in half I have never seen something like this the Archer Queen is extremely powerful uh I think I'm going to uh start with the black pieces and we're gonna do our best the Archer Queen plays onto D4 and says Archer Queen Queen of the archers well yeah that's kind of implied um I'm gonna play Knight F6 standard move can I can I go here okay the the this is just for design right this is like an ocean okay uh the the bot says I'm no amateur I can see what you're doing they have little lines you could play the bots on chess.com yourself I know you're not an amateur your rating is higher than mine I'm gonna play Pawn to E6 standard move opponent is going to play Knight C3 says I would have played differently it's moved two who programs these Bots somebody on chess.com's team needs to say the Archer Queen has a has a line I would have played differently it's the second move of the game I mean are you kidding me anyway this is the nimso Indian uh you pin the Knight to the king you take away some of the control of the center of the board I'm gonna Castle now uh and then I'm gonna and then I'm gonna build up in the center and when capturing here becomes available I will I will do it uh actually I kind of want to do it now to damage the structure otherwise the Archer Queen could have moved the Knight to E2 and now I'm gonna put pawns on dark squares and try to rebuild my dark squares uh Archer Queen is kind of trying to take some Center space I'm gonna play E5 now probably Knight here and I'm going to do the exact same thing now we have a moment here where neither one of us wants to do anything with these pawns so I'm Adept at taking out Knights watch out that's very clever because there's Knights and Clash I'm gonna shut up now um so white doesn't want to take because that would leave doubled isolated pawns and I don't want to take because I would undouble White's pawns and give white a very powerful Center so this is going to be here for a while I'm gonna go H6 to prevent myself from getting pinned and I think in general a good strategy when you play against bots is to like create a very locked structure and a very in you know impenetrable structure um so rookie eight and we're just gonna you know we're just gonna sit and we're gonna wait at some point maybe maybe white can play the move C5 uh maybe I'll just play Bishop B7 for now preparing potentially long-term pressure actually this was a terrible move uh it walked directly into C5 I really have to be more careful maybe bishop A6 is not bad to pressure on that diagonal instead I think the Archer Queen is trying to hit my queen which is down here I think I'll slide over so my Bishop is always protected and C5 is not a thing Bishop D2 is a reasonable move uh maybe now Bishop A6 again I'm I'm really just sort of waiting like what you know at some point yeah we're sort of shuffling here at some point white is probably going to to do something I would imagine uh what if I what if I just Shuffle back and forth well the bot self-destruct like if I just literally slide my king back and forth and nobody does anything ah the bot is gonna prepare that move yeah I probably should have respected what the bot can do I'm anticipating the move C5 that's my that's my big anticipation um I'm still waiting we're kind of shuffling here Knight A5 is is an interesting move I think I'm gonna play it a little bit more pressure there I yeah like I'm just waiting I'm just stalling I'm just what is the bot gonna do I'm not gonna move are we just gonna repeat am I gonna get a draw uh I mean I'm just moving what are you gonna do it's just you can't has the bot given up and the bot is talking trash now it said a clear shot I have found the solution to the Archer Queen just move back and forth C5 is probably gonna happen no all right the bot has a new plan terrifying absolutely terrifying um I don't know what this new plan entails I guess the night is going there um okay is it because I'm just gonna take right what if I'm still gonna do nothing F4 uh-oh uh oh turns out that if you play the same move ten times versus the bot you might get yourself in trouble okay the bot does not want to draw uh it wants to attack me uh I'm gonna come back anyway not because I'm stalling but because okay but now the file is open which could be the bot said cannon fodder oh my God it's uh it's really trash talking me uh let's uh let's slide out of the way because we don't want to get sacrificed or anything uh now we're gonna we're gonna bring our forces over here I'm not I'm not scared so play defense play defense everything is good can't move this Pawn okay I don't what are you trying to take space away from me I'll slide my queen over no gives room for my Bishop it's really difficult to follow all the pieces because they all look very strange but we will do our best uh I want to go here but then H5 is a thing not really thrilled about that this is attacking my Pawn a cuckoo Queen D6 that doesn't look did I hang a piece no take that's not gonna I thought I blundered because I thought take and take but I can take but as the idea take is that is that what we're doing is is the bot gonna go here oh right oh that oh yeah oh this could be bad um let's trade Queens okay oh but I'm I'm under a lot of pressure here oh man yeah it's gonna be very tough I'm under pressure here I'm gonna have to drop the Knight back and the second that I drop the Knight back uh I think the bot is gonna immediately try to take the file and infiltrate with the oh oh it oh wow oh it's just it's just coming in it's not I think I'm gonna sack a pawn to double my opponent's pawns but ah I don't know this is looking a little bit sus as the children say Knight to B6 maybe Knight A5 is gonna happen oh no leave me alone did you the butt you said do I care to resign what the bot literally the last message it wrote was care to resign let's see if you will actually be able to take it it knows that I'm gonna take its Pawn oh my God it literally just said let's see if you're actually gonna be able to yo terrifying oh my goodness absolutely terrifying stuff all right at least this is defended what if I you know what I'm gonna sack my Rook for defense I'm sacking my Rook for oh there is no defense here there's a fine line between skill and luck shut up man that's not even I can't even say that it's not even you're the Archer Queen all right I am a bishop down uh you know I've I've had better positions I'm also my opponent also has a past Pawn which uh and now is going to go here and then take that and yep and then I'm gonna lose my knight and then oh oh it's force me oh it's force made oh it's force checkmating me I can win battles with a handful of archers this is nothing all right I'm gonna take and get checkmated I got checkmated the bot said who's okay me me I I'm next because I need YouTube content all right I'm gonna play a game with white let's play a game I'm gonna do well with white I I'm not all right here we go E4 E5 I'm gonna play my Vienna she said I'm no amateur I can see what you're doing bro it's the Vienna I mean stop it okay this is normal night takes Queen F3 that's what that's not a move what is that I can see the benefits of this movie I mean I would hope so considering you played it that would make sense um Maybe what isn't this just a free Pawn what that's just I just I want a pawn what am I no she's still talking trash she said you Telegraph that move so much I didn't think you would actually follow through these lines sound really sophisticated but they make no sense in the context of Chess it's very funny um I'm gonna pin the Knight to the king and she said the Knight can defend against that easily threat terminated bro I don't feel so good I really this is this is brutal I my goodness okay if I go Queen here is that check a problem maybe I have to go Queen here but then something like Pawn to H5 is gonna happen I'm not feeling too good about this position I feel like I'm about to get hit with this move okay for some reason that was not the best move I don't know why I'm not going to ask any questions she said an acceptable loss outstanding all right we're developed and we're upon up she said I can see what you're doing I I'm just developing can you leave me alone okay I don't see all if I play Pawn to C3 to try to play Pawn to D4 I think the Archer Queen is going to play Bishop to B5 I think that's the big idea so maybe I developed my d-pawn instead maybe I play Queen C4 C3 Bishop B5 can I move my queen to like E4 maybe bishop D3 how brutal is that looks pretty brutal that does not look very good let's go D3 I mean I I'm a pawn up now now she's small talking me do you prefer the Builder base or the home Village what are we six years old Queen to D4 okay that Pawn's hanging there's a threat here and black is probably going to Castle I could take but then I feel like I'm gonna get slaughtered C3 here King D1 maybe or or or or or or or or we trade the Queens let's trade the Queens oh yes this is just normal this is a completely good position for us wait a minute this is fantastic I can't lose this I'm gonna go King F3 because the king is important in the end game she said easy to track such as such a slow moving piece classic King Behavior what pushy is unhinged she is talking that trash Oh my goodness she said I'm surprised you have moved well bro it's a pawn how much trash is she gonna talk I think C5 is a good move now oh I'm getting okay I see I'm gonna get checked a little bit here now oh man her Trash Talk got to me it really did I'm I'm I'm really perplexed I didn't know how to handle myself maybe Pawn to G3 I need to block this bishop and I need to make my king safe okay wait I'm gonna get into an end game hold on a minute wait a minute I I can't lose this game she talked all that trash but we gonna get a draw rookie one let's go this counts right a draw counts versus such a powerful bot I think all right now maybe it's not even a draw maybe I can play it like for a win I I need to really chill out but you know Pawn to B3 I need to put pawns on opposite colors uh that of my opponent right of my opponent's Bishop it's a bishop end game I can't lose this I mean I'd have to be really stupid to try to lose this somehow I I don't know uh Pawn to C4 and and I got you know I think I got a good thing going here onto H3 just make sure I can't get taken my friends I I don't know I don't know if even I as stupid as I am could lose this end game I mean I I'm gonna try my best to lose it but what did she say I wanna introduce you to a friend of mine this is a cl45h crossbow 10 millimeter with over and under 30 millimeter Pump Action Bolt what what is she saying bro all right G4 I you know what I'm done I don't even know what's happening anymore Pawn takes Pawn takes my friends I think I'm drawing the Archer Queen I think I'm not gonna lose Pawn to A4 all the pawns are on light squares life is good we have good spatial control I think we might get a draw I don't know if I'm playing for a win or not that's the only thing I I don't quite understand but um if I take the king is going to get active and what is the only way I could lose this game because I gotta I gotta make sure I don't do that I gotta I gotta find the way not to lose I just have to I guess not allow just Bishop F2 right there's not that's it what and and what I mean I'm terrified but like so what defended can't do anything to me you can't do it she can't do anything to me oh my gosh this is crazy this might be the best day of my life second to getting married she can't do anything she's gonna play F4 I'm just gonna go here this is nuts oh my goodness I'm gonna put my king in the center wait a minute she might even be throwing a little bit because now I'm getting oh wait a minute oh we in business now oh we are in business wait wait wait can can the king wait a minute oh this is not this is scary wait I didn't mess up right here my friends this is this is some scary stuff if here I can still stop the pawn okay Life Is Good Life Is Good King E4 oh my oh let's go let's make a draw we're gonna make a draw I'm gonna draw the Archer Queen yes absolutely massive hold you know what one last one one last one that was unsatisfactory rematch no I don't want to play Black I don't want to play Black I did not want to play Black I don't like can I play White Nobody's Gonna Know she didn't win she didn't excuse me she didn't win all right D4 that was good nice that was that was a nice game by me um get ready for the toughest Battle of your life of my life I drew you do you know how bad you have to be to draw me let's play uh let's play the Raptor variation of the trumpowski opening trying to take trying to get our uh okay Knight here offering an exchange uh that's a move I guess I can play in a Gambit style I can give away my Pawn but I feel like since I'm playing a bot I probably should not play a Gambit a simple threat avoided yo you don't need to commentate on every single move I know what's happening too I'm 2800. my goodness this is she's mansplaining is what she's doing she's mansplaining to me I know how to play chess ridiculous um Knight E2 or Knight F3 activity seems like a good idea oh we're getting an uh another middle game all right no Queens on for this one either okay wow for an Archer Queen she sure hates Queens I gotta I gotta tell you uh I'm gonna take like this I think little imbalance maybe fight on over here I gotta Slide by Bishop by the way we got Rooks we got nice we got Bishops that's all we need it's a party let's go it's a party all right I think she's gonna try to prepare something like this so maybe uh maybe I play B4 before it looks like an interesting idea to try to play B5 okay and maybe A4 right maybe A4 as well look at that taking space I think she's preparing something over here I honestly can't even really tell so let's let's bring my Rook over are we chilling we gotta we got a nice position um I might have an idea in the future to put my knight on C5 so maybe I'll I gotta be careful how I prepare these things because I feel like you know again this move is very powerful for black I want to play Rook C2 it's still unclear which way I want to double my my Rooks uh okay E2 and and maybe this maybe maybe the reroute idea let's just slide out of the way so I'm not hit by any pawns at any point and then maybe we go for this maybe we do this E5 maybe Knight B3 a G5 instead so now I'm gonna slide my king to F1 so my Pawn is defended so I can always take back okay did I blunder something I just always assume I'm blundering something you know especially when the bot plays a move and I'm like oh wow I didn't expect that all right this is defended I'm not I'm not so concerned uh maybe I should be concerned because now I can't play Knight P3 I can knight C5 right A5 first followed by Knight C5 take Rook B7 oh this is actually a very interesting move I think okay and now I had calculated Knight C5 which attacks that A5 Knight B7 there's also the immediate A5 Knight D7 and then Knight C5 when the bishop is hanging and the Knight if Bishop takes I might have Rook takes B7 uh and if Knight takes I think I had Rook B4 this is looking a little bit this is looking a little tasty for me I'm not gonna lie isn't it I feel like I'm accomplishing something no am I not accomplishing anything Rook takes B7 surely the surely I'm accomplishing something this is nuts I'm very scared this was my big idea Rook takes B7 oh I see you defend and then Aha and then I take and now my Rook is hanging but is that so scary like what if I go here seventh rank control that's under pressure my friends I'm not so sure about this I'm not so sure this bot knows what she's doing I'm down upon but the position looks really bad for black and I'm also about to not be down upon if I want I just gotta get this Rook involved what if I go here and then get in on the bifa yo yo that's looking great oh my goodness wait a minute I'm controlling the only open file I might just be winning what okay Rook F6 is a smart move I think now I'll just slide out of the way and I'm still patrolling E7 and I'm just gonna go Pawn to G3 and I think the bot has to sack wait wait I think I'm just beating the Archer Queen hold on a minute it's not over oh my goodness it's really not over whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa all right I got very excited I mean I thought I was just on the verge of a pure win Bishop F6 Rook f8 Rook G7 check could be another draw are we gonna get another draw or can we win is there a way to win this take Rook f8 Rook C6 oh if take there's a fork well that could have been really bad so what do I do if I can't do that do I stall do I play Rook H7 it's a huge moment in my career this is going to Define me as a chess player for the rest of my life where do I go Rook A6 Knight C7 I really don't have anything there I can't like sack my heartbreaking Bishop B7 looks possible but it also looks dumb I'm gonna go kick G1 I'm just wasting a move okay I still can't take the pawn what am I doing oh my goodness oh why did I do it this way that was not smart um Rook C7 this is so stressful Rook C7 okay but but now I can take G7 back all right she's playing some crazy defense here um but I have a pass I think that's that that thing that guy is going right Bishop E7 Maybe Bishop E7 Rook F7 check but then I'm a little bit stuck then I'm a little bit stuck I can also take and play Rook D6 then I'm gonna lose this Pawn I kind of don't want to trade my Rooks is that am I nuts I don't know if I have a choice though I don't know if I have a choice I'm gonna take and then go here but I I don't know I feel like I'm losing a really important Pawn yeah oh this is so this is so close she's going for that pawn but I can win that pawn but I feel like this Knight is too powerful I also have this guarding my Pawn oh my goodness oh am I gonna lose because the Pawn's just coming down no oh take here here the pawn goes oh I can give it I can give it I could give a check maybe Rook here here Rook C6 check King up rook C7 oh my goodness this is so bad the night coming in oh that's brutal this hits the Knight maybe check wait I am I okay oh oh and now I can't take because it's a fork it's just a check no matter what I can't even defend myself I have to go like Bishop here or something this is insanity look at this position everything is defending everything else King she won am I winning am I losing oh now I can't take because oh no oh I lost I lost I think oh nice move oh nice move I can't take because Queen and if I take I lose my Bishop if I give a check I lose my Bishop brutal oh brutal brutal brutal brutal brutal oh and she said I too would Retreat when facing such a superior foe I'm not gonna lie I don't think that was half bad I really don't think that was half bad will it work if I if I pan uh okay I I know that it's it's cut off a little bit I I just want to see what the evaluation was like down here oh it was equal oh it was equal it was an equal position I was equal with the bot this was equal this end game I know it's cut off a bit oh what was my fatal mistake Bishop there it was equal even here wow tough I was not able to beat it I was not able to get I think any any real oh I mean I had some Advantage maybe some slight slight Advantage but in this middle game but oh that was tough tough half out of three but you know we won the Battle of sarcasm that is what we won um if you're watching this in early September uh of 2023 not of any other year uh chess clash is coming up on September 7th it's gonna be great if you're watching this at any point beyond that uh I hope it was a great event I hope you had a great rest of 2023 I you know I hope I hope life is good and um yeah I'll uh I'll see you when I see you get out of here
