battery life is I'd say the biggest bottleneck to today's smartphone experience and whilst there are new battery technologies on the horizon charges have just received a silent but at the same time completely game-changing update and that's the next best thing take a look at this the Anker PowerPort atom pd-1 okay it doesn't look all that revolutionary but bear with me here this provides 30 watts of power in a footprint this large in fact if you put it side-by-side with the equivalently powerful 12 inch macbook charger it's about 40% smaller its barely larger than a 5 watt iphone charger we've seen the same tech scaled up by a company called roth power who's built a 45 watt super charger that's half the size of a macbook charger and that's not even the core bit but before we can get to that what's going on here you've probably heard of silicon silicon is literally everywhere on this planet it actually makes up about 25% of the Earth's crust and this abundance is mostly why it's become the default choice for semiconductors the building block for all kinds of electronic devices anyways whilst silicon is still the default choice we've now got a lot of areas like charging where we're actually reaching the limits of how fast it can conduct electricity which on one hand is seriously cold but on the other hand means that there's got to be a material to replace it gallium nitride is shaping up to be just that and it is way faster in fact on a very theoretical level this gallium nitrate that we're seeing in these new generation charges has a potential to conduct electricity 1,000 times more efficiently than silicon these charges are based on an entirely different architecture which will no doubt lay the foundation for a massive leap forward and don't forget these are first gen products so undoubtedly future iterations will be even more compact and even more powerful but wait there's more silicon gets hot quickly gallium nitrate doesn't which means it's not just less prone to well blowing up and so it's safer but it also wastes less energy all the energy that has turned into heat with a traditional charger is energy that's not being used to charge your device if you've ever laid hands on a small phone fast charger after it's been in use or probably the worst culprit one of these then you'll know that that's a fair bit of wastage now having this efficiency becomes even more important when you're on the go when size and weight start to become a bit more of a problem get ready for power banks that are not just smaller and cooler but charge faster starting very soon and when you combine this with the graphene battery tech that's on its way people in ten years will be laughing at the idea of carrying around something like this gallium nitride has one more kind of surprising implication cheaper charges because it can result in products with a smaller footprint that means companies can spend less money on materials less money on packaging and therefore less on shipping their charges - not to mention that because of its improved efficiency using a gallium nitride charger would also mean less power draw and a cheaper electricity bill right now there is a bit of a price premium but that's really because it's just new tech and well these companies have the power to but as soon as it becomes a competitive market those prices are going to fall straight down okay this is a bit of a long shot but if Apple started shipping their next generation iPhones with a gallium nitride charger and they built their phones to fully utilize this tech then with no increase to the size of the packaging you could be getting a charger that works up to six times faster than the current ones and that's really exciting in fact all of this is but there's a bigger picture here some of the experts are saying that this compound is so potentially game-changing that if the entire world started adopting it then worldwide power consumption could drop by 10 to 25% and that's not factoring in all the other efficiency gains future products will have and so the obvious spin off of this is how fast can they build one of these charges and I be curious to know if you guys would want to see some sort of side by side charging speed comparison let me know thank you so much for watching and if you enjoyed the video if you could drop a serve but that would be massively appreciate it as always my name is Erin and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
