ladies and gentlemen there are a few greater feelings in the world than actively improving at the game of chess succeeding in something so mentally stimulating so emotionally captivating and in today's video I'm specifically focusing on a very famous chess Prodigy and Rising Talent and that individual is named Frank I've recently been making content with Frank he's around 400 ELO and he got his first brilliant move and that's what I'm going to show you in this video oh and a friendly reminder you could pre-order my book link is in the description it's already top 35 on Amazon that's crazy all of you did that thank you so much folks Frank gets an honorary Grandmaster title for today's video for getting a brilliant move for the first time everybody remembers their first brilliant move some of you may not because you haven't gotten one yet or because you get so many Frank a principled man at this point starting his games with a King's Pawn E2 to E4 his opponent Grand Master threes responds with E5 all good so far now I told Frank to play the Vienna I actually gave him a homework assignment I told him to learn the Vienna he did what all good 400s do he learned one move of the Vienna and now he doesn't know the Vienna anymore um I will be teaching him a little bit more about the Vienna of course uh or maybe I will teach him you know King's Gambit or something completely insane quite play the Vienna we have a Four Knights it doesn't matter we have a 4 -9 it's a game between turrets if you took a sample size of every game the two 400s ever played against each other the chance of this being the starting position is very very high now this is a very back and forth game this is a slobber knocker if you will uh Bishop C4 is good castles uh and then you know in D4 and so on uh now I taught Frank to put two Pawns in the center and he's listening it's just beautiful stuff uh and this is why you should listen this is why putting two Pawns in the center is a good thing because when your opponent takes you take with the Knight and now you've got Bishops coming out and you will be castling also a lot of people at Noob level don't know how to keep tension they see that they can take something so they do whereas they don't need to take anything this is very well defended and the best move here at Grand Master Level is playing the move Bishop before which pins the Knight to the king so that's that would be the best move uh and uh instead of that black plays Knight takes D4 in one second I may add Knight takes D4 and traditionally this is actually like pretty bad for white to bring out the queen because it's a bit dangerous uh but uh but but actually in this case it's not bad at all the queen is very strong you can also Castle Queen side and the only way to get rid of the queen is with a knight and that's not possible because you traded it and this move is not very good because now that square is very weak and I can still go here and I can you know develop and you've blocked your Bishop it was a very short-sighted decision uh which is why taking on D4 is bad and black follows up with an even worse move in one second and loses the game on the spot the game is over Bishop to B4 and we see this says why black should have played Bishop B4 in this position because black actually made one inaccuracy and then proceeded to hang a bishop look at Black's time management one second one second you four hundreds need to stop doing this if you are 400 ELO in chess you need to stop doing this you need to stop booting up you need to stop booting up a 10 minute game and playing every move in one second Knight takes D4 inaccuracy one second Bishop B4 hanging a bishop in one move to the queen that you just brought out and you did all of that in two seconds why are you playing a 10 minute game if you're gonna lose all your pieces in two seconds I mean if you want to last two seconds play bullet all right or go on a date or something anyway now Frank is winning all right Frank is winning terrific he's won a bishop fantastic stuff here now how do you win this position you got to develop what hasn't been developed yet you got a castle all right Bishop G5 Bishop F4 Bishop D3 you got a castle I don't hate Frank's next move but I don't like it either because he's moving something that he already moved which is just a bad habit uh in this position you obviously have to look for checks this check doesn't do anything like just blocks you can't take anything so just develop a piece I don't hate this move because he's up so I don't care that he's trading I I think Knight D5 is completely fine uh of course black takes because that's what black does and now Frank is just up a clean Bishop all right Queen E7 check now here Frank plays a really sophisticated move a lot of beginners they think I'm in check so I have to uh I have to move my king no you can block with a bishop all right uh either is good Frank chooses this one and in this position something absolutely catastrophic happens um Frank's opponent plays C5 attacking his Queen and some of you more advanced and uh experienced folks will realize the queen doesn't have to move here at all what's more forcing than attacking a queen you could maybe give a check but that would be the queen moving you could give a check but that's illegal because you're pinned so what well you see Frank could have passanteed this pawn and he missed it he missed it he saw his Queen was hanging so he gave a check do I hate him for it no Queen B5 check now his opponent blocks the check he blocks the check but now the bishop blocks the Queen's vision of the pawn Frank plays Queen beside Frank Franklin like a Grandmaster Frank playing like an absolute Grandmaster um now his opponent plays Queen to d8 which is considered a slight in accuracy but obviously you're defending the Rook and now dear friends one of the greatest moves in the history of Chess was played as Frank in this position played Bishop G5 a brilliant move according to chess.com Sensational stuff Bishop to G5 the clouds opened up and then you heard the Angels Sing actually they probably sang fresh Bishop to G5 hits the queen and the queen cannot take because of this now on the hierarchy of brilliant moves this is La this is a little lower than some other things chess.com gives you brilliant points when you play a creative sacrificing move that also happens to be like a top computer move um in this position white can play probably about 10 moves and maintain an advantage like white can play H3 uh H4 G3 F3 F4 Bishop E3 C3 B3 A3 castles Bishop like literally any of the moves that I just played why probably going to be better like plus eight but Bishop G5 is a very very creative idea to try to deflect the queen away from The Rook uh and this is very nice and Frank you know of course the he's 400 all right like it's if any of you are parents or have younger siblings or are four years old yourself you know that if a four-year-old comes to the the kitchen and says look what I made and they tell you it's a penguin and it looks like someone just diarrhea on the floor you tell them it looks like a penguin okay four-year-old spoiler alert I don't know why you're watching this but your parents are lying to you it doesn't look like a penguin so Bishop G5 for all it's a great it's beautiful very nice tactical vision and you know what I gotta give credit to the opponent he ruined the party he played the move F6 now what Frank should have done here is you should she should have followed up with another Haymaker he should have played Bishop H5 check and then he should have like sacrificed the bishop and got the but Frank you know principled man played a brilliant move induced more light-squared weaknesses and targets the pawn on D6 and his opponent plays King E7 and now Frank plays long castle and let's see as Grandmaster Frank on his climb to 500 ELO converts this position up a bishop and a Pawn off the heels of the first brilliant move of his career it's like when a baseball player hits their first home run Rook to B8 Queen takes A7 and now he is up two pawns and he will zig and zag out of here how do you win a winning position you either simplify or you deliver a mate if I'm playing white here I'm going Bishop G4 and I'm gonna trade my queen and my Bishop for blacks Queen and Bishop and then I'm gonna get my rook in take a few pawns and make a queen G5 all right now I I don't like Bishop D2 it's a little bit too congested I would rather go Bishop to G3 but okay fine now in this position Frank finds his way out this is really really nice he does find his way out his opponent plays Queen to C7 and is probably gonna try to bring the Rooks down here it's far from over from black for black if black hides his King on G7 away from danger white still has a responsibility to find a way in here like this is not over and also you can use the B file for counter play alright now Frank it's time for Frank to use his Bishops and line up his Rooks okay as I always say when you're up material you have to utilize it but first he saves his Queen I don't blame him he is British after all um and uh made the queen obviously rest in peace and should there be a future Queen obviously everybody from from uh from that part of the world will in fact be protecting her all right so my sincere condolences uh to everybody uh from uh from the UK or I guess from England I guess it would be England I never know as an American by by the way I never know like my whole life I grew up saying people said UK then they say England so but please forgive me if I say some incorrect terminology I'm an American I don't know any other country exists uh so H5 now H5 is a peculiar move for sure and here Frank starts doing uh some things that I that I absolutely hate okay and this is going to be a teachable moment Frank has a queen two Bishops and two Rooks his opponent's king is in the center what should he be doing he should be mercilessly hunting the king like he should be putting his Rook putting his Queen he's got to bring the heavy artillery to the king H3 is one of the worst moves I think uh Frank it's not a bad move like Frank here could could could probably just leave the house for an hour and come back and probably still win like that's how good his position I guess not he would lose on time but then like Frank Frank what are we doing here like what what what why don't no just because your opponent is pushing Pawns in chess doesn't mean you also have to push pawns this is PSA to all you H3 H4 now he starts doing like why is the opponent trying to trade pawns the opponent is dead lost the only thing the opponent can do here is go for the king and folks this is what you should do if you're losing you gotta look at this you know what would have been a better like Bishop B5 like you gotta create some threats all right you're completely lost now Frank takes now the opponent tries to sneak a pawn through now here I like what Frank does I think this was an accidental good move Frank plays G5 when I say accidental good move I mean it's a good move and the idea is clearly you know to open up the King right the king is now wide open and the King cannot Escape so the king is going to stay in the center check is going to come in and you gotta mate soon all right bring the Rook bring the bishop bring the other bit like you got something why I call it an accidental good move is because after fg5 Franco's here I mean he doesn't he he doesn't play Bishop takes G5 and again it's plus 14 or 17 or it's plus 10 I mean he's completely winning why is he completely winning he's up a bishop in two pawns and also Black's King is in the center of the board that that's why he's completely winning that is mostly why he is completely winning and now we have gf4 and again Frank is not moving The Bishop's in front of his Rooks he's got to use the Bishops in front of the Rick to get to the game because he has a material advantage and the only way he's gonna convert It Is by giving a mate oh God now c4 first of all free Pawn L plus Bozo plus ratio plus you fell off Queen takes C4 is just a free pun but Franco's here I don't hate it he's going to the king he's finally got it okay he's got his ducks in a row he's gonna play Queen G7 next Pawn to H2 is a terrible move Queen to G7 exactly as Frank planned putting the King on the back rank the the the brain here is firing on multiple directions okay Bishop Z4 is crazy that is a crazy move but I don't hate it and now at least you have an open file and you have Queen G7 Frank let's go Rook H4 is not bad it's trying to you know pin it's doing something give a check give a check the king is wide open give a check I love it beautiful stuff King F7 now there are no checks here but you can line up the bishop and that's actually mate that is mate Queen G7 is a mate because the king's got nowhere to go all right Queen G7 covers all the Escape squares in this position Frank plays a move that if you gave me a million dollars I would not be able to explain to you he plays the move A3 I I don't know what his plan was uh maybe he was worried about back rank mate but I got news for you there was never any background made possible because Rooks are not kangaroos uh and not to mention that actually doesn't stop back rank made at all that is still back rank made uh so I don't know he plays A3 now his opponent plays Bishop B5 which again Frank is winning so he should trade some pieces here he does and now make a battery I mean he just recently learned about batteries he should be making a battery pack no Frank completely unprompted hangs a rook he hangs a rook to so unnecessarily may I Frank and you know what the craziest part is he's still winning it's still Plus 60. the hands of God were going to make sure that in his first game playing a brilliant move Frank was going to win his opponent plays Rook to H5 and now Frank justifies this plan Rook to G7 on the board that gets an honorary brilliant for me it wasn't actually a brilliant but it gets an honorary brilliant King E8 he takes Rook H takes D5 and now the Rook hits the queen but the queen can go here boom rank wins now you know what's funny in this position this is almost made which is why you always look for checks that's almost the mate like there is a universe in which the King was here and and so white has to do this and never lose the queen all right and then you know white is still threatening that uh a great game by Frank all right Frank started this game with an opening we learned he played a four nights he got a good position his opponent gave him a present Frank proceeded to trade Knights protected his King took a couple of Pawns this is sensational then he castled and now the way you win a game like this is you don't block your pieces your Bishops need to Target things and then get your Rooks in the game and stop all of this Dilly dallying stuff with the pawn so you don't need to do any of that Swift execution of the opponent get to the king don't dilly dally don't play random pawn moves don't hang a Rooks and yet with all that we still converted and we won a very nice game and that is how Frank got his first brilliant move I'll see you back here for another Frank video when he hits 500 ELO now get out of here
