super mario world has been entertaining gamers for decades when it was released back in 1991 it was probably the most anticipated game ever and boy did it live up to the hype it had everything the first three nes games had and even more more power ups more worlds yoshi and even an extremely memorable soundtrack in recent years however the game has been pushed to its absolute limit by a few runners in fact by going directly to the star world beating those levels and then beating the final level it's possible to beat the game while going through just 11 level exits fittingly speaking of this category are known as 11 exit for the past 10 years this has been the most run category of super mario world world record has come a long way so today we're going to see how the world record for super mario world has progressed to start we're gonna go back to 2004. back then there was no twitch nobody streamed their attempts of the game live but rather recorded them onto a vhs tape and uploaded their finished runs onto a website one of the biggest names of the time was scott kessler one of his most famous runs was a super mario world run accomplished on april 28th 2004 he did what so many other runs of the time did amaze people even though a few sections were a bit sloppy it was still amazing to see this so well known game be completely destroyed by someone for the next few months kessler and another player lucid fia went back and forth with the record each run that kessler and lucidfire had done had been executed slightly better than the previous one ultimately though castle would remain on top getting an 11 10 in july of the same year years passed and nobody could beat kessler's 11 10. he had a few small mistakes but it seemed like nobody was willing to grind out a perfect run in 2007 though a legendary mario player decided to test his skills on super mario world andrew g 1990 already famous for his super mario bros speed runs andrew knew that he had the skill to top kessler's three-year-old run and with a few strategy changes he was able to pull it off in 11 minutes flat one trick that andrew discovered in this run was keeping your flight speed through the doors by sliding into a door in a particular way and doing a jump immediately as you enter the next room you keep the flight speed that you had from the previous room and are able to accelerate much quicker because of that trick and a couple of other fancy maneuvers andrew had mirrored what he had recently done in mario one taking the record from scott kessler in epic fashion but just one month after andrew got the record lucidfire came back and took it from andrew the main reason he was able to do so is because of the donut secret house andrew thought that the patterns of the level were random so he made a few small mistakes losing a few seconds but lucidfire realized the first time he played the level on every run the pattern was exactly the same each time so he was able to breeze through the level and save time over andrew ultimately closed out a run in 1059 becoming the first player to get a sub 11 minute time then over the next year and a half three japanese runners took turns lower in the record yaposun yoltsuba and menbu93 each one had slight improvements over the long before whether it be better movement or slightly different strategies perhaps the biggest time save was its decision to take a different route through bowser's castle to allow the runner to keep the cape for the bowser fight this speeds up the fight drastically saving several seconds ultimately though by mid-2011 the apostol was able to get a 10-44 in a nearly perfect run without the discovery of some major new strategy it seemed to many like the run was just about at its end with the japanese runners on top but a few months later that major new strategy was found the orb glitch the orb is an item that normally only appears in one level sunken ghost ship when you touch it it calls for the end of the level so the coarse clear message comes on the screen and then the level exits as this is just meant to be the end of a strangely designed level it was not meant to be picked up by yoshi and put into your inventory but it turns out there's a way around that in yoshi's island one the second level of the game there's an enemy called the clapping chuck midway through the stage under normal circumstances this enemy cannot be eaten by yoshi however for whatever reason the programmer still made it so that if the chuck somehow was eaten it would still trigger an item to appear in your inventory if you go to the point right before the truck is on screen there's an enemy that turns into a coin when you hit it with a fireball you need to spin jump off of yoshi hitting this enemy with a fireball and turning it into a coin which yoshi will attempt to eat however instead because mario just jumped off of yoshi he will collect the coin first and yoshi grabs an off-screen item in this case the chuck and due to the way the game is programmed the item that the game produces when yoshi gets a chuck with fire mario is you guessed it the orb using this orb would have the same properties when you normally found it in sunken go ship it would end the level immediately so runners decided to use in the extremely long first castle level as you could easily get to it by climbing to the top this trick ended up saving about 15 seconds and led the way to a new era of super mario world speedrunning dozens of runners want to either lower their pv or go for the record using this new orb trick for a few months in 2012 runners scrambled to try and lower the record down yeposon men boo and the legendary dram 55 all held the world record at some point in 2012 and eventually the time came down to sub 10 30. even andrew g came pretty close missing world record by only about 5 seconds but one night in january 2013 men boo streamed attempts and closed out one of the most impressive runs of any game in history just how good was this run i'll let you decide from his reaction [Music] this run literally had everything go exactly as planned his movement was basically perfect the best mario runners from around the world tried to beat it drem55 andrew g and x-paco all put tons of attempts in but nobody could top medbu it seemed like this run would stand for years and years to come and it very well might have if it wasn't for the discovery of another major trick the cloud glitch to perform this trick runners would only have to go to the first level of the game yoshi's island 2. there you hop onto yoshi and eat a koopa shell allowing you to spit out three fireballs at a very precise time then while you continue running you eat another green shell and hang on to it once you stop here you spit out the shell and face left when the fireball hits the shell it will turn into a coin you dismount off a yoshi and collect the coin right before you should be able to eat it just like with the orb glitch yoshi then defaults to eating an off-screen item the charging chuck the item that will appear in the inventory will look like a garbled mess but it's really lackituse cloud normally you'd think that having this cloud wouldn't actually be too helpful but it turns out that you can save close to a minute on a bowser fight with it why well the memory address that controls when bowser throws the mechagoopas which are needed to beat them are stored on the same address that controls lakitu's cloud's x-coordinate this means that when the cloud goes off to the left side of the screen bowser is forced to throw more mecha koopas that you can hit him with as if this wasn't enough the game also happens to store bowser's animations such as when he flies in and out on the same address that stores the cloud's y coordinate therefore flying off the top of the screen the runner can skip parts of bowser's movement scenes when this trick was discovered in june of 2014 dozens of runners scramble to try and get the record in a scene mirroring when orb was discovered everyone knew that members record could be easily beaten now the question was by how much the first person to close out a decent round with the clown glitch was a runner named link dead x2 who got a 10 22 beating the old record by four seconds all right that's fine oh that's not not that great still better that's more of what i wanted but even he admitted that the time could go lower there's still a lot way still a lot more room for improvement and he was right within the span of just one week from june 13th to june 20th 2014 runners link dead x2 dram 55 x-paco 5 and artiga omega took the record down from 1022 to a 956. [Music] oh yeah even with shitty zips boom baby there we go nah i can't make it to scdq for months after runners kept knocking off a few seconds each run was more impressive than the last and the time was being pushed to its absolute limit all right now got it got it first run of the day oh my god there it is there it is i did it 46 let's go the record got pushed down to a 945.63 by runner area 51 which is the current best time all right boys you guys ready for a new you guys ready for a new um retime what do you think we gotta re-time this but while all of this was going on a new method of being the game was being slowly pieced together by both passers and speedrunners the credits warp by doing a really complex series of inputs it's possible to warp the game to the ending credits in a matter of minutes to get a complete understanding of how the glitch works i recommend that you watch this video by dots are cool but i'll give you a quick rundown on what you need to do essentially you need to make it so that the game's code is determined by the exposition of certain enemies the player must manipulate koopa shells p-switches berries and other objects in just the right way so they are placed on the exact pixel where they need to be needless to say each of these positionings are extremely precise this way when the player executes what's known as the item swap glitch where the game runs the aforementioned exposition code it tells the game to take the player directly into the credits the first person to execute this trick in a run in real time was famous youtuber and twitch streamer seth blink this type of run seemed to look like something that was tas only so seth bling was pretty excited once he got the trick to work time time it was whoa i just did it that's the first time anyone has ever done that on console that's that's the console super mario world world record for any percent just two months later runners were able to cut their record down to under two minutes by using a faster method of getting the items in the correct positions and since then it's been a non-stop battle to get the record lower various runners have been taking turns lowering the record since its discovery more than two years ago now the record stands at 113 held by furious potentially though the time can still go down if more consistent and faster setups are found as the tool assisted run is only 41 seconds long what the [Music] is it i'm not going to make in the past 13 years this game has gone from a simple run from start to finish to literally rewriting the game's code with koopa shells and finding a way to run it to beat the game in just a minute these are defined as separate categories 11 exit and credits work and both have cost thousands upon thousands of people to watch super mario world be speedrun both of the categories are incredibly impressive both as a viewer and as a runner and these runs are sure to sing the test of time and be viewed years from now thanks for watching everyone i'll see you next time you
