[Music] all right what's up mkbhd here and if you've followed me over the past couple weeks on twitter or instagram then you've witnessed it it's gone down again for the third straight year the blind smartphone camera test 2020. so it's originally started as an idea to sort of crown an unofficial best unbiased smartphone camera but as we've learned from doing this it's turned into a much more philosophical psychological test on social media so here's how it works behind the scenes we take 16 smartphone cameras that all came out this year and a good variety too all the way from the favorites the titans the heavy hitters all the way down to some mid-range phones and even budget phones and we organize them all into a sort of seated bracket style of what we think is fair and then we let them loose we label each one with a letter a through p and then we go through and take the exact same photo from the same spot with every single phone and put them side by side and have you guys vote on them on twitter and instagram stories which you think is better you don't know what phone you're voting for you just pick a letter and the final results are pretty much always wild and at least a little bit unexpected just a couple spoilers slash examples for you we've done this three years running no one phone and actually no one company has ever won more than once and actually the iphone has never made it out of the first round ever now listen this isn't a scientific test at all matter of fact it's kind of the opposite of a scientific test a lot of people on twitter and instagram were wondering why we didn't do a sample control photo or something like that from a dslr we were just keeping it super simple bracket style we might be surprised by the winner but no matter what happens we're going to learn a lot about the way our brains work looking at pictures so with that being said after over 10 million votes this year let's go over the results so here's the initial bracket of those letters and here are the phones behind those letters so now you can see all of the first round matchups the way they were seated and if you want you can go ahead and pause the video right now and go ahead and fill out your bracket go ahead make your predictions knowing which cameras you think are the best knowing how they'll compare to each other which one do you think should go all the way to the end and come out on top go ahead all right you've written that down you didn't fast forward you didn't cheat now let's go through how the actual bracket went spoiler alert you're probably wrong but okay first photo uh was just a picture of me so i'm wearing a black shirt i'm in front of a window and there's plenty of other things to judge the photo from so there's colors there's skin tones of course the red controller the yellow ottoman blue sky blue couch colorful pillow green plant and lots of dynamic range happening but at the end of the day the most scientific part about this was our goal was to take the type of photos that most people would normally take so a lot of human subjects and you'll see more of that coming up but also we didn't tap to focus because what we actually learned from google after our previous results is they have a lot of data suggesting most people don't tap to focus so we didn't anyway here's how the first round went so starting off here with moto edge that actually beat iphone se right off the bat then we have mate 40 pro getting a pretty huge win over the poco f2 the poco was kind of a favorite from previous years but there goes that one then you have pixel 5 scoring a huge win over the oppo find x2 pro then you have lg wing losing to zenfone 7 pro squeaks out that win over here then on the other side we have surface duo never really stood a chance against the sony xperia 1 mark ii so that was a win we were probably all expecting then me 10 ultra did get a win against the oneplus 8 pro and iphone 12 pro max got absolutely destroyed by the mid-range oneplus 8t and then last but not least our defending champ the note one last year note 20 ultra does get a win over pixel 4a so go ahead check your brackets if you still have a perfect bracket you're probably lying but that's that's a lot in one round so next photo was a dimly lit top down kind of replicating more like bar lighting with a warm edison bulb off camera mixing with far away window light so again lots of colors and lots of textures again we made this whole setup uh not quite dark enough for any of these phones to kick on night mode and you even get a little dynamic range test with the candle in there so with this next round with a lot of narrowing down happening already we have mate 40 pro taking the win over the edge plus maybe not the biggest upset ever but those phones are close in price that's a win for the mate then you have the zenfone 7 pro squeaking out a win over the pixel 5. that i think a lot of people would consider an upset considering how much we like pixel 5's camera then over here me 10 ultra gets the win over sony xperia 1 mark ii that's a dub and then the note 20 ultra scored i'm gonna double check this but i believe the biggest ever win in the history of this competition scoring 95 percent of the votes against oneplus 8t so that's a pretty huge win so now maybe not so many upsets this round except maybe pixel losing but again learning a lot of interesting stuff but we'll get to that in a second next round so the semifinals photo was a good one it's me holding up my r5 which is all black in front of a couple different colors yellow cement barrier red wall black asphalt and then blue sky behind it and in this one all the photos by themselves had to focus on the red ring so you get a nice little depth of field comparison 2. so in this round we have zenfone 7 pro squeaking out a win over the mate 40 pro impressively so that that was a close race a lot of votes on both twitter and instagram but that was decided narrowly and then over here we have me 10 ultra getting the win over note 20 ultra in the battle of the ultras so at this point we're going to have a new winner because we had a huawei mate series win the first year and we had the two samsungs colliding in the finals last year so this time they've all been eliminated for various reasons and one of these two is going to be the champ on the finals so the last round the pumpkin photo and i think this one it might just look again like a simple subject in broad daylight but it has a lot of stuff here that's taken in mind stuff we found through the whole contest there's a method to the madness but either way when it came down to it the asus zenfone 7 pro did squeak out a very narrow win over the mi 10 ultra in the finals therefore crowning it your new people's choice award 2020 blind smartphone camera test champion it's december madness [Music] okay there's a lot to take in about how we ended up here but first of all from the last two years the main thing we really got from that that we learned is that when you put two photos side by side it brings out a very specific reaction from people's brains which is hold everything else the same to an extent people will just pick the brighter photo makes sense but this year we definitely got some more nuanced information that's really important actually now first let me just say if you were clicking through the photos and thinking oh this is just a bunch of pretty simple random photos without much care put into them it was kind of designed to look that way but there's a lot of variables in each photo that have a lot to do with the way your brain perceives that photo a lot of different colors a lot of different focal lengths backgrounds style of photo we didn't get to do action photos or night photos but there's some really good stuff in here so from all this i think there's three main things that we picked up one we have a new winner two white balance is underrated and three twitter versus instagram [Music] so first of all yes the new winner is the asus zenfone 7 pro probably pretty surprising winner for most people guessing most of you didn't have this winning the bracket although if you were paying attention last year this one took some great photos and only lost by a slim margin but it's got an improved triple camera system this time the 64 megapixel main camera that bends down to 16 megapixel photos and there's also they toss in a 3x telephoto and an ultra wide nothing too crazy except for the fact that the cameras flip around and become probably the best selfie camera in any phone which is sick so it's not the most extreme crazy 100 megapixel camera or anything like that but if you go back through the rounds while some had random white balance misses or some artifacting or would just blow out a photo dynamic range something would go wrong once in a while you know this phone just kind of had a clean consistent exposure each time just didn't miss this  don't miss no he's good that don't miss man he's good in the heat of battle he don't miss no [Music] okay so white balance has been a major key new factor from our understanding from the smartphone bracket this year and i'd go so far as to say that it looks like this has been the reason that the iphone has lost in the first round every single time see the other thing we learned putting photos side by side is if you have brightness the same and all of the things the same people will choose the photo that's a little bit more saturated a little more vibrant looking which also makes sense but it's to an extent you can't just crank saturation all the way through the roof but generally if you have two photos that are almost the same and one of them looks a little more pale it'll lose so we know what white balance is right it's generally how warm or how cool a photo or video will look and a good white balance has pure white looking like pure white now the nuance with white balance is this in photos that have more warm colors more reds orange yellow that type of thing the warmer the white balance the more saturated it will actually make those warm colors feel and the less saturated it will actually make those cool colors feel and the opposite is also true so in a photo with lots of cool colored things a cooler overall white balance will make those things look more saturated by a bit and those warm things will look less saturated so stay with me so in this first photo white balance was a major deciding factor because many of the colors in the frame are warm you have my warmer skin tone the yellow ottoman the red piece here the red controller and even the sunlight streaming in onto the wall behind me and a lot of smartphones are all over the place with white balance even from shot to shot but when they go too cool my black shirt starts to go blue my skin looks less saturated a little bit more pale and the whole photo shifts this is the iphone 12 pro max's first round shot and you know there is a lot of detail and sharpness sure but it's by far the coolest temperature and plus the whole boosted exposure is so bright that it also blows out the sky behind me which would have looked even more blue if you could see it because of the cooler temperature that is of course very different from the oneplus photo that beat it so really the question is why does the iphone and why do some phones so consistently have such a cool hue a blue tint to the white balance and obviously i'm not behind the scenes your guess is probably as good as mine but my theory would be that on photos of people with fairer skin tones which is most people it doesn't affect the skin tone look quite as much you can get away with it and also blue skies will look more blue than it would if you were biasing warm second round there was a lot happening and i think the number one factor most people settled on was just how much of the candle they could see in that photo and that's just a straight up dynamic range test and in every match up the photo with more dynamic range one but also everything in the photo is pretty warm the candle is orange the salad has some reds in it the yellow lemon and even of course the wood table everything is sitting on lots of good little details in the bread and the lettuce and the place mat to pick up on here then in the third round we have a lot of again neutral and warmer colors we have my hand with the skin tone we have the black camera with the red ring we have the asphalt in the background so we have the four remaining phones but i took a reference photo on the iphone just for fun and it was blue man i feel like it would have lost in this round again if it got this far in the first place because it was so blue now a photographer looking through a lot of these i had some photographer friends messaging me as this was going on a photographer looking at this would probably not be so concerned about white balance because at the end of the day that's just a slider you can fix and even exposure as long as it's somewhat accurate that's a slider you can fix what we really want is as much information as possible as much detail and dynamic range so that you can make the photo you want in the edit and that's one way of thinking about the photo i think the other way is just hey this is a compressed photo on social media just do the best you can with it and speaking of compression so this blind test was held on both instagram stories and twitter where you could do votes and it turns out what we learned is instagram stories and twitter compress and show your photos in very different ways so this was the final round photo comparison it's a photo of an orange pumpkin it's like the perfect finale photo given everything we've been learning about white balance and warmth through this whole time but here i'm waiting to see if you know the photo with the warmer white balance looks more saturated with the pumpkins and wins and sure enough the bottom photo by the me10 ultra is looking more saturated in that side by side so as we post it i'm expecting more people to vote for that and on instagram it won but on twitter it got crushed and that was a weird moment where i was i was trying to like figure out why that would happen in my head maybe i thought because everyone on twitter has been sort of hyper analyzing this and commenting and replying for so long that by the time you get to the finals people are scrolling down the comments and looking at people's talk before they vote and i guess instagram stories is just a pure vote no comments but it was just such a big difference this guy won by about 30 000 votes on instagram and the zen phone won by about 90 000 votes on twitter so that means overall the zenfone did win the finals but that was that was a big swing so it turns out and shout out to the people who are voting on both that sent this to me instagram stories looks different from twitter images see the images uploaded to twitter actually look like they both got a boost to saturation to the point where the bottom photo actually looked over saturated and people overwhelmingly voted for the zenfone for staying realistic while it looked like the me ultra was way over the top then on instagram it actually made both photos a little bit more pale so the top zen phone actually looked too pale and the bottom photo which looked closer to realistic got more votes really fascinating stuff which again dumps more gasoline on my fire theory that it doesn't really matter exactly what your photo looks like when you take it and when you edit it as long as you like it post that so moral of the story am i going to go running out and telling people zenfone 7 pro is the new king of smartphone cameras no but it is very consistent so i'll give it that and if you care about that in a smartphone camera you won't be disappointed with that phone but generally the point is everywhere on the internet you post a photo it's just gonna look different this is even true with videos actually when i post a video on youtube it looks different on my computer versus by the time it gets chewed up and spit out through youtube on your monitor or someone else's phone or someone else's laptop and this is also true about all our photos and different social media platforms so at the end of the day just make what you want to make post it and be happy with that don't worry too much about the tools themselves do the best you can with what you've got because that's what we're all doing at the end of the day [Music]
