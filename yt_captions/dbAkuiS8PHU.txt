[Music] all right what's up mkbhd here so i just got done spending some time outside this is a pretty exciting one and a little bit of an exclusive i spent some time here at the studio with some of the new electric hummers that are scheduled to come out as soon as the earliest one i think is next year 2022 and they are wild so gm brought them out here to the studio so definitely get subscribed to the studio channel if you want to see some of the behind-the-scenes type stuff but these are the only working electric hummers in the world right now just these two models right here so the one you've seen in car shows and other videos that's this one the one that was at lebron james's house and that one video yeah that's this one right here so you can see there's two versions that they brought here to the studio one is the suv version and one is the pickup truck version and holy smokes they are both ridiculous with tons literal tons of quirks and features but you know what speaking of tons let me just start with the obvious these trucks are huge okay they're obviously very tall and they're massive but the truck it's going to be crazy to see these things on the road soon because the truck version weighs over 9 000 pounds 9 200 plus pounds i've been told and it's still goes zero to 60 in three seconds which is like fast sports car fast that's like performance model three fast that's actually terrifying so this is going to be a dual or triple motor config depending on which one you get but with up to a thousand horsepower to move that weight but yeah i guess for a hummer it's it's really not about that speed it just happens to be capable of it from the electric torque but it's more about how much torque you can get and how much you can tow i don't know i'm not a hummer person but i feel like that's going to be fascinating seeing all the wild stuff they've thrown into the truck to make the electric version more enticing you may have seen my video on the cyber truck already that one's pretty wild and then you may have also seen my recent hands-on with the ford f-150 lightning that's kind of like on the other side of the spectrum this to me feels kind of somewhere in between so just so you have the context watching this these are going to start with the dual motor lowest end version around 80 000 so pretty expensive but the ones they brought out here are the the highest end fully loaded like first edition or edition one versions so now we're talking like twelve thousand starting for that and up from there so obviously much more expensive than the other two trucks but for that money yeah you you definitely get a lot of quirks first of all the total height and clearance of both of these vehicles is massive so not only is it over 9000 pounds but the center of gravity is very high off the ground as you can tell but you know it looks good on these trucks they look very rugged and obviously they have these huge wheels but the suv looks pretty solid too very squat and wide but still extremely solid and tough looking the whole thing is so squat actually that you may notice that you have three windshield wipers because a single windshield wiper would actually be too tall while a smaller pair doesn't reach the whole thing so right off the bat that's something you don't see on pretty much any other vehicle then up in front of that you got a huge water sealed power liftgate front trunk for the hummer ev this is this has got to be the biggest front lift gate i've ever seen in person it's absolutely massive and while it's not a super tall front trunk it's definitely deep enough to fit some serious luggage or storage which again is awesome on something like a pickup truck that not every pickup truck has i was loving that on the f-150 lightning too and speaking of electric vehicle stuff check out these headlights so this is what it'll look like when it's sitting in a garage or at a charger plugged in the front running lights are actually multi-colored so they can indicate exactly how much charge you have left and move those blue dots across the headlight area which is pretty sick and they also can turn orange for some pretty sweet regular blinker animations too honestly i think the headlights are actually my favorite part of this truck but wait there's more there's actually there's just a lot of smaller truck stuff that you'd be interested in if you're a hummer person now i'm not claiming to be a hummer expert this is the first time i've spent significant time with a hummer but i learned a lot about trucks from the f-150 lightning and a lot of this stuff is still pretty cool like there's a tailgate that folds down in multiple stages so it turns into a bench or a step to get up into the trunk whatever you want the back window also of both the suv and the truck can go down too so if you want that full fresh airflow from front to back that's pretty sweet and sitting inside the interior is definitely it's very industrial lots of rectangles and h-shaped objects as they do it there is a screen here playing demo animations but also still plenty of buttons and switches this is by no means the minimalist type cyber truck and the best one is probably the mode dial that lets you switch between driving modes can raise or lower the suspension on demand and switch to crab walk mode if you want to which lets you turn all the wheels in the same direction and maneuver diagonally which is wild oh and this would also be a good time to mention this whole thing is also a convertible so the roof is removable it's in four parts so you actually have to go around to each corner and unhook two latches and take the roof panels off and put them in the trunk or the front trunk or wherever you want but yeah then suddenly this hummer goes from a military-looking vehicle to an open-air recreational type thing with the wind going through your hair and this ultra wide windshield other random quirks though there is tons of storage as you've already seen but not just in the back and the front trunk but even in the back seats or how about underneath the back seats or how about inside the back seats i don't think this is something i've ever seen before then there's also cameras all around the vehicle around the front around the mirrors on the side but most interesting to me is definitely the one in the center of the spare tire on the back it's great for your visibility and i noticed there's a good amount of uh pride in this truck like they're clearly proud of having made it in the usa and that explains the american flag on the b pillar and they're proud of that first moon landing which you know i guess they're kind of associated with since gm made parts of the apollo 11 moon rover but they're really proud they're proud to the point where they have a topographical map of the moon all over the floor of this truck it's in the front seats it's in the trunk and specifically in the speakers on the door which show the sea of tranquility and actually there's a boot print right on the spot where the first human feet were set on the moon so they're really into it the boot print is also on the left side of the floor of the car where your foot rests while you're driving so you can kind of feel like an astronaut maybe driving a version of a moonlander but the one thing they seem the most proud of is the hummer name like just hummer ev i wasn't originally looking for this but as i walked around the vehicle and was playing with things and poking it and prodding and pointing a camera at it i started realizing how many times i was seeing the word hummer ev or just the logo carved into etched into the car everywhere so i ended up just counting after a while and i think i got to 31 hummer ev logos on this truck so let's see i mean you just start with the hev on the front of each door that's two then down on the wheels there's a logo in the middle and on the outside that's another one so that's two more logos per wheel plus one more on the rear spare since there's none in the middle then the entire headlights of course spell out hummer ev that's one more you've got two on the steering wheel one at the top one at the bottom then one more on the passenger side dashboard then there's a logo under the floor mats of both of the front seats by your feet as you're sitting in it and then another one between your feet in the back seat and then another one in the trunk both of the pickup truck and the suv then there's two in the front trunk one up in the top and then another one at the bottom one on each seat so that's four more then one on the doorstep on each side and then one more on the back and then finally one more on each of the four toe hitches two on the front and two on the back all say hummer ev you'll never forget which car you're in but overall i i am just really fascinated by an electric hummer it seems kind of like an oxymoron like i imagine the typical hummer buyer doesn't care too much about efficiency they probably won't care about the 350 mile max range that they're talking about or the up to 350 kilowatt fast charging which is very impressive for when someday the infrastructure supports it but uh i imagine they care more about off-roading and power and towing and capabilities and things that other truck buyers are more interested in and yeah check and check cargo space that's another check it's interesting it's interesting seeing an electric hummer so now that you've seen hummer ev i'm really curious what you think feel free to let me know in the comments below and if you've already also watched the videos of ford f-150 lightning and cyber truck maybe we'll get to spend some time with the rivian soon but i'm curious what your thoughts are on the electric truck scene that is slowly developing and i'm still very confident that every year for the next 10 straight years is going to be the most interesting year yet for electric vehicles so we're just getting started this was fun to take a first look either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you soon in the next one peace [Music]
