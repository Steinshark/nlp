what is this all right what is this hold on hold on an animated roller coaster in Excel you know I don't know this was 13 years ago back when Excel was terrible I mean this person was probably dimming some serious variables you know what I'm talking about there's dim was had for those that don't get that joke you're either too old or too young and I'm not sure which one it is but it's good it's a good joke it's a good joke a roller coaster in Excel 2003 in three-dimensional I forgot to turn off alerts I forgot to turn off alerts but guess what I'm recording this video and I have alerts coming on on a separate channel so guess what so guess what guess what guess what Jackass they're going to be taken out or they won't be uh to start de ride after download click the little uh Sun icon do we can we just have a do we did did someone link this and not actually show me is there no video oh this is a video no this is not a video are you serious to me are you serious is this a picture of a video did I just get had by a picture of a video okay I wanted to see this I wanted to see see your roller coaster a 3D animated roller coaster model in Excel all right let's do this average asmin gold enjoyer yes what is that Miss Monique what is that asmin a 3D model or a 3D roller uh roller coaster in Excel there it is there it is let's go all right let's see this thing dude hey did you guys ever play the Virtual Boy anyone here play Nintendo's most bizarre creation the Virtual Boy anybody oh God yes oh God yes this is virtual boy with color not just red Virtual Boy was nothing but red index look at the index go how the hell did they do this look look would you look at this this is absolutely mindboggling that someone created this this also reminds me of a game called extreme G I don't know if anybody ever played extreme G uh in for the Nintendo 64 I can't believe this was made in Excel this is great you know I think what this goes to show you know there's always this argument you hear it all the time right which goes like uh someone's going to say that there's a perfect language for problems and you know I'm I you know you're going to hear me say it too okay but what I take whenever I see this video is that at the end of the day you can write anything in effectively any language now sure is Excel the right language to make a 3D roller coaster no but can someone do it yes is Javascript a language designed for interacting with the Dom yes should we make all of our infrastructure scaling and everything and even ML and all sorts of stuff based on JavaScript no but did we successfully yes so just remember every time you spoot up old node index.js know for a fact you are making a roller coaster in Excel modern day you can do it I believe in you you got this you got this you got you got this people I think that you're talented enough to make a roller coaster in EXL someone already did it's true what is better than no. JS my friend Nero first off nice name Nero second off what is better than no JS what what I would like you to do you know I said this yesterday and I got a lot of I got some backlash yesterday okay I got a lot of backlash also got some positives on it which is here let's let's just bring let's just bring up the actual tweet I still stand I stand by my tweet I don't I haven't been tweeting nearly as much uh right here High reliability of a JavaScript service is extremely hard to achieve if not impossible due to how errors are treated I feel like this is a very benign statement nothing in here is a wild statement but what I realize is that so many people ask that same question well what else would you use wow you must hate no JS you must actually I was talking about bun okay you guys missed it I was talking about a bun if you've never used another service if you've never used another language if you've never done anything other than JavaScript just give something else a try give go a try just try it out and what I want you to do is that every single time you have an error here let's let's go like this does it throw I'm exploring this cool LSP called does it throw okay I'm exploring it it doesn't matter just shut up okay so uh here uh test go I don't think I'm going to get highlighting or whatever who cares I'll just go like this package uh main we'll just do that funk you know main blah blah every time you do any function that has uh that you call right I I forget I forget what it is what what what we want right right let's see is there just like a file is it under OS I feel like it's under something like OS uh right file there we go test this what comes out of here it comes out with an error so everywhere in go code you have something that looks like this right that's like hey if error equals nil do this and everyone's like ah man I hate this this is the absolute worst why would you ever want to write this kind of code this is just terrible so then I go like this okay okay hey I hear you you're right you're right const FS equals require fs and then I go like this uh fs. read file sync right and we do that this is uh read file sync there's no call back Auto auto pilot actually let's go like this WR uh WR file sync look at this you don't even have to do that in JavaScript how much better is Javascript well my friends well my friendy friends this one just ered nobody told you about the error nobody warned you it was coming no nobody was letting you know hey did you know that you're about to do something that might not work so when I say the high reliability of a of a JavaScript service is extremely hard to achieve what I mean is that every single statement that has the word async or sync right if you're using any sync apis you have to remember that you don't do if error equals nil instead you have to do try catch this and then handle some sort of alternative path okay you know what I'd much rather do I would much rather if this is a thousand times better than whatever the hell this thing is okay that sucks that is not something I want to do I don't want to do that I want to do this a 100 times over this is annoying so anyone that says if a equals nil you're crazy now secondly it the thing is is what I want you to catch by doing say something something like go is not I don't want the JavaScript sucks argument that's not the point the point is what it should do to you is remind you about every piece of code you are writing is heavily throwable and the reason why reliability of a JavaScript service is so difficult is because so many things throw and you don't realize it so by doing go you're going to remember these things and you're going to be like oh I know what to do oh I know what's going to happen here oh hey I need to handle this error that's not there rust will do the exact same thing rust will literally do the rust will do the exact same thing to you uh you just you just don't know that it throws yeah you just don't know what throws and that's what's so difficult about JavaScript so when I say these things it's not that I'm saying them to be like mean to somebody I'm saying them because I keep I'm emotionally bruised right now I'm working on a service that needs to be improved and one of the big problems is errors is handling air paths and airor conditions that aren't there and a huge problem is actually bubbling up the air so that like when something fails you know why it fails like that's going to be the next six months of my life is to try to harden a service and make something run faster better and with less errors slash better reported errors so when something's read we know why not just that it's read and it timed out uh I'd like to interject for a moment what you're actually referring to um sh sh anything from soy chaotic I will click oh my goodness okay can't click it it was it's actually too elusive to click it's too elusive to click I don't play 3D Shooters anymore can somebody please [ __ ] explain to me what dumbass developer def find the phrase synchronous operation to mean one after another when the word synchronous literally means happening at the same time there was no greater tweet by the way than this in just watching the amount of program splaining going on well you just don't understand async and why it's so you know you see the problem is is you're you're you're mixing you know here's the so here's the actual problem is just I just want you to know I loved it I I love it I love that this is the greatest tweet ever because it triggers every person that has to interject for a moment I would just like to interject what you're referring to as synchronous is actually dude it's so good it is so good soy chaotic greatest tweeter of all time greatest Tweeter all time the name I don't even know if this is a video is this a video is this actually a video I should make I don't even know we're going to post it we're posting it we're posting it aen
