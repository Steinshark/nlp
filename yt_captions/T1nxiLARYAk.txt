I think the myths are like the parable of Jesus if you try to resolve it narratively you mess it up you lose it right like and I think that I think what Plato's doing and what the Bible are doing is saying look you're always going and this is you know and this is in the Symposium you're always in between the taksu you're always always going to be in between and stop trying to be either an animal or a God you're always going to be in between and this is really relevant right now as we're facing a lot of emerging technologies that are going to put a strain on us around that [Music] this is

and like I said we're just starting [Music] so hello everyone I am excited to be here one with our usual friend and collaborator John rabiki who everyone here knows but then also I'm happy to introduce you to Jacob Howland uh he is he is sorry I forget the name of the program you're you're you're leading but he is at the University of Austin and is an expert on Plato and he just told us that he wrote a book on the talmud and Plato which both John and I would be very excited to look at and to read we've been having several email exchanges and we both John and I have been really impressed by his Insight on on the Greeks the agents and how they're relevant to us today and also noticing the University of Austin and just the courage they have uh kind of to create something new something fresh uh that is they're trying to engage with culture today so Jacob thanks for thanks for joining us today oh it's really wonderful to be here Jonathan I've listened to you and to John uh on many occasions and I'm absolutely delighted to participate in this conversation well it's a great thrill for me to be able to talk to you Jacob uh like I said I've uh your book has had a huge impact on me and I'm very grateful for that thank you and so Jacob you kind of you kind of wrote us several at least several messages I got several messages from you with John in the in the messages and you were you've been poking at some of the discussions we've been having some of the relevance of the ancient Greeks to the modern world today so I'll let you kind of start us off and then and then we'll see where it leads us yeah well thanks um you know I think uh this particular conversation was stimulated by uh discussion you and John were having at uh in one podcast about played a symposium and you were talking about the myth of Aristophanes and I thought you know there's a lot more there that I think um both of you could um really uh relate to and and that we could sort of tease out more of the significance of that myth uh in the Symposium so maybe the way to frame it is to say that um both the Greeks and the Bible are very interested in the relationship between aggression and sexuality these sort of two fundamental forces um so if we start with uh the Greeks you know we have the uh the legend of he said where everything emerges out of chaos you know and you've got this uh Heavenly god Uranus who covers Gaia right Heaven is his name and he covers Earth and and they have Offspring and then he Stuffs the children back into the Earth you know and Gaia plots with uh her children including Chronos who eventually castrates his father Uranus and from from his genitalia that fall into the sea is born Aphrodite which is very interesting because that's the kind of connection between you know here's the symbol of male potency and really aggression in the case of this God and from there comes Eros which sort of introduces in a way the story that Aristophanes tells if we look over at the Odyssey For example to take another ancient Greek epic or story Odysseus you know spends his time trying to get back home from Troy and he's constantly being trapped by these aggressive women you know Calypso keeps him as a boy toy for seven years on the island London Cersei turns his men into pigs and even school and charybdis are Representatives these female sort of monsters remember school is the six-headed one that plucks men from his ship and charyptus as the Whirlwind and I think this is actually um can be traced to uh the the result of the um the Greek uh war against Troy because the cities were emptied of men and then women kind of moved into the center of power and obviously in the case of the Bible you've got these very strange stories um in the Bible it's not the case that as with Odysseus you're trying to get back to civilization but you're trying to the Bible is exploring how do we create civilization how do men and women um figure out what it means to be a couple what it means to be a mother or a father how to relate these drives of sexuality and uh and aggression and I think that's something that's really Central to aristophany Smith so how do you see it connected air to Aristophanes I'm curious well so you know in this in this myth in the Symposium and maybe I should also give a little bit of framing here um the Symposium of course is a dialogue by Plato and the subject is love um the occasion is um a party celebrating the poet agathon's victory at um one of the Athenian dramatic festivals and everyone gathers at agathon's house and um there are seven speeches recorded in the Symposium and it turns out that um through through an accident aristophany speech is the central speech and this is important because in Plato I would say in Sophocles and we also see this in in other poets and writers of our own day the center of a text is particularly important Aristophanes was supposed to speak third in the order of seven but he got the hiccups uh and so he switched places with a doctor named Eric simicus and he ends up speaking forth I think this is important because the way I see the dialogue is that Aristophanes lays out a kind of anthropology okay uh and Central to the anthropology is both the relationship between sort of Untamed sexuality and Untamed aggression and then custom in particular the rights and uh laws and um rituals that are related to The Olympian gods and the last speech in the dialogue is that of el sobieties this flamboyant aggressive erotic Greek uh famous warrior um kind of an uncontrolled man uh his uh he had a shield and on the shield was Eros right the god of love with a thunderbolt right which combines both aggression and sexuality and in between those two speeches is the speech of Socrates who has a who has this lovely account of how the soul longs to come into the presence of the beautiful and into the presence of transcendent goodness and beauty and there's a sense in which I think the dialogue is a contest between the account of Aristophanes which prioritizes aggression we are fundamentally aggressive beings the account of Socrates which is very attractive by the way to Christians and to later religious thinkers because the object of Eros is these this Transcendent truth and Beauty um the contest between them is in a way uh determined or were asked to think about how sobieties a kind of confused erotic and aggressive man in connection with those two speeches so that's a that's a kind of framing um but I'm happy to then uh continue uh with kind of a discussion of of what Aristophanes is saying in in his myth but maybe we can stop and see if there's any any thoughts about about this I mean I think it I've always found the Symposium interesting when you understand also that there's a kind of the context um of our society is being the betrayer you know this idea that later on in the story this is what's going to happen he'll he'll be one of the causes of the fall of Athens uh and so in some ways you already have this Frame where his this passionate aggressive person uh you you kind of know where it where it goes you know where it leads and so I think that's also one of the reasons probably why Christians found the basic notion of the Symposium interesting you know because because there's a sense when these these passions out of control and then are are leading to the destruction of the city and Socrates is trying to you know in that story of the seduction between between him and al-sibilities you get a sense of Socrates is constantly trying to kind of be there and then take his desire and move it up towards something more towards towards the beautiful you know yeah that's exactly right and look the Symposium is set drama medically because we actually know I mean agathon was a historically existing individual and we know that he won this prize in in the year 416 right in the eve of the Sicilian Expedition that was an expedition a crazy far-flung expedition to Sicily the Athenians had this idea to send their whole Navy over to Sicily it ended in disaster but the prime mover was also biodies and his plan was to take the Athenians over to Sicily to conquer the rich city of Syracuse to conquer the rest of Sicily to then use the money and the sort of impressed slaves that they've conquered to uh to conquer Carthage and then to take the whole force and go over and conquer the Persians right sort of they have cop World Conquest it ended absolutely disastrously but one of the interesting things and some people have speculated that Plato is suggesting that on the night of the Symposium when at the end of the dialogue alphabides comes in completely drunk with a bunch of uh his sort of kotari of friends that that might have been the night that alcibiotes participated in or was alleged to participate in the desecration of the Herms now there were these statues of Hermes and uh Hermes is depicted with genitalia and somebody went around and by the way the sections of Hermes he's sort of a god of the crossroads and stuff so there would be intersections in Athens and statues of Hermes Somebody went around and mutilated the Herms by cutting off his sex organs and that's a very um let's say anti-erotic gesture so you know in the background of this is this theme of Ira said let me say one more thing um I would suggest that one of the Great accomplishments of Plato is to reinterpret Eros if you read thucydides history of the pillow of the uh of the Peloponnesian War um the word Eros occurs about six times and Eros isn't just sexual passion in ancient Greek but it's it's any kind of really powerful passion and when it occurs in thucydides it's essentially a dirty word it's like for example in the Sicilian Expedition he says that Heroes for the Expedition fell upon the Athenians and the Greek word fall is the same same word you'd use if a disease sort of fell upon um and so what Plato does is he says it's not Euros the problem isn't Euros it's the objects of Euros what human beings have a passion for is money and power and pleasure and so forth we've got to redirect it toward these Transcendent things so this is very rich background I think um for for these discussions and in the Christian Aesthetics end up recapturing arrows although in the Bible itself it's not the the word that's used the most for sure the Aesthetics end up bringing the word back and so you hear you read the Aesthetics talk about arrows as the prime uh let's say the prime drive towards Union with God and that it is actually Eros that leads us into into theosis so so you can see that they really bring back some of some of these ideas that are there in Plato yeah you know it's interesting though because what we're going to see in Aristophanes is that um Eros is a kind of cure or uh kind of medicine let's say to um to arrest our aggression or at least uh uh ensure that it doesn't have sort of the worst consequences um in the Bible it's very interesting because if you look at the story of Adam and Eve um it isn't until the introduction of Euros that is the splitting of the whole human being whom God created called hadam the human being God created male and female and remember that Adam Adam can't find a partner and then God finally puts them to sleep and and and and and and and and cuts part of him right and sort of makes uh Eve out of out of part of this whole human being it's then interestingly that sort of trouble starts right um for example I've always been struck that uh you know there's this line in uh in Genesis where it says that uh Adam awoke and the the verse says right this is their primordially whole human being spoke and he said that's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she's gonna be called Isha woman because she came from ish man but this is the this is uh this is a mistake because woman didn't come from ish the male woman came from Haddam the whole human being and so Adam and his excitement gets this the male becomes so excited that he breaks into this poetry and and he says she came from me but actually the woman is taken apart from this primordially whole human being and ish the male part is all that's left over so under the influence of Eros the male becomes confused and believes that he is the source of woman right there's a kind of forgetting of God it's very strange in that story does this make sense so that so that there's no it makes sense because there's some weird things that happen in the Christian commentaries you know you when you you read uh in Saint Gregor Nissa and other of the the early commentators they'll say things like the separation of Adam is a preview of The Fall it's done it's done knowing that they say things like God knew the fog was going to happen and it is done in preview of the fall and there's a deep Insight even structurally in terms of Storytelling because the fact that Adam is put to sleep in order to for this to happen is the preview of death it gets a little death that seems to happen that causes the division between the two and then you see as you move towards the freed of the the the fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil you're moving towards a world of opposites basically uh so I they never go so far as to say that it's wrong they'll say that it's good but that they have a sense in which it's like you said there's already some movement uh towards a kind of broken multiplicity even in the the separation yeah that's you know that's so interesting and then of course sexuality figures and this is um if we sort of go back to the Jewish tradition um uh so Rashi the medieval commentator um when when he's commenting on on the serpents um seduction of Eve right and he says oh did God really tell you you can't eat this tree no he knows you know you you know you're become as gods or as my Marley says as as kings the word Elohim can be translated that way Rashi says the serpent one to sleep with Eve and that the serpent actually believed that the fruit would kill right that if you eat of the fruit you'll die and so and this is a really strange explanation okay but uh and that that he believed the Eve was intelligent and he was going to take the fruit and because she was intelligent she was going to test it on Adam first and give it to him and he'd eat it he'd die and then the serpent would have beef now what's it's a crazy story but what's interesting there is the suggestion that sexual Eros confuses right and seduces and kind of messes us up right which you know which which I think is a human experience um but what's fascinating is that that particular story kind of reverses the order of Aristophanes because Eve gets this idea right it's after the division and you've got woman and man Eve gets the idea that hey I'm gonna eat this fruit I'm gonna violate God's commandment right because either I will become like a god or if my mother is right like a king but I'm going to reach for something um and it's an act of aggression right um that is a reversal of Aristophanes because in Aristophanes what's primordial is aggression and Eros follows uh uh from um a kind of a divine intervention to try to sort of Tamp down aggression um now that I think of it though I guess that that you could you could sort of see I mean Eros doesn't exist in either case until some action of God some action of of of splitting right so this is a kind of way that the the Bible in Aristotle sort of match up with each other um so um did you guys have been saying so much I don't know where to uh make a comment but um maybe first to return to the symposium so one way I've often framed uh socrates's Speech is the speech between Aristophanes and emojis I just dropped the name and so I mean for me uh I I quite also look the overlaps right so uh the contrast and the continuities are really important uh I think and this is what Plato was playing with dramatically of course there's a continuity between in the aristophanese myth the seeking for wholeness that gets taken up in uh diatima's uh Ascent the anagogue at assent and of course the neoplatonist made a great deal of that overlap um but it's important to realize that that that sort of ascent uh the the Sikh did the right I think I agree with you Jacob the the idea of the ascent I mean platinus takes this up you know the knowing is the the way we get whole and we have to know the right things in order to ascend and I think that theme is taken up but the Elsa body speech reminds us about something important um buchnik I think makes a good case for this and the tragedy reason is that there's nothing necessary to the ascent the ascent is contingent there's no there's right it doesn't it's not it's not you know once you start you won't necessarily go up all the levels it's contingent all the way along and the and the presence of our sovieties is to remind us of that it's like here's a person who literally hangs out with Socrates it's deeply attracted to Socrates wants to be one with Socrates probably even in a sexual Manner and yet he doesn't go through the anagogical ascent and so I think what we're being said what's what we're being told here is there's a there's a potential transformation available in in that that seeking for for for wholeness which I think is the primordial thing behind both the aggression and the Eros right um that it has a possible transformation but there's something very tragic about it because there's no necessity to it uh we can enter into it but we are quite liable to fail in a profound way and that says to me something very um significant about uh the relationship that Plato's trying to draw between Eros and anagogue and uh logos uh because of course a theme that unites all of these is this theme of giving birth right and and so as you go up the ascent you're giving birth to low guard you're giving birth and it's not just speeches it's also ways of seeing ways of understanding and this and he also says you know um the Quest for immortality sexual immortality is something that we can sort of transform into uh Oneness with eternity if I can use those contrasts and so I see all three speeches as trying to tell us there is something available to you but there is there's great tragedy available also possible in that um you can transform this primordial quest for wholeness into the ascent to the one or the good um but there's no necessity in that and Plato's really wrestling with something here I think was just really profound which is we see we have this weird relationship with his prime more Joel it seems to overpower us but we seem to have options to transform it but those options aren't guaranteed either it like for me that the finitude and the Transcendence are so bound together in this in in sort of an almost you know I keep coming back to the word tragedy right like it's we're bound to it we have this capacity for Ascent but we all and we can transform that primordial desire but we can also just be overwhelmed by it and then I think the question that emerges for me is what makes the difference it's not even the presence of Socrates that makes the difference like I come away from those three speeches sort of wandering deep into Play-Doh like what makes the difference because as I I've tried to late what I think his argument is there's no necessity right so what and I you know and Plato's not I think offering just sort of a base well you just choose I don't think it's a raw existentialism or something I think there's a there's like a sorry but I I I I'm really on the edge of what I'm trying to speak to here but there's something there that what makes the difference between an El sobieties and a Socrates that goes up the ascent and for me that's that's the thing that sort of resonates um because we're in the face of this god-like thing right Eros and and it's in between the Divine and the human and we're in that between place what makes the difference like we're because we're in the in between there's no necessity either way but what makes the difference that's what comes out for me as the question and so the Greeks for me uh well Plato sorry uh Plato in the way he puts the speeches together raises this profound kind of question um that um perhaps we could address to the Bible um and say what makes that difference and you know and I think there's something going on um I'm a little more hesitant to talk about the Bible uh but there's something going on about what I mean Jonathan as I understand what you said and I've read a little bit of the fathers it's like they're trying to get with like this this was going to happen but nevertheless you chose it to happen and there's a necessity but if there's a choice and it's good and it's bad like there's a I find that the two are resonating at this point of what is making the difference so that's what that's what I want to bring to this if I like Mike very very Christian reading of the Symposium so I'm not gonna you're gonna apologize for that but the so when I what I see like when I when I remember the the symposium is that what makes a difference it seems it seems that there's something Socrates is trying to do something without sobieties yes like he recognizes the the arrows and he he knows in some ways that this Eros like he like Jake like you said this is the means by which you can reach up and so and he seems to be trying to transform his arrows and he does it in different ways he does it by kind of bringing him close to him and then refusing him in some ways or refusing his advances and then trying to kind of turn his advances so there seems to be I think that this is going to sound like I said very Christian but it seems like there's a there's something of asceticism in what in what Socrates is trying to do it's like if you experience loss like if you experience loss of what you desire and you're able to kind of do that with the right with the right uh attitude or the the right mindset then it it's a it's like a trampoline or it's like a it's a new ground on which you can reach higher you know and so if you if you to some this degree tame or refuse some of your immediate passions right and you kind of hold them then you put yourself in a position where you can maybe Glimpse through them to something to something more uh but that's me like during Lent now moving into Holy Week saying that well but but like I I don't I'm not trying to put that aside I want to put something beside it which of course you know Plato uh Compares philosophy to seduction um to being seduced uh because uh Plato's trying to deal with sort of you know questions about how can we know and not know and the answer seems to be well love is a kind of knowing and not knowing it's not a complete ignorance because it guides Us in some way uh but it but it's not knowing or or we would we wouldn't be seeking and questing so it's the in betweenness it's this indeterminiveness right that that get that that's a key in that way you to draw somebody into that transformation you have to seduce them you have to you have to get them to recognize the knowing and the not knowing and how they're interpenetrating each other and so I don't I think it's more Socrates is at times I don't think I'm disagreeing with you I think he does what you said I think he draws him in and refuses them but I think that's part of a general thing of trying to get him into uh you know a kind of aporia a kind of longing uh you know so that he'll be seduced towards the good um but see that and this gets into again like this thing you you know again it's I keep I I think I often find Plato is driving towards he's trying to get at oh here's virtue right but you can't teach it but you have to teach it right what turns people towards virtue because this thing keeps coming back again and again and I think of it as this like profound questioning and questing at the heart uh and I I mean sorry I'll shut up I want to know I've been talking to you I mean look I think this is this is all right on track um the interesting thing about lcbiities I regard him as a philosophical casualty right here's here's this guy and let's just like alcibiotes is first of all extremely handsome well-born right he's a ward of Pericles um Rich um gifted as a warrior and a commander very intelligent um you know if you read for example plutarch's life of el sabieties the guy is like crazy I mean he's you know he tells stories about how else about is playing in the road with his other little boyfriends you know as a child and a coach comes going along and all the kids scatter but also buddy stays there and the guy's like stops The Chariot he's like you all I almost killed you and why didn't you get out of the road and he's like because I'm playing here you know and then there's stories about how he would go into people's houses and just steal their silver or you know slaps his father-in-law all kinds of crazy behavior um there's a dollar called the first Elsa bodies there are two dogs called Elsa bodies and the in the so-called first El sabiety Socrates place this seduction game with him right he's it's kind of he's almost like a pervert in some weird ways like he watches Elsa bias as a boy for a long time and then he approaches him when the kid's like 16 or 17. um and here's how somebody's again who I think you know he must have thought I have everything I am full I am replete you know because why everybody wants to be me I am the greatest and what Socrates does is he says at one point he says in the dialogue you're Eros for renowned is greater than any other person's Eros for anything ever right like he but it's so interesting because by the way that's an ambiguous use of the word Euros because we're not talking like a love of the beautiful we're talking about a kind of combination of aggression and and and and erotic I mean this weird mysterious mixture that we find in the human soul right he wants to be number one and Socrates says you're not going to be satisfied with just being the top guy in Athens you want to rule the world you want to be greater than Xerxes you want to be greater than you know the Persian Emperor um and and by the way if you want that you got to come to me I can I can help you right now of course what else the bodies finds and what we see as he reveals himself in his drunkenness and the Symposium is I couldn't do it right Socrates is the only human being who ever made me feel ashamed now this is after as you said John Socrates sort of puts him in this position like you think you have everything but you don't you're longing for something more initially it's posed as like being the ruler of the world or something right you're longing for something more you need me but then Socrates makes him ashamed because of Socrates virtue right you open them up and the gods inside and and by the way Socrates is a Seducer you're absolutely right what's so fascinating is here's this ugly man sort of weird looking guy um there's a wonderful article called Socrates as hoplite where the author it's a something called ancient philosophy in this journal the author um does all the research on Socrates and he shows that Socrates although he was a poor man somehow got the money together to buy the the equipment that would allow him to fight at the level of a Hop light okay which is a heavily armed Warrior and then distinguished himself in battle in fact how somebody talks about it in the Symposium Socrates saved my life you know and then he he he he rejected the honor that the that the city wanted to give him um and so Elsa body sees someone who really has it all somehow this is I'm going to just sort of foreshadow here something I want to come back to later in the Socrates is replete like the circle people in Aristotle's myth right like these like they don't need anything else he somehow has it um but it's the rock that Elsa body splits on because when I'm with Socrates I have to do what he says and when I'm away from him I'm seduced by the call of the people you know so he really is this kind of philosophical casually but I think your question is very well taken what is it how how come I mean is it just the seduction of of being the great El sobieties and being looked at by everyone and and and and regard it as the object of their Eros that that prevents him from seeking Beauty and Truth hard to say um but maybe I can talk a little bit about the air esophagy's myth right because it occurs to me maybe some listeners don't really know what the method so the myth basically is that human beings originally were these Circle people was spherical we had forearms four legs two faces four ears Four Eyes faces facing opposite and we rolled all around right and and and we and and we could do cartwheels really quickly and we rolled up to try to attack the gods we got Big Ideas and so Zeus is perplexed and he decides we got to stop these guys so he cuts us all in half and the original human beings were combinations of male male male female or female female so this is where we get the Sexes right and the result is that our haves seek each other out and we we long for our other half now this is a big difference from Socrates account of Eros because in also in Aristophanes and kind of bureaus we seek the other half to make ourselves whole but we're seeking our original selves for Socrates we're seeking something other we're seeking the ideas we're seeking the truth we're seeking the Beautiful uh but in any case Eros then it like originally we were aggressive beings we had big Ideas what we wanted to do is attack the gods Eros is a kind of um um what would you call like divide and conquer right but but it's a um a kind of uh distraction because now instead of attacking the gods vertically we'll go around horizontally looking for our other halves we're trying to come together now look at the tragic character of this what we really want in the myth is to be bound back with our other halves and have our original Integrity restored should that happen we would then attack the gods again right I mean because that's our original nature so for Aristophanes it's and by the way this is very true to Aristotle's existing 11 or surviving 11 comedies they're all about sex and aggression and playing them off against each other to temper aggression so famously lysistrata now this was a is the the play in which the Athenian and Spartan women go on a sex strike to stop the Peloponnesian War and it works right um I saw this by the way as a boy in the 1960s my mother took me to a play at the University of Chicago and it was quite shocking to me because the the characters were walking around they had broomsticks between their legs right the men were erotically excited remember one a woman says well if you won't come by the hand taken by the handle and she grabs him by the broomstick and drags them off the stage the air stuffies was very popular in the 1960s because it was Make Love Not War right and that really was Aristotle's message uh and and so it's the idea of playing these off against each other but there's something tragic about her Stephanie Smith because cutting people in half it makes us less strong but it doesn't get rid of our aggressive nature and it distracts us and we seek the other and by the way Eros is prior to sex because uh when the circle people were cut in half and they were hugging each other and so forth um they were dying in each other's arms and then Zeus says well we got to have a further operation we'll move their genitals around to the other side so at least they can reproduce um so you know that's a rather tragic Vision I think the socratic vision is not tragic except Elsa body story is tragic what what if there's so many things flashing in my mind you know um because when you were saying you know if they come together then they attack the gods right the the phrase that came into my mind right away was you know was uh was love God with all your your all your might and love your neighbor as yourselves is that it seems that in that in in our tradition right that that in the in the Christian tradition I think also probably in the Jewish tradition there's a sense in which if we that there's an image between coming together as a people coming together in love and then then becoming the body the the you know the place where God upon which God descends and so in some ways it's not it doesn't have that doesn't have that tragic aggressive idea where if we bind together then we attack vertically so right so the top has to keep us separate in order for there's this really dark image of how the world Works uh which is that that which is transcendent you know divides in order to to rule over it whereas there is a sense uh in this image of of agape love right that if we if we come together then we become the receptacle the the people with which God communes um anyways that's just the image that came to me right away but there is the biblical image of nimrod right and and coming in and God creating all of the languages because the people were trying to ascend to God in the tower and and that so I mean that theme is also found in the Bible yeah definitely right right and so and again um but it has I think it has to do with I think I mean this is now bringing it more into our usual conversation John but I think that what you see what you see in in the Tower of Babel and Nimrod is the idea that they had one language and they have tried to have one name and so there's the difference between the normal distribution of identity that happens in a in a normal hierarchy and a kind of uniformity which is that you're at the top just tries to impose itself right you see that in the in the myth of uh of Uranus and Gaia which is that uranos wants to impose himself on God but he doesn't want the children he doesn't want this distribution of his identity into the world and that's the that's the problem whereas the normal let's say the normal kind of organic hierarchy is where we are the reality of our love for each other is real and and the multiplicity that all the variation all the multiplicity is real and then it finds like but but the way that it's together in its variability is because it's connected to something which transcends it and so there's this balance between unity and multiplicity that happens at all the levels maybe that reflects I'm thinking of Telex argument here right um we right we seem to be bound by two opponent drives and I'm trying to see if this will link up to the relationship between Eros and aggression we want we seem to be bound to participate to integrate to unify and then we seem to be bound to the drive to individuate to separate uh to make ourselves different uh from others and and Telex argument is that if we try to if we try to stabilize that by resolving it into one pole or the other we will actually destroy our Humanity that our Humanity lies in uh the polarity and um I'm I'm so again I'm wondering if we seem to be caught up in these themes of we seem to have these like we're drawn into wholeness but then we can get hubristic and so we we break apart but then we get lonely and Adam knew he was alone right we get lonely and we see to be oscillating between them and and and are the myths and I don't mean that word pejoratively right are the myths I don't see the myths offering resolution to that I I'm not here to be I'm not here just to be a contrarian right but I I don't see the myths as offering a resolution I see the myths are sort of saying that's it like this is the perennial thing you've got to accept it you you can't resolve it you may be drawn in but you're gonna be you're also going to push apart the Eros and the and and the aggression are inseparably bound together because if you lose one the other will destroy your Humanity that's that's what I'm hearing the myths saying and and I thought till it did a good job of taking that up and saying look the thing you got to do is you got to accept right that polarity you can't resolve it it's it's one of those tone offs right it's a tonos that that polarity actually defines your humanity and so am I just being quite Frank but I like I'm trying to I think the myths keeps saying stop trying to resolve this I think the myths are like the parable of Jesus if you try to resolve it narratively you mess it up you lose it right like and I think that I think what Plato's doing and what the Bible are doing is saying look you're always going and this is you know and this is in the Symposium you're always in between mataksu you're always always going to be in between and stop trying to be either an animal or a God you're always going to be in between and this is really relevant right now as we're facing a lot of emerging technologies that are going to put a strain on us around that yeah no I think this is really interesting you know um a couple of things here um so maybe it's useful to kind of go back and and sort of look at this anthropology that that Aristotle says laid out these Circle people are like bouncing around chaotically right there they can roll around they can move quickly they're they're like atoms and by the way the word atomos means uncuttable right so they're they're they're bouncing around and they threaten the gods and so God has to or Zeus has to has to impose some order there's got to be some kind of blow right so this is like the destruction of the Tower of Babel or the I don't know the uh explosion from Eden you know um and um what's interesting is that Aristophanes vocabulary changes in his description so when he first says that um there were these three types male male male female and female female um after they're cut in half he talks about men and women okay not male and female and men and women are politicized males and females okay and the way I read the myth is that um Aristophanes is essentially saying you've got chaos like he see it right you've got cast now you have to have order where does order come from it comes from law namas it comes from Custom it comes from the Olympians right that is to say what happens when they're cut in half aristophany says then they had to walk upright or sauce right so you have like orthodoxa Orthodoxy right they now look what happens here uh I actually want to suggest at this point that uh well I want to go back to what I hinted at earlier which is Socrates is kind of like a circle person okay it's got four ears he's got four in other words he's sort of in touch with reality he can hear he can see he can look up and down and so forth when you're cut in half you're now standing up you're looking forward you're uh you don't have eyes in the back of your head you're to look at what at other men and other women because you're looking for your other half right you're not to look up toward the gods and attack them you're not to look back where you came from you're not to ask about these fundamental questions you're not to philosophize right there's a sense in which the Olympian religion is antithetical to this kind of fundamental questing and thinking I think Aristophanes thinks of philosophy like Nietzsche does it's it's a Will To Power okay for Socrates it's Eros but so what happens here is that the gods cut and then Aristotle even says later and by the way if we keep up our aggression they'll cut us in half again incidentally aresophanes who even in the Symposium it's mentioned like he gets the hiccups uh and someone says like I think he overeat you know aristophius was allegedly a big guy and he liked food and and he talks about how cutting apples or eggs you know that's how they cut the human beings I think there's more to it than just a joke here I think the Olympians in the Greek context we are the food of the gods they dine on us in Homer in The Iliad the gods go up with when they're having the big battles with Achilles at the end they're sitting in the trees and they're feasting they're feasting on human beings and there's a sense in which they they [ __ ] us they they they they they you know cutting us in half they diminish our strength they're they're and and so who's this human being Socrates he's somebody who does attack the gods the Olympians in this in the Youth of pro for example right he says I don't like these stories about Zeus and and Kronos and castrations and all these kinds of things these are not the kinds of deities we should be worshiping they're not worthy of the name God now you get in the Hebrew Bible and in the Christian Bible God feeds us we're not food of the Gods God speeds us right so there's some other thing going on there but but so there's a kind of you know I don't I actually you know I think Aristophanes being a poet and having written the clouds in which Socrates says we don't credit Gods you know and suggest that they're made up by each community um he doesn't believe in the Olympians but I think he does believe in some kind of necessary divine order so to speak or or necessary Customs that restrict our sexuality and aggression um and so all this stuff is sorted out in a very different way in the Bible but it still has to be sorted out because we're still the same human beings hmm so you think that um I want to pick this theme up the one thing um that uh um Socrates is somehow whole I mean this the Symposium also takes great pains to identify him with Eros and being perpetually mataksu not coming to completion and of course he knows what he does not know and he can he will never have wisdom the thing he Longs for he in fact regularly says he will never have you can only love it yeah he will always be mataksu in relationship to it so I mean isn't Socrates also um he's also not complete he's also fundamentally incomplete in that he is also always always a lover of wisdom um and also attacks you towards it he always is because if he came to completion Eros would end if attacks who would be over the in between this would be over and the philosophical question see I see Socrates right as as always we talk like there's another there's another there's another way in which this plays out in Plato right is there's another wholeness Socrates is right there he's always aspiring he's also he's always aspiring right uh to his um well his great herself or you know his Divine double to use Charles stings where he talks about he goes home and there's somebody waiting for him at home which is Socrates but that Socrates is gonna you know question him about the day and what did you do when he's got his demonian right that speaks to him right I see him see I I see him as as still divided and still seeking a kind of fullness but what Plato's trying to do is to say you know that wholeness that you're and that you're seeking in other people you're also divided against yourself in a fundamental way that's what foolishness is and you know Plato makes a big deal of that in the Republic we're divided against ourselves and what we're actually seeking is a way to come into relationship to our aspirational divine double to come into uh what you know a kind of well something like wisdom like the kind of uh completeness and so yes I see I'm not denying what you're saying Socrates is clearly exemplary but I see Plato is holding those two together he's yeah he's somehow more like the circle people but he's also still divided he's all he's clearly divided and he's still always in in between and still he's on a quest that he will never complete by his own and repeated admission uh and so yes uh first of all does that land as a as a as some as a proposal to you absolutely look Socrates is fundamentally paradoxical right yes I mean look you know like let's just take the apology right he's like you know he says basically two things you know that you know I am he doesn't quite put it this way but you know the God sent me right to you I am sort of a gift of the god to the city right and I am a gadfly which you know I'll bite you and you'll kill me right well is he a species of pestilence a gadfly or is he God's gift you know I mean you could sort of look but what's interesting here is so let's try to define the wholeness in some way if I post the question you read the speech of Elsa bodies does he love Socrates or does he hate Socrates right yeah and the answer is yes right I mean sometimes I wish he's dead sorry so and this goes back to the aggression and the sexuality right like like it kills him that Socrates is greater than he is and he makes it very clear that he is yeah you know this man is so great now he interprets Socrates as he says it's just ironic you know he's just playing a game with us and so forth and that's I don't think that's quite true but but let's look at Socrates speech Socrates basically says aggression is misunderstood Eros through Moss is misunderstood Euros what we really want is to come into the presence of the beautiful and bring forth in Beauty and people misunderstand that right and they you know they get the reproduction and the immortality and stuff but they seek honor or children or whatever it may be so he doesn't have that split in his soul like there's a kind of inner integrity and what's really interesting about soccer I agree with you completely John and by the way I agree with Kierkegaard here my Socrates is kind of Kierkegaard Socrates suck you know there's a point in uh concluding unscientific postgroup where kindergarten says um you know Socrates is never finished he's always striving and most people like when it comes to education they want to say I'm educated they want to be done with things but Socrates is sort of like this almost like an open wound you know like it's he's constantly questing and yet he has Equanimity you know I'll just give you an example at one point and this this occurred to me and I was sort of delighted with my own Insight on this um at one point you know Aristotle Elsa body is talking about how Socrates behaved in battle right and he says you know the guy was a great warrior and so he says and um nobody could enjoy a feast like Socrates could but then again when food was scarce nobody could stand up to hunger you know the way he could now what's interesting is like the way he puts it is like Socrates alone could like really enjoy a food why couldn't the other guys enjoy a meal because they're scared like Socrates is not afraid he is um he is he has a kind of equanimity his soul is not anxious and troubled I would say the way that there's like alcibiotes is so there's a kind of wholeness that comes through being filled by Beauty and being filled by now again he's questing for these things but to some extent he does achieve the nourishment of the beautiful you know it's not that he's like in the fedris in other places he talks about how the true nourishment of the soul is truth is the ideas and I and I think that that's a statement from his own experience right like he does get something out of philosophy it's not as if he's simply striving and never achieving I agree I agree totally and this is what after Socrates is wrestling with all the way through I mean you've got these weird this weird like wisdom is you have you you and virtue would result from you learning and knowing in some way and yet he he fundamentally knows that he doesn't know but somehow he still becomes the wisest and and most just man you know that's what's at the Fatal which is pronounced over his death you know he was the greatest and and for me that that that's that that's the that's the tricky thing because it reminds me of so we have Christianity and Judaism so I'll bring in some Buddhism too it reminds me of the Zen um and and it goes back to this this thing that I'm trying to get at what makes the difference you know yeah you know you don't get Enlightenment by seeking it but only those who seek it will become enlightened right and these kinds of these kinds of paradoxical things about it if you say you're wise that's definitely evidence that you're not wise but then how could you ever know that you were wise how could you even know you were making progress there's all these and this is what I get I keep seeing this tremendous tension that you're constantly if you try and settle it down then you're you're losing something and for me this goes down to I think Plato's now this is going to be a vervakian argument um so I'll just put the cards on the table I think Plato's seeing something deep about intelligibility itself that intelligibility is this constant evolving tension between integration and differentiation if things only did differentiated we wouldn't understand them if they became a homogeneous one we could not understand them they're and and and they're you know and the postmodernists like derida have made great uh careers out of this but and you can't also you can't stabilize it you can't say okay now we've got the perfect balance because that will also kill intelligibility so for me I think Plato is trying to get us to see profoundly that right at the core of logos is this fundamental paradoxical tension and I see that eventually taken up I think I see Socrates is learned ignorance right that he does taken up in Nicholas acuza you know you do this you really push intelligibility and get all these Paradox and then you come to realize that you can't act the ground of intelligibility can't be captured within intelligence ability itself and I see that as what is fundamentally going on here it's like look right you stop it right you can't make this stop and and so what we most if we are the creatures that of logos we can't ultimately fully possess ourselves because we can't bring logos to completion to finish and I so again and and I think Socrates I think your point is Right Socrates is the best and yet he still isn't you know he doesn't say I'm done I'm finished it's okay right but can I I just want to say something because I both of the both of these are just kind of bouncing around my head in terms of if you think of of the speech Aristophanes and you have this idea of the the union of at a horizontal level right and and the idea that in some ways Socrates is not you know when Jacob you say that he is that round person right he is that round guy and so because he's that round guy then his eyes can look up towards the God so in some ways like you said he is trying to take he is trying to reach into this fear of the Gods he is trying to move up vertically towards that which should be the place of the Gods um and so and and what's interesting about that is that's why he can also live in this world of horizontality in the in a way that is celebratory right so it's like because he doesn't because his his his arrows isn't directed towards food he can enjoy a feast without becoming a slave of his belly right because his arrows isn't you know and so so because of that and right in some way that's like kind of The Secret of asceticism in some ways right is that if you if you don't live for the pleasures you end up actually being able to to to find pleasure in the world more than you did before it is Chesterton that that kept saying that it's like you know when I became a Christian and I stopped just thinking about cigars and and food and all of a sudden I enjoyed my cigars and my food more than than before because you know my highest my direction was changed you know I wasn't just running after after the things of this world so it's there's an interesting idea that that that the fact that that in some way Socrates is beyond what aristophany says is why he he can look up let's say yeah look no this is this is all great I mean let me so let me let me go back um the the beginning points are really fundamentally different in the case for example of Aristophanes and over there I put he see it and Homer and the rest and Socrates so Aristophanes again we start with chaos these chaotically bouncing around guys and then you got to have order and it's the gods right it's the okay so here's the thing you're going to sacrifice to the gods you're going to have rituals you're gonna obey the God's laws that you know and Zeus will strike you down if you don't okay but Socrates doesn't start with chaos Socrates starts with an internal guidance system he doesn't need external um um moderation or externally imposed like you you know now you guys are going to walk upright you're not going to roll around and so forth because he's not chaotic to begin with the internal guidance system is bureaus and you're absolutely right John you know the ultimate object of Euros is beyond intelligibility right I mean he calls it the beautiful here let's say the good in the Republic right you can't look at the sun you can't you know good is beyond being being um but so let's go back to what John was saying about sorry Jonathan about about the horizontal and the vertical right so when Socrates looks at another human being what does he see he sees the glimmer first he sees the he's I mean we have that ladder of Heroes and that's that's an articulated uh Ascent right so you look and remember how he says you fall in love with another body then you fall in love with the Soul by the way this is uh phenomenologically correct right you know you know you go back to when you're a kid and you're like oh she's cute or something and then you realize like well you're actually interested in the soul of this individual and so forth so so he relates horizontally because he knows that the horizontal leads up let's take his relation to air to Al somebody suppose that he had slept with alcibiotes by the way that's a very aggressive act right also body is like I'm gonna sleep with him I think the way I look at that is if he sleeps with Socrates it shows that Socrates he's taken him down right but you really care about is my body I'm the you know he's the Marilyn Monroe of Athens okay and Socrates doesn't sleep but the Marilyn Monroe of Athens you know uh and it's very insulting to ask somebody but that is a gift to El sobieties you see if if he had slept with him I mean how cheap how what a what a what a disappointing like victory that would be you know there's I mean it's out of respect that he doesn't sleep with him um why because there's there are higher things and so with this account there's this internal guidance system and it leads you up and I I agree with you Jonathan this is this is what makes this is what accounts both for his Equanimity and his ability to enjoy to be with other human beings and it's the secretive Community what is community it is both the unity and diversity that we you know you can't have a community without individuals uh you can have individuals without a community but you can't have that Unity without each person being themselves and yet being together um and of course the story of Babel is like it's a big mistake right because the human beings in Babel I've always thought the bricks that they're they're burning these bricks the the language they make the bricks out of Adama which means the soil the ground which is where the word Adam comes from is made from the so it's like we take these and we baked the crap out of them and there's nothing there and then they're just bricks in the wall right it's just fixing the wall that's right yeah well you see the same in in Exodus you have the same sense in which the Pharaoh is wanting to reduce Israel to basically bricks in his system it's like that he doesn't he he gets rid he wants to get rid of the male so that they're only something to act upon something to kind of to make into part of the system so the Babel uh Egypt can see the structure uh and interestingly like we often say that in in Christianity who said that Pentecost is the anti-babel right and the reason why it's the anti-babel is that it's both at the same time and so it's all people hearing the one message in their own tongue and so there's a unity and multiplicity kind of almost like a extreme unity in multiplicity which is which is kind of proposed as a paradox uh simultaneous simultaneously yeah you know I mean so Babel's very interesting because so that's in Genesis 11. Genesis 10 is another account of the origin of languages which is a sort of organic one I actually feel sorry for the people of Babel and you know why it's a strange story right the people came out of the east or whatever here they come and they say let's build us this city in this Tower right so we're you know so that we're by protected we're not going to be dispersed protected from the flood they just had a massive flood in the story it's like they want to make something high so they don't get taken out by the waters exactly and you know looking back I mean obviously there's going to be historical memory of all these things now their mistake is I mean if you sort of think about it like well who caused the flood God you're going to make this hard hard target right are you going to protect against God that that's not going to work but so I mean you know I could I can understand these guys I mean they're mistaken but they're you know they're trying to sort stuff out um well you just say you can understand anybody who tries to create to save an environment garment are too strong an environment who tries to protect their children so much that they just [ __ ] them because they're trying to stop them from being in any danger like you can understand it right but you can also see that if you create a perfect system that tries to account for all accidents all problems all difficulty you know I mean then you're then you're actually going to stifle create brittle a brittle uh community that will that'll break that'll crack because it doesn't have its own resilience this is very opposite today I mean this is exactly it you know we've got these sort of ideals if we're going to everyone's going to be safe and so forth and you know I also think by the way Elsa biodies um he he wants to be safe he he doesn't want to risk things you know there's a kind of instinct there as well I mean to expose yourself and say yes you know I'm deficient and I'm ignorant and I need to learn so I want to see if I'm drawing a couple of things together from both of you um seemed like there was an idea in Socrates um that the vertical vertical Dimension the anagogic dimension in which he's caught up in kind of a paradoxical relationship to the non-intelligible source of intelligibility that allows him right Equanimity in the face of the extremes of the human spirit I heard that argument sort of emerging right so it's not that he it's not that he is stepped out of his Humanity because he can Feast but he can all spread so I'm hearing it's safe you you coming together saying like you you get into this relationship right and it's incompletable and everything right and it and in that sense it's properly paradoxical but if you live if you live the verticality of the Paradox you can get Equanimity within the horizontality of the human the extremes of the human Spirit I'm hearing that argument being made is that is that Landing as as no I think at least that that's what I yeah I really think that it makes it's actually what makes something real is its connection to the vertical relationship and so but it has to connect a vertical in a way that allows the tension of the horizontal to be livable right so people don't lose their humidity Socrates is equanimity is the preservation of his Humanity even as it's Torn Between all of these extremes that we've been talking about that's what I'm also hearing the argument drawing together did I just impose that on you Jonathan or is that fair no I I totally I totally agree with that yeah I think that's absolutely right and I would also point out here that um the vertical Dimension is not going to work if it's conceived in the way Aristophanes conceives it because what's on the top is Zeus and Zeus is just force it's just he's just a big rapist on the top of the mouth right exactly exactly so you've got to have a Socratic or religious conception of of this vertical there has to be Transcendence up here and only then are you going to get this you know and today I'm afraid again I mean there are many Echoes of our situation it's like we have Zeus right it's like okay here's the order here's the structure right whatever it's going to be it's coming down it doesn't really have a logos it doesn't in any kind of expanded sense but it's control right and that's not going to work um the society will fall apart and so you know again going back to Socrates his attitude is really remarkable it's um it's a kind of engaged Detachment you know like I I think of Socrates as like a really good sport you know you have a game and you play really really hard and win or lose it's okay you know you gave it your best and um I mean it's like in in the dialogue they say well we shouldn't drink very much right they're hungover from the day before and like and Socrates he'll drink or he won't drink it doesn't matter right he's he's you know he's he's sort of easy going reminds me John since you're since you're you're working with Kierkegaard now of the the night of faith and fear and trembling this guy who's just uh easy going and you know he imagines his wife's gonna make him a delicious dinner and he gets home and of course it's the usual stuff it's all fine he has oh you see it in the Symposium Socrates stops on the way to Agatha that's how I said he thinks and then Elsa bites at the end because it's by the way the whole speech of also bodies is like the beginning at the end he talks about how Socrates stood there and for 24 hours he was in contemplation and all the other troops very much very much what is it I can't remember in the Symposium they all get drunk and Socrates offers a proof of the unity of tragedy and comedy but they're all too drunk to remember yeah yeah right and I and I don't think that's happened stamp either I think it points towards what I'm talking about here Socrates is the is the mataksu this way that can get give us um I think Equanimity is a good word Equanimity between tragedy and the tragedy and comedy uh of the uh of human lives yeah and so also this this vertical Dimension I I should mention that you know one of the things Socrates does in any dialogue right is let's take a dialogue like the lockies it's great there's a couple of men and they're trying to figure out should their son study with this and you know it's very practical question right like should they study with this guy who's using a newfangled kind of weapon and then the dialogue turns into a discussion of courage so we start down here and we go up right to a sort of high Universal set of questions Socrates is sort of this always this weaving motion right we're not gonna like take off into the you know go to the moon and not come down we're going to come back down right that is to say talk about courage so we can be courageous um and tragedy and comedy this relates to it because if you're if you're sort of on the ground and you're looking up right that's one perspective but if you're high and you're looking down I would suggest that's sort of the comic perspective right from yeah and in fact Kierkegaard has something about this also in concluding in scientific PostScript when you when you look up from beneath with with the Divine sort of in Prospect it's tragic but when you look down and you turn around the way that's behind you it's it's comic um don't you think in some ways because I just keep having Dante that's just keeps flashing back at me you know because it seems like Dante is working all this out in the comedy you know the the the problem of all these you know of all these it's his whole thing is about arrows basically right ABI Dante everything that he writes is about arrows everything is about how the problem of desire and the proper alignment of design the proper directionality of desire and then in some ways that's also what Dante does is to reconcile tragedy and comedy in that text because obviously the beginning of that story is clearly tragic and then once you move up you have this transformation that that occurs um well although I would just point out though The Inferno does have comedy in it remember those uh those demons who are like in the mud and they're chasing around and all this stuff I mean it's interesting but I I take your general points for sure yeah um so yeah the question oh sorry this is a very Socratic thing to do I'm going to bring the question back again I think this has been a good argument that's made uh but again Plato makes it very clear there's no necessity to this I I think I think you're right Jacob the up and down I mean I think uh David David David DC Schindler in uh impure reason makes an excellent argument right that and you you even see it in the myth of this you you go out but you go back down right the up and the down or like always have to be maintained they both have to be addressed the apps if the if the absolute does not reach into the relative it's not truly absolute and things like those kinds of arguments uh which of course Christianity has done some amazing uh things with um and um but for me it's still I still like like what is it what is it that makes daunted a lot of people their Eros is disproportionate it's out of proportion it lacks latio I mean that's why Virgil is there to remind us that right Virgo represents ratio in a really important way right it's like but where like where where comes forth the the drive to bring proper proportion to one's error all right okay I see what you mean yeah yeah where does it come from I mean I think it comes from suffering that's what I I mean I think that it's when we suffer that that we it's when we suffer that we have the sobriety to measure our arrows like it seems to me that that can but we can also because of our suffering turn into resentment that's right right suffering is an opportunity you could say but you're asking why would one choose one and one choose the other I I understand your question that's a tough one I I I don't I I mean I there's practices one can do and things like that but you know uh uh Socrates has this demonium and other things and for those of us who don't have that what is Plato calling us to do I'm sorry I want I'm going to keep pounding on this because this is for me this I agree with the argument that's been made and you you said I I understood it properly the vertical right the vertical relation with the Paradox allows you to properly proportion right the the horizontal tensions and that gives you Equanimity and and that's why the two are completely the up and down is I get I think that's a good argument but for me I I and I think you know one of the one of the criticisms um no not criticism one of the comments that David makes is you know you see in Plato this too and other sort of keeps trying to find the starting point like where does this start how does it start and I I'm sorry he's infected me with this question I think yes but what is it like and I and I think about this I think about the the person who wants to offer the logos in the face of the sophist the complete sophist like sort of derida on amphetamines or something right it's like like what they're going to keep saying they're just going to keep saying oh but all is they're going to do the hermeneutics of Suspicion because Underneath It All what causes the proportion is just a deeper desire that you're not acknowledging and that's the deeper desire for dominance or power because that's the that's the deepest and most and and they have no justification for making that argument I'm not I'm not I'm not agreeing with that argument I'm just trying to ask the question of what is it that turns us well look this is a super profound question uh let me say that um Plato I think leaves it open if we look at the mythiver at the end of the Republic remember the myth of verse yes yes you know and um people who have lived virtuous lives then they go and they're judged and they're sent off for a thousand years to something like heaven right and people who have lived bad lives they're go for a thousand years of punishment and then they come back and it's like this figure eight it's like Infinity yes and people make the next choice of the next life based on their experience uh of this punishment or delight and the tragic thing is that ER who comes back and reports says the horrible thing is that for most people it was an exchange of goods for ill so you know you live a good life you're up there for a thousand years you enjoy yourself and then and then you yeah yeah you choose you choose a tyranny or something like that and he talks about one guy who came down and didn't read the fine print on the life he chose and he chose a tyranny but those who've been suffering right they come back and they choose carefully and they choose a you know a decent life but then of course they drink of the river of forgetfulness before they're incarnated so they forget all that stuff but then there are these people called philosophers and let's just call let's just for the sake of argument Say by philosopher what we mean now is someone who has the correctly ordered Soul right someone who has solved this problem that you're pointing to John um the question that's never resolved is how do those guys like those guys don't choose on the basis of of their most recent experience exactly and and they don't drink as much of that water or forgetfulness so that they'll remember this right where did they come from and I thought about this a lot and and all I can say is that's what what Plato does is he doesn't show how soccer how philosophy is possible he shows that it is actual right that is to say here's Socrates I can't explain him now you can look at someone like Dostoyevsky right there's a sense in Reading Dostoyevsky and you look at people who are either saved or Damned and there's a way in which on some high metaphysical level the human being makes a choice like I don't know how to explain it but you know there is a sense in which it is up to us that I think we have to believe that and like Jonathan said I like this idea of suffering I mean I know look as you get older as I get older I get more moderate you know my Eros was I was sort of a circle person and now I'm kind of and because you realize like the limits and you the more you learn and the more you know the more you understand that you don't know and and you're more cautious and so forth and um but um you know fortunately I haven't had like any really horrible suffering I don't know what that would do to me uh but I would hope that it would it would it would turn to it I would be able to turn it to Advantage but I don't know what the source of that would be if that's the case yeah I just don't for sure like mythologically in the Bible that seems to be what's happening right it's like death is the cure for this problem uh and that sounds like a horrible thing to say but it seems to be what what that is is that uh dying is the capacity to to to change and the suffering and and death is the is the the capacity to notice the the Gap right like when you suffer you see the Gap and so the the weird thing about the the weird thing about the Christian answer seems to be something like ex choose to to die on purpose seems to be that seems to be the answer to it it's like if you accept dying without it happening to you then then that is what will reorganize your arrows and you know Jacob what you said about getting older I think it's I'm I'm experiencing it obviously because I'm like I'm almost 50 I'm I'm getting older and everything and so hey is that crazy Nifty was a long time ago man yeah for me but what I mean but what I mean is that I can I can see that you know my like my body is is is diminishing right I can see that and so I also noticed that my desires could not diminish right and so and then I see around me because I'm like I said I'm coming close to 50. I see those 52 53 year old guys who who crack and you know like leave their wife and buy a sports car and you know marry some 20 year old or whatever and it's like you know and in some ways I'm noticing that if I die like if I if I accept the death of my body uh and and I and I let's say it it becomes an opportunity for me to reorient arrows and so death is actually an opportunity for me to to be saved from my desires like my body giving out is actually a is actually a wonderful thing if I can take it in the proper way where I can see it happening and notice that it's like it's like oh those things that I wanted like I you know I want to be beautiful I want to be in shape I want to be this it's like you know what I kind of have to let that go because it's gonna happen to me now or later I'm gonna end a frail decomposing body just like everybody else and so I could hold on to that and be the tough guy and and try to to look like I'm 25 until I'm 60 but I can't do that until I'm 80. like there it's I'm gonna hit that limit I might as well die consciously and then and I can notice that it's doing that to me like it's reorienting my desires necessarily or Plato does the same thing philosophy is a preparation of death right and then and there's a connection between like philosophy as that which liberates you from the tyranny of the body and and and and death says that which liberate people from the tyranny of the bodies so the theme is there in Plato um and then I'm trying to get clear so is it I mean I don't want to turn you into Heidegger or something is it um though is it our it's something like like in Tolstoy Ivan Ilitch always knew he was going to die the way you know that two plus two equals four but now Ivanovich knew he was going to die there's like there's a there's a non-propositional waking up to your mortality uh that can um sober you up and perhaps alphabetes never wakes up I mean I think people who want to conquer the world are somehow thinking they will they they will not be mortal by doing so um so it is like an infinite regress where like the four-year-old yeah but what came before that but uh so I could I'm trying to get at so is there a proposal here from you Jonathan that what can make the turn is somebody properly awaken me to their mortality but for that to genuinely be the case it's not something they do it's something that has to strike them it's something they have to suffer you if you did like if you just State your mortality you're not actually experiencing your mentality you understand what I'm trying to yeah it probably depends on people like some people it will they they won't necessarily need a massive Blow from life for that to happen to them and then some people you meet that have gotten that massive blow and then they if they take it properly they're transfigured you can you know I've met several people like that okay but then you can also keep your mind like a recent Saint in the Orthodox Church said you know keep your mind in death all the time you have to remember death like that's how you do it all the time and I think this is a good answer and I'm starting to feel like my question is being addressed um what do you do then since you both are leaders of the uh uh of the Old Testament I don't know if that's a majority of way of talking to about it to you Jacob but um um you know um so Pharaoh keeps hardening his heart and all the plagues keep coming and then God pardons Pharaoh's heart which sounds like yeah so in the end right this can also right the external can also do the opposite to you right your mortality can somehow be a vector by which what is Ultimate can prevent you from ever waking up that's what I take hardening the heart to me like Pharaoh it was now impossible for pharaoh to wake up right um what do you do with that then I mean that's in there for a good I mean yeah that's in there for a good reason I I presume I mean I'm not a Jew I'm not a Christian but you know it could have and Pharaoh continued to harden his heart and that but no right there's this and it's like it stops in the face it's like what's going on there so what what do you again I'm not just I wanna I wanna hear more what what both of you have to say about that you know I think it's really interesting that you mentioned that example um I kind of want to draw a connection between pharaoh and alphabetes because you know I mean what is Pharaoh doing he's doing something that's very human in a way um and that is he's doubling down right I am not going to back off like you know and why isn't he backing off uh well I mean and I should say I mean I this the issue of the hardening of the heart I think the best explanation isn't that you know God did something to Pharaoh that wasn't that Pharaoh wasn't inclined to do I think it's that it's something mysterious there but you know God allowed pharaoh to be supremely feralish you know like he didn't he didn't he didn't sort of help him to see another way he just let him do the Pharaoh thing to the ultimate extreme right and and and we can easily imagine I mean we we see leaders today you know uh who are sort of doubling down on yes on sort of bad bats and so forth um so why didn't Elsa biodies like like Socrates was the blow I think he sort of split else about he's in half in a way right Socrates was the blow that Elsa bodies needed but it didn't work yes yes it didn't work and you know I mean I think you know Jonathan was talking about getting older and um how we react to these things like the decay of the body and so forth and some people react to them with um you know uh just despair let's say or you know it's the most horrible thing that could happen and other people uh see opportunities there it you know I mean and so why would you be inclined to take it with Equanimity right well because somehow in your soul you feel that they're to each thing there is a season you know that there's a kind of order right and I mean so like I have a granddaughter you know so I'm a grandfather um I could imagine someone who says oh my gosh I can't believe I'm a grant I must be getting really old that's not the way to look at it the way to look at it is now you got an opportunity to be with this wonderful child to correct your mistakes as a parent without obligations as a parent and so forth then you know you can have a different kind of relationship it's these are doors that are opening um so what's the difference between these things uh I think that part of the problem with both pharaoh and Elsa bodies is there's nothing above their heads you know Pride yeah yeah I mean you know the Jews Like This is the Passover right in Easter season you know they wear these little Kipas these yamakas to say there's something above me there's something above me there's no one above Pharaoh he's a living God and there's no one above all sobieties and so he's going to be trapped in this horrible um Dynamic where you know I mean if Aristotle is right that people who seek honor want to be honored by those that they respect and admire and then if you say here's Elsa biot he said he essentially respects and admires no one because he's the greatest you know uh then he's not going to be fulfilled with the honor of all these little people yeah that's the hegelian master slaves there yes exactly and yet he's addicted to it yes it's only Socrates that who he truly admires but he can't be Socrates and that's what he wants to be well that's how I understood the Pharaoh thing like if you bind yourself enough like in addiction then you get caught up in something that binds you um and that's what I so it's interesting because in terms of Storytelling you know in the story in the story of Jesus you see moments of this this problem they appear oh first of all Christ I mean Christ presents himself as the as the Capstone and the stumble stone is a good way to understand it right it's like the foundation stone and the stumble stone at the same time and then when Christ is on the cross then you see it play out where you have two thieves that are looking at the dying innocent man and one you know one turns away one turned swords in one mocks one derides and the other you know has a movement towards uh towards him and so you can see how the same Act Right the the this this this dying man is acting in opposite ways it's almost like a judge right it's like it's acting as a judge on the on the on those two people around him uh and that maybe that's it in some way that it that it actually can do both it does both at the same time and and like you said it's hard to know like why how why we're disposed humility but then why humility like why do we why do we go in that direction uh and so so and I think in the end what Jacob says is that we we are faced in some ways we can only ask that question of ourselves like we because that's the only experience we have uh and and maybe that's probably the key is to just say I don't know but I I definitely myself I'm hoping I'm on the side of the one who who uses this as an opportunity yeah I think I think that's good Jonathan I mean you know suppose John we had a a convincing theoretical explanation of your question it would still be the case that we're going to have to act in accordance with the rights you know yeah and I I and I hope it didn't come across that that's what I was after of course but right and uh and you know and we've got to sort of a Kirk a guardian Point um where yeah there's this thing that you you're participating in a decision being made it's not that you don't it's not that you make it and it's not that it's imposed on you and you participate in it so it makes me now make this proposal to you that all of this feeds into a fundamental thing within the platonic framework which is the notion of participation um about the relationship uh the relation of participation that constitutes the vertical axis but also constitutes how the horizontal things are bound together um and for me I guess I'm I'm sort of um well I I I I I I I want to say something like oh that I find that a resolution although I don't find it like like you said Jacob I don't find it an answer like a theoretical oh look John here's the formula X Plus y equals determination right all right uh but I do I do this idea that we are ultimately things are ultimately grounded in this this this participation you talked to Father Maxis about the like the idea of synergy like that's it's that's it's a beautiful way like in some ways it's like you just you know you you can't do it on your own you but you open the door this little sliver and a bit of light comes in and then it kind of gives you the courage to open it a bit more and so there's this this this call and response uh mechanism you could say yeah I agree I think it's dialogical properly understood that you know and uh there's what tilak and Plato come together but uh but but even even that Rick uh and I uh the remarkable somebody said I should replace amazing with remarkable groups then I get all ours the remarkable Rick lapetti we're trying to do about because the problem the problem we're up against is the Paradox of self Transcendence uh Galen uh sproston made a very good point about this if if Transcendence means something other than what I am then I can't possibly make it right um and if it just means the extension of what I am right then it's not Transcendence it's just it's just growth and but somehow we put the two together with self-transcendence um it's it's a paradoxical thing uh did that first of all makes sense as a paradox because I mean I would tend to say it's the source like because the source of what you are isn't you completely although it's at the it's at the it's at the origin right it's like the the origin of something isn't in the system but it without it the system can't exist and so all the system is pointing to that is pointing towards it but it transcends it but not in a weird arbitrary way it's it's actually the source of it well that's what I'm you're doing you're doing you're an acting participation and so I think there's something about because what I can say and then give me a chance to respond to what I'm saying right I could say to you oh but what is a self how can you how can there be a self if it's sources outside of itself a self is something whose sources within itself that's what it is to be yourself right and and and and then the answer to that is well then what right but you have to understand a self is something that is inherently participatory and dialogical in nature and that's the perfect guardian and also I think the socratic answer right the the self is something that is inherently is inherently dialogical and therefore inherently participatory through and through yeah I think that's absolutely right I mean look um you know uh from the platonic perspective the soul uh relates to reality I mean it you know it relates to the good it relates to the ideas it's open and it it that's where its measure is I mean it's interesting because if you sort of think about the story of you know the Tower of Babel like the question is are the measures of God going to be the human measures or are the measures of man you know I mean and so there's there's a kind of um so the self can't be understood without relation without pointing to what is not the self the answer to the question of how this question of self-transcendence I think in the in the platonic context we're going to have to go back to Eros right so yes exactly exactly right so that I mean Eros can provide this ladder by this relationship El sobieties is Aristo you know aristophanic in the sense that he's really seeking him set his other half in a way like it's all about himself his Eros is directed toward this vision of who else sobieties could be and um so yeah I mean looking out to the other and then it you know and then of course this weird kierkegaardian thing as well right that love of self turns into Love For Love of another but then that love of the other is actually the fullest self-fulfillment uh well I I was gonna I was gonna say that I mean you bring up perfect guard I mean aren't we all aren't we ultimately proposing the final transformation right Plato does transforming Eros and then of course platinus also puts it in motion right and then and then Christianity comes and sort of says but but in the end the love that puts you into a relationship with the other by which you come to fulfillment is agape right because that is that is right that is the love that creates the other that then nevertheless has come from you like because the model is the the parent with the child and of course the giving birth is all through the the Symposium as well so is is is is is that what we're coming to here that when we like what what turns us is that that which that we we are turned when we participate in the transformation that is always available to us of Eros into Agape is that now coming out because that's that's the thing right because like it right there's a sense in which if if I if I'm just drawn to the other rather than participating in the self foot of the other I'm still there's still aggression there's still violence at the heart of it it's only in Agape where that where the resolution could finally come to be seen because there I am it looks like violence because I'm creating the other but it's exactly the opposite of violence I am giving myself over to the full giving and participating in the other becoming a self Beyond me and other than me but nevertheless in relationship with me you know what I like about that is actually that's a wonderful description of how Kierkegaard regards Socrates right in other words yes you know here's the thing about Socrates when Socrates is relating to you you are the center of the universe he is relating to you there's a very beautiful um uh a book called The Last of them of the wine uh and it has a description of Socrates um speaking to the main character and uh he's he's a boy you know and Socrates comes and sits down next to him in the grammar school and the kid turns around and looks at him he says no adult ever looked at me like that like his eyes were just on me it was about me and so I mean this is interesting because as you know I mean Kierkegaard loves to sort of have these kind of asymptotically approaching lines you know Christianity and Socratic yeah Jesus yeah yeah very much yeah yeah is not you know the the consumerative gays it's the Midwife in Gays it's the games that is helping you to give birth like it's affording you to give birth to yourself exactly exactly and you know I mean this is one of the pleasures of teaching I mean this is this is why so many of us like stick with it you know I mean because there's nothing more fulfilling than seeing a young adult grow and and and you know flourish and mature and and bring forth wonderful things uh that's the Fulfillment of the teacher and I think Socrates was a teacher so could the difference be the degree to which again I'm not looking for a formula the degree to which people have been I'll use platonic language here to read to which people have been impregnated by Agape is that the thing that can wake them up because we agree to which Agape is alive in them is the degree to which they can waken up is that is that a possibility that that rings with the two of you in any way so in some ways you would suggest that that that it it's not just a self-willed thing right that that you could encounter someone you know that would that would provoke like by that by the by their communion by the way they look at you by the way they they they treat you that they could provoke in you that response yes yes yes yeah I think it's definitely one of the one of the possibilities that definitely I like it yeah it's very good I think this is a good place to start stop our first conversation though I feel like this is not going to be our last this was wonderful I really and I have a lot to I definitely have a lot to think about and certain links you know because I kind of dismissed aristophanese you know as the butt of the joke and the in the Symposium and I think though he's still he still is to some extent for sure but but uh but seeing it frame more as a as a structural move between the different uh the different speeches helps me to to see how there's definitely something to take from from his um from his myth so Jacob thanks for this wonderful conversation oh thank you guys it's it's it's it's really wonderful to be able to talk to both of you whom I admire so much so yeah this has been great I really I really appreciated this a lot um yeah I I I I I like the fact that we you know we I hope this is not I hope this is not so promotional I mean I'm in the midst of after I mean I'm done but after Socrates is still rolling out and we're doing exactly this with the the piece on Socrates and Purdue guard again influenced by Jacob's wonderful book and so I I found and I hope this isn't me appropriating things unduly but I found everything we were doing here just wrestling and wrestling fruitfully the way you know uh uh you know Israel wrestled with god um right wrestling very fruitfully uh with the with this these questions that are in so I'm very grateful for this I you know I think this is an excellent uh companion to uh that part of the after Socrates Series so thank you very much for that I know uh it just it's a gift in that way so I really appreciate it all right and so I will be I will finish this though I will shamelessly plug something which is that that John and I were going to be in Chino California in uh May uh and so we'll put a link to that in the description I don't know even though if there are places left but if there are it's it's you have to you have to get them because it's going to be a great conversation the search for a spiritual the quest sorry the Quest for a spiritual home is the theme of the conference and you can see how that was all through what we were talking about here today so I don't know anything about this conference but I'd like to learn more so listen if you guys send me your addresses I'll make sure you get a copy of my book on Plano and the talmud so great all right thanks to thanks to all of you and so uh so to everybody watching we'll we'll talk to you very soon bye-bye thanks a lot bye bye guys
