ladies and gentlemen how many of you enjoy playing against chess Bots yes obviously I'm talking about mittens or Nelson or Martin are any of them in between it's a nice little way to avoid ELO anxiety to practice some new openings and tricks and tips and so on and so forth but in this video I'm going to share with you the fact that for the first time ever a chessbot evolved kind of like a Pokemon remember lariobot I uploaded a video not too long ago of myself playing Mario or lariobot well chess.com evolved my bot first there was lario then he became fire lario he was rated 1400 or something like that but in today's video I played against super plumber the one that shines bright and if any of you remember that famous game that we've played in our childhoods you know what happens when that bot turns red hot like a star the bot melts everything in its path so I played two games against this bot with a chess ELO of 999. let's see how it went ladies and gentlemen oh it talks like me finally they made a bot that speaks like me ladies and gentlemen in this video I'll show you how I became an Intergalactic Cosmic entity born of comet dust and starlight let's go it's Sami star plumber they could not call him a star Mario because Nintendo would have sue them and chess.com has grown a lot but they don't have enough money so if they're gonna go up against Nintendo they don't have the legal fans all of the growth of the last three years gonna go straight to the lawsuit okay terrific I'm on the chest TV yes everybody can play the ball today all right um let's play D4 you know before I was a plumber I spent a few semesters at Baruch College it was fine nothing special who the [ __ ] made this bot what why are they talking about my alma mater they had nothing else to say that's the best they could come I have like 20 catchphrases and that's what they came up with oh my God I don't even all right by the way I don't actually know if this bot is like 999 or not I like I have no idea all right it's playing a uh Queen's Gambit playing at a night's variation okay the bot is playing uh semi-slav defense okay this is one of the best openings critical line Heroes Bishop G5 giving it the pawn on C4 more solid line is E3 I'm gonna play solid line because I have no idea who I'm actually up against again 999 they they made mittens one okay and then and then it was like a god I want to play Bishop E2 all right I mean it would be kind of a shame if it was just as good as mittens but hopefully they made it even better castles you can't go wrong yet okay let's put it this way you can't go wrong yet in a Queen's Gambit now the best plan is that is not the best plan but it's a plan is the bot gonna play a five like aggressively oh God it plays like me too um now I need to get to E5 so one of the ways to play here I think is to play Bishop D3 Knight E2 but I'm actually very concerned about something if I play Bishop D3 can the bot play G5 Knight E2 G4 or do I have Knight E5 in this position all right let's play Bishop D3 let's see what happens okay terrific please plays that wonderful um not nothing to be afraid of and this is actually probably why Bishop D3 originally was the more accurate move but I'm terrified I'm playing a bot with a rating of 999. okay it's stopping me from going there for now um no I can play Knight at fortnite H5 which looks a little bit maybe maybe this looks a bit ooga I'm not worried about G5 yeah stupid bot G5 what do you think this is huh what do you what I'm gonna go A4 I'm I'm instigating on the queen side what are you gonna do I'm not worried about no G5 G5 stupid bot uh maybe I slide my Bishop back and then try to get to E5 like oh that looks like a nice plan look at Gotham the positional Maestro Knight D3 Knight E5 taking advantage of the Bots dark squared weaknesses see this is a place exactly like me completely negating its positional problems do I Rush that move let's do it now look at that exploiting it Sensational um bro you think you can out Plumb me that's what the bot just said it said bro you think you can out Plumb me okay so if I take with an item losing a pawn because after Bishop takes Pawn takes there is DC4 hitting my queen I think which means I'm gonna take with the pawn what is giving me the bishop Queen takes then Bishop A3 is my is the bot gonna go there no way oh that's Giga dank that's what the kids call Giga dank I don't believe that for a second no chance it's gonna go there I'm calling all the Bots moves maybe because I play bot because they gotta check my uh you know like yeah or something like that all right Queen E2 I gotta sidestep the default I'm kind of expecting Bishop A6 oh wait no my plan here was to take here that was my plan it was to take on e4 wait is there C3 no I just take that gonna take nice I gotta take the pawn back Queen C4 or bc4 bc4 looks really stupid but Queen C4 now Queen C4 has got to be right I might listen I'm keeping even with the bot uh oh I just said that that move didn't make sense and the bot just played it instantly so that's probably a bad sign if I play Bishop D4 the bot is gonna go C5 actually the bot is gonna go C5 regardless of what I do so I should probably play Bishop C1 how does the bot guard the pawn by counter attacking my Pawn if I take Rook B3 really yeah actually yeah yeah just a hundred percent actually yep that is exactly accurate and if I play Bishop B2 preventing Rook C3 the bot is gonna go C5 Bishop D5 okay well it seems we have a little problem no problem no no worries maybe A5 but then B5 oh but then I take oh that actually looks good I'm going A5 is that what Mario says I don't know I like okay and so what so what I get a free Pawn idiot bot is so bad all right yeah I knew that was gonna happen and so and so and and what and you open your Bishop I gotta pass tape on bro you're not worried first of all doesn't Queen B1 just guard my b-pawn yeah I don't want to be too greedy I kind of like Queen G4 I think this is a very sophisticated move because I Target that I got eyes on that I can block that everything's good rookie hey yo this dude is cheating like I swear he said what is this yeah E4 let's do it I kind of want to block out let's go I'm all in Bishop G5 Bishop F6 yay ain't [ __ ] yay [ __ ] but how about that Bishop G5 I will take you I made you you are me or something Bishop F6 boom can the king just go here oh that's bad because I have to keep the pin but I'm gonna lose my okay oh I almost hung my queen that would have been wait is this okay no but that does look scary uh so still not afraid Not Afraid rookie one I'm going all in bro yo I was just playing uh [Music] Star Plus yo um I listen I don't mean no beef dude I was just trash talking I was trying to sell the the fight you know I didn't uh you you know I'm it's all dude relax it's not that serious dude it's you know what's up man you know me you know me we go way back dude yeah bro you don't got to take the road it's not a big Don't Take The Rook okay maybe don't take my Pawn I don't all right F5 just do me a favor and just don't attack my king please at least don't play Queen A2 check all right can we just agree on that no Queen okay thank you no Queen A2 thank you very much all right all right uh we're losing but you know it's an interesting game do I have no threats at all right Rook G3 um I mean I'm attacking stuff he's got no checks you can't check what rugby I'm not afraid of Rook B2 so oh so what if I go to the back rank you ladder made me or something okay there it's made if I go there it's mate if I go there it's mate all right well that means by process of elimination I gotta go forward right he's not gonna check me again he he doesn't even he doesn't even see this move it's not even a big deal okay see he he didn't see I'm gonna run my king forward what are you gonna do what are you gonna make me or something stupid uh there's no Checkmate you got nothing see told you no checkmate oh my God ah yo you suck star plumber you are trash bro you suck what do you say bro Alpha zero self-destructed after losing to me oh my God can star plumber beat oh my goodness oh my goodness 9 000 ELO chess bot ah that was tough that was a tough one okay uh maybe we rematch I don't know maybe we don't maybe we don't rematch game review can I get a game review in that game How well was I doing I think I was doing okay I ignored an opportunity to connect the Rooks okay well yeah I mean you know sea chess is simple I just need to connect my Rooks more and I'll be a grand master and you know play it one more time maybe with black or what rematch or what rematch but I no no oh I'm black all right yesterday I checkmated stockfish with all pre-moves nobody asked let's play a modern defense okay does it make a difference if you pre-order my book on Amazon or Barnes Noble no uh age five is is bot gonna go here oh my God that is the top engine move I was trying to play like a structural battle I was trying to play a battle where like uh I trade the dark squared [ __ ] up and all this stuff I think I'm just gonna die I think I'm just not going to win this game A6 is pretty useful because I stopped Knight B5 the bot is doing this in such an exotic way okay I'm gonna walk my king to G7 no no this is okay okay actually not that concerned wait a minute super concerned uh how do I do this though do do I play Bishop G4 and then Knight D7 is is that how we play this structure to get rid of the Knight I don't know oh Lord what did I just do okay I can't play F6 now okay so what I can play 90 if I play Knight t7 is the bot gonna go C6 now it plays B4 uh uh okay very tense position Maybe Knight F6 oh God I don't understand though don't I just take on e4 but don't I just do this did it just blunder what that's not a good move what is it doing wait is the what what is that combo bro I'm about to report this thing for cheating what ha what is what is this bot doing I'm so perplexed it can't go at four yeah but so what I just like move my queen or something I don't I don't think this was a good plan it still can't go here yeah Queen E6 King G7 King G7 is it gonna take now [ __ ] oh now it's going here yeah and now it's gonna get to my king ah there it is wait a minute King G7 it's not so simple not so simple so what so what I got my power my Queen's mad strong oh oh oh this is gonna get really bad wait don't I have Queen F5 Knight H5 yeah I got Queen F5 I don't have Queen F5 because after take take there's Knight E6 okay Rook H6 so what what nobody nobody's ever lost to a bot before okay a giant bullet with eyes teeth and arms just bounced off of me your check is not concerning dude this Nintendo better not see this game oh my God you know I was doing so well like on move four no I don't like losing ah I don't like losing this much okay Rook F7 [Music] oh what what on Earth rookie four Bots are so depressing because they play perfectly it doesn't matter I can give a check it's just gonna make me move my queen anyway I don't see Force mate but oh oh Knight h8 discovered check and then it's made it's gonna triple ladder mate me bro bro oh it mated me with a pawn it made me with a nah that's crazy come on man oh my God man I don't even man but bro I don't even like Bots like whatever all right you guys are just happy
