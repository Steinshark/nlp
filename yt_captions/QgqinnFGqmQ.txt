okay the most requested video I've had in a long time a mister who's the boss style Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus battery test let's do this so the phones in question are the galaxy s 10 plus base model iPhone 10's max while we mate 20 Pro which is the current king then we got the oneplus 60 and the galaxy note 9 from last year to see how much of an improvement we've made and right now I'm just basically downloading all the same apps on the phones and setting them to the exact same brightness using a Lux ometer and also making sure that they've got Wi-Fi on Bluetooth on NFC on and location on but everything else off okay so I've just removed the cables from all the phones so batteries have started to drain and to start with I pulled up YouTube and we're watching some of the more recent mister who's the boss coverage on the galaxy s 10 and we're just going to let it play for 20 minutes half an hour and see what happens so a couple of things to note first of all these phones are not set to all maximum brightness they're set to an identical level because different phones have different maximum levels of brightness and I think it's fair to compare what would be an equivalent experience the phones may look like they're at a different brightness level or the colors might look a little distorted but that's because each furn has a slightly different angle to the camera all right after a pretty heavy YouTube session the iPhone is currently on top and the rest of the phones sort of bundled together in a pack with one plus 60 kind of straddling behind I've now pulled up tumbler and in this video I'm trying to simulate a more realistic usage case I think a lot of battery tests and something I used to do a lot is just run benchmark after benchmark but a lot of you guys wanted me to spend more time on social medias and the things you've actually be using so you get a realistic idea of what your battery life would be if you take a quick look at the specs at the bottom you'll notice that the mate 20 pro has the largest battery of the bunch with the s 10 plus and the note 9 pretty closely behind the iPhone has by far the smallest battery but at the same time it's running the latest iOS 12 point 1.4 and iOS generally is quite efficient at handling limited battery capacities so we'll see how it compares ok we spent about an hour and a half on social media so we're not going to move on to something a little bit more intensive the application you're seeing is called a Thomas it's kind of like a intense particle simulator so yeah that'll push the phones a little bit more now when you're looking at these specs at the bottom you might also notice the display resolutions and this is always a bit of a tricky topic so the Galaxy S 10 plus mate 20 Pro and the note 9 all have quad HD plus displays but simply because a lot of people can't tell the difference by default they'll come loaded with a full HD plus setting so I think the fairest way of testing it is to use this because that is what 95% of people will have the phones on and also it's going to show you what the battery life is like whilst providing an equivalent viewing experience to the wom plus 60 which can't go any higher than 1080p you might have noticed the results starting to shift in favor of the S 10 plus and the mate 20 Pro which kind of makes sense these are the two most recent devices and are also two of the most efficient devices because of the chipset they're running on the s10 plus I have here is an X in are spaced version which means it's running on an eight nanometer chipset now the main xx Pro has the Kiran 980 based on a seven nanometer process essentially the smaller this number gets the more power you can pack into a device that actually consumes less bear in mind the iPhones a 12 Bionic chip is also based off an efficient seven enemy2 process but it's probably falling behind just because it's battery is that much smaller just before we carry on order mention that I've launched a big galaxy s 10 give away with everything Apple prob'ly giving away five devices so if you want to find out about that link is in the description below okay for a temporary hiatus on the intensive applications we are on Instagram which if you're anything like me is 20% of your time spent on your phone so we're going to run this for about 40 minutes and then switch onto the next thing and as you just want to use this as an opportunity to answer one of the most asked questions in the last battery test batteries degrade over time as you use them so if for example I was using the device I use on a day-to-day basis as one of the phones in this test it'll be giving you a skewed result it would perform poorer than a device that you've just taken out of the box so a lot of you are asking do I use the same device is the mate 20 producing in this test the phone I use day to day the answer is no so all five firms that are being tested here are phones that I've reserved for battery testing only so they've had less than 10 charging cycles on them so it should give you a pretty representative result the galaxy s 10 plus is doing really well in fact it's even pulled quite significantly ahead of the mate 20 pro and if it beats that phone that's gonna be something to celebrate because that phone is incredible for battery life don't get me wrong the s10 plus is battery capacity is very good but that can't be the full story here because otherwise it wouldn't be beating them 820 Pro and my suspicion is that this has cemented with one UI one UI is Samsung's completely redesigned software skin and to be honest just using it feels lighter there's fewer menus there's less bloatware included this might be why the battery is doing so well and this would also go a long way to explaining the note nines result so now a note 9 is way ahead of the iPhone and a fair bit ahead of the oneplus 60 as well and this wasn't always the case and funnily enough the note 9 I'm using actually got given the update this morning literally just before I started filming so convenient timing but also that could definitely explain that this vastly improved performance all right things are heating up two of the phones are now on single digits so we're on YouTube looking through my videos as always and we're just gonna see which one tanks first either way though this is a close battle not to mention one where I'd say all the phones are doing really well in fact there's no phone on here which I'd say has anything less than ain't good battery life I didn't mention this earlier but halfway through the battery test I actually turned the torches on for each phone so they're firing into the table underneath right now but that means that even the result you get on this test even the six hours plus that all of these phones have lasted even that is a slight underestimation of what you could expect okay the iPhone was actually the first one to finish and it lost its last few percentage points really quickly which is actually a common thing that iPhone users complain about and pretty incredible to note that at the same time the S 10 plus is still on 19% that's unheard of I think in any test I've ever done and to emphasize the takeaway here shouldn't be that the iPhone tennis max says lost and it sucks at battery life it's actually done really well bear in mind that it's got not only the largest display but also the highest resolution on show right now and considering that it's capaz is so small I think it's done really well to last this long fast-forward a bit and only the s10 plus remains last man standing so we're going to let YouTube run for a little bit fully accelerate this process cedar after just literally watch it going down and then pull up in a game just to finish it off alright so the end results and I would say I'm surprised I nearly go as far to say I'm shocked at what we actually ended up seeing in fifth place was the iPhone 10s max at 6 hours and 11 minutes good performance and a lot better than the standard iPhone 10s we then have the oneplus 60 not much longer at 6 hours and 16 this phone really benefits from the extra four hundred million powers of capacity that oneplus added over the 1 plus 6 I'm impressed with the note 9 it lasted a good 25 minutes longer than the oneplus 60 at 6 hours and 41 and we already know that mate 20 pro is an absolute battery life monster so it's not a surprise that this came in second place but only lasted about 6 minutes longer than the note 9 at 6 hours and 47 and that leaves the S 10 plus with a staggering 7 hour 30 minutes of screen on time and don't forget this was way more intensive test than an average realistic use case scenario so I'm just I'm floored this is incredible battery life performance and we're yet to see how it holds up over time but the future looks pretty bright for more in-depth smartphone comparisons as subscribe it would be massively appreciated don't forget to hit the description for the giveaway information and as always my name is Aaron this is mister who's the boss and I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you
