ladies and gentlemen I have done something very very naughty but potentially extremely exciting and I'm going to share it with you in this video before I get found out before I get discovered and before I get in trouble for doing what I am about to do I'm currently in Toronto in Canada and I'm in Toronto because in a couple of days the most important chess tournament of the year is beginning which is called the candidates tournament the person that wins the candidates tournament plays for the world championship and I'm here interviewing players and I was re interviewing none other than Magnus Carlson former world champion to get his thoughts on the candidates and then I did something bad I snuck onto Magnus Carlson's chess.com account and I'm currently sitting on Magnus Carlson chess.com account we are going to play some games we are going to talk to some people and we're going to see what the experience is like of playing against Magnus Carlson and playing as Magnus Carlson now of course a little caveat before I get into all of this and before I get in trouble don't Smurf especially don't be a stronger player going on weaker player accounts don't play in prize money tournaments don't do any of that stuff I got to give you all the caveats before you go and do this I am a weaker player playing on Magnus Carlson's account so we're going to kind of we're going to we're going to we're going to see what happens um I already have some challenges here um I have a bullet challenge like I have a bunch of people adding me as a friend this is really funny I'm playing bullet on Magnus Carlson's chess.com account somebody challenged me to a game and they have a dual lingo profile photo Magnus has so many challenges it's unreal like he logs in and it's just like like I logged in and I got some like challenges from 3,000 rated players okay so nothing happened okay that person just challenged me to a game what if I just seek in the bullet pool all right I'm playing somebody from uh Argentina should I say hi I'm playing a bullet game let me play a Scandinavian why does Magnus have legal moves on he doesn't know how the pieces move I have another challenge I'm being challenged by a 2200 oh my goodness uh I got to be really fast I I do not have the mouse to be playing uh one minute chess right now this is actually very stressful uh oh my goodness I'm just playing random people this person is rated 1318 maybe after the game I'll like say hello okay let's take let's go here it would be really embarrassing to also lose on magnus's account because then I will get in a lot of trouble like at least if I beat somebody you know they're going to refund them like how they do with the speedruns but I can't lose okay this is capturable let's play Knight F5 oh my God it's really stressful actually I'm playing I'm like about to lose to a 1300 okay let me block that pawn cuz it looks really strong um this is a terrible move but I did it anyway Bishop F6 is very scary luckily they didn't do it maybe Queen H4 oh Knight G5 is really good you got to see that oh my God night CH okay luckily they did not see that I mean I'm still in like a lot of trouble like that was a really good breakthrough opportunity there for my opponent oh my goodness oh my is that mate how did they see that how's that even possible this person's 1,400 Rook takes that five is like absolutely killer okay luckily they didn't play that oh my God I should not have accepted a bullet challenge this is really stressful actually I'm about to lose a game on Magnus Carlson's account can you imagine oh I could have taken the bishop what am I doing oh my God I lost w w w get that out of here get that out I don't even want to see that I almost lost the game on Magnus Carlson's account oh my goodness I said good game let's see if they say something back this PO person is going to make me think that they were beating Magnus oh little do they know oh this is real bad oh my gosh I mean I I I'm using like a a really terrible travel setup and I have my Mouse but the mouse can't move on the table like I don't have a trackpad so the the mouse was hardly moving okay that was really bad let me let me play a three minute game let me all right what would Magnus play Let's Play Knight F3 play a viewer uh Knight F3 my opponent also an intermediate um I feel like Magnus would play this feel like they're ready all right I told my opponent hello I don't exactly know how it works on ch.com like can you chat with people I I I I turned that off a long time ago but if Magnus is the one chatting like maybe they'll you know okay Knight C6 um this is a good move generally Knight in front of the sea Pawn is not particularly great uh then I'll play Bishop F4 you know what would be really funny if I played a cheater cuz technically I'm not cheating because I'm not better than so like even though technically this is smurfing I'm not like I'm not a better player I mean I you know he would beat these people too that's a great move by the way defending let me give this check see if my opponent you know okay very nice nicely spotted okay Queen goes back to D1 opponent is playing very well so far everybody's actually played very I almost lost the first game that was that was really cool uh cuz I just physically could not move the pieces in a bullet game uh that was awesome that was an intermediate and that person almost beat me E5 is a great move by the way E5 is great I'm going to go here um so far my opponent has played a excellent game of chess like really seriously um H6 is a good move here oh my goodness I'm going to put put a uh uh put a bunch of Pawns on dark squares because I don't have a dark squar Bishop anymore and uh we're going to see what happens here but so far this has been really really tough to deal with now I would I would love to okay hopefully oh that's not even a good what am I doing there can put the Knight there going oh my did you see I almost disconnected they're going to kick me off the internet here for getting on magnus's account um yeah Knight to B2 would have been a lot better but right now what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to break through the center with this move Pawn to F3 and um then we're going to uh maybe not because the queen is let's put one more Pawn on a dark square there's nothing really wrong with this move those squares are covered um yeah let's play C4 F5 is a bit scary I mean I'd be very impressed if my opponent plays F5 okay I have another challenge I have another Blitz challenge I have like 50 friend requests wait till they find out I mean maybe it'll still be interesting to people you know maybe it'll be like well I didn't play um Magnus but I played Gotham when they you know see the video but this person okay so now I have all of this coming now I take and and yeah my opponent can't take back that was that was a big mistake and sometimes a mistake in chess is uh okay you can still survive but that mistake is splitting some very very important pawns and um I'm going to take this one my opponent's going to take back with the pawn and then unfort okay I don't know why you let me take all the pawns also you got to keep in mind every time a pawn moves something opens so my opponent just lost one pawn two pawns three pawns and is now going to lose a bishop on top of that and then it's game over I mean I I feel like I played this game like Magnus very positional and they uh they they they do in fact resign that was a um that was nice oh my God are you are you y'all can't I think I have sounds off so y'all can't hear that I have so many challenges oh my goodness oh my goodness I'm going to say hi all they're all going to be famous oh my goodness hi Magnus play me hi oh I mean look there's a lot of things you could do with identity theft you know and I'm not going to do any of those things I'm not going to open up a account on ches.com the best courses you know um now some people are saying it's not the real Magnus that's weird are they in the room with me how how would they uh okay I have um I'm gonna I'm gonna play I'm gonna play this person this person is uh 1,700 so but I'm Magnus and even if I'm not Magnus I can still be a 1700 so yeah it'll be great except now I think this person is reconsidering playing Magnus Carlson yeah unfortunately a though great team um okay I'll play uh play Daniel got another challenge uh let me go E4 this game you think this person will deduce who I am based on the openings that I play like if this person plays E5 okay this person is not writing anything and not moving terrifying oh okay this person is back I just got a game against this person oh he plays caran oh my goodness maybe ax is a Gotham fan little will he know he's going to be famous let's play dform and let's play what what I've been playing a lot recently which is the um F3 caroan I want to say caroan just like Gotham chess which is like basically the I mean can you imagine getting a game against Magnus and then he says Carl KH just like Gotham chess he says yes of course okay except this is not a good move come on AA you got to go E5 here cuz I think I can just go E5 now myself okay but he's very confident yeah I think you're not supposed to give me so much space um but it's probably fine it's probably not completely terrible oh he's playing quickly so that's important I'm going to develop my Bishop to safeguard my my Center here um and I guess I'll develop my knight cuz developing pieces is good I was going to go Bishop here but then I guess a can take which is kind of annoying um although that doesn't really scare me I don't think take take Bishop H4 check let's see if Mr ax will go here how clever is he to remove right cuz my Bishop will have to he says I hope everyone had a good Easter we did thank you what a nice guy I mean probably he will see this video and be like oh damn April fools but that's okay I mean this is this is you ever see those prank videos where people do horrible things to other people like they bully them or they get beaten up they dump things on them in the middle of a store this is like a harmless a you know this is this is a harmless prank I feel like um let's go here and here you know I feel like this is a good prank I mean maybe Magnus will be mad at me and never speak to me again but I think I think he'll I mean unless I lose a game so we're transferring over here I don't like how Mr ax is playing this very passively it's giv I have a lot of central space I I do want to like blunder my queen to somebody though like I I think for the end of this video I want to lose a game as Magnus because I think that will just like change somebody's life I think they will be so happy but is it bad if I then take that away from from them oh I don't know so conflicting let's go King H1 just the general improving move to get off this diagonal probably not necessary but I feel like Magnus would have played it no he wouldn't have F6 is definitely an idea um I mean I was thinking like Bishop here but somehow I don't have a Checkmate that's actually a pretty good move and slightly annoying one as well Bishop F4 if takes I guess I'll take with a knight I also have to speed up now the Bishops are seeing each other Bishop takes maybe I have like a discovered attack which is strong but you know I can just do this as well this is also totally reasonable and my attack is very powerful because if Mr ax takes the Knight I take with the bishop I attack the queen I threaten Checkmate and I win the game just like Magnus would I mean again th this level disparity is still fine but if I play a 3,000 oh my gosh it's going to be really really bad it's going to be really bad for me okay but no but this is crazy because this bishop is hanging this B Bishop is hanging at least Checkmate has stopped but maybe a just thought this might be the you know my opponent might be experiencing the Magnus effect that's what this could be also I have a really brutal move I have a tactic here called attraction I can play Rook takes f8 check right now if I take this bishop it's a fork on the rook and the queen right but if I attract the king to that square like a magnet then this wins a queen which is even more brutal so Bishop takes and then this and uh yeah unfortunately I'm picking up a bishop here and a queen with check and at the end of it as if I wasn't gluttonous enough I take the bishop here as well so this is uh these are now the concluding moves and now I will sacrifice a queen for a Checkmate as one does when they are Magnus I will also make sure the king cannot Escape off the back Rank and uh Knight C7 does delay the inevitable and even this I can take and Rook there is a Checkmate oh my goodness I have so many challenges oh my goodness people are arguing oh my goodness people are arguing in the comments the comments the the the chess.com offline chat is crazy right now they're saying this is not the real Magnus you idiots this is the real Magnus he's totally the real mag oh my goodness uh who do I even play so many people want to to play me somebody is challenging me to a 202nd game I feel like if I lose a 22nd game Magnus will be quite upset um this person's challenging me again this was the person I tried to play in the beginning of the video if they use a bot I will be absolutely devastated all right I got to I don't trust anybody who plays Bullet like I just don't trust okay okay maybe may may maybe this is a real person it's a Gambit that I'm playing okay they did not accept my Gambit Knight C6 that's not a good move Magnus would have found that okay let's develop hopefully we don't lose to this person I got a terrible position the last time I played bullet but this time I'm like pressing the mouse as hard as possible holding on for deer life this person says hi I said hi the the more nice you are to me the higher chance you know I I might have of uh letting you get a win my opponent said real question mark okay they're distracting me I have 20 seconds I got to to speed up I hope my opponent says like big fan of Gotham though all right this is a nice little idea The Rook is hanging uh it's not quite Checkmate but I will take this Pawn to go takes and now check and we crisscross applesauce a little checkmate with the bishop I have so many one minute now a bunch of people want to play me in bullet I think they saw that I was struggling in bullet and now they want to play me in some bullet games uh who should I play this person wants to play unrated Nadal 2013 C3 okay it's a very scary move C3 is very scary London okay so fast oh my goodness I like my structure my opponent clearly doesn't like my structure okay we've traded some pieces this a quite a solid player that's not the best move because the pawns are damaged but could be worse o now I'm going to take do we play a queen end game feel like Magnus would play a Queen endgame give a check ooh but now of course we take because we have more pawns this is we're winning this exactly how Magnus would H5 just don't lose on time yeah and so I just have more pawns and my king is more active and so now wherever my opponent is going to move I'm just going to take a pause I guess I can just go B5 although it's probably not the best yeah and now wherever my opponent moves the king I just get in I take uh I can just come back I can also take this so I get I get a bunch of Pawns here I come back and my opponent can't cross the center line uhoh did I just make this more difficult for myself maybe not that was really really stupid of me and now if they push I give a check now I am not going to play games here I do not have the mouse for this oh my goodness oh that was stressful I'm going to say good game that was way too close for comfort oh my God gosh oh I got to breathe I got to I'm like losing to some of these subscribers I'm almost losing I mean that game was was pretty um that game was was was a little bit better I feel like that one was a little bit less um people in the chat are saying they're confused I think they're confused because I'm playing so poorly maybe we end with like a longer game maybe we end with a with a rapid game against the viewer why are people saying I'm a fake account I don't it it's literally Magnus Carlson like what what do they want I think they're just watching my games and watching me struggle so they think like a staff member loged in which is which is not nice okay that's not nice all right I understand I'm not as good as him but like gez all right let's end with a five minute game um and let's play Let's Play London ourselves let's end with a little London little 5minute action Knight C6 uh definitely not a bad move um but it's a little bit better to attack the London with the c pawn my opponent not interested in pleasantries what if I say Happy Easter I guess it's not really Easter anymore huh um we'll just play this exactly the way you're supposed to you're supposed to build a pyramid and then you're supposed to put the bishop when the bishop see each other you're supposed to come back I wouldn't do that because that opens up the Rook so I don't my opponent going to do this WOW playing so fast what's the rush wow this is a crazy move PA to H5 so what exactly is the idea cuz if they Castle I could also start an attack huh well my opponent is clearly not concerned whatsoever um okay I guess I Castle now the question is does E5 work I'll take Knight take I can take they can take that which I don't really like I don't see why I would allow that um and they do it now I do have a check throw in this check which attacks the bishop and at least kind of gets rid of it maybe but then it does get replaced with a knight so it's it is never really over the pressure on my position um again I'm I'm very conflicted between playing at full force and kind of like relaxing and allowing people to have a chance okay my opponent takes like that which I thought was a thing I'll take in the center we have a trade now very equal position very very good game so far by black uh when you have two Rooks like this facing each other on the same file you kind of don't want to be the one taking because then I'm just going to let my opponent uh take back and take control of the whole file so maybe I'll just kind of inch forward I could go for a queen trade this Pawn could be a bit bit of a weakness in the long run okay so my opponent doesn't play fully accurately there was no need to allow me to have such a powerful Rook now what would Magnus play think Gotham think what would Magnus play I think he might trade the Queens I think my opponent will take it's a very intermediate thing to do and I'm going to go here because if I took the other way I would give the open file and This way everything stays closed now my opponent could push for C5 to open the position uh but because I control the entire H file I'm going to play like Rook H4 for example and kind of you know slowly Advance Knight E4 is a problem I have to be very careful about this move um so for now I'm going to put my king in the center because we're in the end game and now maybe I will play Rook H4 and if my opponent plays G5 I'll probably just go all the way into the position might as well right yes now my opponent will probably go here W this person's playing Super well um I'm going to try to sneak in but you could just come back should I make a draw with this person and make their day should I give this person a draw so they could tell all their friends they drew Magnus Carlson in a random online game okay Rook f8 my opponent did not repeat moves instead now I will try to apply some magnesian endgame pressure let's just Advance with our pawns take some space we're going to take probably Pawn takes right that was an inaccuracy you really don't want to freeze your structure like this because now I'm just going to hunt the pawns black does not have a lot of Mobility I have a lot more space now with my pawns it's probably still holdable but it it will be unpleasant I think now the question is is the pawn end game oh this is such a magnesian moment is this winning or is this a draw take take Pawn to D5 King D6 take take King D4 F5 King E5 oh I'm a little scared I'm not going to lie I am a little bit scared I don't think you know what let's go for it and if I screw the whole thing up then this person will have the game of their life now obviously you shouldn't take you shouldn't allow my king to dominate we saw in the previous endgame how my king became a a really really important asset um in the game this one might end up a draw though oh that's yeah but I wouldn't do that I wouldn't do that um because now F6 is good that is a oh no it's not because I can take I can also play B5 I can wait a second and I don't have to take but but now I'm just the pawn up and yeah if you do the math in the pawn end games it's it's being a pawn up is is fatal um Pawn to F3 should be good enough now we we're going to win this just like Magnus so we're going to UND double and now we just have a five on four a five on four is just a win um whether you're Magnus or whether you're Gotham we're going to stop this from coming to F5 um I'm I'm getting so many more challenges and now we're just going to win this a very slow methodical way I kind of don't like this move but because we have what's called a majority that two-on-one will become a one-on zero and black will have to defend against it we can take but just in general keeping more pawns on the board keeps more winning chances alive we now use this Pawn as what's called a decoy and and my opponent just resigns and we won that game I feel like exactly like Magnus would have um Rook D7 and this was a draw actually credit to this person cuz this person was like 1400 I mean I got to tell you this person played super super well um maybe one last one maybe one last one feel like we're going to make some people's day um let's see l oh my goodness oh I feel so bad kids are challenging me kids are challenging me ah oh I think somebody's at the door guys I got to go guys I got to go okay this has been super fun uh friendly disclaimer uh don't do this especially if you're the higher rated player don't go on people's accounts don't play against people that you're lower rated then don't play in prize money events but if you have a chance to sneak onto Magnus Garson chess.com account you absolutely should you know it could be any top 10 player in the world you got to do it all right I got to go before I get in trouble bye bye-bye get out of here
