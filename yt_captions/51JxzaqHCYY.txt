hey everyone today we are going to be building or coding a discord bot with python and i feel like i keep on hearing this word uh bought bot bot all over the news and just throughout social media because elon musk is obviously uh looking to acquire twitter or wherever that's at right now and it just always makes me think of bot i have it in my head and that's why we're going to build a discord bot today an elon musk discord bot in python so i hope you enjoy it and if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech coding career videos and okay let's just get coding [Music] okay so the first thing we need to do is go to discord.com dash or slash developers slash applications and as you can see here i already have created an elon plot before it was really fun and i wanted to go through it once before we went through the tutorial so from there we are going to navigate to new application and name our application what should we name this one we're doing another elon one i guess let's do elon oh okay that was way too fast elon musk and then from there one thing that's really important to keep is so i did just change the name so i want to go to save changes and from there navigate to bot add bot and as you can see here adding a bot gives user adding a bot user gives your app visible life in discord so we say yes do it and there we go a wild bot has appeared for me for some reason the token always has been coming in like this so i always need to reset the token but the next thing to do which is really important is get your token and i've been dying with it yet so it's fine copy that and put it somewhere safe for now so for me i'm just going to put it on a different screen in my notepad because that will come into hand later okay so next up we need to invite our bot to uh into a server into a channel that we have so for that we go to oauth2 and url generator yes in url generator let's go to click on bot and then it will give a lot of different bot permissions so we need a few permissions we want to read messages and view channels what else do i have written here we also want send messages management messages a lot of messages i'm just going to do select a few and then you can really choose whichever ones you want i want to embed links okay so that is pretty much what i want for my permissions let's see i think i got send messages and threads yes we want that okay now we need to copy the uh generated url at the bottom here copy and next we go into our browser and just paste the url so as you can see here an external application elon musk bought connected to discord and as you can see you can add a server you have to have a server first so if you don't have a server if you just signed up to discord and you don't have a server you will need to do that for this i'm going to add it to the server i already created which is elon server for bots and then we go continue for this confirm you want to grant all the following yes authorized i am human despite what you might think i am human and okay click on issues i'm just gonna take a boat don't fail this tiffany it's embarrassing okay authorized now we can close that window and next up we want to go to rebel i have it open here as you can see and we want to create a new rebel of course in python so here add python name of it let's do elon musk robot i will link this rebel down below as well so you can follow along with it great rebel okay first thing we need to do is import discord so import discord let's just run that so it installs and we also want to import os well i guess it's already installing then we want to have a variable client which will be equal to discord this is a method there we go and then next what we are going to do is a client event so let's go here [Music] give me a sec here sorry let's pause this [Music] okay i'm back i'm sorry paul's cleaning his closet and he needed a step ladder this is the reality of filming from home okay so as we were saying we have logged in as whatever user it is format client okay okay and why don't we like this oh we didn't put the dot this is what happens when you code without glasses do not do that it is a very dangerous thing and what do we have here we're just like this is not our day you guys it's okay we'll get there we still don't like us there we go we're okay just like oh gosh okay so next up we have the client event on ready print and that and then we are going to do another client event if message dot author aka the bot um is equal to the client dot user i'll try that since i'll return and let's do again if message uh dot content starts with oops starts with and what this will do is so if someone in the chat says this word whether it be hello or there's a specific trigger word that is when the bot will then respond so for this let's do starts with hello i feel like that's a pretty basic one so we can always bound them with the bot okay so hello then what we are going to be doing is a weight message black channel dot send what are we going to send back well obviously we're going to send back a famous elon musk quote or what good are we so let's go and find famous he was worried that twitter is a disincentive to respond [Music] i'm trying to find a good one here [Music] it's taking way too long okay let's do it okay we'll do this one twitter has a disincentive to reduce them as it reduces perceived daily users once again you can put whatever you want here we'll just start with this so go here and he also added it is so from there we have this and then we want to do client dot run okay here don't run and here is where you're going to put the token so for this what you used to be able to do is um make an environment uh folder here add file and then it's a dot enb something similar to like this um now rapple i found out yesterday has removed that so i'm going to blur out my token i guess because i mean you already i guess yeah i'll blur it out um but basically i'm just going to take out all of this and just put my token directly in here obviously for um for your purposes put it in environment folder but i'm just doing this for uh coding tutorial purposes but what i will say is when i post this to raffle it will be removed i don't even know if there's anything bad you can do with this token at this point but regardless i will get my editor to blur it out okay and we have here we're really missing everything today here we go there we go let's run this client.event what are we doing wrong client.event oh no it's not oh my gosh let's run this nice we have logged in as elon musk buff number eight seven two three okay cool cool cool so what do we do next now we need to go to back to our discord let's just go to the main discord though open discord last time we're in the developer one and then from there we are going to go to the server server and as you can see elon musk bought was added so you have to make sure you do have full permissions to add bots to the channel you're doing so if harry and mugs if you understand who hearing bugs are you are an og meaning they are my two wonderful dogs um so if someone types in hello elon responds twitter has a dissentive disincentive to reduce spam as it reduces perceived enemy users it is suspicious i think it's fun it's really cool and you can really add on to this this is just a quick tutorial but imagine doing this in a discord server that you have created and if someone says hello or enters the chat for the first time you can say a nice welcome message there's so much you can do with this and it's so simple so as i mentioned i will link the replica down below so you can follow along with it as well i hope you enjoyed that tutorial of building a discord bot in python it was something i've really wanted to do before and i didn't realize just how simple it is so i hope you found it enjoyable and helpful and if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button leave in the comments other videos you want to see what else should we build next okay i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [Music] you
