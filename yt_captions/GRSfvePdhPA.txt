[Music] what's up guys mkbhd here with possibly the most requested video of all of 2018 so far shout out to linus from linus tech tips because this is his phone actually so thanks for passing it along man this is the oppo find x so this is actually the hottest phone on the planet right now purely thanks to its really unique design oppo actually has a history of doing kind of insane things with flagship phones but they don't do them very often they specialize in the mid-range but you might remember way back in the day a couple years ago i made a video about the oppo find 5 the first ever 1080p smartphone that was a huge deal and also the fine seven so they do have a little history with actually doing impressive flagship stuff so now here in 2018 in this world with lots of notches and compromise in walks the oppo find x the specs even though they're excellent are actually probably the most boring part of this phone so snapdragon 845 adreno 630 eight gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage a 37 30 milliamp hour battery bluetooth 5.0 dual sim cards it's a flagship no doubt what we're here for is the design because that's the reason this phone is so hot right now is the industrial design on the surface it looks very modern obviously not a whole lot of bezel anywhere that's the main focus in 2018 full screen rounded corners all the way across the front of the phone but if you look around even more there's actually elegant touches everywhere the shape is just a little unorthodox kind of tapered on the sides but gives way to this intense color design there's a blue and a purple version actually this is the purple which is called bordeaux red for some reason and it has this shimmer just on the outsides of the phone while the middle stays dark mirror finish it seems like the 28th thing to do also to have a glass back but no wireless charging that's also the case for this phone but some awesome design to distract you from that so the huge screen up front obviously looks super cool but even around that screen they've done some things that are really impressive and unique there's a little earpiece up here in the top they actually got a real speaker up there instead of using an under glass solution the whole phone is a little on the thick side at nine millimeters but i'm totally fine with this and for me it's more about the solid weight like this phone really feels dense in the hand with all that glass there's no headphone jack at the bottom or at all sadly but it has this unique sort of concave shape with the usb-c port speaker and the dual sim card tray and man there's just a lot of little unique touches like that the top of the phone also has this shape of like a liquid glass melting into itself and there's no rear-facing or front-facing camera at all until you yeah until you open the top the entire top of this phone is motorized for both the rear-facing and front-facing camera sensors okay so to achieve this 93.8 screen to body ratio in 2018 you got to make some sacrifices so with this phone there is no fingerprint reader anywhere they didn't do the under glass one there's no fingerprint anywhere on this phone and then of course to do the front-facing camera they did i think one of the coolest things i've ever seen in a smartphone which is raise the whole thing via a motor and it's it's different from the next the next feels like a hack to just get a front-facing camera in the phone somehow this feels like an integrated part of a thoughtful design but now though you got to think about again motorized moving pieces in smartphones like this are still a tough ask they eventually will fail and they also make it harder for things like ceiling and make it easier to break and this is the whole top of the phone popping up so i'm pretty sure you can forget about waterproofing right off the bat and then when you have this much surface moving you think about maybe if one grain of sand gets in there that could be a problem too it's easier than you think obviously oppo trust this a lot though because as you can see they have the rear camera which you use all the time and the front camera and a suite of other sensors including a dot projector and an infrared sensor all up here because this also does facial recognition that's right so with no fingerprint reader anywhere on this phone like the iphone they built what you might call a face id clone in those front-facing sensors in the motorized piece here's the thing though it's actually pretty fast if you check that speed it's possibly even faster than face id you register your face in like three seconds flat and then it's just look at the phone to unlock it's actually pretty cool it just pops up looks at your face real quick and then goes back down all in about half a second i'm impressed not gonna lie i don't know if it's as secure as face id i honestly kind of doubt it but if it's not getting fooled easily or tricked by photos then it's impressive to me out the box this thing's crazy man and you also have to consider when you have the back facing camera which you use all the time and the front facing camera and the face unlock in that motorized piece that means you're gonna you're gonna use this every time you open your phone and hundreds more times during the day so that's something to think about i don't know how long this motor is rated to last but i'd be interested to see how long it does also i tried a couple other things just out of curiosity uh with this motor if you push down hard enough the camera just closes the motors just decide it should be closing and it retracts completely probably pretty smart actually and then if you put enough resistance on the top while opening the camera and it's trying to launch by itself it'll pause wait a second and then it'll try again and then just keep holding it and it'll just keep trying over and over it's not really going to grind its gears trying to go against resistance so it has a couple failsafes built in but i also found that i can literally pull the top of the phone open so you can imagine it's not the most durable mechanism in the world if a grain of sand gets in there like i said that's probably bad news for more of the internal parts and that just kind of happens sometimes more than i wish it did so at the end of the day i love this actually i love what we're getting in this genuinely interesting creative design in a smartphone just when we thought it might have been getting kind of boring with everyone doing a notch and dual cameras and the whole predictable dance this thing comes in from left field a new player has arrived but i'm curious what you think if this one came to your region it's gonna be very expensive but could you rock this as a daily driver i feel like i could throw a nova launcher on here give the camera a shot and it might actually stay in my pocket but let me know what you're thinking in the comments below either way thanks for watching talk to the next one peace
