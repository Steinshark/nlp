because documentaries take place out in the real world and not on a Sound Stage as filmmakers there are a lot of times when we show up to a location and realize that the lighting is less than ideal and because docs are about real life the last thing we want to do is bring in a bunch of lighting gear and make the whole thing feel staged but that doesn't mean that you have to accept your scene is going to look bad because you can and should use lights the important thing is that you need to do it the right way for the look to work and in this video I'm going to share my favorite Hollywood technique that I use to enhance documentary scenes while still keeping things looking natural so let's get into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is Luke Forsyth and on this channel I teach the skills I've learned over 10 years of working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to hit the Subscribe and like button because I've got new videos coming out every week so with all the amazing LED lighting technology coming out from companies like aperture or godox or small rig these days it's easier than ever for new documentary filmmaker to have access to different lighting options and while we're on the subject of innovative companies in the filmmaking world this video is sponsored by Audio but more on them later so even though there's more affordable options to choose from than ever just because you have all this stuff doesn't mean that it's going to make your documentaries look better in fact if you like things badly it can actually make them look worse I'd go so far as to say that documentaries could almost be more harshly judged than Hollywood movies when it comes to their lighting because people expect a movie to look lit we know it's fake going into it great DPS like Roger deakins make it look real and believable even when there are hundreds of Lights involved but we're mentally prepared for movies to look better than reality when lights are used badly in documentaries though we instantly know that something's not right and the illusion is broken but obviously given the title of this video we're here to talk about what to do not what not to do I'm confused and that's to motivate your lighting so what does that mean exactly well basically it means to add light to a scene but to make it look believable by tricking the viewers brains into thinking that they understand the source of the light in the frame instead of thinking it's coming from an off-camera light Hollywood does this really well so before I look at some Doc examples let's look at a few stills from different movies and I'll show you what I'm talking about first let's take a look at this still from the movie Inception now this is a dark mood in general but there's this really nice soft light across her face that at least to my eye looks believable there's a lamp in the background and it seems like that's where the light's coming from so our brains kind of accept it except that if we think about it that's not where the light's coming from at all the lamp in the frame is behind her shoulder yet we're getting soft light that wraps all the way around her cheek which is definitely not what a real lamp would do but still doesn't seem fake because our brand can see the light source and our brain accepts the lie and that's the secret to motivated lighting give us a believable source of the light ideally one that we can see in the frame and we'll buy it as natural even if it defies the laws of physics wait is light physics I'm not totally sure thank you grade 10 science education in reality the light is coming from here probably bounced off of something like muslin or a book light or maybe a diffused Light Panel I'm not really sure what they used here but you can see from the catch light in your eyes that there's something in front of her that the light isn't coming from over her shoulder point is that this scene was very much lit but it doesn't feel like it if we took away the lamp and our mind didn't understand the source anymore the whole thing would feel very different okay now check out this other still from Blade Runner the same thing is happening a big blue ray of harsh light which I guess is posing as the apocalyptic sun or moon but for sure it's just a big 20K light or something it's hitting Harrison Ford from behind and wrapping around his face now obviously Blade Runner is not a realistic movie but I personally buy this blue light as real even though the magical beam is wrapping all the way around his face to the opposite cheek the real light is even more frontal than the Inception Shot and it looks like it's a bounce from the ground up probably someone holding a big six by six bounce of some sort kneeling out of frame if I had to guess look where the catch light is in his eye there's no way it's coming from behind his shoulder but it's still somehow believable at least to me before I get into the last example I wanted to take a second and give a big shout out to audio for sponsoring this video If probably heard me talk about them a few different times on this channel but they've really changed the way I find music for these videos which can honestly be one of the hardest parts I've had a membership to pretty much all of the major royalty-free music sites out there at one time or another and don't get me wrong I'm not saying any of them are bad because they're not it's just that for my needs anyways they were all a little expensive and I kept getting overwhelmed by their selections at first I thought I needed as many song Choices as possible but the more I had to find Regular Music for these videos the more I realized that what I really needed was a really well curated library and that's what I love so much about audio they don't have the biggest library out there but what's on there is always solid and for me that's actually more important I don't want to be scrolling through hundreds of tracks before I find something that works I just want to get in there find something great and start editing there's still thousands and thousands of songs on audio but there's just no junk and of course there's the price audio is absolutely a crazy deal for just 59 for a year it's like a quarter of the cost of what I'm used to paying for for Music Services when you use the ridiculous 70 code they're giving fans of this channel I'll put a link in the description to get that deal but I'm honestly not sure how much longer they're going to be able to keep that going because it's so far below market prices that I'm pretty sure they're gonna have to up the rate at some point if they want to compete I keep saying that though and they've managed to keep the cost the same ever since they started sponsoring this channel so who knows either way it's an incredible deal for a great service so check it out okay let's get back to the video for one last example let's check out Joker which I personally thought was one of the most incredibly shot movies of the last few years right over Joaquin Phoenix's shoulder are these lights which look like Titan tubes or something similar maybe hidden inside a light fixture I can't quite tell it looks like the exact same light is falling on his face from the right side of the frame and coming from above again there's no way that this is what that light really does but it looks great and my brain will buy it any day until I freeze the frame and think about it for too long the real light is off camera set to the same color and held off camera right and high up for me it works they've even got the nice opposing colors going in this shot with the warm orange light coming in the other side which from the pattern looks like it's supposed to be the ambient street lights coming in through a window that's also motivated but since we can't see the source it's slightly harder to know see the pattern show people a light source and as long as your lighting is coming from the same general side of the frame most viewers will never question it okay so that's all well and good for Hollywood but this channel is all about docs good documentary cinematographers use lights in exactly the same way it's a lot harder to find stills of well-lit documentaries so I'm going to use a few frame grabs from traffic which is made by mock media National Geographic whether you watch the show or not I personally think this is a great looking dock series if you haven't seen it I think it airs mainly on Hulu I also worked on an episode of this show so I know basically what gear they're using even though I wasn't involved in either of these two scenes I can make a pretty educated guess as to what Fred the series DP was doing here so this conversation between Mariana the host of the show and this dude who I'm guessing is some sort of cartel guy could have been a total disaster I mean as the DP this room is a nightmare scenario to walk into small ugly and terribly lit from this single Bare Bulb now I'm not suggesting this Frame competes with Blade Runner in terms of beauty and it's not supposed to but for what it is it actually looks pretty cool in my opinion there's some gritty dramatic contrast but it's also very clear what we're looking at at first glance it's the Bare Bulb lighting the scene but look closer it's also lighting Mariana's face all the way around the other side of her nose it's also not letting the Narco guy in the same way and his face is totally dark that's not what a light bulb like this would do I'm guessing there's a Titan tube or a two foot Light Panel somewhere out of frame and above coming down on Mariana's face maybe there's also some duveteen or black wrap on it to stop the light spilling under the narcos face which is supposed to be dark I think there's also a chance that this big piece of black cloth is the film cruise and that outside the window it's broad daylight but I could be totally wrong here either way the effect of this scene is dark and ominous and looks totally real to my eye and it is real it just looks quite a bit better than it would have if they just started rolling without lights on Productions at this level the crew will often get to locations way before the subjects and I've spent hours and hours lighting a scene like this one of the average viewer it just looks like a dingy living room okay let's do one more example from the same show these guys are sitting around a table lit by this Lantern except if we look closer it doesn't work this Lantern wouldn't hit the top of the guy's head like this but it still looks believable to my eye also look at the guy in red the lantern is behind the laptop yet it's hitting him from above if the scene was shot with just this Lantern I think it would be too dark maybe there could be a natural overhead light on the ceiling but the colors are so perfectly matched to the Lantern and the light is so soft that I kind of doubt it I'm actually not sure if they're sitting under a roof at all or if this is just outside I guess that there's again probably a Titan tube or a two foot panel somewhere up here dialed into the same temperature as the lantern there might also be another small fixture like a quasar tube down here on the floor to light up this low wall and bring some depth to the scene but I'm not positive no matter how they did point is that my brain buys this is just a bunch of guys sitting around a lantern when I'm 90 sure there are lights being used here now Fred is a friend and he's one of the best out there so don't worry if your footage doesn't look like this especially since you probably don't have access to a bunch of narcos or an 8 000 kit of Titan twos these examples might also look rough by Hollywood standards but with documentary you're never going to have access to the kind of equipment time and Manpower that narrative people do so it's all about working with what you have and most importantly still making it feel real and once I started lighting with motivation as a guiding principle my own work started to look so much better working with Fred was actually a great lesson in how to do this well and I left that shoot with a bunch of ideas so thank you Fred hey everyone future Luke here since we're talking about cinematography in this video I just wanted to jump in for a second before I wrap this one up and let you know that if you want more of this high level kind of cinematography stuff you might be interested to know that for the last while I've been working behind the scenes on a dedicated course all about advanced documentary cinematography I don't actually have a formal name for it yet but think of it like a cinematography master class but created specifically for documentary filmmakers you might be sick of hearing me say this over and over again on the channel but I have more than 12 years of documentary photography and cinematography experience and if there was ever a filmmaking topic that I was qualified to teach a course on it's this this course is going to cover everything I know about the job and not just obvious stuff that you've heard all over YouTube yeah we're going to talk about gear because I love gear but I'm also going to look at topics like how the industry Works how to make money how to work with your subjects visual storytelling techniques how to develop your career and a ton of other stuff I'm also going to bring in some really top level DPS directors producers and other industry Pros that I work with so I really think this one's going to be something special I'm putting everything I have into it and I'm hoping to have it ready by about this summer and I'm probably going to limit the spaces available especially for the first intake so if that sounds like something you'd be interested in follow the link in the description to be the first to know when the course is live and I'll give you a discount for being early and if there's any cinematography topics that you really want me to cover post them in the comments and I will do my very best to make it happen if I'm being totally honest here this whole thing makes me super nervous because I've never tried to sell anything through this Channel and because I grew up listening to skateboard punk I'm terrified people are going to call me a seller but at the same time I really just want to create the course that I wish it existed when I was starting out and so I'll just have to deal with it I guess because I think this one has some serious value to people who want to take their documentary cinematography to the next level sorry for hijacking the video there I just wanted to get that out Link in the description for getting on the wait list and grabbing your discount and enjoy the last bit of this video okay so that's it my favorite lighting hack to get the most out of your scenes without making them seem fake and with all the options out there from aperture or Nan light or godox or whoever you can add some seriously versatile tools to your doc kit without breaking the bank I hope that video helped give you some ideas for how to light your next documentary if it did do me a quick favor and like And subscribe and all that good stuff to please the great algorithms in the sky and if you did like that one you might also like this other video I made about my current documentary lighting kit that comes with me into the field see ya [Music] thank you
