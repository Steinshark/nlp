I need to upskill on python I have an upcoming Tech interview can you help me by asking me some interview questions about it of course okay I want to do this interview in a two-way format so you're going to ask me one question I'm going to answer it and then I want you to provide me feedback on the way I answer this technical question certainly we can conduct this interview in a two-way format let's start with the question hey everyone in this video we are going to dive into to how to really use AI specifically chat GPT to help you study better learn faster and in turn interview better as well because at the end of the day the skills you will use when interacting with AI in this case chat GPT from studying to learning something new will be applied as well to the job market for interviews or your day-to-day life I'm so excited to dive into this topic as someone who is always using AI to help better uh understand different technical topics learn things in a quicker Pace this video is going to save you so much time and also to really help you learn how to learn at a much quicker rate learn really anything you want all right let's dive into it this video I want your enthusiasm for discussing Ai and its applications however it's important to address the technical question first to ensure a focused interview practice a I was still listening to me that is a problem here this is the problem in today's video we are going to cover and really dive into how to use and harness chat GPT to help you learn technical things better I mean this can be applied to literally anything but in this case we'll focus on technical topics how to retain the information you learn better that is a whole other skill in itself and then how you can apply this to other things such as interviewing in tech let's start out with using chat GPT in this case to learn something new this is a skill or a tech topic that you have no prior experience about but you really want to pick it up in this case let's use Python although I already know python as I can see it's behind my screen right here but regardless let's focus on learning python actually before I even get into the step one and step two do you know what has been a game changer for me is using the voice command in chat GPT it's been such a game changer because often times when I am learning something new and I'm sure this is the same for you we are sitting at home doing so it's in our downtime but there is so much time in a day that we spend where we could be learning new things but we don't because it's not very accessible or it just doesn't make sense let's use an example yesterday I was walking to the grocery store and I was thinking to myself I'm going to a conference this week and I was thinking to myself you know I really want to learn more about this specific topic related to composable architecture I'm I'm going to be interviewing a lot of digital leadership and their focus is on composable architecture so more how systems are built different things like that and I said I really want to upskill or learn a little bit more about a specific topic within that now usually what would happen my next step would be okay I'll go home I'll make dinner cuz I just got groceries and then I guess after dinner I'll study for a little bit and read up a little bit but in turn I was like wait I have chat GPT on my phone I can use this to learn quickly here so I put in my airpods probably looked like a crazy person but I think is a society we are far past that and I mean people probably thought I was on a phone call but what I was doing was interacting with my phone with chat GPT and just saying can you share with me a bit more information about composable architecture and the chat GPT would then recite some information to me then I made it I use very specific prompts which we'll get into today to have a two-way conversation with chat GPT about composable architecture and in turn when I got home I made dinner and I watched Netflix I didn't need to study I didn't need to focus on learning because I did it during these times where I would typically not have access to quickly learning I wasn't going to sit there Googling and searching up different things I could use the AI That's right on my phone to learn at such a more quicker speed I'm sharing the story with you because these people I mean I maybe I'm biased cuz I was doing this but these kind of tricks these kind of people who are doing these things are the ones that are going to take over technology that's kind of a strong statement but what I mean is the ones that are really going to excel by finding different ways to embrace AI to learn quickly we cannot continue learning the same way we used to because it's it's the old way it doesn't make sense all right let me share with you when I was doing that yesterday one of my favorite things that I discovered through doing that which will really help you ramp up learning something new the first thing is this well let me share with you let me pull a chat GPT up here it's connecting okay it seems there might be some con hard I'm it's hard to do this when um chat GPT is listening because everything I'm explaining to you it thinks it's talking I'm talking to them let me explain to you quickly what I'm going to do and then we will do it so what I'm going to do is prompt chat GPT saying I am learning about python for the first time I want you to ask me some very basic questions sorry let me rephrase that before we even get into the questions I want you to explain to me like in very simple terms with a real world example what exactly is python from there I'm going to see what questions I have around it let's go let's get into [Music] it hi chat GPT I am learning python for the very first time I want you to explain to me in very simple terms why python is important what projects it can be used for and why so many companies use Python explain to me some of the benefits of why I should learn [Music] python certainly python is a popular programming language and here's why it's important and worth learning in simple terms one easy to read and write python syntax is easy to understand which makes it a great choice for beginners you can write code that looks almost like plain English two versatile python can be used for a okay I'm not going to make you listen to the whole thing but imagine you're on on a bus you're on a train you're walking to school or work and you can just listen to this knowledge this information through your airpods or your what are they called I listen to airpods I have airpods earphones whatever the things are um all right camera just died I my my Paul was in the other room and he goes Tiff you should know what earphones are you work in Tech I'm not a hardware person okay people anyways whatever the case is listening to this information is so vital now let's move into what I consider to be the most fun part of AI prompting or prompting with an AI which is getting it to interview you even if you're not going for an interview or going for a test per se if you are learning something new studying something new this is a tool that will help reinforce your learning so you don't just learn something and then it disappears you know when you learn something or read about something and then you spend and it's a Friday and then the weekend goes by by Monday you totally forget what you're learning it is wild but it's there's so many facts around this so now what you can do is with chat GPT when you once again are walking or going about your day even if you're doing the dishes just pull it up and do this like I mean this is the amount I I think because I'm such a multitasker this gets me excited because it will really help just even in short bursts reinforce your learnings is it's a GameChanger I've never it's there's never been a time in our lives when we can learn this quickly and have information so readily available all right so now that I'm done that spiel let me share with you how to use the prompt to get it to do a two-way interview with you let's go back to on chat gbt here we'll go back to the um audio listen to how I prompt it here hi chat GPT I want to have a two-way interview with you I want you to ask me a question and then I provide an answer then I want you to provide feedback for me about that answer this interview is on the topic Python and I want it to be entrylevel questions [Music] of course we can conduct a two-way interview focused on entry-level python questions let's start with the first question question one what is the purpose of indentation in Python and how does it affect the code please provide your answer and I'll provide feedback afterward the purpose of indit indication in Python is it has has to be specific to the codee if it is too far indented or not indented enough there it won't run the code will not [Music] run your answer is on the right track but let's provide some feedback to make it more precise feedback you correctly mentioned that indentation is important in Python however it's essential to clarify that python uses IND indentation to Define blocks of code such as loops and functions indentation is used for structuring and readability okay so isn't that such a great and powerful example I knew in my head why we indent code in Python but to actually for the first time verbally say it you kind of stumble a lot over your words and it just comes up this mumble jumble then when the AI repeated back to me about some feedback I'm like oh that is such a great way to explain it it's simple it's to the point point it's clear things that are so obvious but especially in technical roles we aren't typically speaking a l out loud about these things until it comes to an interview or if you're just learning it it's your first time learning it so you haven't spoken you know out about it before so this is such a great way to have a two-way conversation and really reinforce your learnings I can't I know I get so excited about this but I just it's such a GameChanger the amount you can learn at such a quicker Pace using this tool having it have two-way conversation with you is it's going to really make certain people who use this stand out in job interviews in how quickly they learn something it's it's kind of mindboggling on that note I hope you found this video helpful valuable and also to a little inspirational to go pick up something that you really want to learn now is a better time than ever you don't need to block out specific time 1 Hour 2 hour chunks you can literally learn on the go make sure to leave in the comments any other videos you want me to make this is how I make these videos is hearing your feedback questions and topics you want me to cover all right oh and hit the Subscribe button I got to say it I got to say it okay bye everyone
