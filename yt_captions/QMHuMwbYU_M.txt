we're interested in sort of the intersection between humans and computers no human connection with interact and the part of my junior are meeting various researchers I met with Christian and immediately sort of identified some natural research interests that we shared it's been a an interesting encounter of computer scientists that's certainly not me and sociologists so we've we've been working on this in an interdisciplinary fashion complaining a descriptive survey as to how people continues with a very interesting experiment that's been very much driven by the computer scientist involved in this which has tried to capture and tap into what people do when they come face-to-face with with news fake otherwise one thing we're interested in sort of computer science perspective is the history of information which in researching this or provenance and the idea is you can look at the veracity of information it stems from wine actually sort of wine bottles looking at where was that wine where the grapes from where was it manufactured where's it come from so once you know that history you know the sort of understanding of the wine when you apply that principle to information you can start to look at okay how is information manipulated particularly in the web and so on and something like Wikipedia is a great example of that how sources have changed how the content has changed and taking that idea and matching it with sort of Christians work around sort of nationalism society and so on fake news cropped up almost almost immediately right which is you know how does information and fake information affect society as a whole site use to me looks pretty straight for you look at it and it see they've got good sources or it's not always making some wild claim where it's not so how do you guys approach there's a couple of things really so first of all we wanted to get a sense of people understanding and understanding of what people think news is first and foremost I mean you know news is different for everyone gaining so some people interesting celebrities some people into interested politicians and so on I said to do that we sent out sort of survey and to various people 200 or so people I think got a good sense of what people understand as what is news to them so that gives the bigger picture then to really delve deeper into it you started to look at doing some sort of qualitative work interviews with people and understanding terms of in the real world how do they understand these things so what we did was we put together a fake facebook page populated with a variety of different news articles some of them are real some of them were fake someone from different news sources and so on and then we asked people to look through that newsfeed and as if it were their own and digest the information and try and identify what is the fake news in that space now people make a lot of decisions very quickly this or the digital space you imagine yourself on a mobile phone you'd be like yeah yeah next mix mix or snapchat kind of consumption of things and so really to break that down a little bit we have to make use of an eye tracking technology and the idea behind that is that if we can track someone's gaze in the computer we can look out what information what areas of the screen they digesting the part of that breakdown or an analysis of their news and what it allowed us to do was to see okay well people have a tendency a to look at the the title of the news article first and foremost and Mick or you can see is they're making a kind of initial judgment at that point in time is this true or not what was my feeling about it cows are fed skittles by farmers is that true or not instantly I'd feel you know skepticism about that whereas if it said Trump has done something ridiculous again probably more true at that point in time you'd say okay if I have some doubt about that what people tend to do then is look at the source of the article which is the link links at law above them and it is something from the BBC people would typically say yeah okay I believe that if it's something from or I'll come pick me freaking like that what are the like satire yes I hyper said anything click click based clickbait something in the woods sort of consumer understand at that point now there were cases where another micro judgment was made which is where people would say okay well I'm not sure about the article I'm not sure about the source that got into the article then look more for more information and that's when we'll start to look at things like dates like the content the way it's written always author and so on so you can start really break down this kind of order almost criteria that people are instantly using to make make judgments about these things this all sounds kind of very logical very kind of ordered do you think everybody does all those things people do it in different ways but I think for the most part people do and I mean I realize they're doing it and I actually some people would look at the source first in an article as a as a part of the natural consumption of this information others then would skip all the things broaden very quickly but I believe based on the data we've got that people are making these micro judgments but that very quickly this is a video we recorded of some of the eye-tracking that we did so this is this is the Facebook page whether those play it now so you can see that the dots moving around is where someone's gazes and the circle gets bigger the longer they're looking at something so you can see this person looking around the screen and looking at the source the eyes are jumping around the place because all the while this is happening we're using what's called a sort of sink allowed protocol and that's where we're asking someone to look through this feed and talk out loud about what they're doing so it's a real stuff mix yes yes you're gonna try and make it as convincing as possible consuming media in this way it's quite a private thing in a way right it's something you do on your own is no one around watching you do it so in the first instance ask someone to talk through the sort of logic of their thinking as they're looking through this stuff it's kind of strange it was bit odd really people aren't used to talking about it actually there's almost a level of discomfort that comes from talking about these things because you're being challenged on something that you're not normally challenged about and for example someone said to me and I've thought about this III immediately think yeah I trust the BBC I trust that as a new source when someone asks me why do you trust that as a new source I think to myself I'm not sure really I kind of just just do I kind of have trusted it for a long period of time but I've never actually sat down on God why did I trust that as a new source and that kind of question people struggled with a lot where when we challenge on these things what is it that this research do you think will lead to where are we going with this so it's a couple of things really I mean the first is is that we can look at and understand how people as a community verify news so in social media shared space people can comment on things and actually a lot of people's trust in means that they get if it's from their friend or friends commented on something so it's kind of different is this trusting but I guess where we're moving with this is really around how can technology support people in this space and the sort of tool thankless the first is we mentioned this leo is the idea of having algorithms that can assess a news article based on a set of criteria whether it's the source of the content of it and then leave a lit or label it with some kind of I don't know fake indicator or fake index and some some level of trust or confidence in mouthing and the question that space is a what algorithms do you trust you have the same problem that you do with the sort of new sources which is there will be different types of algorithm that work in different ways how you trust with which news source secondly then is how do you present that information back to people is it appropriate to have that kind of indicator slapped on to a new news article in your new scheme so already tons of stuff going on in right now so you really want something else but how would you represent that is it some kind of percentage red yellow green I don't know some kind of indicator on that the second end consideration is sort of the most social side of things which is how do we support and enable people to continue to as a crowd as a group to verify these things so often you're finding news articles where there's an element of doubt you look at the conversation and people are plowing in different sources people are having that conversation and that's kind of another way to verify what's happening how would you enable that community can you do that and how do you embed that into the sort of the news article itself as well so you can almost imagine having some kind of algorithmic indicator then also some kind of social indicator that says yeah twenty percent of people have read this article believe this to be true how does that then influence someone's consumption of that medium fight news isn't really anything new it's just the speed of which it can travel her--her I mean you know back when you're a child on the playground so one of your mates would tell you you know such and such and switches happened yeah and then you don't make a judgment call us or whether you believe that based upon here it wasn't telling you and and who they knew sick from home via and but this is technology that's causing it to be a bit of a problem and also by the sounds of it there in the room there are agents out they were trying to make make things change in different places on there do you think this is inherently about educating people can we do anything at the source technologically not that we can find the source necessarily process the problem I don't know I mean I think you've got the social media is inherently a social platform I think you've got to rely on people to govern that I'm not sure how much really technology can attack the source of those things that's the problem is that technology as you say enabling these things and not only the easier and faster to share information but I thought anyone can create very convincing looking news articles that look look fake so I'm not sure how you'd government I think I think it's got to be a people driven government I believe Facebook has actually hired people to physically look at these sites and postings and things so they go back to people to do this do you think that machine learning and all sorts of you know clever computer algorithms could actually do some of this stuff I can be definitely could I mean you know there's plenty of sort of them opportunities through text analytics or bit gauges of whatsit or the content saying what's interesting is that do those people that are reviewing those articles have any biases themselves does the organization behind them have any biases and when you think about how much in a way control that organization has over the the information that people are presented with it gets a bit worrying then so in that sense yes I should definitely be a place for machines to do that because they can be unbiased in a way so it's a heatmap one as you can see a lot for jumping around the screen because it's using the same kit as usable I think it's just a different representation so some of its just kind of almost a logistics of oh I need to scroll the page down so I look at where the scroll yeah yeah and actually a lot a lot of the time people don't really realize what they are looking at what they're not looking at yeah so we would so not only would this allow inform us about the sort of these decisions in order they're making but it's also a prompt for us to talk to them about Kimsey did you realize you were doing this and so we were you watching this in real time oh yes yeah watching real commands do as they were consuming talking about it yeah and what that would let us do then as a part of the conversations would prompt and say okay well I know it's what you just did there did you realize that you click the link first all or so on and it sort of helps really draw out what people are actually thinking in those moments the first thing they see is the Facebook page we put together and then we just said okay well what you want to do is you want to look through the page as you would naturally the best you can so it looks like yes the other circle Pimpin was interested a lot of the time people are pausing to look and talk to people and the guide games moves back and forth actually that last one of the challenges with eye tracking is maintaining a level of accuracy and a lot of we use them I track exact expenses upwards of 30 grand you know and a lot of the time people are put their chin something that keeps their head straight and so on this is the device we use is more of an affordable tracker and actually it wasn't the accuracy of all the looking at this word or they're looking at you know it's not about that it's just about the order within which they do things which meant the accuracy of this was enough for us and really it was it was its secondary to what our primary goal was which is to understand what they think I mean what they talked about one thing that was apparent to me just looking at that just then is how quickly the eye moves yes it's William thing yeah what have you been able to slow that down and then just do a bit more kind of in-depth look at it yes it's not not yet but we'll do that and yeah we will use the video slow it right down and you'll get that point to point to point to point order of where people people are looking I wonder how much it's conscious not not all of it I don't think a lot of it is unconscious young yeah people have shared it my friends have shared it therefore it's true rather than I'm in the news agents that paper is when I trust that one is one I don't trust this is Facebook so like it's but it's my friends who said this the medium mattering more than the message or the medium establishing a framework within which certain decisions become more likely than others that's certainly my same tonight if I'm honest that was my sense at the outside of it
