hey everyone welcome back to talk tech with tiff today i'm sitting down with lucy who is the founder of hacker gal we are talking about her journey leading up to hacker gal how she started hacker gal and what hacker gal is all about okay that's a lot of hacker gals but you get the point i hope you enjoy this conversation and let's get right to it welcome to my new series called talk tech with tiff where i am sitting down with industry professionals to hear about their career journeys and current roles i created this series to hear from people who are established in the tech industry so that we can all learn what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities that are out there okay let's get started hi lucy how are you good how are you i'm good thanks for being here with me today thanks for having me it's been so long no i know we did we i mean outside of uh just catching up and through different things but we sat down i think it was three years ago oh my goodness i can't tell anymore right now the past like three five i don't even know what year we're on so it's been a while it's been a while but i'm excited to be sitting down with you again and uh you have such an interesting uh story leading up to uh founding and starting hacker gal and i think that's a great place to start tell me a little bit about yourself uh and your career history before hacker gallon how it led to hacker gal yeah oh my goodness i'm trying to think back down memory lane and like i feel like everything has been a blur but um i think when i first like my passion for technology started when um i was actually a graduate of the university of waterloo i graduated in environment and business which is not your conventional route to work in tech but that's the beauty of tech there's a place for anybody i graduated and much like many university students i had no idea what i wanted to do um i knew that i wasn't passionate about the environment the way that my peers were my peers were like finding new ways to count greenhouse gases and like all of this crazy stuff and i'm like it's amazing but my heart wasn't there the way that i think my peers were um so in the waterloo community there's a huge tech scene and that's where a lot of the startup companies came from alongside toronto of course um so one of my friends actually was like hey why don't you come work at the startup company that i'm doing um he was uh much younger than me so it was really cool kind of just like not your again not your conventional route like you're not working in a corporate place where you there's like 15 000 departments et cetera um so i i worked with him for a couple years in the operations and project management role and i immediately was fascinated by technology i knew nothing about it but i i was attracted to the energy that the startup scene brought so from there it was kind of like you know just it wasn't a straight line but it was like more just finding myself what i was really good at what i wasn't good at um then i moved to toronto worked in venture capital for a couple years and it was really cool because i got to see the other side of the table where it was companies coming to pitch their ideas entrepreneurs coming with like from so many different backgrounds which was so cool to see um but i think the main experience i had was that many times i was the only woman in the room the only person of color in the room um probably the youngest person in the room so that's kind of what led me to create hacker gal as a cool idea to get more girls interested in stem so when i say girls i mean girl identified students as well and what was a solution for teachers in the classroom became a national movement to close the gender gap in tech so um yeah it's been a wild ride and i wouldn't trade it for anything it's been so rewarding and so impactful to work with so many communities across canada wow yes oh my goodness and your journey too from you know going back to your days at waterloo and uh studying going to school for a business and environment to where you are today it's such an interesting i mean through just what you told me i have so many questions i'm gonna try and yeah write them in but i guess one of them kind of going back to the beginning of your story when you made that leap or jump or you got into tech initially what was it like what was your experience like going from a non-tech background i think there's still this misconception that if you don't go to school for something tech related you can't get into tech and that's a question i get asked a lot is you know i came from a marketing background or i came from a business background how can i get into tech uh what what advice or what was your experience like with that yeah that's a great question because that's a i think i i get that a lot too when girls are like well i can't code or like i'm not good at coding how do i see my plates in tech and what i have to say to that is like when you think about all of the apps that you use every single day and you really dig deeper those are companies building your ubers your lifts like whatever the case is marketing has a place in that user interface design all of that good stuff so i think just what i would say to them is just honestly follow your passion and like if you're really good at marketing apply for that marketing role at your favorite tech company or whatnot because there is a place for you and it takes a community to make technology and i always say too diversity thrives with technology right so it's like more perspectives it's not just like the perspective of a coder or developer it's like every component that makes a product work or service work right so i think um more and more people are seeing that as technology has become more relevant in our everyday lives um there's a lot more talk about roles and tech so that's the that's the good part i love that it's so true and and it is one of the most for me one of the most exciting things about the tech industry is uh when i was growing up i was very interested in fashion and i thought that's what i wanted to do and but i thought if i was interested in something i had to go into that specific industry but with tech you can have so many whether you're interested in sports or there's so many different things you can go work at a company that's a tech company that focuses on fashion or focuses maybe they're building a fashion app or a sports app or whatever there's unlimited kind of possibilities yeah totally and like the digital skills is like the the language of today to like the future right so it's so cool to see even like my peers that are in environment and business there's tech companies that focus on environmental products environmental technology right materials that are sustainable that are built through tech so it's amazing to see how technology is literally infiltrated in every single sector i know it's really cool going back to hacker gal you you uh mentioned that you're throughout canada now yeah but you did when you started tell me about the early days when you started was it just toronto based was it how did it kind of expand yeah when i first started and and caveat there um i did not have an education background okay so i was not a teacher yeah but i was like how do i actually like what is this problem that i'm identifying the problem i thought was that girls were not exposed to computer science at an early age so i was literally like what is the best way to get this experience to kids specifically girls and i was like it's through the classroom it's through the educators it's through the facilitators so back then in 2015 when i started hacker gal i literally used social media tiff and i'm not a social media guru at all but i was like dming teachers that were tagging stem they were tagging coding um and because like who's lucy and like obviously when we are working with the school systems there's a lot of red tape about who they work with um accessibility all of that um yeah there's a whole bunch of stuff that you have to consider um but yeah i started hacker gal as a pilot with 30 girls in toronto um and i and i did that because i dm teachers and i was like hey i have something really cool that i think you might be interested i noticed that you're interested in stem like would you be open to having a conversation with me and the magic of social media and technology in that day allowed me to connect with teachers i wouldn't have had relationships with so what started with the 30 person 30 girl hackathon grew into like that teacher would tell someone else that told someone else so it was very much a grassroots approach which i'm so proud of because even to today our team works one-on-one with teachers and facilitators to make sure they're comfortable um hosting coding programs in their classroom because every school is so different every community is so different right so yeah it was it was very much a grassroots approach and then it caught like the people found out about it which was really cool hacker gal is all of our programs are free for students across canada and teachers to use so it became a resource that teachers leveraged because nowadays they do have to teach coding in their in their curriculum in most provinces exactly you know 20 2015 in many ways wasn't that long ago you know seven years ago and i'm curious to hear that because 2015 was really on the cusp or right before i would say and correct me if i'm wrong but i think it was before almost this whole um women in tech movement or you know really pushing for that so as someone who started out in 2015 with hacker gal what have you how have you seen it evolve that's a great question yeah that's that's actually what led me to found hacker gal because of my experience in tech yeah not like it's exactly what you said in 2015 women in tech was not nearly as talked about um there wasn't as many resources events mentors that you can lean on um women were still very very like it was it was different to see woman and tech like a woman in a room woman sitting at a boardroom table um and that's that's really where i found that my experience led me to create an experience for girls that they can actually see themselves in roles like like you know women featured in tech companies leaders and tech ceos and tech so yeah it was not nearly a thing but luckily now with a lot more um talk about it diversity focus there are a lot more women and i'm proud to say that girls have representation it's not a lot but it's still getting it's getting there which is nice to see yeah and now also you missed you know now also thanks to you know like hacker gal that's a huge part of it too and you and the work that you're doing in your space it's so important and i just i absolutely love what you're doing and it's something that i wish i had i'm sure you get this often from from adults as well like i wish i had something like hacker gal when i was young because when i was growing up i didn't associate you know everything about technology and for me coding is i love it because i'm creative but i'm using my logic it's both sides and i'm building different things but when i was younger i just associated that with fashion like okay building different kind of pieces together and things like that which is is still which is a great um way to use that but when you're not exposed to it at all you just don't even you don't know you don't know exactly and that's what i always say girls don't know what they don't know and that's why it's so important that girls are exposed to opportunities at a young age and i always say like when girls are taking computer science or exposed to computer science in grade 9 or grade 10 where they have to choose if they want to take it in this elective they don't like they'll miss the boat if they don't know earlier right like come to grade 10 they're like oh well i don't i've never dabbled in it i'm not going to take computer science as an elective because i've never done it before and i don't know anything about it yeah and then come grade 12 when they're like oh shoot i probably should have yes then then that's where the problem is you're not gonna go back three years worth of electives to complete that prerequisite to get into like u of t or whatnot exactly or that com side course and then it just gets i don't want to say harder but it gets it does get a you know your window of opportunity kind of like goes closes it does yeah so yeah i totally agree i love that and with hacker gal i know one of the ways that you teach coding is through gamification so i i mean that's one of my favorite ways to learn and as an adult even still and i know it's a lot of people so what was the reasoning behind that uh when implementing that way of learning that's exactly a tip like i think kids learn so well when there's like a gaming component right like there's some kind of reward or like something that you're working towards so yes our hackathon program has a gamify a gamification model where teachers can give out badges so you can you code your project for the hackathon with that coincides with a social impact mission and then you we invite teachers to invite parents or people in tech to come and score those projects and then when you're working in teams you can get the highest score gets a reward for user experience or coding like how much variables did you include or like components of code did you include so there's lots of really fun ways that we celebrate coding and celebrate trying something new at the end of the day right so i think girls the one thing we always say is that like coding i mean our hackathon program is not just about coding it's about celebrating trying something new the perseverance behind coding so you're learning a lot of these soft skills that we're not really talking about but we should be talking about when you're coding right it's not just your tech skills you're learning like how to problem solve growth mindsets all of that great stuff so yeah it's like it's a fun way to get girls involved in coding i love that i i absolutely love that because i think it's not spoken about enough is the soft skills behind coding you know problem solving or even working in a team or feeling comfortable to ask questions those are all really big soft skills that you have to just keep on flexing and practicing to get stronger those muscles get stronger and so often especially coding is just looked at as a i mean it is a technical skill but we often forget all the soft skills that come around you can be an average coder but if you have strong soft skills yeah it can really lift you up versus the other way around exactly yeah yeah that's great i know i'm sure you have countless stories of girls who took your program and now maybe they're in university or working but is there kind of is there one successful story you can share with us of a girl who took your program and now where she is today yeah oh my goodness i it was there's so many and it's i i i truly think i have one of the best jobs because i get to work with so many brilliant young minds tiff i was saying that earlier to you before like the p the girls that are going through our program are thinking so much bigger than we ever thought when we were younger like so many different ideas on how technology can change their everyday problems and that's the essence of it right innovation so when i think about one of yeah like i've i've worked with um a student um her name is samia um she has been part of the hacker gal community ever since she was in grade six and when i first met her her dad registered her for one of her workshops and she was such a shy timid girl like she was in grade six and this was like in 2015. just came in kind of kept to herself did the coding exercises what not um but she kept to it like every year she would come back and she came back and now she's been part of our ambassador program for the past two years she's in grade 11 now she's thriving like her skill sets are beyond like where i was when i was that young and she's leading our coding workshop she's presenting in front of our national community of girls like it's so wonderful to see her grow and i think that's the most um impactful thing to me is that like i've been able to witness her growth and her mind like now she's she's actively saying like i'm going to pursue computer science i'm going to apply for that degree in commsci um she was like presenting at one of our workshops and she's like oh like i'm actually in my computer science class right now my teacher let me out to do this workshop and it's just so cool to see that like from a girl that was in grade six that you know didn't know anything about computer science and i'd like to think that hacker gal had a part in her journey to get to where she is today and i'm just like so proud it's like a proud mom moment but you know what i mean like i'm like that's amazing and i hope that hacker girl has that impact on so much more girls like as they think about themselves in technology i love that oh that gives me chills that just that's that's what it's all about yes exactly going back to when you mentioned how your grassroots approach to starting hacker gal and you just started dming uh teachers you made it sound so easy oh it's not you know it's not and i know you know you're just like i dm people i'm like but what was i even hearing it from you my personality or my thinking it like gave me fear i was like oh my gosh the rejection possibilities how did you overcome that fear of rejection or just putting yourself out there when hacker gal was just starting and it wasn't necessarily uh a proven concept meaning that it wasn't as widely used as it is yeah yeah um that's a great question i think it sucked yeah it sucked there was a lot of people that didn't think that like they were very much against an all-girls program there was a lot of people and i don't blame them like this was like again what you said in 2015 women in tech was not nearly talked about so the whole concept of like creating a safe space for girls to learn how to code was like why would you segregate boys and then my reaction to that was like we'll look at the landscape right now there's no woman so what are we doing about that yeah like are we just gonna sit back and just cool like let's just hope girls will get there one day right so it really sucked and i think like regis rejection just sucks in general like whatever the case is um but you just have to like really believe in what you're doing i think it comes down to passion and the motivation behind what you're doing and it took a lot of times of me reminding myself like you know what if i can impact just one person i'm cool with that yeah you know what i mean it's hard to boil an ocean i've heard that phrase like it's hard to like boil a whole ocean but if you can just like do a little bit um at a time it will get there if you truly believe in your mission and i think that's what really helped me get through times where a lot of teachers may said like i can't host this program because of xyz or um people just saying like oh no i think it's not inclusive enough or what not so yeah it was hard and i'm sure that you know that yeah being a woman in tech um feeling you know uncomfortable or just like rejected in any shape or form it's hard it is hard that's i love that i've never i've actually never heard that um expression before you can't boil an ocean yeah i like that though it's a good visual yeah it's like no i cannot do that yes what what are some uh and maybe some things you can't necessarily share yet but what are some upcoming events that you can share that hacker gal is putting on or if uh people want to learn more about hacker gal i'll link of course down below your website and socials but are there any events coming up you can share yeah we actually have our 11th national hacker gal hackathon happening in may it's a one week hackathon it's a hybrid program so it's designed for girls in grades six to nine it's a free program so you get to come and code with our national community um communities is our theme this year our programming theme making big change through communities so we're asking our community to reflect on how technology can change your own personal experiences in your own community so that's coming up on may 25th until june 1st we have a lineup of amazing events and speakers for for that so yeah if you want to know more check out hackergal.org awesome i'll link it down below lucy the last question i ask everyone on here is uh what advice would you give to your younger self yeah i think my advice that i would give to my younger self is to bet on yourself i think it's just so hard being a young girl like i think you know even thinking about the experiences we had when we were younger the things that were top of mind that in hindsight were like what were we thinking like why why were we even upset about that or like why were we even worried about that because like it got to where clearly where we are now and you know you got through those hard times and whatnot but i think it's just a reminder to like bat on yourself and if you don't no one else will so i think that's just so important for any young girl to know that you know build that confidence bet in yourself and everything will work out i totally agree i always say be your biggest cheerleader which is essentially that too exactly yes that's another way of saying it i like bet on yourself though it's awesome yeah lucy thank you so much for taking time to chat with me today it was so awesome to hear more about hacker gal and your your journey leading up to it thanks for having me tiff thank you [Music]
