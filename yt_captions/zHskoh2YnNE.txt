introducing rust Rover send rust over a standalone rust IDE by jet brains now first off I do want to say that jetbrains holds a special place in my heart because jet brains was the first IDE I really learned to love it was first netbeans and I just knew no better right and I tried Eclipse afterwards and said wow netbeans is incredible netbeans it's not Eclipse that's what a selly point and then one time during college I opened up vim and thought only dumbasses use Vim by the way I use Vim full time now anyways after those experiences I finally switched to IntelliJ as forced required due to uh my new job I was working on a company called Web filings a little publicly Trade Company back then it wasn't publicly traded I think it's called workiva now anyways I had to use IntelliJ and me and a friend had a contest to see who could learn Vim motions faster and I thought Vim motions are stupid but I'll learn it anyways within one week I could never use anything but Vim again or Vim motions and then I used IntelliJ for many years after that an absolutely loved it so this is actually kind of cool I'm curious if this really is going to live up to the hype is this gonna be amazing I'd actually use this I would use a rust IDE to just try it out because I really do like IntelliJ and what they build I do not like the startup time but I'm fine paying a one-time upfront cost for a project for incredible incredible integration with something like this you always hear me dog on vs code I think the problem with vs code is that it's it's neither an editor and it's not really an IDE it's like a hobble together JavaScript mess that's slow that has most of the IDE stuff in most the editor stuff but never quite picked a lane to be in because you know because everyone's always just like no it's a it's an editor no it's an IDE no it's an editor no it's an editor that you can make into an idd IDE sort of you know and it's built with electron so let's feel what they do this okay when will there be a rust IDE uh we get this question from our users quite frequently and today we are happy to announce that the day has arrived to welcome rust Rover our Standalone IDE for rust let's go as many of you are aware we've worked for years to bring support for rust functionality as a plug-in that works both in IntelliJ IDEA and sea lion yes I always thought sea lion was going to be there I didn't realize that they're going to have a separate one I thought sea lion was like the place to go however time and time again we received requests from the community for an IDE specifically dedicated to rust and its ecosystem that also has features on par with the existing jetbrains Ides today we're opening the rust Rover Early Access program yep yep well wouldn't it wait hold on wouldn't it technically be R wouldn't it be reap you're telling me you don't want to call it reap the the great reaping we loved for you to try it so I will say that when I did try Fleet and their Early Access it was actually dog water I really don't think you should try to make something in the middle honestly I think the I think middle is terrible fleet Fleet is just awful and so I had a horrible time using Fleet I feel like it was a huge fail on them like I don't think you have to chase IntelliJ I don't think you're winning anybody or I don't think you have to chase vs code I don't think you're winning anyone from the from the Intel from the vs code Community I think you just keep doing what you're doing right give us feedback and help us shape the product we'll listen to your feedback and update frequently to ensure that the product is amazing meeting our users needs rust Rover send rust over will be our let's it will be free during the public preview and the license model will be finalized closer to the date of commercial releases Okay cool so that thing what it's probably gonna end up being like 100 a year or something like that uh commercial ID and as the number of users of the rust plug-in has grown so has the demand for new functionality within rust Rover we aim to take jetbrain's rest support to the next level stay tuned for the future updates consequently the investment required by us to provide such functionality is also increasing yeah I mean this would be really hard because rust doesn't necessarily play well with all the other tools in the ecosystem right there's GDB and then you really just need like rust GDB you need the rust Dash version for everything and so I'm very curious how this is all going to play out in line with our other Ides to ensure continued sustainability as a team and as a company rust Rover will be offered under a commercial plan after the reap period okay yeah yeah yeah we aim to release rust Rover before September 2024. okay okay okay existing open source plugin the existing open source plugin which we have been working on for a number of years that's cool that they make it open source right away I like that I like that good job IntelliJ good job IntelliJ has served as a building block for rust Rover this plug-in will remain open source and freely available on GitHub and the marketplace however moving forward we'll be investing our efforts into rust Rover which is closed source for the existing open source plugin we'll do our best to maintain compatibility with newer versions of our Ides but we won't be fixing bugs or adding new features this existing issues uh the the existing issues that are on GitHub uh where applicable to rust Rover have been imported into our issue tracker okay so that rip open source plugin uh unless if they allow Community maintenance I guess that's the big question do you think they're going to allow Community maintenance I mean should they should they like appoint someone from the community that wants to be like in charge of running it I think that would probably be a really good move and make people feel like they could you know keep it going oh no to me that uh 100 no I don't know if it's 100 no as far as I can tell rust or IntelliJ tends to be a pretty good company right they they tend to be yeah you could Fork it you could do whatever you want but it'd be best if you could just have the official support right we can all agree just having official support is fantastic what does TJ have to say TJ is actually the only person that I trust can you just Fork it if you want to right you can just Fork it but it'd be nice to have it as the official right because you don't want a bunch of different ones it's not like I understand them but how cool would it be if you poured this much engineering hours into rust analyzer instead of just rolling out a new one my guess is they will use rust analyzer and then they're going to do some extra stuff on top which I think is just perfectly good right because the thing is is you want to make a compelling product that brings people in and so the only way you can do that is you have to be able to like you have to put a lot of engineering hours into it right and so it's like either you put a lot of engineering hours into it we're spending literally millions a year building out functionality that you cannot monetize on or you spend million dollars a year building out something that you can and they already did that with the rust plug-in I don't know to me it just seems reasonable to me it seems reasonable that hey we can't afford to simply just build out functionality free forever this is what we're doing we made it open source because we didn't want to support a full IDE we just didn't think there was demand so we just didn't do it but instead we gave you what you wanted for a number of years but now we think it's time to take it up a level and build our own you know commercial grade IDE and when you get a commercial grade ID from by the way this is not an ad I just actually like IntelliJ shockingly enough I simply like IntelliJ if you want if you want an ad like if you want some ads if you do just check out this coffee company baby oh gosh so good uh anyways uh I actually really do like I really do like them I think they they were such a foundational moment in my engineering career that when I look at this I can't help but to think like this is where I truly got started was IntelliJ IntelliJ gave me the ability to become the engineer I am and so it's like I don't think I can ever I can't look back on it negatively right just like netbeans netbeans is a piece of [ __ ] but guess what it was amazing for what it was when I used it and you just got to judge things by the time they are created in you know what I mean uh that was Pascal for Turbo Pascal for you yeah and that's why I don't I mean that's why I I shouldn't dog on vs code but I just want to let you know that as that as a human I'm a hypocrite okay vs code sucks yeah what can you do uh this plugin will remain open source freely available okay I really hope that they get a community manager on board support for IntelliJ and sea lion uh like many of our Ides the functionality of rust Rover can be installed as a plug-in into the IntelliJ IDEA ultimate during the preview period it will also be possible to install into sea lion I'd love to see it I mean why separate out c-line I feel like if you're working in Rust rust plus C plus plus like the embedded the embedded IDE right give it all like the the low level the system's IDE right make it into one thing that you know people could really love that are working on these different programs uh this rust dedicated IDE I'm not 100 convinced it's a great idea versus I don't know that's just me that's just me I think having it together would be good um this is because we're still not certain whether users will need the Plug-In or whether dedicated rust IDE will be sufficient okay very interesting so they actually will build it as purely a plug-in until it's really truly obvious that it's purely something else joining the Russ Foundation good luck on that one we are confident that the rust ecosystem and Community will continue to grow otherwise we wouldn't be betting on it uh betting on an IDE on that note we are happy to announce that jetbrains has joined the rust Foundation along with many existing members will help support the efforts of Russ community and drive its future development this might be the most healthiest joining of the Rusk foundation in a long time so I'm very excited about this I think the rust foundation's obviously an absolute disaster no matter what you say with all the problems that continuously crop up at all periods of time that are surrounding rust it just seems to me that the foundation in the project they just got the wrong people on it and so I hope that's some new blood some IntelliJ stuff will help make the stuff better because that would be good I'd love to see some management cleanup it would be fantastic um anyways I don't know that's very cool though isn't calling it rust uh against the rust Foundation yeah they may actually well they're joining the rust foundation so that they can use the term rust Rover it's officially supported by the rust Foundation literally they're on the rust Foundation and they called it rust Rover right yeah they did they did well they I mean it just goes to show for those that uh you know don't really care about that kind of stuff what it does go to show all the rush drama what it truly goes to show is that Goodwill is hard to earn easy to destroy consider that like if you're making a product that involves devs how do you remain on Goodwill you know so what I see is that you are up front with how you plan to monetize you're upfront with how you want to do things are you still using rust a lot yeah I programmed rust for two hours yesterday like Unity we're about to talk about unity and what they did like being more upfront well I mean the unity one is less surprising we'll get to that one but like you got to be so careful you just got to be so careful and that should be the Forefront of everyone's mind that's working in the public is that whatever you're doing be as clear as possible to your users show them what you're doing because honestly someone that knows like this right here notice that they're saying hey they're going to build this out and they're gonna a not support the uh current open source plugin anymore they're not going to be making their new one open source and they will start charging in the future right so even if you don't like that that sting doesn't sting very much right you've kind of feel it you kind of know now I wish they were clear on the open source who gets to own it are they going to allow the community to continue to push it forward will there be community members doing all that great but it's still they they were upfront their Ford I just like IntelliJ I like how they've always operated I don't have any current problems with them fine by me charging as a company for tools perfectly fine by me keeping things a secret sauce for your environment fine by me I don't care about that kind of stuff I don't think you guys should either care about that uh idea Vim is the best Vim implementation changed my mind it is it legitimately is the best Vim emulator it's so good it was good 10 years ago it was good 12 years ago jetbrain says the company IntelliJ is the ID exactly idfm is great yeah anyways uh jetbrain and has avoided drama completely good decisions yeah everyone knows exactly what's going to happen very straightforward perfectly fine with them hey Jet brains are doing a lot of good things make sure you get a community manager let people manage the open source plugin themselves if they wish to make it on par with whatever functionality you offer let it happen you know what I mean let the community do the community thing because then you can continue to have a great you know some great is some greatness as far as the whole Russia UK crane drama first off you can't really call it Russia Ukraine drama um that's probably not the right term for it it's it's a war uh but the the hard part about the IntelliJ is there's a lot of there's a lot of Russians or it is a fully Russian company but it's one of these problems where you can't really throw the baby out with the bath water so I don't know what their statements are on the war and honestly I don't I actually would rather not hear them because I really like them special military drama it's very military drama honestly uh they condemned them good okay so there you go and they're a good company they can be Russian and still be good companies there's this dumb notion recently like I've seen it a bunch on Twitter some guy's like oh I'm from Russia and this is what's happening and then the next tweet right up below them is just like [ __ ] you you Russian Dirtbag it's just like you know what that's you don't want to do that either that doesn't make you look a good either right not everybody you know not everybody you don't you don't need to do that to people I see so that's why I knew this would come up with the whole IntelliJ thing and so that's kind of my opinion you know if they're fine people they're fine people there you go they have a statement on Ukraine you can read it for yourself you know if they say hey we don't like that that's good we have made her uh in regard to the invasion of Ukraine we condemn the attacks of the Russians there you go you can still be Russian and totally totally a normal person right you gotta extend Grace to people right uh anyways that's that the name is the primogen
