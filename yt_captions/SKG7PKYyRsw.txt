you ready for this bad boy my worst Tech interview experience okay this is fresh off the presses okay this guy had three aces in his hand levitating and somehow screwed it all up let's find out what happened here uh my worst Tech interview was with me as the interviewer okay I didn't see this one coming HR told me the applicant was a co-worker's friend with 10 years of experience so I better be prepared to ask some tough questions a little fun fact by the way just because somebody has a live I cannot tell you how many people I've interviewed they're like 10 years experience I'm like hey can you just uh can you make a basic query parameter parser and they're just like huh I'm like yeah yeah just like a basic one could you could you take care of this and they're they're just like I uh and it goes on for like 30 minutes of not even getting anywhere near done it's shocking I was shook okay shook this happens more than once and then when you explain the problem you're like maybe you don't understand the universal resource locator fair enough not everybody works with URLs let me help you out so we start going through it and they're just like I I don't know how to parse a string and we're just like what it the hell is how have you been programming for 10 years and you don't know how to do split just tell me how to split uh when I ask the applicant to walk towards the Whiteboard he clapped twice and said bring the white board love him I would have just hired him right there right there this seems like the greatest thing ever dude if if you're like may you please enter towards the Whiteboard they're like let's go dude I love this I thought he was talking to me but a greasy looking guy wearing a beret uh came in the candidate introduced him as uh as his scrum Marine wait I can read trust me scrum Mainer is that what it is Scrum Mainer is that is that kind of like Tow Mater what the hell is that is that like toe Mater specifically in Cars 2 uh who then produced the tiniest whiteboard from a backpack okay hold on hold on I'm super confused can we just walk back what the hell just happened okay hold on hold on when I asked the applicant to walk towards the Whiteboard he clapped twice and said bring the Whiteboard I thought he was talking to me but a greasy looking guy wearing a beret came in the candidate introduced him as his scrum Marine Mariner scrum Mainer scrumaner still waiter uh who then produced the tiniest white okay dude so hold on this guy hold on have you seen dodgeball when the main guy forget his name gets punched and he's just like Michelle is that what just happened here is that what we're reading here is the is the shell and just came in ripped out a little white despite having a full whiteboard behind him size size Matters not truth value let's see truth value is everything the candidate whispered what size does not matter while holding his tiny one size does not this can't be real I actually believe this has to be fake at this point at that point I wondered if I was dealing with someone going through a psychotic break of the many questions that popped into my mind most of which remained unanswered well I asked what's a scrum Mainer I don't think I'm even saying this correct okay I don't even think I'm saying this correct the candidate went into an a politically charged rant about the founding fathers and the need for post-structuralist symbols in these dark times I to tell you the truth I don't even know what a post-structuralist symbol is like I I know what all those words are individually but like when you put them all together like that I genuinely have no idea what is going on he interpreted himself and apologized for using the term nation state since the British proved they weren't real in 1951 last 200 years hasn't been good for the British okay they've just they've been losing ground I didn't push the topic smart play you know smart play I figured the quickest way to end my torment would be to continue the interview as if nothing happened and ignore the scrub Mainer who at that point started to shuffle the deck of cards I stated the problem inverting a binary tree uh try you mean uh the candidate said no I mean tree but you do know what a tree is the candidate uh asked knowingly yes the scrum uh Mainer shot double finger guns at both of us I'm not joking here this cannot be real this cannot be real he immediately pulled out a prayer mat and kneeled on it I regret not going uh more often to church as I feared the Lord had forsaken me be it a tree or a tree I have the algorithm for every data structure I can give you uh the Big O the little Omega and the rare W the candidate said oh wow sketching on the Whiteboard a lot of people think that the universe is some sort of simulation he continued but what if we are all to rooted running inside a higher level Universe with a similar structure that we can't CD back out of maybe all the answers lay outside of the charout waiting for us he handed me the white board and I was surprised to see 20 something lines of syntactically corrected bash code which performed a zero day Linux to root break ending with the line cat inverted binary tree Schrodinger it was unfortunately it was unfortunate that my face my face expressed approval as as that gave the scrub Mainer the cue to shout charoot and so I can't my brain actually can't comprehend this whatever I'm reading my brain just does not it's not it's not working right now sure like dude I why could this this had to be fake this has to like not that the article's fake they had to hire an actor or something because how do you not break a character and I also believe this person doesn't exist in reality but he didn't stop he stood up and continued chanting charout charout charoot and some sort of Mystic trance mystical trance the candidate soon joined I was relieved to notice that they were dancing very slowly towards the door halfway out a drum beat started playing out of the backpack the scrum made her threw a card backwards between his legs just before disappearing it landed on my laptop it contained a QR code invite for a Discord server I never scanned it thanks for reading it if you enjoyed humorous Tech stories like these and you want to support me by consider buying some coffee do that I will literally buy coffee every time I literally you can also follow me on medium or Twitter look at that is this real is this real or is this fake because I don't necessarily I I mean the thing is is I could actually see this happening this has to be a fever dream DM the guy and invite him on stream I demand I demand you tell me right now if this is real follows me I want to follow him back you must explain yourself is this real charoot charoot charoot to root true root
