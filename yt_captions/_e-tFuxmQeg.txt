gaming is obviously meant to be fun but even if you're a seasoned vet the alphabet soup of gaming acronyms can be a little mystifying from technical terms to shorthand you see in discord to jargon throne and angry game reviews so let's demystify some of these acronyms right now starting with the dreaded qte which stands for quick time event this has nothing to do with that old video player from apple but it does have to do with cut scenes instead of giving us a cut scene to advance the plot and then just getting back to the game some developers had the genius idea of making gamers press a button during a cutscene to make something happen on the screen the whole press f to pay respects fiasco from a few years ago has become the quintessential example of an extremely stupid quick time event the acne qte isn't disparaging in and of itself but the vast majority of times you see it no one's going to have anything positive to say here's another popular one moba moba or multiplayer online battle arena these are games based around fighting through three lanes as a team to destroy the opposing team's base the game dota or defense of the asians is widely credited with popularizing the genre and fun fact dota was actually a mod for warcraft 3 but it became so popular that a standalone sequel called dota 2 was developed today dota 2 league of legends and arena of valor are three extremely popular moba games that are common in esports competitions though many other titles do exist let's move on to something a little bit more technical right after i tell you about secret lab chairs which are great for your ass they're engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play their new titan evo 2022 chair keeps you feeling comfortable for longer hours with their four-way lumbar support ultra-comfortable line of different seat material and more all chairs come with a five-year extend warranty and 49-day return policy so head to the link in the video description and check out secret lab today so for something more technical dlss and fsr which stand for deep learning super sampling and fidelity effects super resolution respectively are the next acronyms on our list these are two technologies designed to deliver better image quality without putting a huge load on your graphics card the lss is developed by nvidia and is only available on 2000 series and newer cards and as the name suggests it uses machine learning to train an ai on what a game should look like meaning the card can use ai cores to upscale the game instead of forcing the gpu to do tons of raw computation meaning higher frame rates and higher quality than traditional rendering fsr on the other hand is from amd and unlike dlss it does not use machine learning but it does have special amd specific algorithms baked in that allow it for better up sampling without putting too much extra work on the gpu for your game to support the lss or fsr the game itself has to support it so it's mostly found on newer titles some games only support one or the other while other titles support both another graphical acronym that's sneakily important is fov or field of view this is a setting that determines how much of your surroundings you can see the common wisdom is to set it higher if you're sitting close to the screen and lower if you're farther away setting it too low when you're close to the display as is often the case when you're gaming on a pc is actually a common cause of motion sickness so try turning it up if you're feeling queasy of course turning it up too much can make the game look like you're viewing it through a fisheye lens so watch out for that as well do you have any gaming acronyms that confuse the heck out of you let us know down in the comment section and you might see an explainer in a future episode so thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and hit us up in the comments section with your suggestions for topics that we should cover in the future
