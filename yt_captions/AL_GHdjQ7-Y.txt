[Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to iphone 10 launch weekend i'm sure your subscription box is doing just fine so i've been using iphone 10 for about a week now and i'm getting close to putting together my full comprehensive video review uh but in the meantime at this point uh iphone 8 and iphone 10 are on sale next to each other in stores starting right now so i figure it makes sense to make a quick video highlighting the differences between these two what makes iphone 10 iphone 10 and what makes iphone 8 iphone 8. of course there are plenty of other unique phones out there especially this year this has been i think a really great year for phones but let's face it there's still a lot of people who are just picking between these two iphone 8 or 10. so if you're one of those people then this video is for you so first of all the most obvious difference is the design and i'm pretty pumped to finally have a different looking design for this iphone 10 and even if most of the rest of the phones are nearly identical i think having a new design is what really makes people feel like they have a new iphone this year the bigger screen and the smaller footprint finally it feels very 2017. we all know apple also likes to do like a little something every year just so you can look at your phone and know like yeah this is the newest iphone so this year obviously the camera module tilted 90 degrees you can tell from pretty far away that that's the new iphone and then of course the nearly unmistakable top-notch display get it top-notch it's okay but it's true that's the characteristics that make it seem really new iphone 8 on the other hand is familiar uh nearly the exact same design as last year and the year before and before that with the bigger bezels the fingerprint sensor and the home button on the front some people will like that and gravitate towards that because they're used to it but yeah like i said a lot of people have been waiting for something new and that's what iphone 10 is true story as i was shooting some of this i was outside and i guess someone was kind of stuck in traffic in their uber and they they were like half a block away and yelled from the back seat of their car hey is that the iphone 10 and i was like yeah they could i was impressed and they said 10 not x but they could tell from their car way over there that it was the 10. take it for what it's worth oh yeah and there's also some new colors so iphone 8 comes in silver which we're pretty used to uh space gray the darker one and the band-aid gold and iphone 10 comes in this silver which is a different type of silver it's really more of a white or a pearl type of color with the very shiny aluminum bands all the way around just an all-around very reflective phone and the space gray iphone 10 which is definitely a more subdued version it's darker and the metal band around the sides isn't quite as bright it does at least match the space gray of the iphone 8 and 8 plus so it's the same color but there's no getting around it these are both super reflective phones overall the iphone 10 design feels and looks more modern i would say while the iphone 8 especially when you look at other phones that have come out in this past year or two looks kind of more stuck in the past but the specs of the two iphones are nearly exactly the same not stuck in the past at all so no need to worry about missing out on anything in the speed or power department but something that is different about the hardware is the cameras the iphone 8 has a single camera like we talked about in the review and the 8 plus has the dual cameras adding a telephoto lens for portrait mode and 2 times zoom iphone 10 has actually exactly the same sensors as iphone 8 plus but with slightly better glass so a slightly wider aperture to let in more light and now both lenses are optically stabilized instead of just one so you can expect slightly occasionally better performance with things like zoomed in video and zoomed in photos and low light performance for portrait mode shots it's not a huge difference maker so far from my experience i mean all these phones have great cameras but where you'll find the bigger difference is around the front with the selfie cameras the iphone 10 has all these extra sensors and tech on the front of the phone for face id and that also comes with a better front facing camera experience a selfie on the iphone 8 is probably very familiar to you same as iphone 7 and 6s and 6 the classic warm colors decent sharpness not the widest angle in the world but you know it's a pretty standard looking selfie the iphone x front facing camera adds this portrait selfie mode thanks to the depth sensing capabilities it's not very good there tends to be some sharpness and halos around the edges and a lot of times in bright light it just refuses to blur that background at all but this is something that can continue to get better with software updates and i can't say i'd get this phone just for that but it is an advantage a big hardware difference that's going to matter between the iphone 8 and iphone 10 is the lack of a fingerprint reader on the 10 which means you're unlocking the phone with face id instead of touch id now face id is cool don't get me wrong for me it's worked in a huge percentage of the time in various conditions it's been pretty quick unlocking basically as soon as i look at the phone but the thing is touch id is still a bit better i know they say face id can randomly be tricked one in a million times versus one in fifty thousand for touch id but we had years of touch id getting better and better and i never had anyone spoof my touch id and what really matters is touch id is lightning fast and almost never fails i think with all the talk about face id since it's new and you know everyone trying to spoof it all kinds of different ways we kind of forgot about how good touch id was it's been the gold standard in fingerprint readers for so long that we kind of took it for granted and even if face id does get way better with software updates like i expect it to will it ever get quite as fast as the fingerprint reader not really sure about that it might be a couple years but look what it's really going to come down to is the displays that choice of putting a display in between two huge bezels and a home button and a fingerprint reader versus stretching the screen all the way across the entire front of the device that choice makes all the difference in the world there are a bunch of gestures to learn when using the iphone x some of them easy to remember some of them a little bit more interesting but at the end of the day i found that you get used to them pretty quick like a day or two in i was fully used to it and it by that time it does feel more modern and clean just swiping around this pane of glass instead of using an actual button so is iphone 10 worth it over iphone 8. uh well obviously the full review is still coming soon so that'll be the full wrap up of everything but i think the question is it worth it comes down to the difference in price the iphone 10 starts at a thousand dollars the iphone 8 starts at 150 bucks less and you kind of pay that off over time if you go on the monthly plan uh i think there's no question iphone 10 is a better design than iphone 8 the real question is is it a better phone and that'll be decided pretty quickly by you from using it so either way thanks for watching hopefully you stay tuned for the full review and all the videos upcoming but that's been it talk to you guys the next one peace [Music]
