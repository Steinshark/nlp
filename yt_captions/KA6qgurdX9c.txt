ladies and gentlemen in the world of chess the highest two possible titles that you can achieve are international master and Grandmaster and it is no secret that the biggest question that I get asked is will you become a Grandmaster someday and the answer to that question is not at the very moment but in this video I'm diving into that exact subject and that subject is what are the differences between an IM and a GM frankly we can solve this very quickly it's just one letter see you have a great video get out of here no I'm just kidding the real differences lie in the intricacies of how the game goes on the nerves the anxiety of how the game progresses and whether you can keep yourself together as you get into the 40 50 60 moves and low on time on the clock so recently I played in a tournament and I'm going to be sharing four games with you against four very very strong Grand masters from all over the world and before I do that I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video help

the world we'll be going to South Korea we'll be going to Brazil and we will be ending our time in Spain by way of originally Argentina so this is uh zui he's a Grandmaster from China and uh in this game I will be demonstrating to you the difference of decision making under the efficient use of time between an IM am myself and a GM my opponent so I played E4 C5 and to my shock and to my horror uh my opponent allowed me to play my Gambit a lot of people do not accept this Gambit so my opponent played Knight C6 and against my delayed Wing Gambit which is one of my specialty openings against the Sicilian zui took this Pawn which is crazy Nobody Does that anymore and by the way the eve Al Barba got bigger I don't know if you noticed this but they made it they made it bigger which is really funny so now you can you can see the eel bar better and the idea behind this is that I go here and I go here and I just get a massive Center and if I could have it my way I'm just going to get all the pieces to the party right so Grandmaster not afraid of the fire there are ways to get into the fire and then get burned he's not going to do that he plays this move E6 and so against E6 I have a lot of different setups I can play Bishop D3 keeping all my pawns here or I can do what I did in the game which is just try to take his head off like just basically try to knock him out shove all his pieces back uh and he makes a mistake actually he goes Knight E5 which allows me to attack him again and play this move D6 so from the opening the international Master that's me I'm the international Master actually knew the ideas better than his opponent I played like this and I shoved his pieces backwards and I had an advantage but a Grandmaster rolls with the punches he thought for a bit and he played this move E5 now the best move here for white is tough to find it really is if I explain it to you you will get it the idea of E5 is that if I push or take whichever one now this is open and he will play Queen to H4 and probably devastate my position and we will get into this completely insane position where like I can maybe win his Knight but he's going to take all my pawns my kings in the center so we we didn't we didn't go for all that the best move in this position is the move Knight A3 responding to a strike in the center with just a knight journey and the whoops and the point of Knight A3 is to play Knight B5 and Knight here and if he tries to stop Knight B5 I play it anyway because of this pin so so I'm not saying I would have won the game if I played Knight A3 but for to beat a grandm you got to beat him multiple times in the same game instead what I did is I did this I Gambit it another Pawn so now I'm down two pawns and now rather than playing E5 I should have probably played Queen D4 at which point it is really difficult for black to move my opponent played in a very provocative way and sometimes Grand Masters do that they take risk in order to try to imbalance the position because their opponent is not going to punish them in the most efficient way and I didn't I went here I thought this was a very smart move you know shielding in his Bishop like he can't move anything I thought I just have a clear Advantage he plays this very aggressive Counter Strike on this side of the board defending a center kind of in the style of the Kings Gambit if any of you know it I develop he goes here and I just keep going I mean I'm attacking him but you will notice look at where my time went I got I'm getting nervous right I'm getting nervous I have a good position I don't want to mess it up so I spend 2 seconds on that move then I proceed to spend 1 minute 54 seconds on this move H4 this is an inefficient use of time he goes here I go here he plays Queen B6 he's looking at Queen B2 he's looking at Queen here and what I do here is I traded the queens and I thought he's never going to get out of this position how is he going to deal with this and how is he going to deal with my knight I'm getting very confident but but but now I'm down to a minute he gives me this Pawn to get out with his Bishop but my Pawn is two squares away from queening I still have the advantage right I develop he goes here and now was my last moment as you get deeper and deeper into a fight in a chess game you have your your your branch for keeping an advantage gets much thinner like earlier in the game I could have played a handful of moves now I have to be very precise and right now what I have to do is either go for it with my knight or Castle give up all my pawns get my Rooks into the attack as fast as possible Right some of you may be wondering what about Knight F7 that is a fork but this comes right back in my direction and uh even though I can take his Rook I will get forked and I will not win anything I did something here I went Bishop F7 and here I attacked this pawn and I threatened a fork and I thought this was very creative my advantage is now gone it is all but gone he proceeds to sacrifice his rook and I thought I was really smart for winning his Rook I'm not as the position transforms he now is able to get out his final Rook he is going to have pass pawns on both sides of the the board and more importantly he's up 30 seconds on the clock inefficient use of time very very good defensive skills by my opponent making putting me in very practically difficult situations and all of a sudden I have lost my most advanced Pawn that was a little trick there but he has now uh three pawns for The Rook because I gamed one in the opening then a second one and now a third one and he's completely protected and uh at this point a grand Master might settle himself down with the white pieces and say you know what I'm in it for the long haul I'm in it for a very long defensive game yeah I fall apart immediately uh we trade he takes and now he's got a pass Pawn on this side of the board he's going to take this pawn and push both of these and I feel like the funniest thing about this game because yeah he just you know he got his Pawn through the funniest thing about this game is he beat me without a bishop like all that hubub bro straight up did not move his light scored Bishop the entire game like he beat me down a piece that's embarrassing and I'm still showing it to you because you know again it's just a matter of speeding up when the time is right I had him in a situation where it looked like he literally could not move a single piece he straight up could not move all his pieces and he found a way to get out of it he found a way to punish me for my inaccuracy sacrificing material so I would not have an attack and he was just so accurate to The Bitter End and uh that's game number one but I've got more and um this one's a tough one this one is a tough one I I I will tell you about this game I actually beat this guy this is Sergey drala I played him some months ago he was in a video of mine because you know if I beat The Grandmaster they they they are making it into one of my videos so I was actually confident I was confident going into this game you know and and last time again I I played a very similar uh Sicilian variation with the white pieces against them uh G6 now this game by my opponent was playing with fire right how Grand Masters play with fire create imbalances take risks but ultimately manage them really really well and understand the Dynamics of the position now this game was anything but that so completely not that so he plays in a way where he allows me to damage his pawns I play D3 and the way I like to play this position is F4 I like to play with more space I like to play Knight F3 and then I like to attack on the dark squares right so he went Knight F6 Knight F3 we both castled and generally black creates counterplay on the Queen side but he didn't he didn't create counterplay on the queen side so for the second game in a row in the first like let's say eight moves I have a better position my opening knowledge is clearly there in fact nowadays there has never been a closer gap between titled players like myself I'm not a grandmas and um and and and and Grand Masters in in openings and I clearly have a good grasp of my openings because I am getting pretty comfortable advantage is especially with white I mean it's harder to get an advantage with black you go second but and the idea is Queen to E1 all right the idea here is Queen E1 simultaneously defending but also venturing over here which is one of the reasons I like to play this move F4 because without F4 I would not be able to venture out with my queen now I have Queen E1 he plays Bishop G4 which made sense I guess I should have went Knight E5 here probably uh but I decided you know what I'm just going for mate like go ahead and take my knight okay I'm just GNA go for checkmate so he did that and went E6 and here I thought I mean I'm better like I I definitely have a better position I thought about jumping in right away but I did not see anything concrete after let's say F5 he can take I thought about Bishop G5 but that doesn't really do anything I thought about Pawn takes but he could just trade Queens with me and uh nobody is getting attacked in in this position with no queens so Bishop E3 right and now he plays this very odd move H5 and I kind of like why would you push a PA in two squares in front of your king I mean I guess the idea is to play here so I played H3 spent 17 seconds on H3 that is a terrible usage of time you know but I was I was looking at a lot of stuff I was looking at E5 but I went H3 he went Queen E7 and here uh I played too slowly Queen E7 I only realized the idea of uh after I played my move so it looks like I can play E5 but I can't play E5 cuz he would go Knight D5 and that would be defending his Queen right and I don't really want a queen trade cuz I want to attack now my first thought here was just go F5 just just go for it because he pushed the pawn in front of his King so that's weak so right now we go for this critical idea F5 Rook F1 Bishop G5 we just add everybody to the party right but instead I was like well I shouldn't rush that thought well I shouldn't rush doesn't make any sense it's not a chess thought it's a words and emotions thought I'm playing a Grandmas so I'm like I'm not going to rush I'm going to play Rook to F1 what did I just say multiple times I just said a person who is going to get a queen traded in this position will not have an attack right that's why I'm not going E5 because we're going to trade so I'm not going to trade the queens and then it dawned on me he could just trade the Queens like this so I didn't play E5 because of Knight D5 I just didn't even realize he he could just go Knight D5 because now my Queen is hanging I have to trade cuz if I don't trade he takes my bishop and then he puts the bishop right there and I'm going to lose material so this moment of like well I don't know what he's do I should have went for it and the point is if he plays Knight D5 in this position I take and my F Pawn is the hero and I get a fork and I'm going to probably win the game uh and you know I'll be very very happy so again the difference is that grand Masters take their chances when they are given and he takes his chance and now we have to play a pretty boring position I was a little bit disheartened however at this moment I was like I can't lose I can't lose I have a wonderful Pawn structure his Knight can't re-enter the game because he tried to you know desperately to trade it I'm going to take a little bit more space you know he's playing this very kg setup I brought my king up we both brought our Rooks to the H file and we proceeded to trade a pair of them and again I just thought I'm going to have an advantage forever because he has damaged pawns he has doubl C pawns my Bishop is eyeing all of this and and remember I have The Confidence from our previous matchup so now I'm limiting the movement of his pawns right like this like look at this position I've got almost all my pawns on light squares 1 2 3 four five six he has a dark squared Bishop I have a dark Square bishop and we are eyeing these pawns I'm thinking in the long run this is going to work out for me cuz I'm going to put all his pawns on dark squares I'm going to take space away from him and I'm going to win I mean I'm speaking it into existence they always say affirmations and all this type of stuff Knight C8 I jump into the center I UND double his pawns to get my Bishop there and now his structure is completely weak he tries to go to the open file I say no thank you King F7 now it's time to accomplish something with my life so I go E5 and I'm just trying to lock him in okay he takes plays G5 I give him a check and now I say you know what it's time for a king and Rook King King Knight and Bishop endgame it's time for me to take my chance of losing this game to zero negative you know there's still a chance I can lose I can accidentally allow in his rook and whatever so I say you know what let's go here and what I'm going to do now is put my king in the middle and all your pawns are on the wrong color this end game is screaming for white to win it in the long run so we start shuffling 48 seconds for me more than enough time we're shuffling I'm in his position I'm putting some pressure here I decline a repetition of moves so I don't repeat moves I'm playing for a win Bishop E7 Knight C7 and he's blundered he made a he made a lacad isical move we both have 40 seconds on the clock and it Dawns on me that after Knight C7 he has to protect this and I jump out to the corner look at that the Knight is in the corner of the board and I'm going to win his pawn and that's all I need because if I win that pawn I'm going to take get out both these pawns are weak we both have 40 seconds I'm beating this guy for a second time he goes Knight C6 and I take he plays King F7 instantly we both have 30 seconds I need to adjust to the new situation now my mentality has to be I got to win the game I got to find a way to win the game right while understanding he might jump in at some point he might go here he might he might go somewhere with the Knight I put my king in the middle now the way you win this and I I I saw this idea during the game was I go Knight C8 and I trade the Knight and then I go after this Pawn like this and then I create a pass Pawn but I was worried about Knight D4 which is a really stupid thing to worry about because I could just go here this Pawn is not really doing anything in fact his Knight is like stuck and I have a pass Pawn but again these calculations happen very quickly and also what plays into this game is nerves I got so nervous now watch the time I spent six seconds on that move I spent 5 seconds on that move I spent another 4 seconds I'm getting a Time bonus every move and another 6 seconds I now have 6 seconds on the clock he hasn't move from 30 you know what started happening here started playing instantly every move he started playing instantly he played every move in like one second and I decided you know what I'm going to clog this position so he can't he can't do anything now I'm going to reposition my pieces I'm going to go after his weaknesses he's still making every move instantly look at him he's not going below the time right 7 seconds Knight F7 but and I'm like oh my god he has a fortress he has a defensive Fortress I'm not trying to make a draw I want to win the game okay I'm going to give him that pawn and I'm going to take that pawn and now I'm like oh he blundered because that pawn is completely up for grabs if I can get my Bishop to d8 he can't protect his Pawn I'm going to be up two pawns easy easy easy so I make a move I have three seconds on the clock he plays Bishop H6 and I'm like yes yes yes yes now I can play Bishop to d8 because Bishop E1 is silly because King B6 so I play Bishop H4 and I blunder Checkmate in one move and this this is the difference the difference is that a Grandmaster would have it would have been a routine for them to get to this position the second I realized I was winning I wish you could experience what I go through mentally and physically like the stress level skyrockets because I'm I I know what I have now in my grasp and I just started shuffling my pieces around aimlessly and I I mean I just totally lost side of the plot he played very well of course they all do they all play very well I'm still much better I'm still winning I just have to not blunder Checkmate like I should have went here making the night move and maybe make the knight move again and it's you know it's got no Target and I play King E2 and I and I just go back for Bishop d8 or something like I I of course it's not the end of the world but this is crazy getting mated like this this is tough and the fighting spirit is there 60 moves of focus and uh for my opponent getting me low on time and and and winning like that is absolutely brutal I got to tell you but I have a surprise for you waiting so if you made it this far on the video I do have have a surprise at the end in this game I played Grandmaster cror mkhitaryan he's a Brazilian Grandmaster shout out to all the Brazilians that watch chess um and this game was kind of it you know it was um it was a mix of the previous two he played a a very very aggressive opening against me he took the center I went here I traded and I attacked his center right away with my bishop and my knight and this game I'm playing Black right so every game so far I've had an advantage with the white pieces well here I have a position from the opening that's very good for black I mean it's it's a good combative position I have a knight plays directly in cre or's position right in the center I have an open B file I mean as far as getting an imbalanced game with good chances I thought this was very very decent right B4 R we both put our Rooks and I'm just sort of anticipating his advancement into my position I can sort of feel here when the was going on I was getting outplayed I I even said it on the live stream like he's playing more accurately than I am but I'm going to fight he took right and I went here he went here and I was a little bit worried here about taking to give him two connected pass pawns but I would also get two connected past pawns which is just really funny like psychologically I just wasn't even like thinking about that um so of course I should have taken it was a bad decision to go here oversight that's just the skill issue he goes G3 I start attacking we get this very complicated game and and I the whole game I knew I'm a bit worse I'm a bit worse I mean I just am he he's got this very strong Pawn he's got the strong Bishop but I'm going to fight right so I rotate my knight over to B6 to put pressure on his Queen side he kicks me out I play Knight B6 and right here after doing a good job managing my clock a good job managing the opening I found an idea just like I did against drov in the previous game I found a very nice idea to mobilize my pawns the idea is Queen to F7 attacking the pawn on C4 it's not to take it with the queen because after the queen trade he can actually Fork my king and my knight because my knight no no longer protects D5 cuz it moved and my queen has got the idea is to take with the Knight he went here and I went look at that and the idea of that move is not to take back the idea is to go C4 that was a clearance sacrifice and he can't take because I'm going to pin the bishop to the queen right now my mind I'm going oh my God I'm winning oh my God I I did it like I broke through I'm going to get this Pawn back and that pawn and I have I have two pawns that are both three steps away from queening holding hands they're holding hands they're going hand in hand and they are going to get a police escort again I'm like I'm doing it I'm doing it he goes here now I have a moment I'm like should I give them support before I push them I thought actually pushing was incorrect you know why cuz he could just sacrifice I thought he could just get rid of my pawns but what am I talking about I have an extra Knight like what why would I I didn't play this move because I was scared he would take with the Knight so instead I went here now he goes Queen G2 and I'm thinking oh he wants to go D6 and Bishop D5 I don't want him to go D6 and by he can't even go Bishop D5 like what am I what he can't go here I mean he can he can't go Bishop D5 and I miss his entire idea I play here all my advantage is gone it's all gone it's all gone it's all gone cuz I realize he can play F5 now he's coming at me with the bishop in the Rog what I should have done is I should have stopped D6 by going here now the queen is not the first line of defense now F5 I can just take and now now I will play D3 I'll play Rook C5 I'll play all these things I'll take this Pawn but I caught it too late now I'm in trouble so credit to crore for finding this idea they always take their chances look at this I mean he sacrificing the pawn to get me to open up I said no thank you and I just tried to fight in this position I was really dejected it was plus five and yet here The Grandmaster inside of me kicked in and I started defending my position with tactical tricks to to protect my knight Queen D4 check King to G7 and all of a sudden we both have no time we're at 10 seconds and despite it being plus n he messes up his advantage and I find Rook C2 with massive threats on his King forcing cror to trade the Queens making a very practical decision not to panic difference between IM and GM when he lost all of his Advantage he didn't Panic he did not panic and instead I'm in an end game now where white has three pass pawns and this is a very tough end game to defend maybe an engine can do it but he pushes his Pawn he plays Rook C4 he gets in but he loses one of his pawns and at this point in full panic mode it's basically going to be who holds their nerves better and I got to tell you it was him because I went completely Allin against this King but you know what the major difference was when I got to this position you know what the difference was a few moves ago cror in this position anticipated I would want to put the bishop on C5 which is why he put his Rook on C8 with 7 seconds on the clock he was cerebral enough to realize I'm going to go there at some point and he's going to stop that and push his pawn and that is exactly what happened and it only hit me in this position in panic mode why his Rook was on C8 Bishop C5 is Checkmate it's going to lead to a Checkmate probably so instead I have to go here and I can still defend the position but this is a very tough end game to defend in fact it's probably not defendable because he will play A6 and also push this and push this and push this and I lost and this game was tough because again for a brief spark of Genius a brief moment I almost did it then I made a bonehead decision he created counterplay to my credit in this game I actually didn't just melt I I actually tried to you know still create some counterplay and it was a it was plus n okay and I didn't lose here I lost later so but that's the difference the difference is that he is better at stabilizing and ultimately when it comes down to it what a move what a move made with less than 1 second on the clock anticipating that my Bishop would want to leave one day sensing I was trying to go for naughty things by his King and he stopped me and he stopped me and uh yeah that's uh that's the brutal nature of playing grand Masters but if you had the patience to make it this far it doesn't always have to be that way all right it doesn't always have to be that way as you can see this was a game that I played against platti 3 who I believe is Alan picho yes strong player um originally from Argentina in this game I played my Scandinavian defense just had a course on this opening you can check it out for free um been really loving it and he plays this which is a which is a very funny move actually um H3 and uh there was a Twitter Thread about it by uh by a chess author named Nicolas nus from Greece and I I saw the Twitter thread but I never thought I would have to learn openings from a Twitter thread uh and I got into trouble very early like he got a very good position I I just ort of improvised in the opening I played in a very odd and provocative way uh we had a very you know he couldn't take my queen cuz I would take his Queen so we got a very imbalanced game early just like every other game that I play every other game you saw move 10 in every one of these games the position's complicated like my openings are on the level of these players sometimes even higher I mean I'm getting advantages right but the difference between IM and GM is that the game you know the fight goes on for a very long time like right here my biggest objective should be defending my King I didn't do that Allan gets a massive attack Rook Knight Bishop that's it I've screwed it all up and I thought during the game that that was the end of the game I mean I have to play this horrendously ugly move then I'm trying to kick out his Knight and I'm just in a very uncomfortable position he has more activity he has a clear Target uh and uh you know I'm down 20 seconds on the clock like I always am against good players plus he's 2950 he was during the game uh um but then sometimes you know broken clock is right twice a day but as you can see against these Grand Masters I do get good positions it's just a matter of can I hold my nerves can I convert them better um can I be more accurate as the game goes on and look this is a terrible position for black like I am under a lot of pressure but I'm doing my best right and right here if I don't find one move I lose white is dominating active all over the board and yet I have one move that is a cold shower for the white position and that move is F5 and I found it with 24 seconds on my clock versus one minute blocking the queen getting out of the way of the bishop stopping anything from going to E4 and suddenly I'm on the offensive I go here to stop the night from going here then I play A5 A5 enables the move Bishop A6 and also stops B4 he goes here I activate the bishop on the diagonal I put the Rook on the open file suddenly Alan picho and I both have 20 seconds on the clock the whole game has turned around and I'm better Bishop B7 Knight B2 now I'm like oh my God how do I actually take advantage I put my queen on G3 I don't know what the followup is but I'm just doing it now I have a crazy tactic which is sacrificing my knight I would have never seen that I go here he trades the queens and I'm like ah I messed it up again typical Gotham all right now we're going to have to play this end game two Bishops I'm staring at his pawns maybe I'm going to use my pawns to kind of break them down but we both have 10 seconds I strike in the center to weaken his position he takes right his Pawn's hanging he goes goes here now I can slide all the way back but I really like this move putting pressure on his position trying to get a pass Pawn to the E file right put the bishop on C3 to facilitate the advancement and now what I do here this is a move that I would never never never never ever play against somebody my level but I played against him because it's this because now I can't lose now I put the Bishops of the opposite color I create this blockade I'm going to put my king on F6 I can't lose I just can't lose I can't lose it's not losable the other ones were losable this one's not losable I go Rook E3 and Rook here and suddenly I'm like wait a am I going to win the game and the answer is yeah he succumbs to the pressure loses a pawn which I forget to take here because I have three seconds loses this pawn and he loses this pawn and he has to go here and I take and I'm going to take his bishop and I'm gonna take his he just lost he lost so I beat a 2950 GM I can do it it's there in this game it wasn't from the opening that I had an advantage it was a complex game I was worse I defended and I found the one and only move to stop his initiative to stop him from bullying me then I became the bully I took over the game I activated all of my pieces off the back Rank and when we clashed I was the one that was left standing and that's the difference the difference is that what you see in this game happens one in every four to five games but from the other side it happens all the time defensive ability efficient use of time playing on your opponent's momentum trying to get the momentum back from your opponent taking back the pace of the game so many things make up grandmas level chess and that's why they have the title and I don't yet now get out of here
