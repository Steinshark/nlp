hey what is up guys mpbhd here and welcome back to prime picks yes we've officially named the series so shout out to everyone who uh suggested names and for those who agreed with that one and in this episode we're taking a look at the absolute best-selling headphones on all of amazon so the number one most popular stuff in the uh personal audio department and there's a couple different categories for headphones as you probably already know there are earbuds there are on-ear headphones and there are wireless headphones so we've got the prime picks here for all of those now i've talked about headphones before you might have already heard me talk about audio technica's athm50s i've reviewed a couple pairs of beats i've talked about my favorite bose headphones some jaybirds but those were all well over 100 bucks but these number one selling headphones all have something in common which is that they're all cheap they're all less than 100 bucks they're all less than 50 bucks they're all very inexpensive so at the time of this recording the number one earbuds on all of amazon are these panasonic ergo fit earbuds nine bucks 50 000 reviews four stars pretty basic the number one over ear headphones are these mpow zero five nine hi-fi stereo headphones 35 bucks 15 000 reviews at four and a half stars and the number one wireless headphones on amazon are what do you know also made by mpow the mpow flame bluetooth headphones 20 bucks 8 000 reviews at again four and a half stars now i have my thoughts and feelings about one company kind of dominating the best sellers list of all of accessories on amazon including headphones but that's a whole other video but basically i thought a lot about why people buy these why these have ended up at the top of amazon why they're the best sellers and what it comes down to is it's a lot of expectations positioning and a little bit of luck but i'll go over all that at the end basically the reasons people just buy super cheap headphones and this especially applies to earbuds is people buying headphones at this price don't really care about a whole lot basically what it comes down to is people buying super cheap headphones around these prices really only care about a couple of things what they do care about is number one how functional and convenient they are you know they they plug in they're easy to use number two how comfortable they are pretty straightforward you can wear them for a long time and not feel any pain number three how durable they are i don't want them to break again i just want them to last as long as possible with my use and not fall apart early we've all seen cable fraying and plastic cracking and then last but not least is how good they sound notice this is kind of low on the list and in all honesty by the time you replace something that broke most people are just happy it works and sound quality is not the top priority here and honestly this priority list i think explains the existence of what i think may be the most popular pair of headphones in the world by volume it's a pair of headphones that you probably haven't actually bought with your own money or at least consciously done it it's earpods earpods are super functional and super convenient i mean they come in the box with your phone they're built and designed for the iphone they're super lightweight so they're comfortable for a surprising amount of people and then durability and sound are just barely average they're good enough but they're just so convenient but what if your ear pods break what if what if you come up you know that the cable starts to fray something breaks about them you don't feel like contributing maybe to apple's trillion dollars so you head over to amazon and you find the most popular headphones and you just end up with these so okay the panasonic ergofit headphones functional and convenient yes nine bucks on amazon next day shipping this is definitely convenient they plug right in with a 90 degree jack assuming assuming you have a headphone jack i forgot to mention but assuming you have a headphone jack these are really convenient they plug right in they are pretty comfortable mostly because they are super lightweight so they're easy to forget about in your ear and they don't make a great seal or anything but there's multiple size rubber tips in the box so you can adjust that durability i think is my biggest concern this does not look like a cable that would survive very much stress at all it's kind of thin and wiry one of those that would like peel apart after a while but it's fine for now but then how do they sound [Music] make sounds it's funny it's actually harder i think for me to evaluate uh these than really really good quality headphones because i'm used to hearing a certain range of things but they work that's really what matters they sound fine you're not missing any frequencies they're not super bass heavy or super tinny or anything like that so it's all right all right onto these mpow over-ear headphones they come in a bunch of colors i picked red and black naturally i think from some angles they kind of resemble beats like some old beats studios or even the solos from a couple years ago because of the shape of the plastic and these ear cups but these are 35 bucks so i won't complain and they are wireless bluetooth headphones with up to a 20 hour quoted battery life same as my bose qc35 and they're rechargeable via micro usb also the same as the bose so are they functional and convenient yeah i mean it was about as much as headphones like this can be they do have some midi controls on the side so if you're into that you can play pause you can accept and reject calls volume up and down and they fold up for travel so i feel like you can bring these just about anywhere any other pair of over ear headphones will go and they are actually pretty comfortable they have soft ear cups that fully surround your ear the top band also has a cushion plenty of headphones are way less comfortable than this durability these might be about as durable as beets i mean they use plastics in a lot of the same places there's thin metal at the joints i i don't expect you to be able to beat these up or toss them around but if you do take care of them they'll be fine they'll just get really fingerprinty they're not sweat proof like the earbuds though so this is not a workout pair of headphones and then of course how do they sound [Music] [Applause] this weird hiss they have this weird hiss when well when they're connected and then as soon as i hit pause when the music stops there's like a for like a second and then it stops and then i play i press play again and it comes back and the sound plays but there's this hiss i think it kind of sounds like i'm listening through like a bed sheet like if i if i had a like a pillow sheet up to my ear between that kind of that's what it sounds like i don't know they're just like slightly muffled like the frequency response probably looks kind of like this they're not super bass heavy which i actually like i think a lot of headphones that just over exaggerate the bass are easy for me to rip on because they're clearly doing it wrong but these uh they sound alright the isolation is pretty good too i'll give them that you put them on your ears they're not noise canceling but because they surround your ear the passive noise isolation is pretty good and then the number one of all wireless headphones on amazon is these 20 earbuds by mpow these these are definitely on a sporty slant so they're sweat proof they have this cable this flat cable a seven to nine hour battery life claimed and they also kind of resemble some sporty beats i've seen they are functional and convenient for people looking for like wireless earbuds that are way cheaper than airpods for example these have almost all the same functionality obviously no w1 chips so they don't have quite the same deep integration as airpods that everyone loves but bluetooth pairing is still pretty easy at this point you can leave them loose kind of just like hanging the cable back here or you can do the wire clamp to fit them on the back your neck like the jaybirds and uh that's how they look so for comfort there's still all the different sizes of rubber tips but if you want to change that you of course have them in the box and then the over ear arch that kind of hooks over is more universal than the wing tip that tries to go up into your ear i think this is going to fit more people's ears durability of these is actually probably the best of the bunch which is pretty good for 20 bucks ipx7 water resistance a decent quality flat red and black cable rubber and plastic mostly everywhere else and they come with this case that you can zip them up in that you can throw them around in now sound [Music] i would characterize these as functional they're definitely a little heavier with the base than the other two which is interesting for earbuds but i think again this this all falls into a kind of a nice sporty package generally i mean audiophiles aren't buying these but when you consider again that these are 20 bucks maybe a little more shipped that's uh cheaper than earpods and you're getting a lot more for that price so what if i what have we learned here today honestly despite the length of the video there's not really all that much to say about cheap headphones you kind of just hope they work they do what they're supposed to do they're advertised maybe one or two extra little features like being sweatproof or having a little thing that goes over your ear to keep them on your ear longer that kind of stuff is nice but at the end of the day if they work well that's pretty much good enough for nine bucks that's why these are prime picks the question of how do they get to the top of amazon we could talk about that all day but essentially what it comes down to is these are about as good as the competition they're around the same price they're a bit on the low side and then basically they're just rise to the top by whatever means necessary and stay there because they're good enough my biggest thumbs up from the number ones that we tested i think would be these mpow the flame the earbuds i think they're the most complete and they represent like a package you could actually recommend for 20 bucks sweat resistant again decent quality cable durability is probably the biggest strength of these compared to what else is on this table but i could also see myself recommending these for like kids i mean if they're like maybe they get their eye on some more expensive fancy headphones in best buy these kind of have the same look to them and do almost the same job i don't know i mean if they're asking for beats then they probably already know they want beats but if they're asking for nice red and black headphones then these are fine but that is it that's it for prime picks episode two of the number one best headphones on amazon i have a question for you if you had to live with one of these headphones for life on this table which one would you pick and why either way let me know what other categories you'd like to see in the prime picks series until the next one thank you for watching talk to you guys later peace
