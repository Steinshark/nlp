fortnite do you play fortnite's a ranking fortnite you play games you ever played fortnite i'm dead foreign [Music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome back to ask mkbhd number 27. it's april and it's definitely getting nicer out finally so we're going to take advantage of that and shoot outside here for a little bit the phone's kind of trippy you're probably familiar the shirt's also kind of trippy that's new the link is below and i asked you guys on twitter and in the subreddit what you wanted to know these are your questions so kareem wants to know have you started training with empire yet can't wait to meet you again when you come to montreal yes so uh for those of you who don't know the pro team and ultimate that i'm playing for this year is the new york empire our home opener is tomorrow against uh toronto rush but we play up and down the east coast all season long so we'll play in philadelphia in our home state of new york we have ottawa montreal toronto and washington dc if you're in any of those cities i'll post a schedule below come out to a game come say hi so ricky says he recently put down a deposit on a mission e congrats uh do you think porsche evs will eventually supplant tesla so the word supplant if you look it up means to replace and i don't think anyone's gonna be replacing teslas anytime soon i don't know what it is with this obsession about like the tesla killer or replacing tesla but a new electric skateboard company can come along they don't replace boosted their competition a new camera company comes along they don't replace canon we have canon nikon panasonic all these guys so a new electric car company can come along or a new electric car can come along and not replace tesla and they compete and at the end of the day that's better for us all right so we're seeing i'm seeing a lot of questions about pixel 3 it's coming out later this year we want to know what that new camera is going to be like what they do about the screen will it have a notch so the thing i think to remember with the new pixel which stems back to the nexus days is it'll just be no matter what the hardware ends up looking like it's basically a vessel for google's new software so google's new os whatever i guess it'll probably be peppermint but whatever the newest android os ends up being google's new ai their new software fixes all of that stuff it's a showcase for developers and us to use that software now it is nice that at the end of the day we can buy this phone and they do put some focus into the hardware but i wouldn't be surprised if it ends up looking a lot like some other phones this year with the exception of the camera we have this new p20 pro and the review of this is coming soon with three cameras on the back and a lot of phones coming out now have two cameras at least some more are coming out with three but the prowess of the pixel 2 and the whole success of this phone which is the incredible single camera is the fact that it did all the things that you used to need two or three cameras to do well in one it did edge detection extremely well for portrait mode photos it has great color great dynamic range so having another single camera on pixel 3 i think would emphasize that it'll continue to do all these crazy things with software on a single camera so it won't look like other phones in that way but i wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't have a headphone jack again if it has a notch if it has a similar look to other phones we've seen that would not shock me at all it's still a vessel for the software the only frustrating part about that is it makes me want other phones it makes me want the google play edition stuff back it makes me want to see other phones with that same pure fast updated software experience i would love to see a note 8 or a note 9 google play edition i would love to see a huawei p20 pro google play edition but that's never going to happen so it's just frustrating all right so which product has given you the most value for the money i thought about this for a little bit and my answer is the shark slider s1 it's a slider it's a camera slider i buy a lot of products but video gear tends to be pretty pretty frequent and i bought this many years ago so we tend to we roll through a lot of video gear we upgrade things all the time it's kind of like when you rebuild the boat after you replace all the parts is it the same boat but this one slider i'll try to give you the original date that i purchased it i haven't upgraded i've used it since i got it many different cameras have been on it many different other things have passed through but that slider the shark s1 has been amazing it shot so many different subjects in so many different ways and to be honest it's a super simple tool it's not a motorized slider it's just two rails and some weights and just moves the camera back and forth but that's something i've gotten over the years a lot of value from right i like this one so on dope tech i feel like you're slowly killing the youtube culture which is cheap and easy to make by using super advanced equipment that robotic arm is too expensive and rare and the red cameras and gimbals so that's kind of the point of dope tech so there are a ton of other product reviews and things where i'm evaluating a product you might want to buy in videos and that's fun but dope tech is actually leveraging this audience that we have here to get an inside look at bleeding edge technology that you may never otherwise be able to see so like supercars robotic arms things like that companies are actually willing to open their doors and show them for the first time to dope tech to get you guys a look at that so it's almost like the you want to find the less common stuff you're never going to buy that robotic arm but having it in a video and actually showing it with you is cool to see so that's dope tech hope that makes sense and we also have other playlists and other videos and all the reviews of things that we'll actually be buying but dopetech is just your glimpse behind the curtain all right so what other two color combinations two color combinations do you think are dope other than black and red i have to pick two uh i think i think red red and gray is pretty cool um i'll give a nod to black and yellow hey mkbhd what's the possibility of having a port free device in the future no headphones no charging port completely wireless actually do think in fact i'll say i will expect this to eventually happen kind of like the same way we're trying to get rid of bezels now we end up with a notch because there's certain technologies that haven't worked their way down yet and we can't completely get rid of it but we will soon same thing with ports wireless charging's not that great yet some phones have it but when you do get it great you can get rid of the charging port we already got rid of the headphone jack and there's really not that many other ports on phones so i think you will see a portless phone so teslanomics asks why get the roadster if not the founder series i can speak to that um so tesla products for those unfamiliar the founders series stuff is always maxed out and also always red it's always a founder series red which is not like the most vibrant red so basically the short answer is if you want to get any other spec or any different color you don't get the founders edition so even like the the multi-coat red that is a lot brighter and different from the founders edition red i think looks better so you can still get a maxed out car in a different color also it looks pretty good in that sleek sort of a space gray look and i think staying under the radar not getting a red car might actually be better so yeah i think that's why you wouldn't get founders edition so when are you going to link up with the 368 crew in new york city we need to see you in one of uh casey's new tech tuesdays honestly i'm definitely down tech tuesday seems like a great way for a collab to happen so we can probably do that sometime but either way that's where i'm going to end it uh thanks to the noise situation i think we've also set a record for longest record time to make this happen without interruptions but that's okay thank you for your questions if you have any others feel free to drop them in the comments section below i'll hang out and answer some of those too uh but thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace that stuff so that'll be the focus of the pixel no matter what it looks like oh my god gets into the hardware but it's not the main but google's but google's whole software prowess with the pixel 2 that's too loud isn't it but google's whole it's when i like make a sound which was the incredible camera it was all the only frustrating part of that is that it makes me want other phones with stock android we just saw that truck go that way all right so which but i'll try to put the original date it's the same truck again are you lost do you need a map do you need a map the red camera is and gimbal what i feel like you're slowly killing the uh what other two color combinations do you think are dope uh so the roadster yeah if i want i think we set the record for longest longest uh blooper reel of all time that's a great place to do that yeah i'm down
