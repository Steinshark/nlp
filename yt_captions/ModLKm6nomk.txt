it turns out rabbit R1 was just an Android app all along AI is in its juicero era if for those that don't know the juicero era get this juicero was this machine that literally had packets of juice that would like squeeze out and then you'd have juice in a cup and I kid you not it was like $800 for the machine it was incredibly expensive I remember being at Netflix when this was happening and there was some hype for like a week around juo and it got like Millions upon millions of dollars and then after all of that it turns out that if you just hand squeeze a juicero packet you actually get more of the juice out of the packet than the machine was doing it was out of control terrible and so now apparently AI is in the juicero oh yeah it's $12 per drink like oh man oh man so good okay since the launch last week rabbit R1 AI Gadget has inspired a lot of questions starting with why isn't this just an app well friends that's because it is just an app uh over at Android author uh Michelle arama managed to download rabbit's uh Launcher APK on Google pixel 6A with a little tweaking he was able to run the app as if it were on rabbit's own device using the volume up key in place of the ri single Hardware button he was able to set up an account and start asking questions uh just as if you were using the $1999 R1 how tall is the tallest building in the world let me see what I can find the height of the tallest building in the world is 2717 ft which is the height of the Burge Khalifa in Dubai United Arab Emirates wait people paying $200 for for Siri no way what is the height of the tallest building yeah the be Khalifa is 2717 2722 to the tip if you measure from if you measure properly from the base apparently I got a list so it's just instead of instead of you reading it that can't be right I cannot people we are in the this is juo this is actually juo this is I did uh tallest uh building in the world see look hold on oh dang it like I you know how Google sometimes gives you like this the summation what is the tallest sometimes let's see the dang it sometimes it gives you like that little summation article it did say from the tip it did say the tip dang it okay whatever whatever I can't okay this is actually just shocking okay raama points out that the app probably doesn't offer all the the same functionality as the R1 in his words the rabbit r1's Launcher app is intended to be pre-installed in the firmware and be uh granted several privileges system level permissions only some of which were able to Grant so so some of the functions would likely fail if we tried but the fact that the software just runs on a mid-range phone for almost two years ago suggest that it has more in common with the plain old Android app we we are juer I we are juicero rabbit founder and CEO Jesse Lou dis agrees with the characterization he gave a lengthy statement to The Verge and we have partially quoted below it also has posted rabbit's X account if you want to read the full rabbit R1 is not an Android app a rabbit OS and lamb runs on a cloud with a very bespoke AOSP and a lower level firmware modifications therefore a local bootleg APK without the proper OS and Cloud endpoints won't be able to access our service rabbit OS is customized for R1 and we do not supp part third party clients but why not but why not just make it an app I wonder what they needed in the device I guess I don't quite understand isn't the device a singular button device anyways it's just like a volume up volume down like what are they getting making it into a device bespoke it's just basically a worse it's just yeah I heard mares Brown really like or whatever his name is Mars he just destroyed this thing I I haven't actually I I never actually looked into this I've never actually looked into this at all but this is kind of shocking R1 isn't alone uh Humanes AI pin appears to run uh on a version of Android's open source software too but they are ones in the hot seat right now as it oh was that uh oh yeah R1 is in the hot seed they're not great uh Bob rabbit used its first software update earlier today to address some of the complaints including a fast draining battery that issue seems to be better controlled uh post update my r1's idle battery performance is vastly improved after downloading the update this morning yo how does this exist I do mean this in in the most genuine sense how does this exist I have a general purpose computer right here it can do a lot of stuff so why would I spend $200 for just one little thing I can't blame capitalism because people do stupid things throughout the ages stupidity is not exclusive to capitalism is it really just AI hype you wouldn't spend $200 I mean the thing that the thing that confuses me on this is that the fact that this not only can this thing exist but at least in that small demonstration like there is no difference between that and my phone is it purely so that you could have some sort of controlled way so that your kids can't have access fully to the internet I'm just trying I'm trying to AI tamagachi it is is this just Millennials that are still trying to recapture tamagachi SL fures is that what this is is this just Millennials reliving their childhood it's just inefficiency of the Venture Capital markets tomis uh have they tried combining it with nfts Niche purpose devices always seem cooler yeah I remember uh mic micro discs what what were those things called mini discs mini dis players it was like 100 megabytes Venture capitalists are easy to get excited Market consumers not so much mini discs remember mini discs microen no that's different I don't see the problem don't like it don't buy it no it's it's it's more than that okay I mean stop you're being way too much of a reductionist you have to first think about the fact that somebody Engineers came together designed a device sold it to a bunch of venture capitalists which then paid a bunch of money to be a part of this company and somehow like because you got to remember this is this is a uh this represents where money and innovation's going to me this is like this is the the representation of what people are doing it VC has become decentivize into gambling I mean that that's the thing that's just so confusing to me which is how did anybody look at this and be like why can't I use my phone what can this do VCS are easier to dup than most most people think maybe that's what the word Venture means they say VCS are sophistic I it just feels easy founders with previously in nfts okay okay okay that's that's pretty fair that's pretty fair TJ is suffering from success right now poor TJ okay well you know so here's my here's my bit advice for everybody here which is whenever you see this kind of stuff you should just remember that I'm not calling it late stage capitalism I'm going to call it late stage hype cycle we're in the late stage hype cycle you know you can you can kind of remember a very similar thing happening with nfts and all that uh you know or crypto in general like 2017 there was like a huge hype cycle flying through everything okay my mom was asking how to get into it Fox News was talking about it CNN was talking about it everybody at my job was asking about it right it was just like it was the kind of like the the soup dour of the time and so now it's kind of you know but time's moved on hype Cycles moved on and now we're kind of in like this new hype Cycles did nfts ever properly hype like AI oh yeah nfts were hyped out of their mind I mean Mark Cuban had a startup that I had a friend work at that was nft company I mean the the amount of of nft companies that popped up in 2019 was incredible okay just absolutely incredible um and so just remember this that if you guys want to make a lot of money and you guys really want to to think about how to make some really interesting dollars definitely think about definitely think about two things one who provides the pickaxes right who's the people that whether nfts make it or don't make it made money who are the people that whether AI changes the world or is just a really exp expensive compute they make money Nvidia is there other things than Nvidia that you could invest in what other pickaxes exist right so that's always like a good way to look at these things if you think in the next 10 years AI crypto is going to be used 10x more than then bu Nvidia right but you have to think that the the Cycle's going to keep on going you're going to make a lot of money and you're going to invest into the thing that's going to be the ones making a lot of money now you could be right you could be right and you could pick an AI company that becomes really useful and boom you just like a 100x your money but you have to like pick the right one this is not Financial advice I'm just saying like these are the two things I consider when I do stuff so I consider like what's the long game H who who's the one that's actually making something that's useful and how do I get into it uh basically the lottery at this point and then B which is if there's a hype cycle you got to be able to identify where you're at in the hype cycle I think right now if you're about to do an AI startup I would really strongly think about what's the value of the of of the AI startup like is this really going to work work out for you um just because we're kind of at this weird we're in this really weird position where where there's a lot of garbage AI companies coming out a lot of them uh and not only that but I mean like think about Devon Devon came out and within three months co-pilot's like I do the same thing the only difference is one is Microsoft which is going to be able to fund co-pilot at infinitum versus Devon which is some startup from some people that apparently got legendary grandmas on Le Cod or whatever it was like who are you going to bet who are you going to bet for I would bet on Microsoft winning that argument they can just simply outspend oh yours cost $100 a month ours for free for the next two years right and guess what those legendary leite code grandm super ultra awesome people are they they're broke is what they are so you know just think just think about that just remember just remember these uh you know just remember these things that's kind of like how I do that whoa whoa whoa grandmas on code forces sir okay sorry grandmas on code forces easy Microsoft wins no question so that's kind of how I tend to look at things which is that's so unfair not going to lie of course it's unfair but that's I mean AI itself is an unfair thing like think about it you like if you are building an AI startup today you are fully reliant on someone else's AI you're probably not getting the hardware you're probably not a team of 400 crack researchers who are going to make the next greatest AI jump you're probably just some person who has wrapped GPT 3.5 or three four and you're hoping that nobody else wrapped it the way you wrapped it okay you're not a bunch of crack crack researchers not crack as in like cracked researchers yeah or that nobody notices and it instantaneously destroys it and so you know just there just more reasons it's unfair it's not unfair some things are impossible some things are some things require money to do right like is it unfair that you can't just create your own five nanometer chips is that unfair it's unfair that you can't shoot light at at Wafers no it's not unfair that's like there's nothing unfair about that welcome to C it's not unfair you first need to go figure out how to shoot lasers and light bulbs and do whatever the hell it takes to be able to do like millimeter ones and then maybe you can get to micrometers throughout your lifetime it's unfair from the perspective of the universe revolving around me yes and so it's just like that's how I look at it ai ai is is is is just fundamentally to even begin to start it you need to have enough energy to power a small City for a couple years then you need enough Hardware to power most of the United States for a couple years like you just you need so much resources to even begin to do the thing there's only a couple people that are going to begin to do the thing it's unfair there's nothing unfair about that there's nothing unfair about that some things are really hard is it unfair that only a few companies can shoot Rockets into space yeah it's not unfair like that's just not unfair right that that you're using the wrong term term unfair it's not you're using the wrong term oh my goodness you guys you guys are just so upsetting yo here's a little thing you don't get the right to someone else's stuff right that's just that they're meing I can't tell if they're meing or not is this Hassan's chat are we in Hassan's chat right now where am I am I in the son chat where are we all right the name is I'm just not going to continue on this conversation it's absolutely ridiculous a Jen
