so I spent the last week building the template for the ultimate smartphone and speed test one that does the best job that you really can to factor in the things that affect your overall experience from CPU and GPU speeds to storage speed and software optimization all ferns are set to full HD plus they've all got plenty of charge and we've just cleared all apps from the memory so to start with boot test and to be clear I wouldn't consider this hugely important it's not really an indicator of general phone performance but some people like to see it and it is one metric for measuring software optimization regardless all three phones boot up in almost exactly the same time there's no notable disparity there so on to the next thing which is unlocking and considering the average person unlocks their phone about 200 times a day this is quite an important one so first up we've got the s10 with its ultrasonic in display fingerprint scanner and it's quite a cool one because you barely need to apply any pressure on the display but you can probably see if yourself there is a little bit of a delay between my finger touching the screen and the phone actually unlocking still 17 seconds to fully unlock 10 times is quite impressive so now the iPhone 10's max which doesn't have a fingerprint scanner so we're using face ID and there's a bit of a trick here you can actually swipe up to start the unlock process before it's even scanned your face and the speed it up and that turns out even faster than the s10 plusses ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner now the May 20 pro has two highly secure options you've got an optical in display fingerprint scanner on the front and you've got 3d face unlocking so we'll try each one by one but to start with the optical scanner is a little slower than Samsung's but delicate it's also less secure now face unlocking on the huawei mate 20 Pro is really fast it actually performs the operation a little faster than the iPhone but then combines that with no need to swipe to actually finish the unlock so you end up with this crazy unlock speed that's barely over one second for an entire unlock operation so I'd say how it takes this one next step is benchmarks and I know a lot of people have a bit of a vendetta against them and it's true they're not perfectly indicative of day to day performance but benchmarks do measure a lot of important facets that will impact it they test for a lot of things that we can't pick up just by seeing for example which apps load faster so right now we're on antutu benchmark and to try and get a little bit more of a representative reading we're gonna run it three times and take an average result that'll also be a pretty good test of how performance sustains over time and you get quite an interesting result while the STM plus sustains its performance well both the iPhone and the mate 20 pros and - - scores fall quite considerably after the first attempt and the overall average winner is actually the s10 plus the second benchmark we're using his Geekbench and again I'm going to repeat this i'm graduate twice this time and then also take an average the iPhone is quite a way ahead in this test and although the galaxy s 10 plus has the much higher single core score than the mate 20 pro in terms of multi-core score while we actually overtake Samsung but if we take a look at the overall picture here results from both benchmarks then it looks like the s10 plus and the iPhone are at the top when it comes to performance and it May 20 Pro is not too far behind storage speed is a lot more important than people give it credit for and the best way to measure it is to use a tool called performance test bypass mark it reveals a bit of an interesting result because the S 10 plus was rumored to be coming with a new standard Universal flash storage 3.0 but actually by quite a long way it has the slowest disk performance speed of all three versions with the iPhone at the top by a long way man this might actually help to explain or one of the results that we get later on in this test so gaming is a little tough to mathematically compare between operating systems but the experience disparity is quite clear in all games Huawei was essentially a little behind still able to play pretty much every top-tier game but you'll notice framedrops quite consistently when you're turning around when you're changing direction all these sorts of things I'm actually using the XE Knox version of the S 10 plus which is in most cases considered to be slightly less good than the Snapdragon but even then it pretty much kept up with the iPhone in almost every situation even on Ark survival evolved for the most part it was pretty smooth but iPhone does take the gaming Department because every now and again the s10 plus will drop a few frames here are there which is not a big deal but the iPhone doesn't really do that so I've hoped you'd phone up to a very average internet connection to see if there's any noticeable difference in download speeds or latency in an average household I'm gonna download two files one after the other on each phone and to see which one does it faster but bear in mind that when you're using anything to do with the Internet there's a lot of factors outside the control of the phone so even though these three are the only devices I've connected to this network with everything online there's just that bit of variability so it's only worth putting your trust in results that are consistent so the two files of a downloading on each phone are labeled three and four number three being about nine point five megabytes and number four being about 42 megabytes and thankfully we do get some pretty consistent and quite interesting results in both of those download tests the s10 plus is at the top it is the fastest to download both files the iPhone tennis Mac's then finished after that and the mate 20 Pro a fairly long way behind okay application load times were gonna pull up ten applications one by one and see which phone can load all ten the fastest but I want to clarify something here this is not a test of a phone's CPU performance this is literally more of a test of a phone's IO capability IO or input and output is the process of taking something from your internal storage and being able to move it to the phone's main memory so that it can start tackling it as a task regardless though as long as you bear that in mind it is still a valid and useful test you want to know which phone loads apps faster and it's looking like the meet 20 Pro is slightly ahead and it kind of makes sense at boot times are something that Hawaii has seriously focused on with its mui software it's one of the primary features of it and it's also worth bearing in mind that samsung's warn you i has pretty much only just come out of beta so there is room for that to continue to improve regardless the mid-20 pro finishes first and then about four seconds later you've got the iPhone 10s Max and then the S 10 plus finally finished is about eight seconds after that social media is a big one so to test this we've pulled up the Instagram explorer page and we're gonna refresh each phone ten times on this but only refresh the next one once one page is fully loaded we'll see which one can load it ten times the fastest and even though yes the code of these apps varies between operating systems this test factors that in if a phone loads social media raps fast oh just because it's running one operating system that doesn't change the fact that it is still loading the apps faster it's an important result as before the mate 20 pro finishes fastest about 10 percent faster than the S 10 Plus which in itself is about 10 percent faster than the iPhone at tennis max okay this next one isn't really much of a calculated test but I did just want to see how first party apps perform on all the phones and so to do this I pulled up the camera app and I'm flicking between video photo and portrait mode of the three hallways that she seems the most responsive both the s10 plus and the iPhone do have some noticeable lag when he moved to portrait mode it takes it a second just to set itself up while we has a little bit of a delay when you move to video but it's definitely less than the other phones have with portrait mode alright the final hurdle is multitasking we're gonna go through all the applications that have been open starting from the most recent and we're gonna see how many of them each phone is managed to keep in memory this is essentially an indicator of how many things you can do at once on your phone what tends to happen is when the firm becomes overwhelmed when you're trying to run loads and loads of things on the phone runs out of RAM it has to start closing tasks so that it can prioritize the food that are open so if we fast forward this you'll be able to see that every single application we opened up in that load time test has remained open so that's pretty crazy safe to say you're getting great multitasking performance on all of them alright guys which phone do you think won this test has been literally an entire week in the work so if you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe for more and also let me know what other tests you'd like to see on future smartphones speed tests comparisons as always my name is Aaron this is mr. who's the boss and I'll catch you in next one [Music] you
