- This is the most expensive
mystery box in the world. And I also bought a $5,000 mystery box. This $10,000 mystery box, a $25,000 mystery box, and a $100,000 mystery box. And all of the mystery boxes you see here cost over $500,000. - That's a lot of cheddar. - And we're gonna open
every single one of them, starting with this $100 mystery box. - Oh, there's glass in here. - All right, let's see what's inside. - Smell my nuts. - Wait. - It's a candle that smells like nuts. Not my nuts, it doesn't
smell like my nuts. - Nature's nuts.
- Nature's nuts. - Here's a $300 mystery box, and Karl, right there, it's a $400 one. - [Karl] See ya.
- Let's go open 'em. Gentleman. - Huh?
- Mhmm. - Get to opening.
- Oh my bad. - All right. We're not speed running
opening these boxes. All right, he's ripping it. Bob Ross Monopoly. This box is better. - Wait guys, wait, wait. - The $300 mystery box was a Bob Ross set. What was in the $400 one? - Whole lot of magic stuff. - Let us know if you'd rather have a bunch of Bob Ross memorabilia, or a bunch of magical stuff. - Bob Ross. - And if you thought these
mystery boxes are cool, wait for the 250,000 box
at the end of the video. - [Chris] I can't wait to see it. - This is a $500 mystery box, and your mom gets what's inside. - My mom. - Is it weird that I'm always
giving your mom things? - Yeah, yeah it is. - What did your mom get? - [All] Whoa - Headphones. Yo, I take it back, I'm your mom now. Now I want 'em. Right there gentlemen, right there. Okay.
- It's heavy. - This is 700 bucks. - Wow. There's a knife right there. - Yeah, I'm weak. - What?
- [Chris] What? This is all just Chick-fil-A sauce. There's no way this is worth $700. In two days, these go out of date. This one goes out of date today. - Well, get to eatin. I think this would be
a good time to mention. I don't recommend you buy mystery boxes. The same company that made this box also made our a hundred
thousand dollars box, and our quarter of a million dollar box. 250 grand is a lot of money. Now we're starting to
get to the fun stuff. This is $1000 mystery crate. That's right, when you get above $1000, they turn into crates. - What the heck? - How do you think we should
get it down from there? I can't carry that. - Yeah. - I can't carry it. Okay, it looks like they're just dropping. - What?
- No way. - [Chandler] I love fortune cookies. - It's all fortune cookies. - Oh, Karl, the box is falling, Karl. How did they even buy $1000
worth of fortune cookies? Our next mystery box was so big we had to move it with a forklift. And for some reason we let Karl drive. - I'm in a forklift. Oh, Jimmy. - [MrBeast] Inside the $2,000
mystery box was a bunch of whips for me and the boys. - Yeah!
- Go, go, go. This is a $2,500 mystery box which is literally 1% the
cost of the giant mystery box, and also 1% the size. - That's what she said. - It looks like this mystery
box was made by Sircastle. Their logo is a star flexing. I don't know. All right, let's see. Oh, these are sneakers. All right, Chandler
and Chris, I need help. - Oh, they're custom painted! Look at that! They're Super Mario custom painted. - They have everyone's name on 'em. This has your name on it. - Oh! Oh! - I obviously told these
companies we were ordering these, so they made us each custom shoes. - Dude, the mix Supreme Louis Vuitton. - McDonald's. There's a note from them. So we wanted to take some of your interest and allow you to express them
to the world with your shoes. Lame. That was a joke, I love you. This mystery box costs $5,000, and all we got was this action figure, and it usually sells for only $350. Next box! This is a $9,000 mystery box, which by the way is a weird price. Why would you not just
round up to 10 grand? And to open it up, I
brought some pickaxes. And this box is where the real fun begins. This is the equivalent to a car. And because this box is worth
the same as a Honda Civic, please be careful. (heavy rock music) - Wait, it needs one more good smack. - Nice, this is clearly- - Holy grail. - Oh my gosh. That's a dope poster of LeBron. Is this signed by LeBron? Don't run away with it. - Should we not have hit this with an ax? - LeBron James. - It turns out between the poster, the signed ball, the game worn jersey, and the rookie card, this box is actually worth $8,500, so just short of what we paid. This ginormous box is $10,000. And so is this box, even though it's half the size, and I don't know how, but this one also costs $10,000. Pick what you want. - I want this one. - Wait, what if I want that one? - What if I want it? - I need all three of you gentlemen to stand in the bathroom. - But it's stinky in there. - You guys got it. - [Chandler] Three dudes in a bathroom. - [Chris] Why are you standing? - This is Chris's sister, Karl's brother and Chandler's brother. I might have locked your
brothers in a bathroom, just ignore it. And before I locked him in the bathroom I had them pick which
$10,000 mystery crate you guys would get. Chandler picked this one, Zach for you. - [Zach] Oh, okay. - Chris picked this one, and Sean, Karl picked the little one - Huh? Great. Of course. - Everyone keep in mind it's expensive, and you keep what's inside. Wait, did you get yours open? - Yeah. - [MrBeast] Wait, what's in yours? - PSA 7 Charizard. That's sick! - What is in Zach's $10,000 mystery crate? I don't know. - [Zach] Oh my gosh. - [MrBeast] What? - [Zach] It's fireworks. - Oh my goodness. At the end of this video, after we opened that $250,000 crate, we'll launch the fireworks. The boys were getting a little reckless locked in the bathroom. They ended up breaking out
and ruining the surprise. - [Chris] Wait a minute, that's my sister. What is my sister doing here? - [MrBeast] Oh my gosh. - Whoa. This is a power glove.
- It's a glove. - Complete in-box Nintendo
entertainment system. This ginormous crate is
a $25,000 mystery box. And this is Sam, say hi. - Hey guys, how you doing? - Dead serious, I paid
$25,000 for this mystery box and you get to keep whatever is inside. - Okay, that sounds about right. Man, I'm pumped up, let's get out here. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go baby! - What do you think is here? - Man, man, dude, I don't know. Maybe a toy car or something. Maybe car bed? Hey! - That sentence was all over
the place, but I love it. - Okay, oh, oh, oh, he just dropped it. Oh snap! - It's a gaming setup! - It's a gaming setup. I ain't had a system since
Xbox 360 original series, I ain't even lying to you. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ultimate computers. - I don't even know how
to use computer that well. - Sam, we did the math, and all this stuff you see here that you've got in your crate, we estimate is worth
between 30 and $40,000. For our $50,000 mystery box, we decide to do something
a little different. Basically I gave Dream $50,000 to put whatever he wanted in this crate. Literally the only people that know what's inside this crate is Dream, and the mystery box
company he worked with. And I told Dream this
crate was for me, correct? - [Dream] Yes. - Okay. I lied. I actually have one of your fans here, and I'm gonna let your fan
keep whatever's in this crate. So I hope you didn't buy
a bunch of dumb stuff. Yep.
- [Dream] Oh no. - Alex is gonna keep whatever
you put in this giant crate. - [Dream] I hope you like what's in it. - I hope I do too. - There we go.
- [Alex] All right. - Do you wanna stomp on his face? - Honestly. - Let's open up the crate. What's inside the Dream crate? - Holy crap. Nutella? - Dream, what is this
car slash, what is this? - Oh yeah, it's a Slingshot. - It looks like a Batmobile. What noise is it making? - It's just-
(explosion booming) - In this briefcase is $10,000, and if you're subscribed to us when you pull up our channel, I'll give it to you. - I am subscribed.
- He is subscribed! Well, on top of all this, you just got $10,000 in cash. - All right, so I got a new car, $10,000, a freaking wifi grill. Subscribe to MrBeast! - Adam, how much do you
think this crate costs? - I don't have any idea, but it's huge. So it has to be worth a lot. 50K? - This is $100,000 custom mystery box. And I have an offer for you. This is a bag full of $25,000, and I wanna know, would you rather have this $25,000, or what's in this $100,000 mystery box? - Yeah, let's go with the box! Let's go with the big box! Let's go! - Adam, I hope this
doesn't make you nervous but the $1,000 mystery box
was just fortune cookies. I got faith, dude. - Okay, like it. - I got faith.
- He's got faith. - I got faith.
- He's got faith. - I got faith.
- He's got faith. - [Adam] Timber! - It's a box in a box. - There's another box. - Right now, this is kind
of nail biting, dude. I'm not gonna lie like right now. - Moment of truth. Wait, Chris, wait, wait. Oh, alright. It's open. There's a lot to take in here. - Hype! This is straight HYPEBEAST stuff. This is sick. Dude, hold on. Bro, I've been trying to
find out pair SB's forever, dude, what. - Looks like he knows what this is. - Oh, dude! Dude! - [Chris] The Demon Slayer PS5. - Plus a Supreme PS5. - And then how about just a normal PS5? (Adam screams) - [Adam] What the frick! - I offer you Jimmy's $25,000
for some of the shoes. - Bet. - Pleasure doing business with you, man. - No problem. Anybody else? - Frank? You wanna buy some shoes? I guess we're all just buying shoes. - You like shoes, you're wearing shoes right now, baby. Get a picture of this. Let me see, let me just see this first. Hey Fred, anything go back. Yeah. Let me check. - And that was cool and all, but now it is time to open the quarter of a million
dollar mystery box. This $250,000 mystery box is so big that they couldn't ship it to our studio and had to build it in our warehouse. Cue the lights. Boom. This mystery box was made by MSCHF, and we have a representative
here from them. His face is blurred because
they're very secretive. How did you guys make this? - The contents of this box were shipped from all across the country
over the last two months. - As far as we know, the world's largest and
most expensive mystery box. - And most mysterious mystery box. - I have no idea what's inside. 3, 2, 1 press the button. Oh, all right, then we pull. - [Chandler] Do we pull?
- [Karl] Pull! - It's falling, it's
falling, it's falling. - [Karl] What? - What? Oh, that wind. Wait, it's a Lamborghini! - [Karl] It's a Lamborghini! - There's dust in my eyes, oh, there's dust in my eyes. Why of all the times would
there be dust in my eyes. - [Karl] Wait, this is
a Lamborghini tractor. - [MrBeast] Wait, what? - Lamborghini started as
a tractor manufacturer, fun fact. - I dunno why they're
freaking out about that, this is a Lamborghini! - I didn't know there were
leaf blowers in there! (Lamborghini engine roars) - Oh my gosh, did you hear that? - [Chandler] There we go. That's on, now it's on. - Yo, wait. It's low on gas. Shout to this person for
