it's like your phone is basically a terrorist that's trying to extort you for money and so anytime you're on your phone and you feel something someone's making money yeah so of course here it is that it's a tool that we need to use because well some of us do right some of us don't we could always go off and live in a yurt and have a different existence that makes a lot of other kind of sense yeah but if we're trying to integrate in the world we need it but I mean imagine like these phones are so dangerous in certain ways if they're not controlled it's like with our kids we almost are seating to be like okay well you can have a little bit of crack so that you're not left out of everybody else is doing crack all the time like we don't want you to be excluded from the crack Community this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] all right so hello everybody I am very happy to be here with Greg hurwitz Greg has been on my channel before you you might have seen him he's also I've been involved with uh daily wire The Exodus series that we're doing we've had great conversations you might have also seen the conversation between Greg myself and and Jordan about Jordan's tweets and so I would say that in the process of this we are we're kind of progressively becoming friends and discovering our relationship like discovering the the similarities and differences between our position Greg comes from a more democratic kind of let's say left-leaning world but he's been really great at Crossing Bridges and being able to discuss things in ways that sometimes it's hard to do so today I want to talk especially about a new book that he a new comic book that he put out called new think in which he it's like a modern fairy tale that deals with AI and and some of the problems of technology so I'm sure we'll Veer to all kinds of things but uh but that's what at least the beginning of the conversation so Greg thanks for thanks for uh coming it's good to see you Jonathan yeah it's good to see you so so Greg gave me the a copy of new think a while ago and uh I went through it and I was really excited to see first of all it's beautiful by the way like the art is just really beautiful there's something very poetic about the way that you do the work and the paneling it's almost non-linear in terms of the way the panel is set up and the the text you can read it you actually create interesting ambiguity in the way that you set up the the text in the pages so that even if you could read it in different ways but it would still kind of bring you the thrust of the narrative I thought that was very fascinating but mostly what I what I was fascinated by was this this capacity to take fairy tale tropes you know the vampire the this kind of possessing agent right this demon or something like that but then uh frame it as frame it in the technological world so first question is yeah what is the thought process that drove you into that that mode well I was thinking about I mean there's so much that's happening in our world that is so utterly insane and it's like we're like a frog being boiled one degree at a time right and so I keep thinking if we ported Us in for 20 years ago and sat us down in this moment of what's Happening technologically it's just it's bananas we can't even make sense of it I mean I sent Jordan an email the other day because we were talking about his Rogan interview and I just pinged him I said you know hey I just watched that on 3.5 acts and he was like 32. and I I just said imagine back when we were when you were my advisor if we were strolling across you know college campus and um and I said to you hey you know 20 years in the future or 30 years in the future however long it's been you know you're going to be announcing like a new project for Sovereign nations in Europe and you're going to go on the website of a media news demon who's a former mixed martial arts fighter and professional comedian who is the biggest news interviewer on the planet and you're going to have an exchange with him and I'm gonna ping you and say that I watched The Exchange at 3.5 speed and you'll respond yeah me too and there's gonna be nothing else we say about it I mean it's utterly surreal what we're living in right now in so many ways um and so I thought you know I've written a lot of Thrillers fiction horror um I've played around with a lot of different forms and I thought it'd be really fun to tell these kind of like Black mirror-like Tales to have five of them right the first one is a science fiction Thriller the second one's a fairy tale the third one is a kind of vampire horror stalker Story the fourth one is a time traveler story and the fifth one's a children's tale like a a children's story and I wanted to take these tropes and kind of twist them around so that I'm showing our reality through just a different lens a different kind of frame break and that's something we do a lot in you know when we talk about things politically and culturally right is we if you want to make people think differently you have to break the frame on how we're viewing our own situation and our own situation now our reality is so surreal and so bizarre that I don't even need to tell stories that are actual science fiction I could just tell our current reality through different lens to show the insanity so I did five stories like that with five wonderful artists yeah and so that it's interesting I think it's interesting especially because like you said you're not you'd almost don't have to show a dystopian future you're basically representing something which is happening now and you but you're just framing it through narrative in order for people to be able to see it differently and that in some ways it's almost it's different from Black Mirror even because Black Mirror they've been very prescient like they they kind of just look that one step ahead and they've been pretty good at it but you're just showing us the reality now that's right and trying to get people to think about it differently I mean the first story is called the screens and I spell it with a k um so that it sounds science fictiony but it's screams it's computer screens and basically I show how they came as sort of a sentient being if you described them that they came to earth right and first they were like Giant and corpulent and you know and there was just a few and they were they were very expensive and then through time we basically worshiped them and then we became enslaved by them right like they got smaller and sleeker and thinner and we got kind of more obese and more disregulated right and we worship them at our altars at home with our laptops like the one I'm talking to you on now and then we have we have these things we carry with us all the time and right uh we go to bed with them we wake up with them they're monitoring our whole life and we we carry them on our transportation to work and then we sit down at another Altar and then we deal with that screen at that Altar and um we basically are you know we're constantly managing them and maintaining them and updating them and finding patches for them and making sure that they work and so I just framed this as a story like if you view our relationship with our screens with our computers through different lens they basically come to Earth and enslaved us yeah but I mean what's interesting about to me in that particular video what was interesting uh video I mean in a particular story what's interesting to me is that I've been you know for the last few years I've been trying to talk with you know cognitive scientists and different people about the man in which agency manifests itself you know and so like also help people understand in some ways what even the Ancients thought when they used the word demon or the word Angel you know this idea of transpersonal agency that is coherent and acts upon us and so and there's even in terms of mythological thinking in Christian the Christian world there's this whole idea right you probably know these Legends these these legends about how uh you know these Fallen Angels Came To Earth and taught people technology and then that brought about kind of corruption and and uh and that's what's led to the flood for example um but I feel like today at least today because we're seeing what's going on and we we feel like we're not in control of in and it's interesting because I saw it with my own kids you know when I we were homeschooling for a very long time and when I finally put my kids in school the first year my daughter I told her you don't need a phone you know why why would you have a phone like this is ridiculous you're you know you're 13 you don't need a phone and she's like Dad I need a phone if I don't have a phone I won't be able to do anything and we're like no so so she didn't have a phone for the first year she was in high school and then we realized that we had basically alienated her from every other child and that she had no friends nobody nobody talked to her she wouldn't nobody wanted to see her because she just was out of the system and then we had to give her a phone if she was going to go to school and then you realize that you're not in control like exactly what you show in your video that there's a type of agency that is leading us and we just kind of play along and if we don't we get so excluded that we we can't participate that's exactly right I mean I've been through this you know with with both my daughters in different ways but my youngest daughter doesn't have anything I mean she has a phone to text but she herself got off Instagram eventually but I mean the way I think about this is it's like we all know what's hap so look I'm powerless in the face of it if I go on Twitter every day if I'm on let's say I'm out on a book tour and I'm so I'm checking like reviews and where I'm supposed to be and stuff I actually can see that my attention span is getting fragmented right so my own agency my own intelligence such as it is my own training it's not better than uh teams of addiction specialists hired by a social media company backed by Deep machine learning algorithms I can't overcome that that's that's insane to think that I can and they look you know when you're scrolling on your phone or when you're on a screen they can see they track like your eyes like if you hitch on one tweet a little bit or on one post let's say they know where you're hitching to give you more of that and so I just keep thinking like imagine if I was in seventh or eighth grade right I don't even have myelination of my prefrontal cortex yet and I'm being bombarded with the most salacious possible gossip that's designed algorithmically to Target my anxiety outraged lust right to keep me glued to that screen you know it's like your phone is basically a terrorist that's trying to extort you for money and so anytime you're on your phone and you feel something someone's making money yeah so of course here it is that it's a tool that we need to use because well some of us do right some of us don't we could always go off and live in a yurt and have a different existence that makes a lot of other kind of sense yeah but if we're trying to integrate in the world we need it but I mean imagine like these phones are so dangerous in certain ways if they're not controlled it's like with our kids we almost are seating to be like okay well you can have a little bit of crack so that you're not left out of everybody else is doing crack all the time like we don't want you to be excluded from the crack community so why don't you go on and have a ton of images of other kids right who are posting an idealized version of themselves that you can look at this fake version and then know that you're not living up to it because it's fantasy but you alone know that you're not yeah so and my sister's a pediatric gastroenterologist and she made an amazing point about this because she's in the Bay Area and she sees Kids all the Time who are like I can't sleep I have anxiety I have depression I'm not eating and she goes give me your phone and they give the phone and she goes oh look you're on you're on your phone 11 hours a day right how often you're on your phone they're like I don't know like two three hours and you look on an iPhone yeah and they're being eaten by it and she also made a point that I thought was quite brilliant where she said you know it used to be let's say you go home for the summer and let's say two of your friends or acquaintances went on a trip that summer together like to a lake or to Hawaii if you get back to school on you know in September when school's back in and they say oh my God we had so much fun you know at the beach you feel really bad and then you go to home room and then you go to recess and you move on but now you're home and every single day they're posting like you're looking at these other kids where you're not posting and what they're not posting is the fight they got in or the fact that there was a jellyfish sting or the fact that someone was super passive aggressive and they had a big fight or that someone's boyfriend was mean or the food sucked they're they're posing they're posting these posed versions of themselves and it's constantly in your face this like sort of fake reality I mean that's even before we get into the filters yeah so how do we navigate that without becoming like luddites right because that's not going to be helpful either if we like exclude our kids from the modern world and so it's it's an unbelievable challenge that I don't think we've figured out the appropriate ways to turn the dials on yeah definitely and what's interesting is like I said the the notion that it's that it experienced as Agency on us to a certain extent and it has its own logic and its own kind of moving its feet in the world that a good example is even now my kids you know the same with my youngest daughter we try to hold back the phone as long as possible but then the teachers give people their homework in class on their phones so if you don't have a phone in class you can't even function because the teacher is literally giving the assignments and will give quizzes on people's phones it's like so my man my wife uh was a psychologist he's a psychologist so she was in the field for a lot of years which is great because she was very practical she worked with like child prostitutes uh and Kids One Step before juvie and then she went and taught so she had a lot of clinical experience to bring to bear and one of the things she would do is is have the have her students get off their phones for just a long weekend four or five days and keep a journal and they exploded they were sweating some of the kids in her class didn't know how to turn their phones off she had one person whose wife was emailing her because she thought that the he was having an affair by not responding like they lost their mind and the other thing that happened is she had students who were dating and what she wrote what they realized was is whenever they had an argument they couldn't have an argument face to face so they'd have to leave and then resolve their stuff over texting right and so what was very interesting for me about that is when we talk uh and in particular if you've seen for instance we have immunoglobulin B right which is a great um autoimmune booster like when we when if you sing especially if you sing with other people especially if it's in a choir so here we are back to the sacred it boosts it right it's a performance yeah it boosts your your sort of immune system as you're singing as you're using your mouth as you're because our tongue's wired to our brain is wired to community and so as increasingly you see kids kind of flatter of affect right like we all have that story where we sound like cranky old people we're like these kids are so disaffected right like they don't know how to express or make eye contact but if your whole expression is that your face is blank and you're here and you're using a special language that's designed right to make it easier for the phones not for us or to make us more malleable for the phones giant laughy cryy face LOL and I've seen people do that where they're deadpan LOL rolling on the floor laughing right and they're deadpan we're actually moving off our evolutionary design you're not moving our mouths we're not we're not engaging right if you're in a conversation with somebody you know oxytocin is the bonding hormone right it's a release and that that's not just for uh intimate engagement where it occurs right and not in individual engagement let's just say but it's also in conversation among friends and so if you're talking and you have a close relationship with your focused I forget the amount of time but there's an amount of time if you're sitting in in you know a discussion or Fellowship whatever you want to call it with close friends there's a release that you get of a bonding hormone right but if you have a phone out and you check it every so often you don't get that release and part of that has to do with us checking a close visual field far visual field close visual field far visual field it's triggering different parts of the brain and so we can't settle into something that actually derives um feelings of of kind of bonding in community but also yeah your mind is also just split when you're doing that if you're with friend but you've got your phone and and every time you've got a chance you just kind of check to see what's what your notifications or whatever and you are not there like you are your attention split and it's also weird because you think about this like let's talk about this in mythological or religious terms it's like we're not God we're not supposed to have access to every single thing every person in our entire Community that's even unimagined like oh that guy who I had you know I was in Little League with and the girl I had a crush with in fifth grade like oh how's she feeling about her cat or president Trump right now it's his inundation right of information and there's a sort of arrogance to think that we can moderate and dip in to the entirety of the world yeah of course it's like you know again what are we gonna do because we can have a discussion you know when the print when the the fabric looms were introduced for instance Austria's entire peasant class I think this was in the 1800s was reliant on making money with their hand stitching so they just shut off they had an authoritarian State and said no we're not going to accept them right but England hadn't integrated them and then continued to go take over the world and you know Austria kind of shriveled up so we also can't stand in the way of that and have like our own little like Luddite Circle where we're we're removed from the world in a way that we need to engage and so it's a lot of what I've been thinking about since our Exodus seminar Jonathan because in particular I think for me you have a way of talking about faith and organized religion that that really resonates with me because um you pay so much attention to aspects of The Fringe and how The Fringe negotiates with the middle and what the middle is right and a real openness about the fact that in in any faith and in or well certainly we were focusing in this instance in judeo we'll call it judeo-christian because we all know where things are headed um faith that there's an admonishment against too much pureness like one of the things that was so funny is we were talking about the story of Miriam right who came in all snotty pants about Moses when he wanted to marry an Ethiopian and she was you know clucking at him that he shouldn't right it's too much Outsider right skin color doesn't match and in one of the the the great Strokes of humor in the Old Testament God came down and turned her Snow White it's like oh you want to be pure you want to be too pure how about if I make you glow and now get out of the camp for seven days so she's just like glowing unappealing ridiculous version of too much pureness yeah so there's this negotiation um which which you illuminated for me in a way I didn't understand coming from my world I think well who knows what world I come from but meaning a lot of people who are who are let's call it tilting more liberal have a view that that that if that religion only wants to impose sameness and only wants to have exclusion right but here's this clear admonishment to say too much pureness right that's the monster of the right like how dare you how dare you not allow integration to new ideas um and I was captivated also by the fact that um you know after Moses strikes the stone twice um oops and then gets excluded and his entire generation is excluded from entering the promised land also due to some of the lying about what they saw in Kanan the only two people of that generation allowed to enter the promised land are Joshua and Caleb and Caleb's not an Israelite yeah it's like 50 of the elders who enter the promised land are foreigners right like why is that right that's that's not a lesson of ultimate purity you're so right like that I mean the story of Exodus is you can see it as a mediation between let's say unity and multiplicity and that's one of the tracks that you can follow to see the story of Exodus and if you do it that way it's very powerful because you know in some ways there's a there's an ad you know it talks about the mixed multitudes there's a few times where it mentioned it uses that term and there's a sense in which that's not good like you don't want just that you just don't want just a bunch of different people that coexist together without any sense of unity but then then there's a covenant that binds them together and that actually makes them participate but in that participation there's different differentiation and there's you know all the the tribes continue to exist and and the strangers also exist in the in the land like Caleb says that Caleb Gets The Fringe of the camp gets the outside of the camp so he participates he's not totally on the inside he is but he he has that he has the Border let's say and that you could imagine that that's like a normal thing and in any any state like if you had two empires the people on the border would necessarily be mixed with the other Empire like so they would get the Border because they're not they're kind of mixed and that's that's fine that's how it kind of works you need you need those buffers between identities in order to to function so I I think that that's that's one of the places where I hope that the conversation let's say about how traditional societies really function can avoid the problem of the opposite right like you said of of thinking that that tradition is just like a kind of Purity and that breaking tradition or modernity is just about kind of shattering that but it's it's traditional societies are quite a way more organic than that in the actual way they function well and you speak to them to my mind with a lot of openness and care about all these places and that's that's rare like I think a lot of people um you know they're they don't unders it's not like Faith it's not like religion has been uncorrupted any more than the rest of our institutions right or captured politically and so I think people have a sort of pullback from any mention of it in a way um the same way that other people will if you talk about like a straight secular higher education right or you're you know HR department right or like all these places that have gotten kind of overlaiden in their own aspects some of which of course there's there's uncorrupt versions of everything Faith included but what was so interesting for me about that was it fits so much in a lot of the thinking I've been doing about kind of our culture which is we have to have conservatives we also have to have liberals and guess what that bell curve of those traits and not to detour too much but there's we have Big Five personality traits that are integral to us that determine very much which way we sort of will lean on a spectrum that can then be measured politically and they're the same across all Races and cultures it's not like black people and brown people are liberal they're they're not I mean one of the big jokes uh in the 2020 election was that Biden got the latinx vote and Trump got the Latino vote right it's like right it's it's not like it's not like we divide into these personality traits by the color of our skin yeah there's a reason for both of them whether whether one views that as evolutionarily selected or god-given or is that the same thing and part of that is so that you know conservatives who want to tilt more towards holding order which is necessary right some in-group favoritism right we need to build a wall right and you think about that for when let's say the Native Americans when Europeans were coming towards them with smallpox infused blankets like it made sense to have a bit of distrust right for an outsider but that but liberals say wait a minute if you build a wall and it's not porous and there's no movement then we stagnate and die new ideas and people can't get in and we can't revivify ourselves culturally and artistically we don't let in the Grateful immigrant right we don't let in the things that feed the culture itself and so getting that balance right and this is this is me getting back around to what we're talking about with technology I mean one of the things that was really in some ways the most compelling to me about Exodus was the realization in some ways that that one of the key aspects one of the key roles that faith can play when it is not corrupt or captured right when it's embodied in people who are really talking about it through a lens of um love and order right not just overwhelming empathy not just overwhelming judgment right but really the integrated full Embrace without hypocrisy is that it's one of the key aspects of how we order our communities you know and so the notion I had is almost like you know faith in the in the in this example or in this Frame that we're discussing it's like it's the conductor right that sets the sections of a community in place and without it all the sections are blaring discordantly yeah right but it also doesn't mean you don't want the conductor to go sit down in the sections and play the flute and play the trombone and do all that that's not the conductor's job either right you can't have faith shot through all of society because then everything becomes too uniform and so part of me is thinking a lot about the role that we need from all of our communities to find the aspects that are neither corrupt captured ideologically right and how to bring that Community into harmonious relation which of course our faith in our faith communities have to play a big role in that and if we have that all of a sudden we could set different parameters around technology to go hey you know what maybe our kids in school maybe everyone checks their phone at the front at the front right they'll put their phone in a box at the start of the day and they get it back at the end of the day well our communities aren't harmonized sufficiently for us to like we feel powerless to make that discussion because there's so many fights and arguments right and I think a lot about you know with tick tock I'm going to get some of the specific facts wrong but um some of your viewers I'm sure can can can correct or um update this but you know tick tock it's it's a it's a it's kind of like a massive psyops operation right I mean it's in from China they put all those filters look I'm a bunny look I'm a unicorn right it's capturing facial recognition and in the U.S you know one of the things that they've done in their export is to lowers quick lower the amount of time that each video will take place so it's something like it used to be 14 seconds then they lowered it to 12. now they lowered it to eight they're just scissoring our kids focus and delay of gratification and attention span and ability to focus it's literally doing that that's rewiring the prefrontal cortex of our kids but in China they're only allowed 20 minutes a day and it has to be educational yeah like at home they're eating broccoli and then they're exporting heroin right and we're letting it happen and we all know that it's there you can read an article about it but we can't get our communities and our politics and our businesses together to look at this and just go hang on a minute right we it's like we've lost our ability to reach a sane consensus about certain things um and that's what we got to get together and that's a lot of what we're trying to discuss in Exodus and I think what's interesting though about technology that's that's fascinating because in some ways it kind of raised the alarm in the sense that one of the things that I try to help people understand is that religion ultimately in at the first stance has to do with attention right that's what it has to do with so it's it's worship that's what it is and so I think that for many people they don't totally understand like why worship what is this thing you get together and then you sing songs you know you sing songs to God and you all pray to God it's like it seems flaky and ridiculous but the idea is to understand that it's a tension that binds us right common attention is what binds us together and so if we if we have if we're together and we're focused on the same thing like in a sports team for example then that will bind us like we'll experience togetherness in a way that is hard to describe if you know that we're all trying to score a goal in a soccer game then all of a sudden it's like things start to move together you start to be aware of the other person without thinking you know you make a past without looking the person is there for some reason it's like this magical cohesion that happens as you're moving towards a purpose but that has to do with common attention so if we so religion and Faith what it tries to do is to identify what's the highest point like what's the highest point of attention what's the thing that can bind us most to the most together in the in the the most important way and the highest way and so you could say I mean a simple way to say it's like if we all stand together and worship the creator of the universe who is also the god of love you know who loves us and made us in His image it's like maybe that would be the highest point of attention that would bind us towards and then things will flow down from there and so one of the things that's interesting about about the the whole technology question and the the capture of the screens that you that you talk about a new thing is that it's doing the opposite literally in the algorithms right what it does is that it identifies your idiosyncrasy and then it feeds you more of that idiosyncrasy because it's the most immediate way common attention is hard right it's difficult to work together towards a purpose but like that little kick of like get what you what you want in your in your little private uh desires that's easy to give you now if I can the more I give you that then we're actually kind of fragmenting ourselves of course I mean you think about it like a 12 year old boy with an internet connection right now has more sexual images at his disposal than the in in a five minute surfing through the internet than his predecessors generationally to the beginning of time like a 12 year old boy's brain is not designed for that that's like injecting cocaine directly into the lizard brain it's insane what that is right and you know so we were there with with a good friend who is a giant AI brain who who I was joking is like Baby Hitler like we just have to take him out now right before he ends the world but then of course the the answer is like well if someone's gonna do it it's better if I do it or else the wrong people are going to do it like we're in this runaway train situation but if you think about it be we all know our silos we all know our news sources but the opposite of it you know with AI I think what's coming with AI I don't think I don't think secular society has the answers for US unless it also thinks symbolically yeah one of the things one of the things you I want you to bring up because you in another discussion you had this interesting point about Ai and how the danger of AI devolving into individual idiosyncrasy and how that at some point can't hold maybe you can go through that because I think it's very fascinating well I mean so you're talking about this with Faith right there's a higher purpose that's that's binding people you know whatever that means and let's say that that there's versions of that in secular society as well for people right whether it's the Constitution whether it's art when people are together creating art when you're in a symphony right and we can we can discuss like I think there's a there's a reflection of different light on those activities also right so but we we need detour here well even the fact that we all have cultural markers that are the same right it's like we it's like we know that Bach is important Beethoven is important like we we know that these works of literature that we that we can read them and then talk about it because we've all read them so there's a kind of commonality of attention that that holds us not at the highest level but at a pretty high level you know nonetheless right and even Television right which came on and everyone thought it was the plug-in drug and it was gonna be the end of the world and my parents did not let me watch television when I was growing up because they were convinced that it was you know the end of any Focus um but we used to have appointment viewing everyone would wait to see like next week like as a as a generation as a community right you're waiting to see you know what's going to happen with Heather Locklear on the next episode of Melrose Place like people were talking about it things got revealed the last time we really had that I think was Game of Thrones in a significant way so basically you know everyone used to wait like what's the new episode what's gonna happen next week right and when as soon as we went to streaming it's like oh this is so great right Netflix drops the whole season I get everything at once I don't have to wait but I can't talk to almost anybody about any of the TV shows that I'm watching aside from saying oh I'm watching White Lotus season one and they're like oh wait till you get to season two well don't tell me anything right I don't want spoiler alerts I don't want to talk to you because I don't know what you've seen and we're in these different buckets already and it's not like that's to our benefit you know when I'm home sometimes I mean and I click on Apple TV there's like a half a trillion dollars worth of entertainment on the TV but at times none of that feels special it's like I have too much access to too many things it's not like I'm waiting for next summer when Return of the Jedi is going to come out right where I'm standing in line for four hours to watch Tim Burt to get into Tim Burton's Batman on opening up you know and so we're fragmented so now with AI let's take it one step further right well I want my so my book series is called orphanax right there's one book that comes out every year everyone can talk about it in my community I go out on a book tour well what happens with AI when everyone can have their own version written for them right where they say well I want uh orphan X book but I don't want any harsh language and I don't want any threat to children and I want to adjust the words down to a High School reading level and I wanted 30 shorter okay being there's your orphanax and somebody else says well I like I like the real violence I want it more grotesque um and I want it to be you know epic and longer so there's theirs and there's theirs and so you do the same thing with music right and we start to do the same thing with all of our AI interactions we're doing a version of this with our friends of who we're liking and unliking right we're curating our relationships we're curating our communities we're getting rid of things we don't like what if we say well I want to hear from my uncle my crazy uncle but I don't want to hear anything that is his political views or anything that's politically adjacent right so now what comes in and it could be over taxed over social media is my safe version I think safe of him I don't see him anymore like I don't I we don't have meetings then I can almost live in that illusion of my uncle and it's fine like it's that's right and and by the way I'm watching TV shows created for me reading books created for me there's news stories and this is what my my friend was saying he's like we're on the verge where we can write a different news story let's say it's about the war in Ukraine we that can be tailored around the biases or outrage let's say if it's for nefarious reasons if every member of your family so all five of your family members are reading a different news story that hits their trigger their emotional triggers differently everyone's reading different news and so all of a sudden we're like in Wally the Pixar movie where we're just kind of floating around ingesting things right coming into our system and our own little isolated bubbles well that feels metaphorically a religious speak that feels pretty distant from God right it's like a vision of hell yeah no that's a great image like it is a vision of Health like you're alone and you're in your own you're in a circle of your own desires uh and you the the the capacity you have to be with others is being diminished diminished diminished so to a point where you know it's very difficult to engage with people that aren't exactly exactly in the same lying as you right exactly almost like little little mirror images of you we're diminishing our ability to assimilate and accommodate information which pajo the great developmental psychologist talked about that's the moderating aspect of development right it's new information what do you accommodate what do you assimilate right what are things that come in and we also we have no idea what's good for us we have no idea what's good news or bad news in the short term there's a hundred Parables about us right and we don't know if something comes in that's traumatizing that feels like the worst thing that ever happened to us that three years later you go well that's something that fundamentally changed my life based on my suffering who's going to choose awful suffering for no reason up front if you have a choice right so we're losing the skills of like who knows when I like you know it's it's it's challenging it's rewarding but challenging for me to go have a conversation with let's call it 10 of the most you know brilliant conservative Minds in the Western World about religion you know about the Old Testament it's it's it's a it's a different kind of corner of the universe where these ideas are being and it's a range of ideas right it's like Ben Shapiro's very different than Oz Guinness it's very different views very different from and there's this kind of whole range of different ideas and there's so much um where you have to modulate between holding your Center and accommodating new ideas and having humility but remembering there's a very firm disagreement with some aspect of somebody's uh of thinking and that's a skill that you're building and we're not only diminishing our world perception the worlds we live in we're diminishing our ability to even contend with difference in a way that is Illuminating yeah and I think that actually does explain why the Exodus seminar is so popular for the strangest like so so strange to realize that this you know talk about that man talk about 16 hours about a book and not get through it with a bunch of people and people you know and like like 60 of daily wire subscribers watch it uh and so and so but I think it's because in some ways like we are modeling you know the possibility of what you're saying the possibility of of difference coming together or difference looking for looking for an honest recognition of things we can see in common while recognizing the difference you know and of course sorry go ahead well and among our group it's not like if we look at the totality of each person there's plenty that I've done that certain members of the group wouldn't understand wouldn't approve of doesn't match their value sad same for me with some members of that group but the point is is we're not going in saying let's do a Godlike x-ray of every single aspect of you and your conduct right and then make judgment and figure out who we're going to vote off the island yeah what it is is we're going to meet in a consensus in a kind of Fellowship around one topic right and everybody is going to be respectful in their engagement of that TalkBack yeah right but I'm not going to go back and dig out a tweet from you know 15 years ago where you like you know insulted Hollywood like you do like I do I think I think you're referring to other people in our group but that's okay but yeah I think it's interesting I just hope like I in some ways I hope that it will be a model and not a like it's that's the problem with media it's like how can I say this it's it's I'm happy we're doing it and I'm happy I'm doing this but you could see how even something like The Exodus semi seminar could become like a fetishized externalization of the need to do it yourself it's like you watch it so you get the satisfaction of doing it right the satisfaction of speaking with people and everything without actually having to do it that's the it's always the day here's my hope here's my hope um so I work with uh a woman called Summer Ali who's uh who's a a brilliant International mediator and international right she helped mediate the Syrian Civil War um and one of the things she talks about is how we're creating you can see when we start to create an authorizing environment for violence right and we all know what that looks like right if you if you if we turn on cable news and choose your home team right language is increasingly aggressive the other side is increasingly a dehumanized monolith right and then there's a lot of words that are edging towards violence or or towards the suggestion of Violence by which I am not implying that words are violence or that that should be shut down or that we shouldn't have free speech I'm suggesting none of that but I think we understand as we're looking that we've been creating an environment where you know uh cities can get burned down and one people don't understand that we're the husband of the speaker of the house can get you know battered with a hammer and people might make jokes about it like we're we're inching into some pretty uncomfortable territory and the solution for this is to create an authorizing environment for negotiation compromise right civil disagreement opposing views and so my hope is that you know one of the things I wrote a book that takes place in mind control Cults and I went in and undercovered a mind control Cults to research it and one of the principles that mind control Cults operate by is called pluralistic ignorance and that means everybody's really unhappy but since they can't share it with anybody they don't say it or believe it they think they're everybody's pretending that they're that this is wonderful and this is great because they see the others pretending that this is wonderful and this is great yeah and yeah and it messes with your own perception so think North Korea right like everyone's not that delighted to have no electricity and be starving to death right but they can't say it there's no environment to say as and if you speak out there's some risk or danger obviously the risk and danger and the courage that takes in North Korea we're not holding a candle to right for the fact that we're risking what we call cancellation or kind of outrage or reputational financial damage but there's some of that right it's not it's not a super easy Endeavor for a bunch of people who think differently to come together and do this but the hope is that it creates an authorizing environment for people to see other sides of different sides right there might be some people you know the daily wire subscribers are probably not going to be as aligned with me on average for some of my political views but ideally if they see me there talking and engaging in a different way there's an understanding that we can have negotiations and disagreements in ways that are much more civil than we're seeing in social media maybe in the world and vice versa is the Hope and by doing this and by trying to model thinking and talking from kind of different perspectives even as you and I do you know in our friendship and in our public engagements whether we're you know like braiding Jordan for his tweets you know um and braiding's the wrong word right it's like it's like a loving discussion about ways that he might be able to more maximize the ability for people to hear his wisdom is the fair version but I like to just say braiding for his tweet because it was really fun but you know you hope that people can see that modeled and it starts to create an authorizing environment to say I want to start saying what I think more I want to start telling the truth more and I don't have to scream somebody else down because I can't possibly contain it right my I'm so disregulated emotionally I can't possibly talk to Jonathan paggio because here's an interpretation of the worst thing he's ever said and I can't even comprehend it he must be de-platformed he can't be listened to right or with me and instead to recognize that not just that but also the ways we might be um prevaricating in our own communities to kind of fit in because we really need in-group protection right now it's really not safe to not have an in-group that's got your back right now and so are there certain ways where you think well this part's gone too far on the right for too much Purity this thing's gone too far for the left and too much hybridization but I can't say anything because I don't want to be those other guys I'm not going to be that across I'm going to just let that go and it's like speaking truth right that's the that's that's our sultanits in right like don't say little lies all the time and so we're trying to model that um you know and and let's hope that there's some measure of success and it doesn't just piss people off yeah it's a difficult I mean it's difficult to navigate the things you're talking about like if you if you try to try to I always the way that I always analyze things is I always try to apply it at different levels in my mind so it's like I think of let's say a family for example and that you realize that you know in a family if you want the family to function you have to you have to kind of let some things go because it's the because it is in some ways the inner group and you also have to kind of iron over some of the fleets like some of the things that are that are complicated or else you know it's gonna get stuck and it's gonna not the wheel is not gonna keep turning but then at some point that can become a problem right you know if you have serious um problematic patterns in your family and you keep ironing them over and you keep ignoring them and you keep kind of wanting to to smooth it out so that things function then then at some point it can it can lead you into into disease really into a disease pattern and so you have to find that weird balance and it has to do with in some ways with that weird bound between something like rigor and mercy something like you know uh focus and and openness like if you it's like a dance that you have to play so that you don't you avoid the dangers of of either because the thing about like the thing about because sometimes when I hear someone's like just say that tell the truth it's like when I hear that I'm like well and I know Jordan doesn't mean that way because Jordan is is very thoughtful about the way most of the time he's very thoughtful about the way that he tells the truth because he knows that some truth can be said with a bad intention right and you know that you know that you know if you're in a couple or in a family it's like you can say things that are true but that the purpose is still like the stab like you could use the truth like a baseball bat that's right exactly and so there's this this there's this balance that happens between and that and the thing about that is like because we talk about technology because we're kind of running around that is that there's a there's something about a face-to-face encounter and they're looking someone in the eyes that that mediates that you know because the problem a lot of the I see it because I'm I'm the I fall into it too it's like on Twitter for example you know it's like you can say you just it's like people's people coming after it happened to me yesterday some guy coming after me and I'm like dude this guy's been coming after me for for months like he keeps poking me poking me and then I just like I lose it and I'm just like and I tweet the thing and it's like like if he had been in front of me and we had been kind of arguing and it would get here your moment like in traffic where you turn to your wife and you're like stay in the truck and you grab your like tire iron and got out of the car it was like exactly that's going crazy yeah so see I wouldn't like that that definitely wouldn't happen and so that would be because I would have to face the person and then have to engage with them and then he's like six foot eight and there's like boobs right that's the real reason but you know you don't say it but but I'm just saying that there's something about like you because you mentioned something earlier where you said uh these young young couples they say young people that when they get into a fight then they they can't deal with each other they go back on their own and they start texting each other in order to to deal with it it's like man that's it's such a scary spot because texts are cold right they have that kind of coldness to it whereas when you outdate with someone there's a like you feel it if you're if you love the person you're talking to it's it's if you're attentive to it what you'll notice I mean at least I noticed it myself is that like I get angry and then I get angry and I kind of let it out a bit a bit right and then but then I let it out a bit but then because I love the person all of a sudden like at the edge of that I feel some compassion for them and that's that's like something about a fight which can sometimes be useful yeah it's like you you let it out and then it's like once you let it out you see the effect of what you said on the other and you're like oh man okay so now I have to I have to reel it back because I love that person and I don't want although what I said is kind of true and that's how I feel it's not the extent of who I of what of our relationship that's right unless you double down right unless you double down like the Pharaoh then you can just write it all the way I Repent I don't and you know it's really interesting you're talking about brushing things under the rug and there's also you know like one of the things there's different personality types how we come to things right like you can also be too confrontational right where everything's a confrontation and so one of the things that's so interesting um for me it was so Illuminating to read Exodus with with so many scholars and I hadn't visited it in depth since since high school really and and really kind of any kind of depth but one of the things is you know we're talking about how the narrative structure like what struck me coming from novels and and screenplays and and such is just looking at it it's like there's so much attention that's paid in in building this up as per into procedural memory right that's the memory if you get cracked in the head and you lose your speech you still know how to ride a bike it's the lowest level of memory that you lose because it's like here's what's gonna happen in the story here's the story that just happened this is sort of the structure of a lot of the things right here's here's what's going to happen and what's coming here's the event that happened and now we're going to describe the event that just happened well for a straight narrative story for screenplay right everyone be falling asleep um but that's not the point of course of of what the sort of sacred stories they're telling they're teaching us how to push it into procedural memory right in Exodus there's so much of it that becomes ritualized so right yeah like the example it's like the Passover so it's like here's what's gonna happen right and Passover is the greatest it's the greatest example because it says like this is what's going to happen before it happens this is what you're gonna do right you're gonna eat the bread this way you're gonna sacrifice the animal you're gonna put the blood on the lentils and then what you're doing is so you remember what happened and it's like whoa you know but you realize just how much it has to do with procedural memories like here's the story here's what you're gonna do and then this is going to be the way you remember it like bodily by engaging in it you know through the rest of the through the rest of History basically and so like compare that to Mission Impossible action scene right like what do they do they combine all of them into one thing to keep the audience moving right so it's like here's gonna be the plan and as they describe it on the Whiteboard you cut forward in time today yeah keeping it as they're describing it right we're not you don't want to tell an audience those things okay so why is it procedural memory well part of what I've been thinking about it's like it's asking us to be every single character in every single story so it's not like we all just get to be Moses we're all also the pharaoh right so when you're talking about figuring out you know like do you sweep too many things under the rug or are you too confrontational right are you too authoritarian are you too permissive like we don't all just get to be Moses we're also Aaron right we're also like you know God comes down with his with thundering Revelation with Moses and Moses is like hey man I'll be right back like don't do anything dumb and they're like let's build a golden calf and have orgies right it's like he's not even around the corner yet and we're all of those things right we're trying to strive upward but we also are failing and and if we try to really embody them which is what procedural memory is it's the embodiment of a story but we're all the different characters and you know that's also true um when it comes to the gospels right it's like we're all Judas we don't all just get to be Jesus yeah everyone right we're all the parts of that and all of these Reflections and I think that's so much of why it's shoving it into our spinal cords the very manner that we're saying is it's ritual it's like you're all gonna fail you're all going to build the golden calf and have proverbial orgies or literal orgies I suppose you know you're all gonna but you have to constantly renegotiate and figure out the different veils of meaning and figure out the appropriate levels as you try to progress ever and perfectly upward right and we're all going to have failings to hold things together and we're not all going to reach the ultimate ideal within our lifetime and and we have to own a lot of that and what's so interesting for me there's a sort of comfort in that too because it's like you know one of the things I say is I'm I'm I'm liberal a classical liberal right um in a lot of ways well why is that like part of That's genetics part of That's My Big Five personality structure like if I do the testing I'm like blown wide open in openness like I'm as high as you can test and openness that's a very big liberal trait right I'm also an artist um and part of that's my environment right then part of that's like there's all these things and for so many aspects like when I've delved into the culture or into politics or into really an exploration of things one of the things that I realized is like I'm coming from my own little lens right on the world that's the result of my experience genetics environment and personality structure we all do and we all have different lenses and all those different lenses are what let us view the common world if we're doing it in a way that's more comprehensive as opposed to we have our own lenses and we just feed them you know those really cool shots in The Matrix where it goes all the way around in slow motion sequence like how they do that is they set up a giant like Arc of different cameras so that something's being shot from every angle simultaneously we all have these different lenses and if we can integrate them we get a very three-dimensionalized view of a situation well guess what that's how we navigate complex change in the world as a culture right we can't navigate it with this set of cameras that are predominantly conservative or this set of cameras that are primarily liberal whatever what do you think of what do you think of like the theory that I I tried to bring out I think I brought it up quite a bit in the Exodus seminar which is that ritual participation is that's what it's doing so if you think about a family meal is a good example where you know the structure the actual ritualization of the family meal is creating outside of thought the the balanced relationships between the different types of people and the different types of of possible human interactions right so it's like we're eating together there are certain things we we know we have to do like you don't make noise when you're eating you have to be able to you have to like speak but listen but you still have to finish your meal so it's like all of this is being being played together you don't want to take too much food you want to leave stuff from others you're checking to see if everybody's got enough and so it's like all this type of of of a of a very embodied action right is is structuring your the way in which you should act more in a more let's say intellectual or or a social in a looser way right and that ultimately religious rituals have it's not the only function they have but one of the functions that's what they have so like Sabbath you know uh coming getting together on Sunday worshiping together processions all this stuff is is doing that for people I don't know if you if how what do you think about that well it's really interesting and it's it's along the lines of what I'm talking about a little bit is so that's really that's that's really interesting so let's think about it this way right like so that example I gave of the Matrix right so let's say there's a mini version of that at your table like you're sitting around a dinner table and you want to kind of accommodate the reality and story of your family and how your family exists in the culture within all the perspectives and so when I was describing me and all the things that lead to me having or arriving more naturally at a liberal mindset the more that I approach any topic with humility right and and I'm not suggesting I'm good at this right but this is it's a it's a it's a muscle we're always building right that's different the more that I become the more that I have a three-dimensionalized version of whatever the topic is and so there's a lot of times where I'm like look I feel like if I was the perfectly embodied human if I had sufficient humility and understanding in Grace I'd be exactly 50 liberal and conservative right that's the yin yang and that sign line that the sine wave between us is where you want to be between Order and Chaos and the little eyeballs are the kind of feat that's Colossus of Rhodes standing astride that and so it tends to be like I had a really funny car I'll give you just a quick example I had a really funny conversation with a uh elected um uh Republican congressman and we were talking about like infrastructure and Regulation and he said you know you liberals think every time that we want to roll back to regulations and so because we want to dump toxins and rivers and I just laughed and I was like you're completely right that's exactly what I think right every time that I read a headline and it says like this environmental regulations rolled back I'm like it's just big business right trying to like dump stuff and so you know then I did an exploration with a whole bunch of stuff and of course like we do need some regulations but they're way too overburdened and some are ridiculous and some make sense like it's way more nuanced than my little approach it led to believe and so I think that what we want to be eventually is all the cameras that are filming Keanu Reeves right doing his little limbo move we want to be all the perspectives at our table and in some ways the wisdom that we want to embody or the grace I think is the best word for it we want to embody at our table is to under understand and integrate all the perspectives of the family right and use kind of minimal possible force and have the discussion and the influence be freely entered into per Oz is freely entered into Covenant right and the more that we can embody the more views it's like it's all the same thing right we don't get to read a gospel and be like hey I'm just going to be Jesus I'm not going to be Judas in my reading of this story I'm because that's just that's just how I identify it's like I don't care how you identify right you don't get to just be Moses and not be the Pharaoh if you're reading a story and paying attention you don't just get to be you and not your daughter you don't just get to be you and not your wife's perspective yeah but you can't lose yourself into that either so how do you hold your lens and understand all of the lenses and when we do that we have an integration right of all the Mosaic pieces that we can step back from our natural proclivities but also Behold a bigger picture and that bigger picture is what helps us navigate towards health or Prosperity or at least towards the least awful misery when when suffering arises yeah so I mean I I think that the reason why I brought up the meal is that what I'm trying to push for is I'm trying to push for the idea that if you talk about procedural memory and procedural you know procedural participation there's a sense in which there's a lower aspect to this like a more grounded aspect but is what I think ultimately is looking up higher which is something like if you know how to pass and this it's going to sound boring when I say it but it's like if you know to pass food down the table right and if you know to be watching other people's glasses to make sure that they've got enough water enough wine or or whatever if you have that attention which is very grounded and that you know you you you you're attentive enough to make sure that everybody gets a little chance to speak even before the content of what we're saying that there is a embodied procedural reality that's ritualized that that makes it possible for the other part and that because what I'm trying to help people understand it's like I'm really trying to help secular people understand religious ritual like why religious ritual is useful and so the idea is that because you mentioned it before like if we stand together and we sing together right in a choir for example and that especially in a choir where they say you're in a choir and you've got different voices and everybody kind of has to follow their voice and then but also be attentive to the other voice because you want to stay in line with what the others are singing did that that behavior doing that practicing that will make it easier for you to then scale that up into the meaning like the actual explicit meaning world where where you can then discuss with someone but it it's actually grounded in a deeper thing like it could it could be other other things like playing a sport together you know that kind of thing playing games together if you play games together then all of a sudden you there's a kind of there's a kind of ethic of the game which is it's not political it's not ideological there's nothing about it but if you embody the ethic of the game it puts you in a space where you're able then it trains you to to be able to interact with others and it trains you also for the Transcendent right so what do we say when you know Michael Jordan's Michael jordaning were like God he was out of his head today he's not he's not him right all the we have so many phrases with that with sports and like watch you know watch any baseball player step into the Batters box if we want to see all the ritual all the things that they have to do to get embodied in a particular space right there's so many cues before you're gonna step in and engage in a game which then needs to proceed in a certain way that's harmonious um no I think that's I think that that's right and if we don't if we don't set those cues right like I remember I had these I had double hip surgery about like eight nine years ago and so I was going like as part of rehab like a year in I was starting to go to yoga which now I love I do like you know Hot Yoga 110 degrees and whatever but you know it's not like I was good at it it wasn't anything that was natural but it was really funny because I was like working when I first was going and I'd go driving down there and I'd get like all aggravated if somebody was taking water in front of me in line right like everyone hurry you know I gotta get in and do yoga and be like embodied and relax like what are all these people inconveniencing me right and so there's this funny thing that to like to catch it and laugh at yourself and be like right everything that you're doing right is trying to set a template so of course that's ridiculous right so how do you how do you set your system down before you go to the gym talk to your wife right go online right like anything that we do we want to get into a space that we're oriented towards where there's some sort of ritual and engagement where we're clear of mind that we're bringing the right part of ourselves to that endeavor right the most valuable thing you're talking about attention the most valuable thing we have is our attention and where we put it like we we are literally where we choose to put our attention you know and so what you're saying about dinner is it's like do we all set the table right you how do we how do we come to this right where there's already a bit of choreography that is ritualized right that starts to set the mood for whatever the discussion is to come um and can help people I think that understand this can help people understand also the important for example of holidays right why why it is it why for example like why it would be important I'm not American but why it would be important to have a national holiday and why we have to celebrate that with things that are in some ways apolitical right apolitical in the direct sense it's like it's like there's a flag there's uh there's just you know a parade there's a potluck there's whatever it is that that sets a kind of a ritual space of participation in something which binds us which is something like our nation uh and that and that avoids when we try to like when we politicize holidays for example too much then it it can't do that like it it tends it right whichever way you you end up doing it it can do that because it's like you're not in the right embodied procedural space that you should be to create that that ritualized uh participation that's right and what we've seen with the elevation and in some ways I think this is with the you know the the leeching out of Faith from society is that politics has filled that void right and you know I don't have a great explanation for it because like you can't just like Rush people into faith and it's like people have a ton of trust in the religious institutions from the secular World any more than people in the religious institutions have a lot of trust in the secular world and what's happening you know it's like but everyone's got to come back to the table and Stitch together but what we've seen I see this so much in the Arts right it's like for me there's a very clear value structure when I'm writing and it's like art politics if you flip them you're doing propaganda yeah right so I've helped politically I've written speeches and commercials for candidates or people or causes that I agree with but I'm very clear when I'm doing that that doesn't come into the books or screenplays or comics and if you subvert it and if I'm if I'm pretending to tell you a story but I'm really indoctrinating you just a little bit in ideology you're going to get angry and rightly so because that's not why you're coming to read a comic or a book or many people some people just want to read propaganda they want to be put in their little Wally seed right yeah for sure it's it's easier to read the propaganda that you agree with and so you know it's it you don't notice it as much but we should still be careful because you know it doesn't have and it's good that you bring up storytelling right and because storytelling also if you have proper storytelling it is it is it does end up being not in the not in the argumentative State not in the state of of uh of dialectic let's say but it's in it's in the state of procedural relationships and so you follow a character through events in their lives and you identify with them and then you you're challenged or all of this that's that that's something that is has a universal quality they can help us then train ourselves for the for the other stuff but you're right I mean you can see it that's why I mean that's why right now it's I mean so so many of the movies and so so much of the media has been captured and it's very difficult I mean it's it's difficult because it is siloing us you know I have a friend who's who's conservative um pretty conservative right he said something really funny he was like look in terms of watching the Oscars or something he's like I don't want to turn on the TV and watch a bunch of people tell me how stupid I am like right it's it's you we need to have and part of this in some ways is it's like I I don't want to take my politics and moral leadership from artists I want to take like Wonder and awe and contrast and shock and surprise right and and be Jarred into ways of thinking from some chaotic Vision right I don't want to read Faulkner and figure out then you know how to think like Faulkner writes about race in America it's just unbelievable right Southern Southern writer he's just so nuanced it's so like spectacular just feels like it's turning your brain inside out you know or you read Richard Wright you know like you're re when you're reading real art it's it it shouldn't be neat Solutions and I think part of that is a loss of sacred rituals I'm gonna expand the term a little bit but for me it's when I'm writing I'm trying to engage and you know I think for you obviously when you're carving um obviously your subject matter is also more more specifically or more closely aligned with the sacred but you we have to hold those spaces in other ways like I have to have my writing or my art as something that's sacred that's said above everything else if I subvert it to the political right if I subvert it too much to the commercial right it doesn't work it becomes something else than what it's supposed to be and so in a world where we're kind of denigrating hierarchies right with some haphazard and where everything's political all things are political yeah we're we're losing the different aspects of our society that actually anchor at like the Arts should speak differently to politics like or or it should have a different place in the conversation right than politics do education should have a different place than politics do Faith should have a different place than politics too but if we see schools embodying ideology if we see you know Faith communities becoming overtly politicized with one side if we see art and entertainment in Hollywood start to get hide Bound ideologically in a different direction all of a sudden it's everywhere we look and it's just it's a capture because I think that's the easiest lever Force for the hate industrial complex right cable news fundraising letters from politicians um social media that's the easiest lever for outrage and Terror and fear to have us just hit and be glued to if we can turn everything about that right did this movie do the wrong thing politically right it's it's just hitting the lever did this person do this or were using you know do you have the proper stove are you adhering to the right regulations you right did the right movie get this award if we can turn everything into that it's a constant churn of judgment and hate and outrage and insecurity and Terror and also there's a real Pride to it too because then we all feel like we've cast ourselves in this immensely virtuous role in some moral pageant right where we're all you know standing forth against the inequities of the ages or you know we're the last voice against mouth-breathing reprobate seeking to tear apart the fabric of society on the other side that's a terrifying monolith that can't be distinguished and in reality it's like dude you're tweeting you're not doing anything special right you're tweeting into a void and you're probably talking to a bunch of Saint Petersburg troll Farms right or like you know it's we're not doing what we think we're doing we're engaging in a fake dance with the fake intelligence yeah yeah and I think that that's why in some ways I you know when I tell people there's a catchphrase I say people I say go to church and what I mean by that is in some ways it's you have to engage in the human relationships around you that's like the best way to go about that you know you have you have relationship do you have a family you have some kind of community around you and so that's the the best place to go because in some ways that's the place that will have this procedural aspect to it that will will ground the other stuff you know it's like if you have to if you have to you know to help your kids with their homework or you have to do this this kind of really grounded stuff that has nothing that's very little to do with the ideology you you get engaged in others other people's lives then it that it binds you in a different way right it binds you in a way and you can't Outsource that you know it's like like one of the things I say sometimes is the luxury will be the death of us right it's like you could hire someone to go teach your kids coach your kids soccer games right you could have someone else do that like we could always be way too busy with our own lives than to do the stuff that's the real bonding and then it's not even just that you're coaching your kid at soccer it's that you're driving them right and then you have that car time that you're not looking at each other so there's more information and you're driving them and their teammates and when they're in the back they're talking differently and you get a different you know view of that and then there's kind of discipline and there's different rules that you engage with on the field and then there's different celebrations through like there's so much stuff to it versus being like well I'm busy so someone else can do that you lose all of that texture yeah yeah and it's tempting I mean I imagine for you for me for sure because there's so much pulling like it's so much pulling there's so much to do like you could just there's so many opportunities and it's like yeah you gotta be careful family don't bother me I'm carving Jesus leave me alone yeah I mean like what like what do I know it's like it's interesting when you talk about this with Community though because one of the things I think that um I've been fortunate about is I've always moved between really actually diverse communities not in like the modern sense of it but like I've so many different communities or friends with really really differing viewpoints you know and that's that's challenging it's not it's not it didn't used to be as challenging as it is now because there's so much distrust you know but like learning to really negotiate that to really try to to understand and see like you talked about when you get angry in your family and then you let anger out but then you see the effect it has right and then you have to pull back it's like if you're doing that in different communities or different groups especially in this environment where we're so where there's so much distrust and there's so much tribalism it's pretty um it's amazing because it really for me I feel so much um kind of undeniable reality to not turn any one group of people into a monolith because once you turn people into a monolith you dehumanize them so you can talk about well the regressive left right or the resentful right but it's like there's so much Nuance everywhere and if you're in real relation with people with really differing views like you know look Jordan I've been friends a long time I mean it's been more than half my life at this point so many people are like you know here's what a tweet he said like how could you be friends with him right how could you not and it's like well like you think you disagree with him we have tons of disagreements right some of them even public I always think like imagine being so limited in the scope of your imagination that you think that you'd want to be friends with Jordan Peterson and agree with him on everything what like why would I want to have a relationship with you to try and like win you into my full set of views rather than having an engagement right it's like there's so many things to learn and figure out and see differently and to hold the respect that we all come from different viewpoints Big Five personality traits genetics experience and to really try to embody that to try and listen and you know that's so much of what we're doing when we engage with story like we're taking our nervous systems we're trying to listen and take our nervous systems out for a test run we don't have to be the ones who get eaten by a bear right or nailed to a cross like we we get to try to experience this and see what it is and and parts of being in community are that way too and if we lose that muscle to want to really understand and embody what somebody said the other thing is is that it requires it a lot of security to be able to contain your own emotion about whatever political polarizing opinions you come from to really open up and let another perspective come in and come through yeah you know and Carl Rogers talked about that the psychologist he's the one who you know he was the one everyone makes fun of of like well how did that make you feel right that he's that psychologist but he's you know one of the things he did was he sat patients up like Freud would sit you know with his beard in his pipe and then the patient would be laying on a couch and he was sort of sitting and they weren't facing each other Rogers sat him up you're sitting face to face you're looking at somebody and one of the things he did was he talked about how like to really listen you have to embody with empathy in your nervous system almost like what is being told but then you have to have security you're not going to lose yourself right and all of a sudden come out and be like I'm not going to come out of Exodus all of a sudden become like a you know Christian Warrior for the right which is like a fear that a lot of people would have for for that Venture yeah yeah they're like what are you doing like what are you doing over there and it's like look it's amazing like if I have a chance to sit down and talk with Oz Guinness at length that's amazing right do I want to resist that to get as little as I possibly can to make sure I'm always leading with everything that I think first no if I can open up to his perspective in a way that then is shared or that he opens up to my perspective in a way he's so winning Oz right that it's it's hard to not be engaged with him yeah for sure yeah but if you have that relationship it's like there's so much um kind of richness and then you can go away and figure out your accommodation assimilation right and then it's you know it's hard moving between communities right now you know it's like re-entry can be hard moving one kind of culture and Community back to another but it's so worth it it's so worth that so I wanna I wanna bring you because right now you just you're gonna leave on tour for your new orphan Xbox all right and so one of the things that I found interesting about that is you know we were talking about Ai and the problem of this idiosyncratic novel and uh and you also have a way with or for next like you you have a charity that is related to orphanax that is kind of trying to connect into the world so I'd love you to just talk a little bit about that because I think it is an interesting way because sometimes like we talk about Ai and like the danger of it coming like we shouldn't we shouldn't what do we do and so I think that you found some interesting ways to connect your literary work into the real world to give people the sense of participation in community and something that's more than just a novel right so look as we were talking about that I mean really over these last weeks as we're thinking about this fragmentation with AI you know one of the things that occurred to me was you know I want to have part of what is going to be special or worthwhile about this about my writing about me as a novelist if pretty soon we can have ai write novels it's like we can have arguments about the spark of the of the Divine in humans right like there's a human governing aspect to for when you create a novel or a series of novels but I think in some ways the thing that's the most important that's at the bottom of it I mean it's it's really obvious in a lot of ways but it's Community it's the fact that everybody reads the same book right I write one orphanax book a year and the books are really about I mean orphan X for those of you who haven't read it you know he's a he was taken out of a foster home at the age of 12 as like a very unwanted member of humanity and trained to be an assassin an off the books assassin for the US government he was trained up basically to be an Expendable weapon and one of the things that his Handler his a CIA Handler who raises him kind of an isolation and puts him through very very rigorous testing um and training but he tells them early on and he actually really loves Evan and that's one of the things that's a bit different about this isn't just that he's trained it's traumatic and awful it's also the best thing that ever happened to him because it's the first time somebody treated him with love and care but so Jack Johns who's uh orphanax's Handler and Father Figure orphanax's name is Evan smoke he says to him when he's 12. the hard part isn't going to be turning you to a killer the hard part is going to be keeping you human and so the series is very much about his process of being trained under these he has like the Assassin's Ten Commandments right that he's never supposed to break but it's very much about the process of him shattering through into a different understanding of one of the things I say is he never learned the strange language of intimacy it's almost like he's Pinocchio and he wants to be a real boy and so it's the process of his becoming it's the process of him learning to be human in a lot of ways and so the thing that's the most I think important about this is that everyone's not reading um a different storyline that's designed just for them once a year everybody can read the same story that comes out and that's that's what a fan base is that's what readers are that's what community is that's who shows up when I'm on book tour we're all there um to talk about and discuss one Arc that's happening but one of the other things that that happens that I set up is that orphanax as you mentioned uh there's there's a charity so he basically left the program it's called The Orphan program at some point because those two things being human and being a killer are like trains on a collision course and he essentially becomes a pro bono assassin like so he can align it with his own moral compass he's got unlimited resources he's got an insane skill set and basically he will help people who were being terrorized by other humans who have nowhere to turn and there's no way the law can protect them and so he has an encrypted line uh phone number it's one eight five five to nowhere and if you you can call it and you can see if he answers it in the real world and every time he answers that phone he says do you need my help and so I started a foundation called the junior my help Foundation where we go into local communities we don't assassinate people I hope [Laughter] depends who Pago that's right that's right um but basically you know I I do I do a lot of democracy unit and unity building work um uh pro bono and so one of the things that we do is we go into um through through uh organization uh called millions of conversations I mentioned my the partner I work with in that uh whose name is Summer Ali who started it and we go into really left behind counties in a program and build kind of community leaders to then have them figure out what problems they want to solve and then we bring in experts in you know rural Economic Development and mediation to try and help them out of it and so really what it is is we're trying to teach them to fish again right in this new world where everything has conspired to leave them behind but one of the things is is while you're teaching someone a fish you also need to give them fish right or they're and so do you need my help is something that I set up that's just a stop gap for some of those things where it's like you know we had one family in the first place we went was in a Grundy County that's the most uh it's the poorest count in Tennessee um and when we went there I went there two weeks before the midterm elections and nobody mentioned Donald Trump or Joe Biden or midterms or January 6 or China or immigration all that they were talking about was I don't have enough gas in my car to drive 35 miles to talk to Social Services to get food stamps to feed my kid like the problems they're dealing with were so concrete that there's no room for all the stuff that we're screaming about on CNN and Fox News and so there was for instance one of the first uh the first kind of Grant we made was there was a couple there young couple his car broke down there's no public transportation right the roads are terrible um his car broke down he lost his job because he couldn't drive to work his landlord kicked him out they had a newborn baby who developed a respiratory infection um and the landlord poured bleach all over their possessions as kind of Revenge for them not paying the rent so there's this young couple with a newborn who who've always worked right he's always worked up until now who are literally out on the streets and then you get into all these regulations right and issues so there's local charities who were there but all of their funding can't go towards kind of this relief in this particular example like they can pay for certain different programs but there's there was nothing there where the money had been earmarked to help them so we just stepped in and got them a a motel room for three weeks while the task force scrambled on the ground there and eventually got them a place in uh longer term housing that didn't open up yet but they would have been homeless right got the baby Medical Care gave them a base so they had somewhere to sleep and then they got moved into longer-term care or longer term housing and then the husband applied for a job in the military right and then needed some help because he failed the math part so we have somebody who's a military veteran who's amazing who's one of the founders of millions conversations and so we can point them to resources and so it's just sort of like when when when this little family kind of fell off the curb into the gutter it's just this little assist to pick them up and put them back on the curb again right and there's there's other stuff we have like a bunch of floods destroyed um schools in Tennessee and one of the schools just got wiped out and we're going to go in and just put in like a rural computer lab I'm sorry a computer lab for this Rural High School right that lost all of that for the students so we're trying to go in while while this longer action plan is kind of being built up and that's called Genie by help foundation so that the readers and the community of orphanax readers can also kind of participate um yeah and also then the cycle of Charity and gratitude stays in the community right it's it's given by and chosen by the task force not by me right not by me outside the community right so that everything stays within there and so it's just another way to try and Stitch this community together around the story and the story ultimately is about helping people though of course it's a thriller so he's you know executed killing people but I mean in some ways it I mean I love it because you're you're trying I mean I don't know how consciously you're doing it but basically you set up a narrative that is of course extreme because it's in the story world it's about assassins about this but then you set up a structure and then you're trying to help that structure inspire people and giving them a path for it to inspire people into their real life because I mean the problem of entertainment is often that it can be it can just be a uh a supplement or it can just replace actual virtuous action right so it's like okay I watch movies about great figures that did things that are that are inspiring and then I can just go back and go back to sleep yeah you know where else we found that in a study is that's also what angry political tweeting does yeah yeah yeah I did my part today boy I really told them off that's right and you go back to work and it's like um right beneath you screaming at your hated politician or celebrity of choice like what's the cause you're real you're really worried about if you can peel back all the layers of performative outrage that you're trying to help right do you really care about like what's happening at the border or immigration or like you know how are you trying to fix that from whatever side you're coming from right like what's the ACT action that you're doing and you're right we can sometimes just be blowing off off steam but you know with storytelling and I've always thought in stories like a lot of that is Trend challenge myself really because I'm not I don't always know what the characters are going to do I don't know how things will turn out I'm not just filling in the blanks when I'm writing the story so it's trying to be about kind of growth out of the chaotic some organization into some new version of of order but the more that I can have that Community around me both online and there's a good use of online like when I'm online I try and be about the books and stories and joy and reading and right it's a there that's a nice way to have an established online community and use social media at least for me and when I'm on tour seeing people who show up right who are interested in talking about ideas or interested in talking about orphanax and then trying to do a bit of good in these communities while also deferring to and having humility that the communities will know how to help themselves better than I will right we need to go get the local we need to get the ground truth in those communities to choose where to put those resources right I can't just come in from the outside and say I've determined everybody needs education it's like what like where you've been the last 40 years while we were on a slow downhill slide because everyone was ignoring us yeah so so so what's the name what's the name of the the new book and tell people where they can if you are in tour tell them if they can come see you somewhere oh I'd love I'd love people to show up so it's called the last orphan um and people can find me my website's Greg hurwitz.net um you can find me on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and I'm going to be in London I'm going to be uh Northern California I'm gonna be in La I'm gonna be in all across Texas Austin Dallas Houston I'm doing an event in Fort Myers I'm doing uh I'm gonna be in Tucson and Scottsdale so it's a lot of travel that the tour stuff is is all on my uh website if you want to come look for it and if anyone wants to come say hi and and talk story or or you know orientation towards towards meaning or order or anything else um you know everyone's welcome it's a they're they're a lot of fun I love going on tour cool well and everybody check out new think I really enjoyed it for sure and I think like I mean if for people that have people that have followed my work you know some of the stories like at least two or three I would say three of them in of the of the total really just connect right to the kind of things that I that I talk about that I care about so so Greg thanks man this is as usual we could this is great and I hope we see each other at if we're gonna do uh some kind because we everybody people don't know we finished the second part of The Exodus seminar now there's like talk of some other project which would bring us together again so that would be great it'd be it'd be a lot of fun but I'll I'll see you before then I hope thank you on Jonathan it's a pleasure thanks man
