hey guys Zhou Steen this is the r-tx 20 atti liquid-cooled Thunderbolt gaming box now I have three questions first of all what exactly is the point of pairing the most powerful consumer graphics card available in a thunderbolt enclosure my second question is does it make any sense whatsoever I mean you have the bottleneck of thunderbolt you have the bottleneck of whatever a thin and light laptop you connected to and finally and probably most importantly of all is this worth the massive $1500 price tag let's find out shall we so up front we have a USB 3.0 port and if we flip around to the back we actually have a pretty decent selection of ports including all of the graphics outputs we have tight C Thunderbolt USB as well as Ethernet this is a very weird concept because on one hand you have an Archie X xx atti you have the ridiculous overkill capabilities of what you're going to get out of water cooling so realistically you should be overclocking it on the other hand you have limitations of Thunderbolt now they do have what seems to be a pretty decent liquid cooling setup here so we have a 240 Miller 88 err on the top and a water block over the GPU itself as well as the VRM I mean you've got the the dual 120mm fans which are exhausting straight out the top it has a dedicated 450 watt power supply right down here I mean looks like a pretty solid gaming setup I guess there's only one way to find out so for testing we'll be taking advantage of my daily driver a 2019 Dell XPS 13 2 and one with 10th gen core i7 as well as importantly Thunderbolt as when you're using one of these GPUs you need Thunderbolt 3 built into your laptop or desktop or whatever now another reason why I'm using the XPS 13 is I think this is sort of the sweet spot so obviously there are much beefier much more powerful gaming laptops that do take advantage of thunderbolt however if you got something that thick and that bulky you probably already have a decent GPU anyway whereas this while the integrated graphics are fine there's certainly not up to hardcore gaming which is where this supposedly will come in huge handy huge handy that's something you have to pay for I'm sorry and we paid $15 for GPU you get a huge handy I feel not particularly happy with this monitor right now it is freaking out really hard on this display so one slight issue that we've had is that it does not like running on the internal display so I just disabled the internal display the battlefield doesn't understand that I have two screens connected because generally speaking with thunderbolt you don't want to run with the internal display on because it's soaking up your bandwidth please keep it over okay this is not respecting me at all right now I don't think this is necessarily the game boxes fault this is just a matter of Thunderbolt and this XPS are really not agreeing it just doesn't understand how to deal with this monitor do you think another Thunderbolt laptop maybe so it's another day in surprise surprise switching to the razor blade a laptop which is actually designed to work with an external GPU is working flawlessly so the setup is exactly the same as it was yesterday so we have the blade the screen is turned off to get the maximum performance now let's see if this actually works would that be lovely okay we are up and running with a very cinematic 23 fps so I'm not particularly surprised be considering that we are running it literally with everything completely maxed out let me bring a couple settings down to something reasonable and see what we get oh look at that literally just returning my ray tracing from Ultra to medium we went from 20 to 40 fps I mean you can see it looks incredible this is definitely an area which we're getting some real performance out of the 20 80 Ti so next up we have GTA 5 now this might not seem like a really obvious choice however it's actually still a pretty good game to test specifically DirectX 11 and very specifically the CPU usage so this is a game which once you crank it up can still should be fairly demanding so this is mostly max settings at 4k so we're in like the mid 30s right now now we can certainly turn the settings down but actually think this is where we're starting to run into some bottlenecking so even though the razor blade is still a fairly powerful laptop it's still using a mobile chip which means that while it'll boost up to a fairly high clock speed over time as you're hitting it with a pre sustained load that clock speed will start to drop which will start to hurt our performance this is fine and we can very easily turn the settings down just a little bit and probably be well above 60 FPS but I do think this is probably the first real example of a game which is starting to run not necessarily badly but this is nowhere near what I would expect a 20 80 I to do if it had a better CPU and wasn't being wildlife like thunderbolt server Roberts I have the same graphics card paired with a core i7 9700 K getting twelve thousand seven hundred and fifty points in the times bite test you know we're not going to hit that I'm curious to see exactly how close we are obviously with whatever bottlenecks that exist CPU I think is definitely gonna be one of them okay and our score is 9600 okay so that's not terrible but we are certainly losing performance not only on the CPU score but specifically even the graphic score is a little bit down than what I would compare to what I would expect for reference though that is still over three times more powerful than the GTX 1650 which is inside this laptop so there's no doubt that we're getting a huge performance gain it's just that a water-cooled 2080 eye is obviously going to be bottlenecks running over a thunderbolt now what I'm curious about is if we actually start overclocking it can we get that much higher are we just fundamentally limited by this setup that we have here let's see so gigabyte does offer some software that was supposedly autoscan for a GPU boost I don't know exactly how good this is going to be I assume not great but let's see what we can actually get you see what I would do is get it to like whatever oh the whatever the slider lets you go to and work it down is that the the school of Ken overclocking cranked it up to 11 figure so later yeah go maximum at all times so wait no that's dumb because if I haven't set to this it only goes to a higher clock speed when it gets hotter [Music] fans please fine gee people will not let me unlock oh I can't okay cool yeah give me more I'll leave memory alone and I'll do manual GPU Bustos oh no I'm not I'm not gonna it's not gonna work if I do it all the way why not it's not just not gonna work never find out it will never know you don't do it why do I let you talk me into these dumpsters all right Wow I can't believe that did it work no way Gretzky said you miss 100% of the shots you don't take how is that a shot you crank something up to a million and it doesn't work at the end like it's not okay I'm just gonna restart the whole system now okay so we have now done the auto overclocking tool 2080 I I did manually bump up now they power limit but also the GPU temperature and let's see what we've got so again for reference before we overclocked we had a score of 9600 28 let's see if this actually made a difference or whether our water cooling is not useful the suspense is real oh that's very slightly better so 10,000 seventy-two look if I'm gonna be real for a second this actually is pretty impressive so we're getting most of the performance out of our 2080 ti using Thunderbolt and you have to consider that there are two major bottlenecks so first of all is the Thunderbolt 3 port now well yes it's quite fast you're still only getting about a quarter of the bandwidth of using a PCI slot on a desktop motherboard it's not the end of the world but it does her performance but probably our biggest bottleneck here is the mobile core i7 inside this laptop don't get me wrong blade stealth is a very nice laptop and you do get a lot of power for a 13 inch laptop then at the end of the day you have some fear thermal limitations and power restraints compared to a full desktop so if I was using a core i7 on a desktop I can easily tune it to go well over a hundred watts of power lots of cores lots of clock speed but on a laptop you're really limited I mean we're realistically using like if that power budget and it can't boost anywhere near as high and when you combine those two it totally makes sense that we're losing some performance but 20% but used on all of that is actually not too far to drop however I have one more thing I want to try so this is the ARS 2070 gaming box so they've actually make a couple of these so this is the one that I think is probably the best bet for most people or at least of my assumption before starting this video as essentially what you get here is still a very high-end graphics card but it is significantly cheaper so that's actually one of the things that have really touched on too much $1500 for a our chicks 20 atti game box sounds excessive and extreme when you actually start looking at it it's not a bad value so the 2080 I if you just want to buy that graphics card is $1200 so you consider that the extra $300 goes into the enclosure all the Thunderbolt peripherals as well as stuff like the Ethernet and USB you also have water cooling RGB that's not cheap and when you consider that razor is one of the companies who makes a lot of these gaming enclosures the GPU enclosures they're charging usually about $300 for it by itself this is actually a pretty respectable deal my real question here is that while this is good should you just save yourself a few hundred dollars and buy something that's not quite as powerful I think that might actually be a pretty smart move so now we have the Archie X 2070 gaming box connected the nice thing is they all use the exact same cables and drivers were all set up so it's literally just a plug-and-play kind of thing so again for reference the 2080 I got 9600 28 whereas the 2070 got 7117 hmm so essentially the pricing difference is almost double so this is about $800 which is $1,500 for the 2080 Ti so right now while yes the 2070 is what 25% off it actually isn't wildly off of a normal RTX 2070 so while yes this is cheaper so we're looking at an $800 GPU enclosure as opposed to a $1,500 one you're not sort of seeing that doubling of performance by any stretch this is a lot smaller it's cheaper I would argue it's better for most people however the real question here is not so much is this a practical good idea to spend this much money but rather should you buy in our tix twenty eighty I and push it to the absolute limit not counting your overclocking but like something a little bit more grant than that so this is the culmination of our thunderbolt setup so we have three 4k displays all being powered by the RDX twenty atti as well as that razor blade which is connected with the single Thunderbolt cable or at least that's what I'd like to tell you so yes this setup is currently running on our twenty eighty I Thunderbolt gaming box but the issue is well nothing really wants to work well together and actually I will say that this has really nothing to do with the Thunderbolt side much more to do with the fact that between our TVs our cables and adapters going into the twenty atti as well as windows and the Nvidia software fighting we've had a real issue trying to get any of this stuff actually up to full resolution so it is currently playable you can see I have the wheel up and running but I did have to turn the resolution down to thirty eight forty by 960 now performance no problem with that resolution but it doesn't look anywhere near as sharp as it should across three 4k displays realistically this is the upper limit of what anyone would really be doing with Thunderbolt well yes this is a perfectly reasonable gaming setup there are a lot of issues the way I would really prefer to do this is if I was using three gaming monitors instead of the TVs well the teenies work there's too many issues the adapters we have to get over to HDMI for this to be a viable setup but it does do a good job of showing off the wall yes we're losing a little bit of performance compared to a twenty eighty i and like a full dedicated gaming PC even something like this is totally usable so we're running on a 13-inch thin and light laptop also I'm really really trying hard not to crash right now and it's not easy oh it's so hard man so um I don't know why I'm playing this game what's what do you know why I I'm I just got brought in to maybe play better or worse than Austin I know my doubt I have a lot of faith in you my friend you probably shouldn't but alright well let's see what you got what are you doing faster you'll blow your motor you only get four of those a year do you really yeah can you need ABS oh Jesus Christ in traction control and tracker control oh and I died I died so Ken would you like to sum up your experiences as a world-class Formula One driver um yeah I am very bad at it Oh crashed no no well beautiful racing setup well and it just shut off wait the game crashed wait no the computers find the game just crashed it couldn't handle our excellent Formula One driving capabilities anyway thank you very much for watching this video all about this ridiculous gaming box make sure to subscribe to the channel for more content
