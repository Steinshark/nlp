New York City home to some absolutely fantastic 
architecture although even here some buildings are   cuboids I mean look at that one how embarrassing 
a cuboid it's just a cube but it's not even a nice   neat Cube It's stretched out it's a rectangular 
prism how embarrassing whereas over there you   can just see it behind those cuboids it's the one 
World Trade Center anti- prism and that is a much   more exciting shape so a regular prism is when 
you've got two parallel polygons and you join up   the matching sides with rectangles in the case 
of a cuboid it's a rectangular prism it's the   worst of the worst whereas an anti- prism you take 
those two parallel polygons you give them a Twist   so they're perfectly offset and instead of using 
rectangles use triangles twice as many triangles   there are some amazing anti prism shapes out there 
and in this case we have a square antiprism it's   such a good shape I'm actually in New York because 
tonight I'm doing my evening of a necessary detail   show which is why I'm joined by my maass friend 
Laura tman who are maass Professor yes at James   Madison University and you're doing part of 
the show tonight yeah I'm going to talk about   computational knitting so good I'm so excited 
but that's not why we're here uh Laura is also   very well known for her 3D printing so if 
several of my videos have featured things   You' have printed uh including the scoid video 
scoids um but that's that's somewhere between   a pris and it's kind of like half half and half 
yeah we're not going into that so because we're   doing show this evening we thought it'd be fun to 
do a day trip today and go and have a look at the   world's biggest [Music] antiprism we've traveled 
to the other side of Manhattan because here it's   possible to get a much closer look at the building 
this has forked my question for the video cuz I   wanted to ask the question is anti- prising a 
building is that like does that increase the   volume or decrease the volume but now we've got 
a second issue because you can see on the model   the top is smaller than the bottom so now we got 
two questions uh later on we're going to answer   what is the actual volume of the anti prism as 
built my question now however is if we ignored   this tapering effect so if we imagine the top is 
the same size as the bottom it's a true antiprism   does that increase or increase the volume compared 
to the original prism I mean I feel like that's   an obvious question what has more volume the 
prism or the anti prism well the question is   obvious I don't the answer is obvious I uh what 
do you think the answer is I don't you made the   point earlier that if they were the same we would 
know that we would know we would know you could   Google it yeah and we would know it would be 
a fun fun fact did you know right a prison man   and anti prism have the same volume no one has 
written that on the internet that I can see so   it's false says proof by not on the internet M so 
it's bigger or it's smaller yes when you twist it   and connect with triangles instead of not twist it 
and connect with rectangles rectangles I feel like   it's going to be bigger I disagree good good for 
narrative purposes that's really useful so what's   your logic for for for for Less my Logic for Less 
is that if you took the cuboid and you twisted it   like a lot like more that it would get all I 
imagine it would get all small in the middle   cuz my thinking was in the exact middle ignoring 
the tapering it's going to be a regular octagon   or it's going to be a regular Eng gon that's twice 
the end of the top and bottom and just by proof by   thinking about it for a minute I feel like the the 
Octagon in the middle will have a bigger surface   area the cross-sectional area than the square at 
the base it's not a bad Theory cuz like honestly   if you take this off that this isn't quite the 
Octagon slice but it's close and even with the   frusty bit it this is pretty big compared to this 
like if it hadn't been decreasing at the top would   that be bigger this would actually be quite large 
but if that octagon is a smaller area then I think   the total volume is smaller yeah yeah so so all we 
have to do is calculate the area of that octagon   which we genuinely have not done in advance um 
we met up this morning and we're like I wonder   what the area is and now we're going to work it 
out yes the paper was out and we quickly got to   work trying to calculate how big that Octan is and 
everyone got involved producer Nicole was doing   some working out a camera assistant Truman turns 
out we only hire people with a math background but   after a while and a lot of trying to visualize 
triangles in 3D we had a bit of a breakthrough   my argument was if you've got cuz you you look 
at the whole silhouette yeah if you look at from   the side there's your base of one of the triangles 
it goes all the way up to the Peak at the top and   back down again it shouldn't make a difference how 
tall or short the antiprism is right the Octagon   is always going to be halfway up and that similar 
triangles is going to be half the base exactly oh   nice so that's just going to be well if if it's 
a square of size one that's half and so we we   just need to work out the area of an octagon 
with sides half a square which is got a bigger   volume and there is an equation for the area of an 
octagon I'm about to look up on the internet I did   indeed just look up the equation and I put in the 
length side to calculate the area of the Octagon   relative to the base square but other people 
got real obsessed we're trying to derive the   equation for the area of an octagon from first 
principles feel free to have a go yourself but   we're going to move on Laura had something she 
wanted to say h Matt was right I'm as surprised   as anyone I'm not that surprised I'm not I'm not 
used to this he was right it seems to get bigger   in the middle in the non frustr me yeah well and 
then we worked out the area and the area is 20.7   1% bigger kind of a lot bigger actually 1 plus 
root2 on two yeah yeah 20% yeah to recap we were   trying to answer the question if you take this 
anti-prism and you compare its volume to just a   regular prism so this has exactly the same surface 
area in the bottom that's the same size as that   and it's EX actly the same height there and it's 
got the same area on the top so that is the same   square as that it's just rotated around by 45° 
which is why we get the triangles and that's what   makes it an antiprism so we were looking at what 
happens if you look at the cross-sectional area   right in the very middle here which is a bit hard 
to see on the anti prism I mean it's the same on   the prism it's consistent the whole way up what I 
can do is I can duplicate this one so if we get a   second uh antiprism and then what I'm going to do 
is just just make the top bit here uh transparent   I think that's it okay there we go you can now 
see that's the exact cross section there and it's   a perfect octagon so what we showed is that the 
area of this octagon is 20.7% bigger than the area   of this Square which means unlike the regular 
prism where it's the same cross-sectional area   the whole way up over here on the anti prism it 
starts with this area gets gradually bigger and   bigger and bigger until the exact middle when it's 
the oct on and then it gradually gets smaller and   smaller and smaller back up there so that means 
that the total volume of this antiprism must be   more than this prism there you are yeah okay the 
volume's more but now we want to have a closer   look at it I think we need to go and measure 
the base mhm and then we got to see if we can   work out the volume of a anti-prism frustum and 
figure out exactly how that frustum thing works   yeah yeah we're going to do it use the word frust 
a few times that just means a prism where it gets   more narrow at the top because if if it doesn't 
you can see these side triangles they lean out   that's because the very very top like the corners 
now stick out from above the base and you may not   want that when you're making a building so the 
One World Trade Center is designed so the top   exactly fits inside the base so it's been reduced 
in size and that means that the sides of these are   perfectly vertical this is an antiprism this is 
an anti frustum so we walked across to the base   of the One World Trade Center and said about 
measuring it I counted my steps I know how big   my shoes are and I just counted how many steps 
all the way across whereas Laura used a knitting   stitch counter to count the number of panels in 
the ground from one side to the other and then   we just had to measure one panel and multiply it 
up we then dropped by our friends at Jane Street   who have an office nearby so we can sit on their 
balcony and do some working out right we need to   work out how long the side was how long the side 
is what did you get uh well I got that it was 82   panels long and uh we measured that those panels 
were 30 in so that's 2,460 in or 205 205t that's   my panel estimation right I had 12.6 in per foot 
time 190 oops 12.6 in per foot time 196 ft is well   it looks similar 2 4 69 divide that by 12 25.8 
ft oh is it like The Price is Right Where yeah   I'm I am8 of a foot high Nicole looked it up what 
is it what is it 200 200 all right round number   well done here you go so our question now is what 
is the volume of our antifom right not including   there's a straight bit the cube is Trivial we're 
going to ignore that we want to know the volume   of this now you put something else to this are 
we I did you like to see so um think this is a   really difficult shape right I had a hard time 
uh visualizing what was missing and so I thought   maybe I could visualize it better if I had it 
in four pieces because you know if I could just   compute the volume of one of these pieces then you 
know multip by four so so okay so now the problem   is compute the volume of that yes so it's it's a 
cuboid mhm with that missing mhm and how much of   that is that is that a quarter what's that is 
that well that's what I wondered too and so uh   in this program Tinker CAD you can move these 3D 
pieces around y okay so I thought you know maybe   there's some other way to move them around so that 
it would be obvious what you're missing and it   turns out if you assemble them kind of inside 
out like this so now it's the same square top   and bottom yeah now it's the same void and this 
pyramid fits right inside so what's missing is   if you take one out you can see it just like that 
see what's missing is this pyramid exactly see so   the volume of the frustum frustum anti prism the 
anti prism is the volume of this minus the volume   of this these are both really easy shapes to find 
the volume of yeah um so I think we're golden so   the volume is just the cubid trial minus this and 
what's that that's a third a third of the cubid   yeah I think that's true and the area is probably 
half well wait it's it's it's a third of the half   the area yeah yeah so it's a third of the little 
keyb do you want to draw a picture so people can   see what you're I know what you're talking about 
this is what I'm trying to say yeah is the big   square is the base the small square is is the top 
and it fits so each of those Corners is directly   above the middle of that edge so these surfaces 
are straight up and down which is lovely and if   you imagine this if you split that up into the 
quarters each of this is equals that and so that   smaller square that whole internal Square there 
is half of this one and so the volume of the   whole original cuboid is the bottom area times the 
height mhm and the volume of the missing pyramid   cuz the volume of a pyramid is a thir time the 
base time the height so that's going to be plus   A3 times the area of the base which is a on 2times 
the height so what's that going to be future mat   here past mat had done too much walking in rope 
Plus instead of subtract so the total is 56 of   the base area multiplied by the height that's 56 
of the volume of the big cuboid now we just need   to plug in some numbers okay so 1183 is the 
height height times 200 * 200 * 5 / 6 equals correction 39,43 3 ft cubed doesn't this say 39 m433 
, 333 whoops more what's three orders of   magnitude you're right that wouldn't be a lot 
that wouldn't be a very big it's smaller yeah   yeah yeah yeah wow it's closer than I thought okay 
so 39 million yeah there you are 39 million cubic feet I'd like to thank this video sponsor 
Jane Street whose summer internship program   is currently accepting applications so if 
you're studying at University and you're   considering a job in the financial world or 
doing something with programming then this is   a paid internship where you can work somewhere 
where your mind truly matters if you've enjoyed   solving ridiculous puzzles like the volume of an 
antiprism frustrum you will blend right in at Jan   Street I always enjoy visiting Jane Street and 
I often give a talk when the interns are in so   you may see me no promises but you can apply at 
J street.com internships and you can choose any   of the offices they're in Hong Kong they're in 
London and they're in New York and you know with   the New York office is it's downtown Manhattan 
I genuinely realized we were going to be like a   block that way at the One World Trade Center 
Tower and we could just come here and I can   ask them very nicely if we can come up to their 
balcony and do our filming so a huge thanks as   always to J Street and thanks to Laura Talman 
so it was very kind of it to come along print   all those things at James Madison University 
her JMU experimental mathematics lab has the   3D printers which meant that we could print 
those fantastic models and without those to   be honest I don't think we would have got to 
the bottom of the volume of an anti frustrum   so huge thanks to the gem math lab for making 
that possible and uh finally thanks to me I   mean thanks to evening of unary detail that's the 
show that's why I'm in New York by the time this   video comes out we should have some new dates 
for even necessary detail in the US and we've   always got shows coming up in the UK I will 
link to all the details below and thanks for [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] watching
