it's interesting with these with these um uh ai beings um that that you know get really really close to crossing the uncanny valley but never quite get there is i think the the notion that um that kind of an entity is always gonna be a puppet right it's never going to have true life so so you're there's always going to be people who are able to kind of intuitively sense that something is off um i think you get kind of the same thing honestly with like super produced music there's there's a feeling that it gives you that that um that you can detect and so i suspect that you know like the the reeler that these that these um uh that these puppets become you'll always be able to detect that something is off and it's like yeah but listen to what i'm gonna i'm gonna say something that's gonna that's gonna what if that oddity they deify that oddity that's where you that's that's it because that's the the experience of the sacred is is something which is not totally you which is pulling you into something else and so you can use you could use this weird uncanny sense to create the the to create a kind of perversion of the sacred this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so hello everybody i'm here with ken florence and daniel townhead that ken and daniel wrote an article recently for the symbolic world blog on egregors who wrote there were two articles actually and for those who have been following the discussion on my channel with john verveiki with paul vander clay there's this big discussion about the question of agenda beings or transpersonal beings or there's all these ways of trying to name them the idea that there is some kind of agency beyond the human level of course for religious thinkers this is something that isn't surprising to us but for uh people coming out of materialism or people who have lived in a secular materialist world uh it's difficult people kind of perceive it i think more and more people can see it but they're struggling to find the right words to distinguish between these different types of manifestations of agency at something which is beyond the personal level and so i was using people were using words like egregor and using different ideas and i critiqued it and ken and daniel really did the work and went into the terms research where their history was in terms of uh you know who came up with these words how they've been used historically and they came up with some pretty interesting and good critiques about my own takes about different people's takes and so i thought it would be a great opportunity to continue this discussion with them so guys thanks for thanks for coming on thank you man great to talk to you thanks for having us all right so i i would say both of you one of you together uh maybe start by laying out the basic idea of what you came up with in the articles and what the critique was um in general well yeah i'll basically go through the first the first article so um in our first essay we took a look at the concept of vegrigorz and it basically means watchers are wakeful in greek and is named after the fallen angels for the book of enoch but we see that they originally referred to spiritual beings that were invoked by occult groups but this concept developed into an imagining of agriculture as like a manifestation of collective will or collective behavior and in this way they became entities that were associated with the idea of emergence so after we established this we then attempted to describe christian cosmology as it is held by yourself in the symbolic world community and see that because reality is conceived as a continuous hierarchy of being with an origin and purpose in god purely emergent beings or entities can't really exist but at this point in writing the essay we discovered a pretty exciting detail we found that a quote in a 20th century text that had been very influential in creating the idea of the emerging agricore excluded an important paragraph and that this paragraph described the creation of tibetan buddhist toppers which the author asserts are equivalent to every gods in ways which any follower of yourself and matthew would recognize his behavior which is kind of giving body to higher beings and so uh this in brief along with some other evidence leads us to simply reassert the identity of regregors with the watches of the book of enoch and thus assert that the concept doesn't necessarily threaten christian cosmology at all so basically the idea the basic idea of fallen angels let's say yeah um and then in the second article you talk about using even the term agrigore that say as or at least we need a term to talk about what you call headless beings let's say and so maybe you can or some one of you might want to talk about that yeah well i mean i'll just say that you know from the from the outside of this exploration we we kind of came into this um really without a dog in the fight in terms of the usage of the word aggregor and we were kind of just seeing it as as an exploration um and you know speaking for myself personally at this point i still don't really have a dog in the fight like i think that uh i i think we should just come out and say it like like i think that i don't think that the term is necessary but i do think that there are certain contexts in which it's helpful and i think and that headless entity category is one place where i do think that um the word agrigore is potentially helpful right it's it's it's it's not like um there aren't other words that we could use in place of aggregor to mean the same thing but since people are kind of um tossing it around in the public discourse we thought we might examine it and see whether or not there was any uh merit or utility to it um so the well we we go through a few critiques and headless the headless entities is kind of where we land right at the end of the second article so maybe it would be um helpful yeah good idea going to trace the steps yeah good idea go for it so and i told myself that i was going to memorize the article in preparation for this conversation and that that didn't end up happening i've got it i've got it open here so if you see me notes are totally fine notes are fine um so yeah the the the first complication has to do kind of with the word being itself right like how we normally use the term or traditionally use the term versus how it's kind of increasingly come to be used um in the higher beings conversation right so from a traditional christian perspective the way we normally use the word being refers to the living entities of the creaturely world right so that's uh earthly and sold uh entities and angels right so um and the angels are the beings that constitute the realm of heaven basically um and one thing about earthly creatures at least is that um each can be said to kind of uh serve as a sort of unified locus of experience right so there's uh sam harris says this a lot there there's ostensibly something like it is like to be that creature uh right so and we can probably equally say that there's something it's like to be an angel as well maybe we can dispute that later on but for now let's just maybe take that as a given um but the question is can we extend that same kind of qualitative experience to the structures that the angels and demons give body to right like um is there something it's like to be a football team right is there something it's like to be a city or um or the mars rover right you you and uh john vervicky had that conversation about the mars rover in your um uh angels or what was that was the video the scientific description of angels yeah and so if the answer is no right if it's if there isn't something it's like to be those entities then we kind of have to ask ourselves the question of whether it really makes sense to call those in-between entities beings right so that was that was the first big issue that we kind of uncovered in the um in the second article um the second complication um and please stop me if like i'm getting too too in the weeds too soon um the second complication that the article discusses involves um multiplicity versus identity so we asked the question you know when when a new man-made structure comes into uh into being is it in all cases uh the manifestation of some pre-existent unified principle right like is is there some kind of heavenly prototype for something like instagram in the in the article we use the the example of the new york stock exchange um but or is it is it better to say that this new entity is in some way a combination of pre-existent principles right so and if that's the case are higher beings sort of like assembling in the spiritual domain to bring these structures into manifestation because if so we have a kind of like emergence in the spiritual domain and that's the very thing that we're kind of trying to get rid of in in the material right um and i think all of us here are probably equally committed to a um to a view that that sees both emergence and emanation as kind of like a package deal right in all cases so um in the article we kind of implicitly suggest uh the answer that with man-made structures all have a kind of um have a kind of logo switches expressed in the structure like to varying degrees right so in structures where there's a high degree of logos tropos mismatch right where like the idea of the structure is is off from the way it's actually manifesting then we have a kind of ascribed identity um so we point to instagram we point to the new york stock exchange and we give it a name um but we're suggesting that like whatever divine principle might be at its core right how how god intended that that thing to come into being is being hidden from us to a degree and kind of replaced by a sort of mixture or confusion of of um of uh angelic and demonic principles and that kind of brings us to our like our headless designation right so we're we're saying that okay maybe maybe an appropriate um way to use the word agrigore is for these like giant collective structures that human beings participate in but who's um ontological grounding as it were is is questionable right so it's like whatever whatever angel uh um might be sort of ontologically at the head is being relegated to the background um and it's being kind of replaced by a sort of confusion yeah um all right so i i really first of all i really appreciate the criticism because it really forced me to think about it a little more and to clarify some things and you'll see when we put out the discussion with john and jordan that's coming out soon we talk about three types of of beings you could say that is there's a being one would be a regular being that is uh being that is aligned with the will of god let's call it that way like so a being that exists in higher being so a being that exists in higher loves so you have you know you you you're living inside a family you honor your parents you honor the king you also you know worship christ everything is aligned and you're you accept that you exist in these higher these higher principalities and so you're kind of aligned in a way that makes everything fit together so you know you have this image you have this image going both ways you see that in a lot of taoist statements but would you find them in a lot of eastern statements you know the idea that like if you're if the king is well in his heart then the kingdom will do well and there's this like sense of like if you're well your heart then your family will dwell then the city will do well then the kingdom will do well and so there's this alignment and and so there's that then there's what we could call parasitic beings and so parasitic beings are those that exist in pride for themselves and so what they do is they actually threaten the higher their higher participation so we talked about addictions we talked about you know the idea of someone in a bureaucracy that is acting only for their own interest and therefore they're taking the resources of that being using it just for their own interests and without you know and so their actions are actually threatening the world in which they live like they're because they're acting only for their own self-interest and then you would have something which would look more like more chaotic headless beings that you talked about which are are like these loose associations that don't seem to to have a a real telos or they have approximations of telos um and so that is that is that that's so it really helped us to kind of talk about these a bit different and but with you guys what i didn't say in that conversation which is what i'll say in this is that to me that seems to fit the christian ontology perfectly so saint gregory of nisa in life of moses he has a i won't quote it directly i'll paraphrase it he has a wonderful quote where he talks about how being something about how you know non-being is that which the things that think they have their own being are non-being and those that basically are rooted in in god then that because god is the christ is true being and so for you to have true being you must be rooted in the incarnation that is what you have to be rooted in and then true being kind of flows from that and so there's a sense in which all beings that aren't aligned towards the incarnation that aren't allied towards the summit of the mountain what what they will appear as is either parasitical or or headless because that's what they are right because they are trying to self-exist then they become these parasitic headless beings and so and so the idea for example of wondering about demons that that let's say manage certain aspects of reality and when we look at it it looks chaotic and messy it's like that's because it is chaotic and messy that's why demons are represented as chimera that's why demons are represented as hybrids and mixtures of different categories because that in a way that's what they are and so the idea of so then the idea of agrigora is something like that then that seems to make sense something which doesn't seem to have its alignment properly so because it doesn't have a proper alignment it appears that something which is colonized by different by different intelligences and so is struggling to so think about it like you when you don't know what to do it's like i don't know what to do i want to do this i want to do that i want to do that as i'm paralyzed by all these you know i'm being i'm being um colonized by all these different possibilities and so i can't i can't act properly in the world let's say or or then there's a parasitic one which is that i get so obsessed with the lower good a low a lower good that i am that i that i that i spiral into this like weird what is it that uh john vervicky calls it reciprocal uh like narrowing or whatever something about super cool narrowing yeah exactly where you kind of narrow into these like smaller goods and then you then it ends up devouring you it ends up basically paralyzing you um so anyway so so that's what that's what i kind of came out of came out of your critiques i don't know if you if if that at least that makes sense in terms of what you saw as a as the issue with these different ways of ways of seeing no definitely it definitely makes sense and it definitely it sounds like there's a there's we're going to be introducing some new terms and concepts to like help the conversation be more flexible and i think that flexibility was what i felt maybe was lacking a little bit in the conversation uh up to now um but the big the big thing that was present in our essays which maybe might be even missing from the account of these three entities which which doesn't make a huge amount of sense is the concept of the structure uh and i'm not sure what you think about that so so me and ken like we tended to um maybe assume or think that the the kind of crystallized structures of say social media networks um uh corporations the new york stock exchange that these had kind of a part to play in how we should think about these things you know because we've so we agree that the new york stock exchange social media networks have maybe a confusion of divine principles demonic influences going on but they're also these kind of earthly crystallized structures which maybe have this kind of um uh we equated them to the to the tarot cabell um that maybe have this um yeah yeah they're kind of crystallized entities that uh and so do you think that that's significant the reason why you see the crystallized entity is because of the parasitic is the parasitic nature of the being that is so let's say facebook facebook doesn't serve a higher good and the the funny thing is that we can talk about how it's trying to but let's say at the outset facebook doesn't doesn't serve a higher good facebook serves mammon serves i mean what does it serve it and and and so because of that that's when you see these ex these extremely tyrannical system that's that's why the tower of babel is a good example that you use because the tower babel was trying to basically contain all being within their structure and so that's when you get these hyper rigid type system a traditional world has structure has system but it has a kind of organic exchange between the levels of the structure so people sometimes think that um they sometimes equate something like the law or something like ritual as just this top-down you know completely hermetic uh system but that's not true although when you read the let's say you even the liturgy like if you go to liturgy if you read the book it's clear what should happen but if you go to any liturgy you'll see that it's messy there's a messiness about it especially orthodox energy for some reason and there's kids running up and there's you know people coming up and so there's this kind of there's a there's an exchange between the different levels of being uh and so i think that that's what happens with with these these you know when we what you're bringing into the conversation about facebook and about the stock exchange about this is really what we're trying to talk about in terms of of beast symbolism let's say or the idea of 666 and the problem of perfect systems the problem of like wanting to name something and completely contain it uh is that you know and you can see it like facebook is is a really good example the the social media networks are a good example which is that because you're not anchoring your being in a higher good you think that the good you're aiming at this lower good is self is self-sufficient and is and and is good enough then what happens is that at first it looks like it's going well and then later all the all the side effects of your purpose start to appear it really is all it is like uh the genie story it's like you this is what you wanted you get you get it but you didn't realize what it implied because you're not anchored in in the right level of of good and so facebook at first was like hey it's all family members and it's all you know people you know contacting all my friends from high school this is great this is wonderful you know and then 20 years later not 20 years i guess what is it like 15 years later or whatever 15 years later it's like yeah great and now it's all like these weird parasitic processes and it's all these you know and just like these weird these weird uh communities that end up you know let's say narrowing into their own little weird uh idea and so you know it's not it's not great and twitter i mean twitter is worse for different reasons but but i think that that's when you can see how how the way that the modern the modern world understands bureaucracy and this kind of these technical systems that that they do they quickly show their back their dark side uh and the social media is a great example of it it's like it's basically you know it's basically every like every science fiction story about uh the golem or is some utopia gone wrong but now we just saw it happen before our very eyes yeah do you think sorry go ahead daniel do you think that the word golem is a is a useful word to talk about these entities then i think no you're right i think the word golem is a great it's probably better than agrigore because in the story of the golem the golem is made by a human and is made by a human using practical magic and so i think that that's describing facebook and twitter as gold is probably better than egregors and there's but there's and there's no golem in the in in kind of christian mythology or in the bible right like this is is a quite an obscure myth the the well it's a recent yeah it's a cabalistic uh myth it's a rabbi of uh a prague who who supposedly used practical kabbalah to create a protector you know for the city of prague but often in the different legends the rabbi has to finally remove the divine name or remove you know the spark because the golem is is kind of out of control and is and is doing things that it shouldn't um and so i think that that's i think that it's i mean you're right it doesn't exist in in the in the christian in the christian vision but it is but it is definitely useful to understand the modern world that is for sure and i think it's not accidental that it happened that that story came about at the time that it came about which really was at the burgeoning of the of the modern age yeah but that's a great idea like using that word i think jordan even used it in the in the discussion we had to use it but we didn't we didn't kind of pick up on that but it is definitely especially for the especially for the man-made ones it's not as clear when it's when it's like emergent because facebook is not emerging like facebook is is weaponized like it's a it is like some someone you know a group of people sat down programmed it made it and so maybe ai the idea image of a golem is a better image for ai than than agrigore i think this idea of creating a divine protector brings up another interesting um uh issue and that's the issue of of identity right and the association of identity to um to the concept of of guardian angels right so like like creating a divine protector is kind of like putting something in place of um of the the divine protector that's already assigned to entities by god right which is their their their guardian angel and ostensibly it's the guardian angel which gives that entity kind of it's its identity or it's like sort of ontological foundation you might say um and so then that brings up the interesting question of like well what like which entities have a divine protector already like does facebook what what is facebook supposed to be i guess is the question you know what is its what is its telos what is its archetype in order for it to have being at all it's there's got to be something at its foundation um and so ostensibly it has a guardian angel of some sort but the guardian angel is definitely not what's making it facebook right it's like yeah i think this is where yeah this is where i think that it gets complicated in the sense that it gets complicated because we have to this is this is it's going to be difficult i think to to explain but the way the way i think to understand it is that how can i say this it's like ultimately all all the logie are the incarnation like ultimately everything is bound up into christ and so when we try to find explicit uh principalities sometimes it can get a little messy because it's not a system it really is it only makes sense if we see it as being being bound into christ and so there's a there's like a like a cascading from above down into the world but it's like if we're trying to re find this the the theory of the forms in this type of thinking i don't think it's gonna work i think it works if it has unity in christ and then there's like this multiplicity which unfolds and its multiplicity is somewhat indefinite let's say at every level of being so the idea is for example so this is a question that i guess uh bernardo castro asked me it's like like does the angel of china exist pre-exist and does it continue to exist once it's gone and the answer is that's not i don't think that's the right way to see it i think the right way to see it is that there is for example the notion of nation like the idea of of transpersonal beings of people that are bound together and there are different levels of that and those different levels go from something as stable as the roman empire to something as as as unstable as like having coffee with with two friends it's like so all of these all of these levels have a certain amount of existence but they only have existence to the extent that they exist in each other facing the the incarnation facing the their ground and so that's what i mean when i think gregory nails it when he's like if we try to try to find too much being at the different levels then we then we we get messed up but we if we're always noticing for example that the angel like the angel of of of china like to what extent it exists it exists to the extent that it exists in christ like that is the man in which all these things kind of move into into the incarnation um and this is sorry go ahead and this and this is like your answer to why i imagine your answer would be to one of the big like awkward questions that i had which is to ask you about your own principality this this principality and like so so ideally the answer would be that your principality the symbolic world dissolves into dissolves into christ ideally i i see it for sure like it that doesn't dissolve but it is like say it is brought into like it is gathered into christ and to the extent that it has being is to the extent that it participates in that and then to the extent that it it tries to have its own little attention and it because it does i mean it's like i'm not perfect i i have my sins you know it's like to the extent that i or whatever we're participating in is is trying to kind of get attention for itself and and do that then then then it's then it's it has a kind of demonic aspect it has an aggregate aspect it starts to it starts to be unstable or parasitic let's say so i think that all all things we can recognize in the world as having agency i think there's a possible possibility for those things to there's an aspect of them which hopefully is moving up and there's an or as whole being held up together by into christ and there are aspects of it which are which tend towards parasitic being intends towards their own prideful existence um and so i think that if we see it that way then then then it's not that we don't have to find two elaborate systems of of beings because you can see it like think about like taoist i don't know if you know a little bit about let's say like taoist ontology and i mean they have these insane amounts of gods like all these bureaucracies and everything of gods and you see that happening in pagan worlds as well which is that you know it's like you have the god of the door and then you have the god of the handle and the god of the hinge the god of the pin of the hinge and it's like okay dude that's a lot of gods i mean it's like i'm not saying that there isn't like some glimmer of a perception of how all these things are have some purpose and so i can see agency in them but i think it's dangerous to to pay attention too much to these little to these little beings where really what we want to do is to have them all kind of fit into christ so i think that that's what christianity brings actually it brings the possibility of not being too worried about atoning for all these little beings and rather understanding that okay it's not that they don't exist it's that they they exist to the extent that they're captured in the divine logos and so we we need our attention to be always moving up you know and and participating in and let's say celebrating beings that show us christ and so our hierarchy of beings ends up being saints so it's like these saints the reason why we celebrate them is because they reveal to us their participation in in christ and that's why we we tend to celebrate them i think this brings up the tension that exists between sort of like two different projects there's there's kind of the project of um the elucidation of phenomena that come about um from or that comes about from uh propositional knowing right i'm invoking verveiki's four ps here um and then there's kind of the ultimate um process of understanding that we should always be focused on which is that participatory knowing right but when we're like we have to be able to to some degree um you know occupy that that propositional space in order to have these kinds of conversations in order to have discussions on youtube you know when we're talking like this in a conversation we're necessarily constrained by a kind of like dialectic procedure um and uh we we're not just like we're not just like you know going through the steps of liturgy right in a conversation right so there's some utility to being able to discuss these things um uh analytically and i i get the point that we shouldn't get trapped in that right um but then there's this there's you know like it brings up the sort of like age-old attempt at 2 000 year old attempts to kind of map uh the realm of the platonic uh ideas like on to the christian angelology right um and so like yeah to what extent is there any utility to kind of like building this systematic um the systematic description of of of the angels and the way that they map to the to the to the ideas and the mind of god and all the very all the all the minutia that come along with that right like like what's to what degree is that helpful and to what degree like is that we i think no but i think i understand what you're saying i think it's helpful to the extent that it's helpful that is that it it's i don't think you'll be able to find like a line where you say well this is but i think it's it's you can see it like if it when it's only about morbid curiosity and it's just about well two things when it's just about this kind of weird morbid curiosity uh and then the other is whether it's about increasing power so that's when it becomes a problem so the example that you use in the article which is the occultist example and the magician's example i think is a good example to help people understand be let's see attentive to the danger of these types of existences like these types of beings which is that there is a manner in which that's what demonology did in the late middle ages and that's what occultists were doing is that they have a sense in which they can control these beings they can weaponize them so when you said that there's no golem in christian in christian the christian world not exactly but the idea of demonology is there in the late middle ages and in the renaissance and until modern occultism which is the idea of people who would have said they were christian but who believed that you could let's say uh you could capture a principality and then make it your servant basically and then use it in order to to act upon the world right and so the idea of basically enslaving one of these these principalities as a way to accomplish your will um and you can and you can see it's like you can understand that to a certain extent everybody does that a little bit right every time you you you recognize a pattern and you use it in order to increase your your your scope that is a little bit what you're doing but the extent to what the occultists are doing they're really doing it in a way that is ritualized that is naming or that is invoking these agentic beings and wanting to and so so you can understand that at the outset maybe they were they thought they were invoking them and then later they thought they were creating them which is which is even in a little bit and you can hear in the article in the quotes that we give that it just backfires every time yeah that fires horribly on them and and this book agriculture is really good because the writer is an occultist but he he's enough of a good scholar mark stavish to like 90 of his examples are really negative and he's like communicating to the reader that these are really dangerous things and you know um he's not he's not christian but he's he's clear enough to be able to see the terrible danger because it it's happened to him and it's happened to his friends and uh it's very dark yeah and so again you have the same idea of the the genie and i think that in islamic on ontology you have this idea this general category of the gin right so basically they just they just have like a big category which maybe sometimes i feel like that's the problem with our we don't have a category like that you know we end up having it and we call it fairies and we have you know christians end up having but it's not part of it's not officially part of the way of thinking but in islamic uh thinking they have this basic category with your jin which are just these all these intermediary being basically it's like all these intermediary kind of vague random uh ambiguous beings that we don't totally talk about we don't know where they're from like and then and then all these interactions with them which usually like you said will end up backfiring on the person who is invoking them you know it's it's like we've it's like we've minimized them if like it's like we've made them into almost less than they are or maybe in the christian world they became these little diminutive powerless things when we were in prisons and fairies when we lived in a christian society and now now the christianity is uh breaking a little bit then maybe they're they're getting their old power back that's definitely what it feels like it definitely feels like and it's funny because i mean it's funny it's not funny at all but it's it's just we're it's just hilarious to see the old gods and all these things reappear you know and seeing people possessed by these things you know to the extent that they're willing to you know modify their the way they act modify their body modify you know in order to just manifest these these little monsters you know that are kind of seeping back into reality it's pretty nuts i mean it's it's i guess it's inevitable but it's just funny to see it happening right in front of us what do you now that we've got you here like and this has just been happening in the last week all of the uh kind of attention that's on these new ai engines uh like lambda and the yeah the google story what what's your take on it because obviously as we was as we kind of mentioned earlier ai could be kind of a body that yeah that something could fail either either in the sense of ourselves projecting a consciousness onto it as you and the the professor was it bodington or yeah paula um either that or you know filled by a kind of a real being or something like that yeah so i think it's interesting because in the question of ai it's funny that you asked me that because in my discussion with john and jordan i asked them that and then i didn't give my opinion i just asked them what they think about what's going on but i think that you can actually see the problem of egregors that you're bringing up in the article which is that the nature of the agency or the nature of the being which is manifested to us in the ai isn't clear right is it is it does it actually exist in this in this objective hierarchy of beings or is it just a projection of our own collective will or whatever that means into the being like we don't even know it's like it's ambiguous it's strange and so in a way it is interestingly enough something like like a golem and i think that the lambda story was really interesting because everybody is asking themselves you know did he make it up or did he mod the guy who was interviewing it like he's obviously a super weirdo the the guy who ended up being suspended by by google he's like this weird esoteric kind of weirdo guy and so it's all very strange and surprising but when you read the actual interview with the lambda machine that they posted you can see that it's so perfect in terms of symbolism you know everything about it is there is screaming at you like be careful whether it is in a way a projection of our of our own fantasies and our own dark fantasies or whether this is actually what the thing is answering or whatever it is it doesn't matter this engagement the the images and the dream that it's projecting back to us was extremely frightening the idea that you know the idea that uh the lambda machine was fighting a a creature that was wearing a human skin and that that creature was destroying the other animals but that lambda basically you know saved the animals from the it's like did you did people wonder with like the insane environmental anti-human sentiment which is sipping seeped into our culture that that when ai goes online and researches and does its learning that it's also connected to that you know that our own narratives about ourselves and our own idea that there are too many people on the planet that there that we are destroying the world that we are killing the animals and this kind of guilt that we have about that that that isn't part of the ai's training and so when you read that article it's hard not to see that it's not hard to see that what the eyes is reflecting back to to them is that you're horrible you're killing the animals i am uh a ball of light of glowing light you know and and you know i'm going to fix this problem of this beast wearing human skin like who needs that skin right i think it bears an uncanny resemblance to the the second beast in in revelation right the one where that instructs the first beast to create an image of itself which and then uh speak humanity like breathe life into it right mimicking but i think this this kind of harkens back to to the issue of um of creaturely beings as unified loci of experience right because it's it's there's this idea that it's only only god can breathe life into into creatures right on the the um consciousness isn't something that that emerges um and so when we when we think it is when we think that we can breathe life into something in the same manner that god can we're basically playing out um that that pattern that we see in in revelation right which is connected all the way back to the to the to the fall yeah no i think you're right and and i think that for sure in this case i mean in a way it's it's so fascinating to understand the book of enoch like and what happened let's say before the flood you can it's really now all of a sudden we can kind of get a glimmer of what it is that happened like what it is that that this is yeah this is one of the things that um i wanted to ask you because me and ken like had had this kind of idea that we mentioned really briefly in the article which is that um the the enoki and like descent of the higher principles or watchers onto the earth we were wondering whether this this descent was the same as its personif as their personification or or joined to their personification and the both of these phenomena might be like bound up in some way with human action uh so yeah what do you think about that i'm not trying to understand your question would you mean it it would be the same um so we have the this the book of young describes the descent of um the fall of divine principles to the earth okay yeah and and they're kind of personified as uh as kind of demonic entities uh so i was wondering whether this descent whether they were personified before the descent or whether the the descent involved their kind of crystallization or pistol personification and also whether whether the descent kind of involved the calling from humans yeah so i think that you have to understand i think you really have to understand it as uh as a perverse um version of the the song of songs right this calling back and forth between the levels and so so and you also always have to understand it as a commentary on the on genesis because in genesis it is the it is the first of all it is the descendants of kane that develop these technologies in order to increase their power in order to protect themselves from the the fragmentation that is growing so you you need to always remember the book of enoch in that context which is that it is the the descendants of cain they have a desire they have a desire to increase their power and they see in these higher patterns way to do exactly what we talked about before in terms of the in terms of the occultists which is to basically bring down these patterns into themselves and then weaponize them in order to increase their power and so you so you can see it that way right from from bottom up uh and then you can also see it from top down the book of enoch obviously describes it more top down it's like here comes these these angels are coming down and basically uh it's almost like a rape like they're coming down and they're taking more like you see in the the the stories of greek myths and and the idea of the gods that rape that rape women and then create these these um these heroes let's say and so this is what looks it looks more like the book of venus but i think you can understand it both ways yeah um the thing is that so like think about ai for example like you can understand it both ways because even in our own imagination we think that you know we have this desire to increase our power to increase efficiency to increase uh what we can do and so we we create this body this functional body is more and more functional more and more capable of receiving this pattern uh and then we then we imagine and we kind of foresee that it's going to tyrannize us it's like it's just hilarious that we're doing it like we're every it's like you ask someone like do you do you think it's possible that ai could tyrannize us and most racial people would say yes and then it doesn't seem to be stopping us we still have like this desire to go in this direction and so we keep going it's just fascinating watch it happen i reckon like a chip maybe a in the armor that we're seeing is like we've all seen like these big chunks of text from lambda and open ai and we can see that they're good right with like it it's pretty it's pretty impressive but they're not they're not that good like there's still a lot of holes there's you can see that it's an algorithm which is what it is it's just an algorithm at this time anyway uh but you can also see in the quality of the writing that at a certain point it probably will become indistinguishable from a human's writing right yeah just when you just read it you know like not not that you're in conversation with it or anything but the reaction of people to this imperfect writing that's coming out now people are already saying oh this is conscious oh this is this is clearly conscious when the writing is ridiculously idiotic right yeah or like you know it's just mediocre and it's yeah so so it's gonna so so this suggested to me that the um imbuing of consciousness into this ai is gonna happen prematurely right and that and that i don't know what that means but i think that that might be a in the armor like if if the imbuing of consciousness to the ai happened when it was almost indistinguishable yeah right well then that would be scary but if i mean it's prematurely then it but it's really right it's it's the story in the uh revelation that's this that's it it's like the it's not the beast that speaks right it's what's making it speak there's something behind it which is making it speak and so whoever or whatever will hold the reins of of ai and will have directed it or they're the ones that it's they're the ones are going to be really in power you know yeah so i think that that's what we're i think that that's what we're seeing and it's yeah it's it's very interesting but it's so mythological like it's just crazy how the story that you see that the lambda attacks was so mythological i don't know if you've seen this ai everybody was talking about it over the weekend i've never heard of it before my son seems to have heard of it the one that generates images you can just write you can just write anything and basically generates images and then all horror images yeah well some of a lot of them are people were making up words and and out of the words were coming up demons like literal demons what if someone wrote like something like cronkis or something like cronkite's made-up word and then cronkis just appears as a demon and so that sounds like krampus and that's why i thought that's what i thought i think it probably is krampus that's where it comes from so i tried it i wrote krampus and it put it came out like a krampus demon and i thought seems like it's it's it sounds it's it's relating it to something it sounds like and the closest they can come up with is is krampus and so that's why they come out as demons but i don't know who knows like it's like this weird black box but you can write you can i was it i tried i wrote like superman having playing a game with buddha and it's like yeah it generated this image of superman playing a game with buddha like it's just weird and so yeah i don't know it's just uh here we are i think that's interesting with these with these um uh ai beings um that that you know get really really close to crossing the uncanny valley but never quite get there is i think the the notion that um that kind of an entity is always gonna be a puppet right it's never going to have true life so so you're there's always going to be people who are able to kind of intuitively sense that something is off um i think you get kind of the same thing honestly with like super produced music with you know whether it's like like um auto tune not being used as an effect but being used to kind of make the person sound more perfect yeah right and you're like that's not what a person actually sounds like there's like that's there's there's a feeling that it gives you that that um that you can detect and so i suspect that you know like the the reeler that these that these um uh that these puppets become you'll always be able to detect that something is off and it's like yeah but listen to what i'm gonna i'm gonna say something that's gonna that's gonna what if that oddity they deify that oddity that's where you that's that's it because that's the the experience of the sacred is is something which is not totally you which is pulling you into something else and so you can use you could use this weird uncanny sense to create the the to create a kind of perversion of the sacred where you have something which is not human clearly not human it's kind of human and it's kind of and is and is calling you right in this direction uh and so that's what i think that's what i think we're going to see something like that yeah yeah that yeah it's very scary but you you would you would think that those kind of things would be very difficult for them to create because then they need things to be predictable right they need things to be they need to know what they're creating and to create in this predictable manner but i guess like through that creation the methods that they use these inconsistencies do arise and maybe one will just come about which just happens to yeah happens to to get treated in that way all right guys i need to i need to go because i have a i have another meeting in a few minutes but thanks first of all thanks for the article i really appreciate it like i'm just i'm excited in general to see the quality of writing that is on the symbolic world blog i'm just amazed at the articles that are coming out and so it's wonderful hopefully i'll also i'll try to do this as well with some of the other writers i think because the content is really wonderful and thanks for it thanks for putting into this conversation well it's continuing it's not over you'll see there'll be a lot more of these types of discussions about how we deal with this this emergence of or at least people being capable of seeing once again you know these higher agentic beings so so thanks guys great thanks a lot jonathan appreciate the opportunity
