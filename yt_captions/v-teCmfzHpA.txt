what makes millionaires go insane this man might have the answer youtuber noelle miller much more popular than me that's totally not why i'm clickbaiting him in this video he just came out with a theory called the millionaire anamorph theory which i'm dying to talk about ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking about science we're talking about important theories and we're talking more most importantly perhaps about millionaires flexing here's why i'm talking about it okay i feel like i'm sort of an england bus driver like those uk bus tour drivers with like and that's the big bit that's the crazy thing over there that's this i do that with internet marketers online i'm like hey look at what that guy's doing hey look at what that idiot is doing but i'm just kind of a man of the the people i don't have a great way of like scientifically categorizing these guys i just want as many people to gawk and laugh at these people as i can because i think it's funny i think it's amusing i think these people are worth calling out but noelle miller comes in here like uh copernicus and revolutionizes my idea of how to think about millionaires let's watch a little bit shall we so i went down a rabbit hole of these self-made millionaire guru personal finance people and i kind of have now in my mind this sort of anamorph evolution of the millionaire first of all great science being done right here but you see what i mean like i look at these guys and i just laugh i just think they're just uh each one is their own unique special psychopath their special snowflake sociopath he though he just starts out he sees this world he immediately categorizes and i love that i love that we're going to talk about it because i think he gets a ton right i think there are a few things we could add to it and uh let's see what you think do you think the millionaire anamorph hypothesis is correct we're going to talk about it i think it's pretty interesting because a couple years ago i feel the internet concept of a millionaire were dudes like grant cardone and tai lopez you know guys with maseratis ferraris and big houses by the way i love the idea that the internet's idea of a millionaire is people flexing on you um isn't that sad that that's our state of affairs all the millionaires we know are just people flexing their wealth but his hypothesis is basically that the money changes you slowly blah blah blah and they have their own place in the anamorph scale but there are steps before that that i feel have only been recently revealed to us i find the first stage of millionaire is the humble millionaire the balding hasn't begun yet they have these videos like i sold everything and you know i only work off of a piece of wood that i took from a yard sale yikes i'm getting some uh graham stefan vibes here this is the beginning stage of the animals now i don't know if i agree with this i think there's another stage and i think this might be the first place that the peer review and i think that's what we have to do here listen all great scientific ideas have to go through peer review why not us to peer review this most glorious of uh hypotheses so i think that this first part is the most incorrect of the entire thing which is i think it's a great idea the millionaire anamorph thing i think it's actually the marketer anamorph which is what's actually going on because there's tons of like pretty normal millionaires who just never talk about it but because of that you never see them talking about it so they they're never included in the theory because you never see them i think what you're actually seeing is internet marketers have realized this new grift of pretending to be rich and then eventually you become rich so the real first stage of the anamorph in my opinion are children who have realized that they need to pretend to be rich got a text there so something like this might be the first stage how i map 100k per month at 16. this is sort of the first step right but basically the rest of this theory i agree with but as they continue to make more money and they start to see that they have a formula that works then they evolve and they become the youtube pre-roll guy [Laughter] wait stop the humble millionaire the pre-roll millionaire the space in between and then i'm actually a millionaire yeah so i only disagree with that agree with this agree with this and this is really where i think things get really out of touch i mean you're really you've lost the plot you think everybody on earth can become millionaires and you want them to spend their last thousand dollars on you i don't know what the number is but somewhere you turn into this dan pena he apparently has made a trillion dollars he calls himself the trillion dollar man and uh you know he's got a sales program that teaches you how to make millions of dollars dan i feel represents that sort of off the deep end rich this is why you're [ __ ] poor okay uh yeah i have to agree okay at some point you go off the deep end for sure but i think the key distinction here that i want to make in this theory is that a lot of these people have always been delusional and i don't think it necessarily has to do with uh making so much money as it does with they want to stand out right so like i said i want to tweak this hypothesis to be the marketer anamorph hypothesis which is they start out they're innocent they're like hey i want to make you you know a thousand bucks extra a month ten thousand dollars then you become the pre-roll guy and eventually when you start making real money at the top you realize the more i can promise the more i can position myself as like this amazing guy the more money i'll make so in a world with so much competition of these millionaires yelling at you you kind of find that to go to the top you have to be the most outrageous the most insane the most pathological i mean grant cardone talks about the fact that he faked his own bankruptcy for views the rumors of my bankruptcy that is soon to happen yes it's true okay i'm losing the plane the condo pick it all up guys this i think is the puzzle piece that could maybe put our anamorph story together why these guys seem to go kind of psychotic on their way to the top let's check it out guys guys uh look it's very very difficult to get any attention right now any attention at all because of what wuhan china virus coronavirus recession contraction airline industry people dying uh worldwide pandemics it's hard nobody wants to listen to 10 acts how do you get attention how do you get attention in an environment that that is that noisy guess what you have to get real noisy you got to have an imagination you got to start thinking about crisis if like faking your bankruptcy like that kind of crisis uh because that's what this guy did he kind of faked his bankruptcy which is hilarious because you know he's got like a whole grant cardone capital whatever so he's got like investors and he's like yeah i had to goof on you guys and make it seem like you may have lost all your money oops this is the way the marketing game plays there it is folks this is the way the marketing game plays this is a shell of his former self let me tell you that look at his face i mean has he had worked on cheese that is rough this is cardona's worse honestly the pandemic had really hit at this point this is april i think he's doing better now but uh this was a tough time for him and he decided to lay all his cards on the table you got to drop bad news to get anybody to pay attention to you i mean crazy news like it needs to include like murders uh bankruptcies failings uh people getting hurt murders but i can't believe how many of you out there that know me have been in our offices that are investors with me i can't believe how many of you out there went for it you guys understand how insane this is this like is like a guy saying publicly you got like a a company right you got people invested in you you say publicly without warning you go on instagram live and you go i'm going bankrupt i'm going bankrupt and when people freak out you go i'm kidding i'm kidding you didn't know i can't believe you got you idiots actually believe me when i said that how stupid can you be this is the kind of marketing um kind of craziness that goes on you become psychotic when you're in this world long enough that you kind of become a little crazy to get to the top that's just what it takes so when i reflect on this video with noah miller where he's talking about the anamorph i agree with so much of this which is you kind of go a little nuts when you're in this world but i think it's not for the reason that like money just makes you crazy in of itself i think there's a lot of normal people out there with uh you know that are doing well off this guy's probably one of them i think he makes a pretty good living but it's when you're trying to market yourself as this that you just constantly have to raise the bar after all it's no surprise that this is the the climax of this guy's video he's getting exactly what he wants dan pena i mean he's getting uh advertising sort of free advertising because he's crazy he's pitching himself as this like crazy old man he's not really the trillion dollar man but he calls himself that because he wants to be at the top so that's how the game is played and i think you know what i think this is a workable scientific theory i don't know what you guys think if we're gonna be awarded for any kind of uh nobel peace prize maybe the noel peace prize or the noble i don't know i think we should be he should be i'm trying to ride the coattails here but uh anyways let me know what you guys think you agree with this theory do you not do you think the humble millionaires are part of the problem do you think that the flexing is part of the problem let me know in the comments below thanks for watching guys see you in the next this ain't what it one nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
