we are live we are live do that again we are live hey everyone I am so excited today to talk to you about the jobs of the future that don't exist yet okay well well some of them do exist Tiff okay fine she's right yeah they do exist to varying degrees but some jobs of the future that aren't necessarily the most in demand today but will be in the very near future you know us we are futurists Q go was lighting up here we love to do different things learn about new technology and see what's coming up because as you and I both know while Tech is moving I will be very in demand what she said again all right let's get into [Music] it all right let's just jump right into it the first one being Quantum cryptographer and this is something that is my as the young kids say my Roman Empire I think about this all the time and here's why it's so cool maybe you have or maybe you haven't heard heard about the possibility of quantum Computing being able to break encryption and what does this mean why is this possible first of all one of the most important Quantum Computing algorithm is called Shores algorithm and here is why it could potentially break encryption it would allow for a large quantum computer to essentially break well all encryption systems that are currently used to secure internet traffic against interception well let's first talk about current encryption systems so when you think of how they currently work many modern encryption systems such as RSA they rely on difficulty of factoring large numbers I mean you've seen what encryption looks like now with Quantum Computing if you give it enough power it is continuously able to solve problems especially with the right algorithms Shores algorithm at a rapid pace and modern computers nowadays can't do that but with Quantum Computing encryption the possibility of potentially breaking encryption becomes very real now of course they have different systems in place to prevent this but Quantum Computing cryptographer will become a role that that is essential in the tech industry so what are some courses you can take today how can you prepare for this role if you are interested in Quantum Computing well here are a few courses that you should really look into the first one being around Quantum cryptography by edex or Sorry by the California Institute of Technology the second one being corsera we love corsera over here there are so many Great Courses and one of them for Quantum Computing and cryptography is applied cryptography specialization and this course I haven't taken either of these courses but they have great review and I'll link them down below the second one is AI ethics officer and this role well just like all the ones we'll speak about today somewhat exists you know in different formats it might not be as in demand per se as it will be in the future but it's definitely getting there with AI continuing to evolve and grow at such a rapid Pace we will need people actual well humans I don't know why I put my arms down for that humans to be in place for these roles these are the individuals that have a background with ethics philosophy Psy pschology Etc so how do you prepare for a role around ethics what does that even look can you study that there are a few courses that will help level you up your skills when it comes to Ai and ethics now the first one is by corsera I know another corsera one and that is ethics in Ai and big data so this is a great course if you have a background in AI but even if you don't it's a great starting course for you another one that is really great to look into is called secure and private AI course and this is by Udacity Udacity is a lot of Great Courses as well and the other thing about Udacity is they offer really good certifications so if you are someone who really wants to get that certification this is a good bet all right coming at number three this one I think would be my current dream job and I feel like I always have a different dream job that's the beauty of it because we live in a time where we can always be changing and iterating this is extended reality architect so you can think of this role as someone who has programming skills storyboarding or storytelling skills uiux skills it's really a mish mash of skills now the really cool thing is we will see more roles in the future that have a combination of different skill sets especially because of ai ai makes it so much easier now for people to start programming within their current roles even if they don't come from a programming background now I'm not talking they can be a software developer overnight but have the skill set required if some programming is necessary now back to Extended reality though what does this look like so this could be a mixture of AR VR mixed reality and what this architect is in control of or in charge of this could be from designing the immersive experiences building it having user testing around it as to what it looks like but this is from beginning to end architect you can think of it like our traditional architect we think of as someone who is building buildings or uh architecting them anyways from beginning to end understanding the process but from a mixed reality or extended reality perspective now how do you get into this field it's very interesting but it seems like there's not a ton of information there well good thing is there actually is a lot here are some courses around it there's one from porer one from Udacity and one from Unity these three courses here are great options if you are looking to expand into the extended expand into extended expand into the extended reality world and by the way I'm linking all these courses down below all right coming at number four is with the technology well this role in itself already exists but we are seeing a huge incline in the demand for this role this is blockchain ecosystem manager and it's kind of an interesting term what does it refer to well you can think of a blockchain ecosystem manager is someone who really well I was going to say manages the whole ecosystem let's go deeper than that though you can think of this role as someone who manages from beginning to end the blockchain ecosystem so they really take a step back and look at creating and executing strategies to Foster the growth and Adoption of the blockchain ecosystem so this includes identifying key stakeholders partners and users not to mention defining value proposition and in incentive structures for partners so there's a lot to it now here's the really interesting thing about this role aside from technical knowledge no you don't need to be a coder for this role per se but aside from understanding the technology depending on how the blockchain is being used so in the situation of health care or education you should have somewhat of a background in that and that's a really cool part about this role is like many of these roles we are talking about if you are coming from a different industry or a different background or expertise you are going to be so like Beyond in demand in these Tech industries that I'm speaking about well tech industry sub areas within them because right now what we have is so many individuals within Tech that are specialized in Tech which is great and will continue to be in demand but what we really need are individuals who come from other backgrounds other Industries to come into the tech industry and share their knowledge and expertise especially as Tech becomes touching every asset every facet of our asset facet you know what I'm saying every part of our life oh I almost didn't do courses courses for this role here's one by course Sarah edex and one by MIT once again link them down below okay in my opinion I definitely saved last for best and within this one there's something really interesting that Apple patented which really promotes or really reinsures how this area is going to continue growing it kind of gives a little bit of hints as to where the tech is moving and this role is neurotech interface designer it sounds pretty crazy but when you start thinking about all the big tech companies we'll get to Apple in a second here that are starting to patent different neurotech neuro why can't I say neurot I'm always thinking of like the Egyptian when they are starting to think of different patented interfaces it gets really interesting now here's what Apple did they recently patented a Next Generation airpod sensor system so how would this work well for one it would still be external it's not going you know in inside of your ear or brain or anything like that so it goes on to say that the patent describes multiple approaches to optimize signal quality for individual users incorporating up to 22 electrodes on a single earpiece so be so cool imagine you have this earpiece and it's you know either in your ear or around your head wherever it is and you can communicate with what music you want to play who you want to call all from your brain you don't need to interact with your phone anymore it's a wild thought but listen if you would have told me a few years ago we'd be where we're at with AI and everything else going on I probably wouldn't have believed you so it definitely seems like well it is something they're working on and it is a role of the future now here are some courses if you are interested in this role I think it's fascinating and it's one of those things that you don't necessarily have to have a background in just be interested in exploring it now here's the thing maybe you're not interested in any of these roles and that's cool too there the reality is there are so many roles of the future that don't necessarily exist today that will the important thing though and I think I say this in so many of my videos is being open continuing to learn and also just staying curious understanding that we don't know it all and that's a good thing in the sense that Tech is continuing to evolve we as humans are continuing to evolve based on the skill sets we're doing what we are focusing on and even if you're watching this video you're like yeah none of these roles really entice me having an understanding as to what is possible what some big tech companies are working on that we went through today is so valuable and so important all right I was going to say I'm going to go get coffee but I feel like I've had enough coffee today thank you all for watching make sure to hit that subscribe button and leave in the
