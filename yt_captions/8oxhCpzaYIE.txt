most people who want to become programmers take ages to learn the code actually no most people who want to become programmers never end up actually learning the code at all because they just end up quitting but in all honesty I don't blame you if you feel like you're overwhelmed if you feel like you can't do it because learning to code is a very overwhelming process and it's not a surprise that most people don't make it but I did make it so what if I told you that there are three Secrets like three keys that if you just have these three things then you are very very likely to actually succeed and whenever I speak to or coach people that end up quitting and failing it always seems to be that they're missing at least one of these same things but before I tell you what they are how to implement them and why the tech industry doesn't really want you to be aware of these things I want to tell you a story before we get into that though if you're enjoying this content you're serious about learning to code and making money with it I think you would really enjoy my free newsletter internet made Club every week I send you more research and detailed emails about the world of tech learning to code business and whatever I'm curious about as well as you get access to special discounts on my products that I don't always advertise here on YouTube and for signing up you get access to all my free notion templates which include for example this free online computer science template that a lot of you have really been loving we've just passed 10,000 members recently and you guys seem to be really enjoying it so check it out it's free and you can always unsubscribe at any time if you want now back to the video imagine you're taken hostage by a gang of evil hackers and you're thrown in a small closet all on your own and this closet is like full of cockroaches it's dark it's cold it's really a nasty place to be and the only food they give you is 200 calories worth of plain rice every single day but what this evil gang of hackers gives you is one Lifeline okay bro listen up the reason we have kidnapped you is because we need more members to join our hacker gang and unfortunately we had to lay off our previous employee and by lay off I mean throw him out of the window so here's a laptop and what we need you to do is learn to code in one month so that you can join our slave force and learning the code is the only way for you to escape this closet otherwise you will stay there for the full month with Justice rise so in this situation what would you do would you sit there complaining that you don't know which language to start with would you waste ages choosing which course to pick or would you simply do whatever it takes to Simply figure out what needs to be done because that is the only choice that you have actually I'm okay like I'm sort of trying to lose some body fat anyway so like I could be here for a month reckon I'd lose quite a bit of fat I mean you can just use chbt right like AI is pretty much going to replace what I do as a junior programmer anyway what are you doing dude it's just for the video like you weren't supposed to say that I mean of course like I have to learn to code now because it's the only way for me to get out of here yeah let's go and this right here is pretty much the first thing that almost every successful programmer hat they have this fire under their ass that absolutely forces them to figure out how to do it and no I'm not talking about like actually being kidnapped by a gang of evil hackers or something like that I'm talking about having some like really strong why something that you're either running away from or running towards with coding that just makes failing not even be an option for me the way this worked is that I was working as a banker I was sitting in a rainy office in Helsinki I hated the kind of work I was doing I hated the hours I pretty much hated everything about my life and I figured out that learning program was the most likely option to give me the life that I actually wanted so then now I had this fire I had this previous life that I was sort of stuck to that I just had to escape and it became an obsession of mine to do whatever in my power to never have to go back to that life so I think sort of paradoxically the reason most people fail right at the beginning is because their life is just a bit too comfortable because it's not a strong enough reason to keep going in those moments when you really don't feel like doing it so what is the solution then how can you fake this fire under your ass if you don't feel like you had it I think every single person who's learning the code there's some reason why you want to do it find that why find that motivation because it's the only thing that will keep you going in the moment when you really don't want to do it but let's be honest here like that in and of itself is not really enough because even if you have this fire it doesn't automatically mean that you're going to keep being able to get yourself up and do what is required and a big reason for this is that society today has sort of made us way too soft the truth about learning the code or learning any hard thing is that it's going to require you to go through this period of what I call Obsession like this season of obsession where this one thing that you're trying to learn or achieve is the only thing in your mind but the problem we face is that the society that we live in today is telling us that this is wrong this is unhealthy you're not supposed to work that hard you should take it easy and what this leads to is a lot of people who end up failing because it simply does not work work in practice for me there was sort of a 3 to 6 month period in my life but I simply decided that for this next half a year I will let nothing stand in the way of me reaching my goals so what you need to do is just accept the fact that it is okay to be unbalanced or unhealthy for a period of time I'm not saying forever when you're down here with your skills in order to get here there's going to be a period of time when you're going to have to work a lot more than others to make up this difference in skill until you reach the level of skill that you're happy with so your second step is just to accept that it's okay to be obsessed and to forget what Society is telling you about what you're supposed to do and like oh you're supposed to have this balance all these kind of things okay so once you've got those two things down as think you have a reason why you're learning the code and you've adopted the correct mindset of becoming obsessed about your craft you still need one more thing you need something to channel this energy and this Obsession into and this is still where a lot of people fall apart so this is an exact step-by-step process on how to channel this Obsession and this energy in the correct way to learn to code as fast as possible so remember for me in the beginning of me learning the code the way I saw coding was basically as this like superpower it's like the closest thing we have to a superpower as humans so then I started getting all of these ideas of like all these things I wanted to use this superpower on like I started realizing all these problems in my life that I really wish existed and now that I was learning this coding skill I could just apply the skill to create myself rather than having to wait for someone else to do it for me and there was a particular example of a problem I had when I was thinking about where I should move like one of the big things I was considering like okay if I move to France and I make let's say 60k a year how much of that 60k is going to go into taxes versus if I do the same in the UK or in Germany or whatever but then when I was learn the code and I was learning about python like how to do maths with it and then I was learning about simple UI stuff and things like this I realized like why wouldn't I just build an online tax calculator where you can just input a gross salary and it's just going to Output the net salary off the taxes in this like really nice table and that ended up actually becoming the very first programming project that I built and the thing that I realized while building that project that I still take this day when I'm coding stuff is that it didn't feel like work to build it like I was waking up and literally the first thing that was on my mind was like oh yeah today I'm going to build that feature to it or like oh yeah today I'm going to figure out the French tax system and then how to calculate it and then figure out how to calculate that using Python and because I was building something that I really really wanted to build myself I didn't really need to motivate myself which was one of the first ever times that I felt this and so that is why I always say nowaday that if you're trying to learn the code and you're struggling just figure out a problem that you really really want to solve and then think about how you could use code to solve that problem then a month will pass by and you'll just realize like oh I'm so much better at programming now that I've built all of this stuff and through this process you go from being a coder to being a software developer because now you have developed actual software being able to build your first like real projects real functioning program that does something real is the most amazing feeling in the world this is how you will learn to code so much faster than you ever thought possible this is pretty much how I did it Without Really realizing at the time but like I said for any of this to work you also need to have some sort of a road map to know what you should be learning and in what order so that is why I made this video where I break down like 40 plus coding courses that I done into the ones that actually work so I highly recommend you go watch that video next and I will be rooting for your success while you do it good luck I'll see you in the next one
