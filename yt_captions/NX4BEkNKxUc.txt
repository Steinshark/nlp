why the devil will be reviewing this uh YouTube says we have a Content Gap it's the GT 1030. yeah people keep searching for reviews they keep asking for it you guys actually want us to talk about the GT 1030 you know it came out over five years ago right well do you asked for it I never wanted to talk about this card because we recommend against entry-level gpus to the point where we call them manufactured E-Waste but all right maybe I was prejudiced this time the truth is I've never gamed on one or even really looked up performance benchmarks but you can get these bad boys for about 50 bucks on eBay or about a hundred dollars brand new and with the prices of graphics cards these days along with how great the economy is doing right now that's a slash S to be clear it makes sense that you don't have to go too far down the steam Hardware survey to find the star of today's show but is it any good is it even as good as this segue to our sponsor War Thunder immerse yourself in War Thunder the free to play online vehicle combat game take command of over 2 000 uniquely modeled vehicles all fully customizable to your heart's content check it out at the link below for a free Bonus Pack I understand how it happens you need an entry-level GPU for the hand-me-down optiplexer kids picked up and a quick Google search later you find yourself staring at our friend here Mr GT 1030 with two gigs of vram a nearly 1500 megahertz boost clock and a DVI connector for that old mod monitor that you refuse to throw away which hey no it still works which I guess is kind of the theme today probably the most in point on the GT 1030 spec sheet is this with a 30 watt maximum TDP it'll get by on less than half of the potential 75 Watts that supplied through a pcie slot meaning no external six or eight pin connectors to plug in and it's tiny taking up a single slot or even a half height single slot that is great for compatibility and compared to your core i3's onboard Graphics it absolutely spanks handily beating poor Intel HD over the head with a stick in every scenario our blender render goes from over 12 minutes to just under nine CS go gets literally over double the frames per second going from playable to downright decent rocket League same story and gentian impact comes up against its 60fps cap the really important part though is these one percent lows they Skyrocket in every title thanks to the card's dedicated vram and additional processing power which means a huge difference in perceived animations moveness pretty compelling that is until you look at basically anything else for reference we dug up some comparably priced used carts a GTX 1050 TI and a GTX 1650 both of which are still available new for as low as 180 and 170 respectively and they give nearly the same thrashing to the 1030 that it does to onboard Graphics but this time for a smaller up charge both of them broke the 300 FPS barrier in CS go rocket League hit the high 200s and genshin well unsurprisingly still runs fine that's what a mobile game will get you now we're going to try a few more cinematic games for you in a second to see just how bad the GT 1030 is but I also wanted to mention that the RX 580 a card with 8 gigs of vram and a chip that would demolish every card from Team Green that we've tested today is available brand new for as low as 90 bucks can I get a shout out for the crypto crash I mean seriously in a world where a 580 costs ninety dollars why is YouTube asking me to make this video I just can't even no you know what let's see how Halo infinite runs seriously that's it okay Last of Us remake not enough vram while we mentioned the lack of video memory earlier you might not have registered just how important that is for modern games now four or five years ago when Nvidia released this thing you could get away with just two gigs but that's not gonna cut the mustard anymore for more demanding titles for example Jedi Survivor launches this month and lists a GTX 1070 an 8 gig card you know what isn't an 8 gig card our new couples matching underwear at ltdstore.com and you know what else isn't the GT 1030. let's see how many of the most popular games on Steam it can play though wow this is this is not a lot of fps's the flying is the hardest part yeah because it's doing the whole map yeah okay I mean In fairness this is running 720p mostly low but I can see the game and while my FPS is low okay around 30 33 FPS my 1 lows are also 30 FPS so at least it's a consistent 30 FPS which I would take over a choppy you know 15 to 40. you know what I mean this is an Esports title but it's also one that looks pretty good when you run it on high-end Hardware oh I don't have a gun yet and this person probably does so how do I melee too late next game I'm surprised Resident Evil 4 even launched the game requirements call for a GPU with four gigs of vram and we've got only two oh boy okay well your left motion blur on your pleb you can really do you're better off not no I will fight you at this graphical Fidelity the atmosphere of the game is definitely impacted but hey if you want to play through for the story it is absolutely running at 7 20. yeah at 7 20. 720 is a resolution that's HD that is high definition cool you wanna try another game not bad and this is at 1080p I mean I shouldn't be too surprised sifu calls for only a gt640 but so did Apex Legends and I needed to go all the way down to 720p for that I think there's even some film grain effects and everything really seriously wow this is like cranked really you can't turn motion blur off in this game oh my God what is this Batman Arkham Asylum kind of okay what do you want Destiny yes please vampire survivors I mean this is gonna work let's go I forget how this works you just run around you kill stuff and collect the gems and then as you collect the gems you unlock new powers and then you become strong uh you gotta point the other way yeah I know I was going this way so I could how am I supposed to get the stuff yeah this was how am I supposed to get it there you go okay man there's so many games you can play without a high-end GPU buying a top tier gaming PC just kind of seems like unnecessary it's my tutorial out some 10 years ago um game design for sure okay well either way this is clearly running more than fine if you want to play League of Legends DOTA Smite Esports titles like that you're not going to have any issues but you're not going to have any issues with really anything else in those titles either so why are you spending even a hundred dollars so then it sucks and we were right to ignore it you should buy a used card or you should save up for something better but if it's too late for that we decided to see what happens if we use the magic of overclocking to squeeze every last Penny's worth of value from our bad Buy I wanted to do this test in Halo but that's not happening so we're going back to our fan favorite the one the only shadow of the Tomb Raider with our base settings out of the box we managed to reach a solid 27 FPS average with one percent lows of 11 FPS let's see what we can do with that who hear that fan go here we go boys core voltage percent oh you can do a hundred percent More Voltage why don't we do a more modest 20. you had luck with uh yeah 200 on the core and uh six or seven hundred on the memory you can do 600 to be safe I did get a run with 700 it worked all right I'm going 248 and 700 okay fine there we go here we go Shadow Tomb Raider what was our what was our results again 27 FPS 27 oh we're gonna beat that with one percent low of 11. this looks decent this is the easiest part of the best I know it is oh no why'd you go to 248. why did you tell me to do that if it doesn't make it through this time I'll just do 200 okay sounds good oh wait for it here we go average FPS 31. that's not bad it's a pretty sizable Improvement yeah it's over 10 let's go seriously though while there are benefits to this card like the ones we mentioned at the start of the video low profile low power consumption low cost not to mention it's quiet for gaming there are simply too many other options out there that absolutely trounce it sometimes even at the same size like the RX 6400 for about fifty dollars more it also barely uses more power with a TDP of about 50 watts and it's probably just as quiet so if you have the k space and a spare eight pin pcie connector please consider literally anything else because the worst part of this is we've got the good one the gddr5 version there's a ddr4 variant of this card floating around out there that performs even worse but trying to get a hold of one and benchmarking it was beyond the scope of this video so if you want to look into that Hardware inbox has got you covered with this great video from a few years ago we're going to have our variant though and all of the other cards the ones you should actually buy listed in the video description below so there you go YouTube there's your GT 1030 video okay yes it has a few limited use cases video encoding yes it's better than onboard but no it is not enough better than onboard especially when compared to other options they're going to be drawbacks to some of the other cheapest ships Alternatives that RX 580 for 100 bucks for example that RX 580 for 100 bucks will outperform it but it will draw much more power while doing so realistically the 1030s ability to launch them at 7 FPS is not a lot better how are you going to see enemies coming how will you see this sponsor
