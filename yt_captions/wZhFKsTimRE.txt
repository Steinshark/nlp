ladies and gentlemen I've got something very special for you today I'm super excited for this video today I am going to get to the bottom of something can three Magnus Carlson brains put together defeat stockfish 16 which is the most powerful chess AI on the planet now it could get more powerful if I also had a massive computer server space here and all that good stuff but it is the most powerful chess computer even on a web browser now I have no access to Magnus Carlson let alone three Magnus Carlson we haven't figured out how to clone them yet and as far as we know he doesn't have any twins so instead I will be using the magnite chess bot that was created this month on chess.com where I can only imagine it has a playing personality and brain power and capacity mentally of three Magnus Carlson I have two games for you they're so cool it's so cool to see these AI Titans fight against each other a lot of you like AI content do let me know in the comments if you do by the way because every time I ask I always see people commenting CU right now YouTube comments are all like Levy never fails to never fail to never fail and Levy never fails you know like it's just all like Teenage memes but I I do like to hear feedback from kids adults seniors like I really enjoy this type of stuff and I have two unbelievable games for you today so game number one stockfish began with uh D4 and the magnite Bots have an ELO of 9999 cuz their actual ELO is impossible ELO and ch.com doesn't let me customize the field with words it only lets me put numbers so I put 9999 D4 D5 Knight F3 Knight F6 and we have a Queen's Gambit because stockfish really likes Queen's Gambit it also likes C4 Knight F3 systems I don't think it likes E4 as much um and the Magna here play the slav defense there's no such thing as the Scandinavian very variation here there is the Scandinavian defense but that's of course E4 so they play you know they play the slav and then they surprise me by playing not the semi slav which is very very good uh not Bishop F5 which is the mainline slav but A6 this has multiple names I do believe it's called chabin or the um oh it has another name that I'm forgetting anyway A6 love and the idea is to play B5 the other idea is to take the pawn and go here and gener nowadays engines play E3 to try to take back with the bishop quickly uh or they take and basically say well now we're playing an exchange but you have this dumb move A6 yeah stockfish 16 plays G3 um web Bay stockfish says take my Pawn let's play I'm I'm going to give up my Pawn completely not only am I going to give up my Pawn I have no intention of winning it back with the bishop none whatsoever now the magnite take the challenge they take on C4 the opening stage is very interesting for Bots cuz normally they come with opening books so when AI plays against AI you pre-program them to play like certain amount of moves I let the bot decide like on whatever depth it wanted Bishop G2 this has all been played before and basically white just says you can have the pawn what do I get for the pawn I get long-term pressure on this massive diagonal I can always play Knight E5 and try to win the pawn back and another way that I'll restrict you from playing B5 is I'll play A4 if you let me which is why frequently Bots will go B5 but then they weaken this and this can be very annoying to defend and then white will play like B three and there there's actually lines where where white just like just gets a position like this just to full Pawn down but a lot of pressure and Black's position is very difficult to dig out of so instead of that the magnite play Knight bd7 which stops Knight E5 and so instead of that stockfish takes this approach and says well you know what middle finger I I mean uh pointer finger pointer pointer pointer finger pointer pointer finger we have kids watching to the magn iBot I'm pointing at the B5 Square you can't play B5 anymore you can't play B5 cuz you're going to open up that diagonal you're also you can't take like this and so the magnite play A5 and they say well at least I one control of B4 completely I can put pieces there you can't put anything on B5 like a knight and by the way for the record stockfish has no intention whatsoever of winning the pawn back for now which I find hilarious a lot of moves tie for first here like E4 is good Bishop G5 just developing as much as possible Bishop G5 the idea of Bishop G5 for the record is not really to put PP on the pp like there if I can jump the pawn there that would be great the idea is to is to take the Knight take the Knight black can take back a variety of different ways and then just play like E3 just basically put a bunch of Pawns on dark squares no longer having a dark squared Bishop maybe advance but Knight D2 Queen E2 win the pawn back utilize the long like look at Black's light squared Bishop right the computer's trying to take a long-term approach here and it doesn't mind kind of traditional nature of you shouldn't trade a bishop for a knight cuz Gotham said it in a YouTube video because if the computer could have it its way it would be the one with 4 and a half million subscribers so Bishop G5 is played the magnite put the bishop on B4 justifying their plan and stockfish goes Knight to E4 which does put PP on the pp but more than anything else it opens up the C file and you basically render this bishop targetless and then you're going to try to win the pawn back and finally claim some sort of Advantage the Magna here say it's about damn time you do something with that Bishop the computer takes with the Knight and then brings the bishop back now you might say well didn't you just say this was going to happen yeah but it didn't want to trade too much I guess I guess stockfish didn't want to create this massive imbalance potential problems for itself on the king side so it just goes back and says all right let's trade Knight E5 Queen C2 I will slowly win my pawns back you still have a stupid Bishop the Magna now play a mistake um in the eyes of stockfish Knight E4 which is an overextension stockfish doesn't like the fact that this Knight is bouncing around so much much one two three it's probably going to have to go back as well uh the computer here and by the computer I mean of course the god of computer chess stockfish just thought castling was fine and if you're going to move the Knight i' also like Knight D5 and if E4 well then I'm blocking my own bishop and Knight F6 is good and if E5 well now the Knight just lives here forever and black is completely fine so it's actually interesting how in this position the rather this position this is good for white but if the pawn is on E5 it's bad for white which is fascinating right very very fascinating very interesting so Bishop D2 Knight E4 takes takes and now stock says all right time to get my Pawn back Knight E5 and uh okay Queen D2 interesting not Queen C2 which virtually guarantees the capture no actually this position is not deemed that much better because black is completely solid it's very difficult to break through the black position instead of that stockfish goes Queen D2 which is a smoke screen scen Queen D2 is a smoke screen targeting this Pawn forcing a reaction out of black and and and black if they defend that pawn will now have to deal with this the computer prefers to put a rook on C4 instead of a queen it wants to play Rook C1 at which point there is pressure there is considerable pressure on the B Pawn and it's a big problem so now by playing this stockfish baits the magnite into a reaction and basically stock is like well you uh magnite are like well you missed your chance to take so now your knight is going to have to wander into our territory and look stupid stf says stupid stupid who's going to look stupid you bozos yeah plural by the way plural for leaving those pieces on the board which is uh exactly that way and now I'm not even going to take this I'm going to attack your king cuz you weakened your king the magnai wanted to have a weaker King so that white would not take those pawns back but that was really bad at this point the magnite started saying some really hilarious stuff um so King F7 Knight F4 they played E5 and then when stockfish took and they took back they said two out of three Magna have voted to take I I wonder who the dissenting one was now stockfish finds a beautiful idea rather than stepping back with the Knight or going here and getting trapped in this position stockfish plays Queen takes Pawn that's a problem if it can win its Pawn back like that it's it's it's a serious issue because if Pawn takes Rook D1 and you just you use this pin if the queen trade is offered you don't accept you you go bully this King because the Magna weaken the king so Queen B4 okay the magnai now need to go Queen E7 and defend themselves but white is building the pressure white is building the pressure there are Pawn targets all over the board this is a very weak and isolated Pawn the king slides back to G8 now stockfish starts building up the pressure Rook D7 looking to move the Knight and trade the queen stockfish knows that and at this point the magn say together we have over 60 world championships combined Knight C3 Knight F7 you may wonder why did stockfish go here but not double the Rooks it wants the Rook on the f file you know why it wants the Rook on the file because it knew this was going to happen and now F4 and now we see we wanted The Rook on the file trying to open up the position but the magn are very close to equalizing the game they're actually doing a really really really good job now we double the Rooks now we take Rook Knight Bishop versus Rook Knight Bishop imbalanced Pawn structure the way you win a same color Bishop endgame is you have your pawns complement your Bishop nice hat your muscles look really big I really like your car Etc G6 they played G6 and they said we have unanimously chosen the best move and by the way according to stockfish yeah 0.08 so they're talking trash correctly Bishop F1 Bishop E6 stockfish expands on the dark squares compliment the bishop actually means put pawns on the opposite color of the bishop so your Bishop controls light squares your dark squares are controlled by the pawns at this point the Magnus play H5 and they up the trash talk they say the Magna would all beat easily any other chess player in a fight because there's three of us yeah honestly understandable have a nice day F5 look at that idea this is such a deep idea by stockfish stockfish gives up the pawn on F5 to win the pawn on C4 it does that because it's its only winning chance you might say how how is that the only winning chance well these pawns are going to be frozen on light squares so the bishop always has a threat to sneak in that pawn is now Frozen on a light Square H4 was designed to play H5 I don't think Magnus Carlson would ever play the move H5 in one of his own games because that pawn is a liability in all end games because it's on the same color as the white Bishop it's also on the same color as the dark Bishop as Black's Bishop but that's going to be the defending side white is going to be attacking so now look at this now now we pop back we defend apparently King G6 is a bad move apparently it's better to go King H6 if you ask me to explain this to you I can't I don't understand I think the king here is a bit smooshed maybe here it's out of the way more room to move but at this point this was the first mistake the magn made and stockfish immediately went uhoh I'm better B4 I'm happy to trade the Rooks A5 all pawns are on dark squares three pawns are on light squares white is that look at the advantage ballooning couple of moves ago it was borderline dead equal the move H5 started the problems King G7 King G6 slightly inaccurate endgame play and actually The Rook trade is probably losing it's a simplification that stockfish can see 20 30 40 ply ahead and whatever the Magna are programmed to can't which is crazy A5 and now stockfish brings its king and this is the Fatal mistake Bishop C2 the computer think thinks that the bishop should stay back here and the Knight can dance in the middle the bishop can go back and forth but when you overextend now we have Bishop F3 and the Knight comes in and stockfish is going to get those pawns these pawns are a massive problem and the Knight can come here and win this in fact it does for the magnai but it's too little too late because the king is coming if you play Knight to A6 which looks like a really nice move I'm just going to go King E4 I don't care about that pawn because I'm still constantly threatening and look at this winning idea so there's an idea here that's hidden it's the outside pass Pawn walking past the blockade because you sacrifice the bishop and you clear out the defense very sneaky idea looks like there's no way through but there is and that is the way stockfish wins game one it threatens enough problems and then it wins that weak pawn and it's got a two on nothing it's got a two on nothing Advantage so you go up the board you create a blockade with your bishop and you slowly escort these pawns to a spot where the King has no choice but to go address them G6 H5 now the king is there now it's this this and this versus the rest of the black position the black king is completely stuck it has to play defense so you can bring the king up the board black is in tuang if Black Goes King F6 you play H6 and H7 that's it black is completely lost at that point if black plays King here you take a little walk around that's what you do take a little walk around threaten to promote the pawns threaten to take go to E6 you go here take the pawn get over there now you might even find a way to lose this Pawn but it won't matter because by the time the Knight goes there these pawns are too advanced and that's exactly how the computer wins this game stockfish look at this like the king walks in like the Terminator it's what look King E3 King E4 King E5 King D6 King C7 I'll do it myself giving up the bishop look at this giving up the bishop cuz you can't stop me a beautiful first game and uh stockfish methodically PRI apart the defenses forces the king to the edge King F6 King F7 black again in a tuang knight G7 you could play Knight F4 but then I'm going to go here that's mate if you move the Knight if you move the king that's mate so it's game over King F7 Knight G7 what a game stockfish beats the magnite at their own strength which is the end game crazy crazy cuz the magnite kept in there it was a very interesting game I mean stockfish was applying pressure the whole game playing that interesting uh G3 slav type of thing putting the bishop on G2 if you want to ever add like a if if any of you are intermediate or Advanced then you can actually put these types of openings to the test and your opponents are not you know having violent diarrhea in the first 10 moves and moving their Queen around and playing stupid gambits because that's what chess is below like 1500 rapid you can't you know you show up to a game after studing an opening somebody puts all their pawns on the sixth rank you lose you want to throw your phone out of a window but at an advanced level you know G3 systems in Queens Pawn openings are really tough to play against so consider adding them this game though Insanity absolutely insane game I want to look at it from stock fish's standpoint because I find it actually just more more terrifying this game was unbelievable so the magnai started game number two with a trosi which really surpris me because if I don't think any computer will play the chowski okay um now G6 uh sorry I I have a I'm going to break the fourth wall here I have sticky notes on the like I have my thing where I'm recording but then and I'm going to tell you the funny things that the Magna said in this game and one of them happened on the Move G6 G6 was not played there I just read the move out like you know when that happens like you're walking you see something you're like having a conversation and you're like yeah you know I really like that tomato cuz you like saw a tomato or what you know you meant to say like I really like that thing and then you just slide it into your sentence that's called something I I don't don't know what it's called it's like the same phenomen it's not the same phenomenon it's like you look at a word for too long and then it starts looking incorrect anyway another very interesting thing they play Knight C3 I play this with white this is a system where you put your queen like this and it's very aggressive and you try to Castle along C5 is a very interesting line Knight C3 super interesting um so they start immediately attacking stockfish which is super funny stockfish plays E6 E4 Knight F3 and now they're just going to go long castle and and and attack now stockfish here can Strike Back it can already begin creating counterplay but it plays D6 very kg approach the position really resembles a um a classical Sicilian after Knight C3 here Bishop G5 this is called the Rouser and then you know it basically looks like this and and black puts these Bishops Behind These pawns A6 A6 Rook C8 and it looks like this well the position we get in the game kind of looks like that it's got a very similar structure where it looks like E4 C5 and it looks like kind of a sicilian cuz black doesn't have a c Pawn so you know it it it doesn't look that different and now we have long castle and when you try to attack stockfish sometimes it stubbornly defends itself and sometimes it says you want to fight you got to fight that's what we're going to do we we got to fight it says I'm not going to Castle cuz I see what you want and sometimes in these positions it's actually better for black to keep the king in the center it's the fascinating thing about the Sicilian Defense there's some variations the king hiding behind its own pawns is safer than going somewhere because sometimes if you Castle somewhere and then you try to like fight back let's say H6 uh well I guess I just Castle let's say like Bishop D3 H6 you're going to lose like you'll just get checkmated and positions in the balance cuz there's some absurd ways to defend you know yourself but this is nobody wants to play like this so play Queen A5 now the magn shocked me they didn't play King B1 they didn't play Bishop D3 the magnai sacrifice a pawn here a full Pawn to open up Black's position so they are taking the fight to Sock fish now you can't take with the pawn apparently because Bishop B5 is lethal get the Knight get the rook in the game sensing that they are under attack sorry that they are I I keep mixing up who's who sensing that stockfish is under attack uh it decides to trade pieces so the more pieces that get traded like KN for night the less chance stockfish has of getting checkmated Knight takes E5 now Queen takes E5 not opening its own King and when the check arrives it doesn't offer a trade stockfish makes a conscious decision to move its king and it's basically saying y'all are trash yall attack is trash good luck I prefer to keep my pawns like this and I'm going to I'm you want to see an attack you're going to get an angry angry AI coming your way look at the position though castled King Rooks on the files Bishop sniping Queen lurking Knight ready to go all for one Pawn this is a terrifying position for black whose four of seven pieces are on the home rank the eighth rank Queen F5 F3 defending itself and ready to go G4 ready to get the queen and the bishop out of the way and G4 H5 just trampolining these pawns forward stockfish plays H6 kicking out the bishop the bishop goes now it plays A6 kicking out the bishop because it's the only thing it can do but what about Bishop D3 the Bishops are going back to reset for another wave of an attack fascinating stuff the queen goes for a queen trade stockfish goes for a queen trade here was stuck behind between all these moves stuck between queen of here Queen there Queen there really couldn't decide it was all about balance it offers a queen trade if you're going to attack somebody in chess you can't trade the Queens the queen goes back and now stockfish looks silly cuz it put its Queen directly in the line of attack oh my God what is it doing I got news for it's not doing anything Bishop D7 it's like come get me you clowns come get me I'm not I'm not locked in here with you you're locked in here with me that was a great movie by the way I love Watchman Rook C8 B5 like all of it it it actually thinks it's going to attack the Magna instead so here comes H4 it could have played G4 plays H4 stockfish plays Rook C8 completely unconcerned a lot of moves are possible here like I thought about trading first it's all like within the same it's about you know from from equal to minus point1 minus point2 plays Rook C8 and now it goes to A5 directly into a discovered attack which doesn't actually do anything because Queen A2 is fatal so Queen A5 and now the magnite play a prepatory move which is King to B1 and now now stockfish has a major choice at this point it realized that White's attack is actually very powerful stock fishes are a little bit bad sometimes a tiny bit bad at like the 3700 level of going oh I see yeah that that might be a problem in 20 moves especially with peace placements like sometimes it thinks a peace placement is fine then it goes oh it could be problematic if I had like Google computer uh servers here it would not but you know I got the browser so instead of that it plays D5 which is a really bold move instead of D5 it could have brought it Queen back to the home Square which is deranged like I can't even imagine and then it basically will take put the Knight there and do this cocoon and say I'm still a pawn up you clown I'm still a PA up but then F5 would have ripped the position open Knight to D5 would have come in you would have grabbed the bishop you would have tried to put the bishop on the dark squares it would have been crazy but instead of that stockfish says come Checkmate me D5 completely G it it just allows the pawn to come in and then it plays 98 it plays 98 and the magnite push this pawn and say all three Magna have evaluated this position as advantageous for white barely how Black's position is not completely collapsing is beyond me for any human this is game over game over for black you take this you open up your king look at that I don't even have to take I want my knight there unfortunately there's no non-stop flights so I'm going to have to fly boom and then to Istanbul and then to G6 but it's still winning so instead of that F6 the pawn is actually in White's way white white doesn't want the pawn there white wants the open lines but the Knight is still going to go for the journey he plays knight2 and here the Magna said the magai cannot agree on a move for a good reason because here F4 is good knight B5 is good uh Bishop F5 what the what is that giving up the bishop to take on D5 and take on E7 sacrificing The Rook there's so many good moves in this position the magn literally are beside themselves they can't decide Knight to E2 is played the bishop oh my I told you this game was absurd the queen is hanging but instead of moving it stockfish counterattacks because if you take the queen there's no further damage and if you take this you attack The Rook if you want to survive an attack trade the Queens but trade the Queens intelligently you go here trying to trade the Queens I kick you out incredible Bishop C5 both Queens slide out of danger the attack continues to pour forward Black's move in this position is unfindable for a human unfindable unfindable Black's entire concept here is unfindable the Knight arrives putting pressure on this and this any human here reinforces this any human the best move in this position for black is to play H5 now you it if you had the attention span to survive 24 and 1/2 minutes in this video thank you you're very appreciated but now I'm going to really show you how beautiful 3700 ELO chess is so we have this position Black's King is stranded in the center of the board this Rook has no connection to the pieces white is creating a very powerful attack where basically every piece is involved and yet the best move is to play Pawn to H5 and the the best move for black is to play Pawn to H5 because it prevents the knight from arriving on that square to perch and pressure yes but stockfish is preparing for the end game stockfish knows that in a distant World it will survive the attack it will neutralize White's initiative it will trade a sufficient amount of pieces and when its Knight gets there or there or the bishop goes there that pawn will be a liability and F5 will be played it's not just about the Knight coming to H5 because there's going to be a situation also in the future where H5 is played and black can't get out black is suffering trying to breathe and there's going to be sacrificial ideas on the pawn when the Knight moves and this Pawn will be able to promote so it plays H5 which is so crazy and I'm telling you this because I'm from the future I'm telling you this because it might happen Queen to H3 the magnai put pressure Knight to C7 rookie 2 rookie one applying so much pressure Bishop A3 is a Checkmate threat the bishop goes back to defend itself E5 breaking open the center the queen is under attack Bishop F5 counterattacking this bishop the Knight is hanging but you can't take it you can't take the Knight because Bishop D7 there's Checkmate threats so you go Bishop B5 White's Knight goes out of the way it's e it's z0000 but it's so complicated it's so complicated Black's King is under massive pressure White's King is under Counterattack as well the bishop goes to B4 what what about Knight takes yeah then I take the Rook what about this well then I take the Knight and it's still equal White's attack is still so powerful because what is this guy doing black is basically playing without a rook but instead of that we have Rook D1 all right now here there's so many crazy lines oh my God it's all around the same evaluation white can go black can go Bishop C4 here which stockfish thought was bad after F4 E4 sacri sacrifice and look at this look at stockfish thinking uhoh uhoh and it's under too much pressure you sacrifice material but you open up all the lines Bishop takes Rook takes the bishop drops back white plays A4 for some reason because I guess you're trying to just take space away and now black is lost black is lost because you can't get the Rook into the game so you are playing down a rook Insanity so instead of Bishop C4 we have Bishop B E7 now we have Bishop D2 and Bishop C4 now we have a move that I can't even I can't even begin to explain which is this again A4 taking space away from black maybe threatening to trap the bishop Queen C6 stockfish just go ahead and and trap my Bishop I wanted to trade it anyway I wanted to get rid of the Knight what why would you want to get rid of the Knight what about the queen coming in here yeah now stockfish says I'm attacking B5 oh my this is nuts this who's going to lose it's like two heavyweights a takes B5 Knight takes B5 now the magn play a move that is unfathomable to me unfathomable I think two powerful Bishops two powerful Rooks let's continue the attack no no no no no no the magnai go for an endgame they take the Knight they take the Knight they want to go for an end game and transfer in the queen so now the threat is Rook takes Pawn with the weakened King so you know where black moves King E8 the position here looks absolutely horrible for black black still can't get the pieces into the game but black might get a queen trade somehow black survived the house made of cement survived the the big bad wolf blowing and blowing and blowing and blowing and it survived F4 right trying to create E4 now the best move there this was the last chance for stock stockfish thought Bishop A5 was strong for the Magna and then after something like Rook D6 Rook D3 and maybe trying to transfer in like this he can't really go D4 because now this is very powerful F4 E4 worked in the past but that was when the pawn was back there so stockfish found a series of moves here that would have weakened its position quite considerably and would have given some good chances to the Magna but still you would have tried to trade the queens and then there's this Rook sacrifice Rook E5 just straight up sacrificing a rook because of Queen F7 mate insane look at that just beautiful F4 though E4 we go to an end game Queen trade the magnite finally win their Pawn back finally but look at this this is so unbelievable this is the 40 fourth move of the game 20 moves ago stockfish played H5 in the middle of a massive apocalyptic battle with its king and rook and Knight all on the back rank it played H5 because it had a feeling that 20 moves into the future there was a hope that is insane and I got news for you it gets even more insane than that because it wins the pawn it Chucks this that that and King safety just for its pawn it plays Rook to H6 and this this is insane it plays Rook to H6 to attack the pawn on G6 but what is its plan after Rook B6 Bishop G7 its Rook is trapped and if it wanted to invest in the pawn Why didn't it just go here well then there would have been this right away and if you play H3 and try to run away I go check I will win your Rook Bishop here Bishop here H2 and then I have this and I'm actually checkmating you in many lines you're actually getting checkmated and then this Pawn is very strong as well so instead of of that first stockfish goes here and it goes there because now it can push it couldn't do it right away because the bishop would have had to block but by putting the Rook up it allows The Rook to die you've been what does he say to Snape sorry if mute now if you don't want Harry po spoiled it been a good and faithful servant seus but only I can live forever H3 H2 and the difference is that the king can get out and the pawn is too slow G7 H1 is a check and then I stop the pawn watch as stockfish performs gymnastics to escape Rook B8 we would have gone King D7 you may wonder what about Queen Queen C2 and Bishop F6 six that's the problem it's in it's Insanity so Rook B8 check would have led to King D7 Rook B7 King D6 or King E6 Rook C7 and maybe this is equal maybe there's a way to draw this that's probably what the magnite should have done but they blunder the magnite blunder which is Magnus would never blunder here so this is like clearly an AI that is just programmed to do some stupid stuff it makes a queen and then it goes to this end game of rook and Bishop versus queen but it gets even more ridiculous I think the Magna thought this was a draw the Magna idea was to give up the bishop for the pawn and make a draw and what I mean by that is let's say E2 Bishop H4 E1 take take Rook C4 is a draw this is a draw you may wonder why well a queen can beat a rook but I got news for you a queen can't even beat a rook and a pawn sometimes and two pawns is good enough and three pawns is even better because this is what we call a fortress this is a defensive Fortress The Rook is defended and creates an impregnable defense now let's say white plays King B2 King E7 King A2 King F6 and black walks their King all the way to G4 you look at the eval it's actually getting bigger and then there's going to be an idea to sack the queen so something like Queen F4 or weakening the position maybe but it might be a draw but guess what happens for whatever reason stockfish makes a knight it makes a knight because it assumed it would be taken and the magnite didn't take the night they actually might have made a draw but for some reason see if you make a queen it's going to take but they did didn't the magni malfunction in the end game and allow the Knight to survive because I guess they thought they they just got some sort of weird Horizon effect the Knight completely broke the AI and they're going to lose of course they're going to lose there's a whole another piece on the board so black just black you know circles and circles and gets the knight in and finally picks up the bishop and gets the pawn and this is winning because it's just a pass Pawn it's not there's no defense and um stockfish 16 advance doesn't make a night that time surgically wins what a weird set of games I mean that first one was a fascinating you know Pawn sacrifice positional grind this one was chaos stockfish accepted a monster attack for its opponent for the cost of a pawn simplified the game down into an end game made a queen it was probably still equal but the magnite blunder in an end game and um if you enjoyed this you know I'm happy to make these two play a 10 game match it be fascinating to see if you know maybe the magnite can win but stockfish is the AI Overlord I mean there is no denying it's so powerful it does some crazy stuff it takes crazy risk and it plays to the crowd um hopefully you enjoyed because I really really enjoyed these games and uh I look forward to making some more so stockfish remains undefeated Undisputed for now get out of here
