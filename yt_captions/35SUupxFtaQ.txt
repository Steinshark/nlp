imagine what would happen if suddenly I gave you a special drug that gave you the ability to learn any skill instantly what would you learn first and most importantly what would you do with this ability to just suddenly be able to have any skill that you wanted well in this video I am going to not give you a drug like that because a drug like that doesn't exist this is just some stupid face cream but what I will give you is a step-by-step system to allow you to start learning difficult technical things much faster and to make understanding them easier and thus make it easier for you to apply these things in real life the reason you're struggling to learn is that you haven't mastered the skill of learning itself yet because trying to learn difficult things like coding without actually First Learning the skill of learning is sort of like trying to build the roof of the house before like building the foundation of the house like you might have the best roof in the world but if you don't have a foundation for your house it's just gonna like fall down and the biggest problem with this there's a massive problem with the way way you've probably been learning your entire life because the way you're taught to learn at school is not actually the best way at all you're probably wasting a massive amount of time just learning to completely wrong way and this is what I see with most people so in this video I'm gonna give you a solution I'm gonna give you a system to apply to learn any skill that you want there's three steps to my process and I've applied this to not only just learning the code I've applied this to learning languages so I hope that these systems that have really worked for me can work for you as well and I highly suggest that you pay close attention to this video because if you master this freaking skill it could be the most important thing that you have mastered in your entire life so let's get started [Music] the first step is to get better at the skill of focus you need to be able to sit down at your desk and focus on one thing for an extended period of time ideally at least one to two hours and there's a couple of strategies to do that first of which is to make sure you don't eat carbs before your work session there's a thing that happens when you eat load of carbs like these fast carbs like you know pasta sugar bread these kinds of things they spike your blood sugar but what also happens is that to like I don't know half an hour their blood sugar goes down and it like crashes that's why you get these like top crashes that people talk about and it's doing these crashes like usually after your meal that it's gonna be very very difficult to focus what are you looking at the thing is if your meals are filled with these fast carbs that cause these blood sugar spikes and crashes it's gonna be very very hard for you to focus because in that kind of state that your brain is just going to have a very hard time focusing so that's why when I go through phases when I want to learn a lot and I want to focus a lot I stick to a very low fast car title of what's called like a slow carb diet and in general at least for me I find that when I'm a fasted so in the morning my focus is up because when you have eaten a lot even if it's not as much carbs like it's just going to be full and I'm sure you know that feeling of just being stuffed it's just being full and like lethargic after a big meal is gonna make it much much harder to focus and for your brain to work as hard as it needs to actually learn another thing is that exercise and daily exercise like first of all should be a daily habit for you anyway but this also helps with Focus this is a thing I learned when I was recently listening to an episode of the cube of My Lab podcast essentially after exercising there's around a two hour window where your focus is going to be elevated this is also a useful time for you to place a work session so this is what I've now started doing every time after working out I make sure that I have nothing planned afterwards and the thing I do for the next two hours after my workout session is going to be a work blog or or a learning block again allows us to work with our body rather than against our body by strategically placing our work sessions in the moments when focus is at its maximum and the third strategy is to improve your focus is going to be meditation focus at the end of the day is just like a muscle like you can train the muscle to get better at the skill of focusing if you haven't mastered it yeah basically you just want to sit down for an extended period of time and try to just think of nothing and you will see especially if you're one of those people who Scrolls Tick Tock who's focus is like completely destroyed it's going to be very very difficult for you to do that and the longer you're able to do that the more you do that on a daily basis your skill of focus is going to start improving because a lot of the times even if we were able to focus we don't want to because we find starting to be boring or hard work and things like that and I used to feel that as well so I came up with this like strategy to essentially trick my brain into one thing to learn so let me explain that okay so what do you think it is that we're always willing to spend time playing video games but we're never really willing or we never really feel like spending time studying probably because to us and to most of us playing video games is fun like it's cool to play and things like that but learning is not fun it feels like something that we have to do rather than something that we want to do so then as a consequence if we could just make learning more fun we would want to do it more right and then we would be able to do it more because we would want to do it and that is like from the research and from what I've learned about learning the biggest thing about everything and just getting things done if you can just make the activity more fun we can make ourselves want to do it more so here are the ways that I have found to make learning more fun again this is gonna sound a bit weird that might sound a bit controversial even but I think we all have the ability to just choose to believe that whatever we're doing is fun like let me explain like when you're playing some video game like I used to play play these games where you have to like collect these trophies or like these complete all these quests and all of this I didn't always feel like doing it like probably if you're used to playing like shooter games or FIFA or something when you lose you're probably not loving the experience but you still choose to keep playing so I really spent a long time thinking about why that is and I just came to the conclusion that we enjoy video games because we choose to enjoy them we just choose to have the belief that a video game is a fun activity something that we want to do so we keep doing it once we choose to believe that learning is not a fun activity it is not something that we want to do it's something that we have to do so what if you just chose to believe that learning is interesting that learning is simply a game that you're playing where sometimes yeah it's difficult but the difficulty is what leads to that progress what was found by Richard Feynman which is who is one of the most successful Learners of all time is that us humans we have a natural inclination to want to understand the world like everything we do and our curiosity is always really targeted as understanding how the real world works now that's actually why I believe that learning some of these more technical stocks like abstract topics can be more difficult because they're sort of removed from the real world like if you're learning loops that doesn't have a like an immediate obvious connection to allowing it to understand the real world so anytime I'm learning something technical or something like abstract that I don't really see the immediate benefit of I actually take the time that before going to learn the thing to place that thing in the context of the real world what is it that learning this technical thing is going to allow me to understand what interesting things is it going to allow me to do or is it going to allow me to understand about the world for example if I'm learning loops which is abstract and like Technical and whatever I try to come up with an example like a real world use case for the concept of Loops to like make it click better in my brain and to make me more excited to learning like just as a dumb example when I learn about loops I might easily see how the concept of Loops could be used for example to Loop through a list of transaction and convert the currency which could be something that I'd want to build in a finance application that I might want to build another example like data structures and algorithms is something that people often find like boring and dull or something that they don't want to learn and I felt this so when I was learning data structures and algorithms I took the time to really understand okay why are computer scientists actually learning data structures and algorithms and it turns out that faster algorithms contribute more to allowing us to improve the performance of all of our applications than all the improvements in Hardware in total so after I learned that I understood the reason why learning algorithms is an interesting thing because I realized that it would allow me to understand why some applications run faster than others they would allow me to understand how we as humans are able to create these amazing programs that do all these things this is related to the broader idea of the broader way I essentially live my life which is making my life into this exploration everything I do everything I learn on a daily basis is just targeted at the goal of improving my own video game character in this game of life and like unlocking new levels like learning something like programming fundamentals which is this one topic is going to unlock 10 topics at least these 10 areas of software development that we might now be able to learn using these things so that is how we learn about Focus that is how we actually trick ourselves to want to learn things but here's where we get to the part where you actually start learning better when you are learning the problem I have with the way we learn our schools is very what I call test focused learning schools encourage you do learn in such a way that you will pass a test but the problem is school tests or that they don't really test the thing that actually matters so tell me if this ever happened to you you had a test coming off for a math test or whatever at school you crammed for it three days you did pretty well at the test but then a week later you had no idea and you didn't even remember anything I was a really a really good student at school like I've always get these really high grades but then like a month later I wanted to try to remember something that I had done in a test I could not remember anything but the issue with schools is that they try to make you remember all of these things so you come up with these rules to like memorize things which is completely useless when it comes to actual real world understanding and the bigger problem with this is that now like maybe you're teaching yourself the code you will still wired your brain in this way to optimize for memorizations you go through some lessons and some course and you try to remember all the functions and all the methods you completely ignore the idea and you just try to memorize the details because that's what your brain is primed to do and this is the massive problem and the massive mistake that people do so here is how you fix that first of all when you're going through any course don't try to memorize anything go through the entire thing and at no point try to memorize anything okay the next day after you've learned something you do what I call the explain the mom test you essentially imagine that your mom asks you to explain that thing to them which forces you to explain me in a very conceptual level and it actually forces you to really really understand when you're not able to hide behind having memorized some keywords or some syntax or whatever and in general you want to make your brain work really hard because the way your brain works is that the harder it has to work better the learning is going to be because your brain sort of understands like if you're trying to work really hard to remember something how to like use something it's going to then Force itself to like build that thing into the fabric of your brain or whatever neurons work and this is why learning through application learning by doing is so effective because I mean you actually have to go out there and build something using Loop so if I gave you the task you then actually have to understand Loops to be able to understand how to do that the fact that you have memorized the syntax of Loops is not going to help you and that is what we're trying to do in the first place anyway right we're trying to learn something to be able to use it in a real world contact and to actually do something real with it just try to do things much earlier than you think that you can so even before you fully learn something give yourself a challenge where you know you would have to use that thing so for example building like a full-fledged web application before you even learn the web development and then figure out what would be the first step that you need to do you're probably just getting started with Django or something like your web framework and through immediately applying it to a real project you actually learn the process of getting started with jungle because your brain is so much more primed to learning when you're actually applying it rather than just trying to memorize it in some unrealistic scenario I'm sorry just because you've gone through five courses doesn't mean that you know how to code but you can literally just go and build one application from scratch and learn the steps along the way and after you do that you will know how to code because you have actually done something with code and your brain will have internalized these things through doing it and then after that you want to learn the theory of the there you have already tried to apply because it will make so much more sense after you have actually tried to apply these things first and you've realized that you have these knowledge deficiencies which you can now go and fill that is how you want to learn we want to actually learn things you need to make your brain work hard and it's uncomfortable and that is the biggest problem and the biggest mistake people make that they're not willing to go the extra mile they're not willing to put in the effort to really really work hard because it's uncomfortable well I know I need to be comfortable enough um learning difficult things is hard if you expected this video to tell you something else like I'm sorry you can dislike the video again if you just do these three things of mastering your focus making learning fun and understanding that you need to work hard to actually get results and apply things you will get results but the thing is that it's really really difficult to apply these things and to keep all of these things in mind consistently for a very long period of time and so to do that you also need to build the right habits and so if you want to learn more I actually just released my new module Pro program as mindset and productivity inside of my full program python developer masterclass so for those of you who already bought my full masterclass it's now available to you and you can find it inside of the course and for those of you who haven't if you are interested inside of the program my goal is to teach you from scratch all the skills that you need to become a real developer which is not just the technical skills there's a lot of things to be said about their mindsets and the character traits that you will need to embody as a real developer and there's a lot of skills that you will need for example when it comes to building your CV and actually getting higher because it would suck to get to the point where you learn all these skills but you still can't get hired because you don't know how to apply for job strategically how to actually impress companies how to build your resume how to interview so that's why I've also included section is in the course that specifically teach you these skills as well because for right now some of the modules are not out yet so I'm gonna be making modules on by the web development or object-oriented programming which is going to be the next ones that's coming out I do still have the program heavily heavily discounted from the full price that it's gonna be so if you are interested the link is going to be down below right there but the price will keep going up as time goes on so make sure you don't miss out on this price point with that I hope you got value out of this video if you did I would appreciate the like down below and make sure you remember that you can do a lot more than you think I will see you in the next video
