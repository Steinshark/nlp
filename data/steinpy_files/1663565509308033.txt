#INTRO SECTION
#Hello world, Im Everett and I've been coding for 5 years. 
#I want to share what I do with youtube in a practical way, so welcome along to my journey, and maybe to yours.


#SECTION 1 
#I want to get you started coding from the get-go, so this series aims for depth not breadth.
#I encourage you to do your own research; I just want to give you at least give you the answers to ask to build coding skills on your own.
#we'll start from the very ground up; I'll assume you have the following: 1) a computer 2) an Internet connection
#Thats about it!


#SECTION 2 + CLOSING
#I'm excited to share, learn, and experience YouTube and hopefully be apart of some of your coding journeys!
#Thanks for being here
