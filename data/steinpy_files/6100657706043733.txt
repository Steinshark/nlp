#INTRO SECTION
#Hello world, Im Everett and I'll walk you through "environment setup" today.
#To code any program, you need 2 things: a way to create files filled with code, and a way to execute that code


#SECTION1 - Editor
#That first thing has many ways of being done, kind of like how you can write your essay on word, google drive, etc...
#We can similarly write our code using many different editors
#Some popular examples are VS Code, Atom, Nodepad, VIM, etc..
#We're gonna use VS Code. Follow the link in the description to end up here. #https://code.visualstudio.com/download
#Youll probably want the default option, so just click that. The file will be downloaded to your default directory.
#Lets install it
#Go ahead and accept the default settings. and finish
#Choose your theme, I always use dark. 
#Lets also install the python extension too
#Our editor is now ready to use! We can create files and fill them with code now!


#SECTION2 - Code execution (i.e. python environments using Anaconda)
#Now that we have a way to create files of code, lets create an "environment" on our own computer 
#That can actually interperet and run them.
#This is what a programming language is. It takes our files of text, which we wrote in the "syntax", or rules of
#that particular language, and instructs the computer to do as we specified in the code.
#  
#Of cource, we'll be using python for this, but c++, java, COBOL, and rust are some other examples.
#Each language has its own unique strong suits, ideal use cases, and challenges, but just know that 
#any problem solved by an "algorithm" can be solved in every programming language, provided that it is "turing complete" (all of them basicall).
#   
#There are actually several ways to setup your computer to be able to run python code, and we'll be using "Anaconda".
#This provides a nice way to handle alot of the background details that we dont need to worry about.
#Download anaconda the same way you did VS Code, and keep all the default settings.
