the rubik's cube world record has just been broken it is now 4.74 seconds check it out that is the fastest any human has ever solve a rubik's cube it was set on the weekend just gone when i was lucky enough to actually be at the uk rubik's championship where this record was not set it was actually set at a competition in indonesia by a guy called mats valk who is from the netherlands but he didn't come to the uk championship because actually studying in singapore at the moment not that i'm bitter i missed out or anything and what a phenomenal time it is under 5 seconds he managed to solve a rubik's cube and set the world record faster than i can tell you that someone has set a new world record so check it out this is my introduction from the beginning of my video you're currently enjoying and this is mats setting the world record watch the rubik's cube world record has just been broken it is now 4.74 seconds see the rubik's cube is solve faster than i can tell you about it now if you want to know how it was actually done this is the actual scramble that he started with at the beginning of the solve this is what he was faced with when he set the world record and at the end of the video i'm gonna have a breakdown of how he actually solve this rubik's cube in such a tiny tiny amount of time but before then i thought it would be nice to actually have a talk to the man who set the record and i'm actually joined here by mats valk hello mats how are you doing i'm good good thanks how are you i'm ok i'm ok you had the more successful rubik's cube competition over the weekend than i do so have you been doing none stop media since then yeah i had a lot of media inquiries like from all around the world but i also have two test last week which i had to prepare for a little more so it was completely chaos and only couple hours of sleep every night but it's a good fun did you have to fly to an interview or you just did them all over the skype or did you have to say "i'm sorry i've got a test" i stayed here at singapore i was flying back on monday but we missed our flight because we had a couple of beers on the sunday night and we woke up too late but like i've been doing a lot... so a post rubik's cube celebration were too much but yeah i think a lot of interview i was tired by calling and also some just like over the email so now when you actually broke the record were you going into the championship thinking you know "i think i'm at record breaking level" or did it come as a surprise to you as well it actually came as a big big surprise it's obviously the world record and it's not easy to beat that just if it was easy then it would already be broken already be beaten yeah so i think on the earth there are like maybe 10 people who are capable of breaking the world record and after that it's just a matter of going to a competition like being in the right shape like having a little bit of luck and doing it dead right on spot and i was fortunate enough to do that last weekend so when you got the scramble you were given did you look at it and go i'm in for a shot with a very fast time or did it just work out very nicely towards the end both to say you probably know that it's all like you solve a cross first on that scramble like i usually start with blue but i look a bit to the other colors and it turned out that green is only three moves away from the cross being solved which is yeah so it's a three twist cross yeah it is pretty nice and i was already able to see i think two pairs during the inspection so that's like not bad at all like you can do like maybe 15 moves after the cross like straight away so i knew it was gonna be a pretty decent time and i have a little bit of luck 'cause i was able to force skip the oll like at the 6th or the 7th step and i was lucky with the pll skip at the end i recreated your solve 'cause i looked up online what the scramble was at the end i... were you looking ahead and saving moves 'cause i was like well hang on that corner and edge hasn't gone in yet but you pocket it somewhere else yes knowing you can skip orientating the final layer exactly if you put it in at a different time that's the difference between 'cause a lot of people practice and get down to about 30 seconds on a rubik's cube or possibly don't but to get sub10 seconds i mean sub5 seconds time you've gotta be thinking on the fly about being you know doing things slightly different earlier to set up some efficiency later yeah yeah yeah but still you don't have to do like very fancy stuff like i did like do a forced oll skip that's not required at all to be sub10 like just with all the regular algs you should be able to easily get to eight seconds so when did you first get into rubik's cubing? like what got you to your first competition? so i started when i was 11 when 9 years ago i was still in my last year of elementary school and my teacher she brought a cube in the class and i was interested i thought it was like a impossible challenge so i was like pushing myself to learn that and then after a week i was able to solve the first two layer by myself without any help and then i went to my mom 'cause i wasn't able to solve the last layer and it turned out she still had the book from the 80' that (inaudible) how to solve a rubik's cube so she gave that to me and i started reading and reading and it took me about a week i think before i was able to solve the rubik's cube and it was just like as slow as anyone else i think it's like 10 minutes or maybe even worse and after that i was just kept practicing kept practicing and i kind of knew that there were rubik's cube competitions but at that moment i was not fully aware of that and then it was like sort of like an accident that i went to this puzzle affair and it happened that the dutch national championship was held over there yeah and i didn't want to enter first but there were some people at the competition like they convinced me to eventually do it may you know actually erik akkersdijk he was the guy who had the world record at 2008 with 7.08 seconds yes i met him at that competition and then he convinced me of actually competing at a competition i mean he didn't know what he was starting you actually have you own (inaudible) of rubik's cube i do yeah this is the one i'm using how did that happened it's a valk3 alright that (inaudible) name so i get invited last year to come to the chinese championship by this company called "qiyi mofangge" and then i went to the factory they offered me a lot of good talks and then they came up with the idea of making the valk3 like my rubik's cube so we discuss a lot on like what in my opinion would be the perfect rubik's cube and they sent me a couple of designs and i said well this is good this is bad this is good they sent a couple more design and it takes quite a long time to make those mods they took it like five month after the first design and get it actually release but now i'm really happy how it turned out i used this cube to set the world record so that's really good i think and i finally got i know how you feel about getting stuff made 'cause i run a website called maths gear where we make ridiculous mathematical toys it's a long slow process getting stuff made but i had just ordered i got some valk3 cubes that will put on maths gear you did? so i only get a couple but i thought if people watched this and they wants to get one... that would be great and now i stocked your cube you are the only cube on maths gear yeah!! that's what a honor you know you thought winning the world record was exciting my goodness being... being on maths gear... i was about to say that like i will sent you couple of these cubes but since you've already ordered down ahh! could have gotten it for free unbelievable ahh, one day so thank you very much mats valk for spending some time explaining the rubik's cube thanks for having me it was good see you soon bye cheers so how did mats take this scrambled rubik's cube and solve it so efficiently? sadly even if you take the footage from his solve and slow it down to one quarter of it's normal speed he's still moving too fast for the video to be that insightful instead i've done some research online that's how i found the exact scramble he started with i've also found the list of the individual twists he did to complete the solve so this is my breakdown of how you solve a rubik's cube in under five seconds if you like to play along this is a rubik's cube with the green facing you and red on the right this is now the scramble we have to do if you aren't familiar with the notation you've got b that represent the back face f for front, r for right, l for left face finally u for up, and d for the down face the way you see b2 that means you're gonna get the back face and rotate it twice we've now got f2 so it's the front face twice and then when you just got one letter d it mean you rotate that face in the clockwise direction so d is a single clockwise move there you've now got [sped up audio] ahh now back is a single where you see a dash means you go anticlockwise it's a single anticlockwise move on the back [sped up audio] what you end up here is the scramble that he actually faced in the competition so if you have a look at the mat you can see it's positioned like, there we go like that that's the same arrangement ok now we can actually do the solve so he started with the orange one facing him blue on the top and white over on the right we're gonna do the left anticlockwise a single twist we then the the down clockwise and then the right a complete two rotation you think what does that achieve? have a look on the bottom there's a cross so this is the cross set up and not only are these green cross ones in the position they're already lined up with the center ones on all the other faces so in those three twists he's already got the first step completed there are now four steps and each one of those steps fills in a bottom corner and matching edge so we'll do the first one first so that is a [sped up audio] so that corner pieces is now been put in to match the bottom and that edge piece is in there as well the same thing should happen when we do the next one i'm just blindly following along [sped up audio] oh now the lower case "d" means instead of rotating down anticlockwise by itself you actually rotate it with the layer above it as well so you get that [sped up audio] and if we have a look around again we will see ah over here here it is so now that so as well as the first corner over there we got this corner put in place and the next edge up up next that "y" means we have to re-orientate the cube clockwise in the vertical y axis like so [sped up audio] so we have a look there we go alright so we've now got those are in, those are in those are in all we have to do are the last two over here so right let's do that [sped up audio] we should have all four of this those are in place, those are in place, those are in place and oh they're not now this is what threw me the first time i followed these steps because i expected to see the yellow red green pair put in over here they're not here all the way around over here there they are what are they doing there? they should be in here well in this incredibly clever move mats has paired them up he also manage to pair these up and he has made he's future life a whole lot easier so let's carry on with the steps as shown so his next moves r and watch this, this is incredible so he's gone r' there u there r', face, right face' that all [inaudible] to come together here u so that's a single twist over there and then a right and that's pretty much it it's now a single u and it's solved so by not blindly putting in the fourth pair straight away but rather by hiding it somewhere else he's able to set up and save a whole lot of orientating and positioning the last layer incredible if you like to learn more about the competitive rubik's cube solving i was actually at the uk championship to make a youtube video about it so you can check that out there if it's not available yet because we're still frantically editing it which is pretty much the case at the moment then you can subscribe to my channel and you'll find out as soon as it is available but as well as all sort of other ridiculous math related videos quick thanks for this video obviously thank you very much to mats valk for being interviewed by me as well as letting me use the footage from his world record solve please do check out his youtube channel and his facebook i'll put the links down below thank to the people on the cubers subreddit they're the ones who reverse engineer what the scramble was and how mats actually solved it i'll have a link to the discussion thread around his original video down below and finally thanks to maths gear which is effectively thanking myself and some chump called steve mould so manage to get a few of the valk3 cubes on there if they proved popular we'll get some more in do check it out we have loads of other fantastic math toys :)
