do you do when there's a big bald biker guy who knows everything about your personal finances you make sure he gets the best darn intel extreme tech upgrade possible guys we're gonna have some fun today meet clarence from our accounting department hey guys we are going to be taking his living room which appears to already be adorned with electronics from work that's becoming a bit of a theme in these and we are going to turn it into a surround sound home entertainment system then we're going to take his office which i think i also recognize this triple monitor stand but that's okay it's in need of an upgrade too and we are going to be turning it into a sick battle station with three 32-inch 4k monitors also there's a memory foam bed topper king size okay not electronics but hey intel didn't specify what you have to spend your five thousand dollar budget on so let's have some fun and huge shout out to intel for sponsoring intel extreme tech upgrade here we go [music] now i have to confess this was the most surprising part of your upgrade to me because you've actually got a pretty decent laptop it's got a sixth gen processor i hate that computer oh okay then there's i've had nothing but problem with it since i bought it that's like the fifth chassis that it's been on and oh i hate that thing okay but then why did you go for such an op creator spec laptop let's get this thing fired up because it's the msi creator z16 this thing is so over the top like you don't even gain as far as i know don't but it's gonna last me the next five seven years i want something that's going to be around for a long time you know what's really funny is even internally people do a lot of their tech shopping based on ltt videos and clarence comes to me after we do the sponsored video on this which was a while back he goes give it to me straight is it actually good and i go yeah yeah it's really good so here it is with the sponsorship well behind us creator z16 core i9 11th gen rtx graphics amazing display but that you won't be using so was 327 or these are 24s i guess it was time for an upgrade yep so you're going with those are those aren't even hdmi monitors oh okay not that that matters dvi and hdmi have no signal quality not pbi pga these are these are vg oh wow okay yeah it was time okay never mind i take everything back by the way i love your calculator please tell me this has a story oh yeah this i got when i started working for the accounting firm in 2001 and it's been with me ever since i'll cry if i ever lose this calculator i won't take it it's still there's still some guys that i know from my pwc days and we talk about this calculator right casey let's get this all sorted out for you here let's get these monitors going shall we now you're not expecting to reuse this same monitor stand are you oh you're too small okay good i was hoping that you knew that the monitor stand that you took from the office no no i was in the garbage i picked it out of the garbage trailer i remember saying they could get rid of it yeah because we tried to we tried to give it away we couldn't even give it away and then clarence turns out we wanted it apparently it's just so heavy no one no one wanted it this is so janky you're using those old evga like what are these like usb to vga adapter things yep but for years those have worked fine they've done everything i need that's fair but i would have i would have at least hoped that you would use the dvd i don't put on them i didn't have dvi cables we have an entire bin of them that we never touch at the office my keyboard i've used that exact one for the last 10 years yeah that's the keyboard that i use at linus i brought it from home so i have the same keyboard linus oh really yep is that what you call work just linus sure i've heard most people shorten it to lmg or linus media how many of these you got three i have three of them my fingers know exactly where every key is and that's why i don't want to switch [laughter] i hear you i mean i can understand why you'd need this much monitor real estate at work and you have almost this much monitored real estate at work but why do you need it at home i work some private clients oh okay so it's for the same thing then essentially got it we got them hooked on that monitor candy man oh i was hooked long before i met you guys i used to work with a guy who had six wow awesome because every monitor had a purpose i totally have six now we need to talk about this because the plugable hub that clarence is using is actually not available yet this is the mk2 version 2 which we are the first people outside of pluggable that actually have our hands on it so what's different about the mark ii it has three display ports the other one had two display ports and an hdmi oh i see so it's just plus plus it does more power delivery there's a bunch more ports on the front got it it's just a cool upgrade now you said you were sure all three of them were gonna fire up yeah and i said i wasn't sure about that which side did you plug into the other side you did plug into the other side let's try that and see if it behaves a little bit differently oh now that there you go interesting so the thing about usbc is that usbc is just a connector so it depends on how that usbc female port on your device is wired up internally what its capabilities are so what that means as far as i can tell is that this side may have more displayport lanes available to it than this side potentially but let's try the other side again and what i suspect is going to happen is it's going to say no again here's my next question yes i have a 90 degree oh it's fine never mind okay good but i i have a 90 degree elbow so the cable doesn't stick that way it goes will that work i'm going to give you a big probably nod on that one this is a very edge of the edge of the spec configuration that you're running here yeah you could try it do you want to grab it if i can find it yeah give it a shot this is really cool it specifies on the back of that hub that two of the ports are display link so those are the ones being driven by the laptop's dedicated gpu and then one of them is displayport like alt mode over type c and that one has to be driven by the onboard graphics so that's what i was talking about before when i was saying it depends on how everything is linked up within your device how a usbc port might behave so we've got a compatible setup here which is great but one thing that's really important is if clarence or his kids or whatever ever wanted to actually play games this is totally capable of it it's got rtx 3060 gpu in it but we want to make sure that our middle monitor is one of the ones that's running in display link mode and actually being driven by the proper gpu how without putting anything confidential on the screen can you show us what your you know what you look like when you're in your accounting zone i tell you i'm sure yeah i've got outlook on this screen so i can monitor my email excel is usually running on this screen okay and quickbooks or whatever i need to do is my second working screen second working screen got it you know the first one to go laptop for your daily driver why did you choose a laptop over a desktop because i'm not a gamer and i take my laptop around tons of places i like the portability fair enough yeah i mean these days i'm not even you're not even giving up that much in terms of performance it's what like eight core cpu or something stupid like that it's it's going to be a long time before i have to upgrade this laptop which is why i went the way that i did yeah eight core 16 threads 32 gigs ram yeah you're right it'll be a while and that's even accounting for the clarence is one of those is the word one of those freaks who uses excel so hard that it can actually take a while to process what he's doing i think my record is something like 12 million calculations in one sheet yeah i don't i don't that doesn't surprise me yeah now come come on in to tell you got to tell me about the plan here because obviously this guy's gonna go most of this stuff is just here for looks these speakers are going these speakers are going there from a totally different system these two black ones or these two white ones are going to be the left and rights the other one's going to be my center channel and i've got these little guys they're going wireless to back behind the chairs for my full surround cool okay and i noticed that you tried to pull one over on me here by covering it up but it's still a sin to put your tv above a fireplace let the record show not a working fireplace not a working fire okay all right so at least you don't have the heat concerns but oh you know what you didn't see there's a big ass sub behind that chair oh well you can't have base without a big ass up it doesn't matter okay perfect so i guess what we're trying to decide do you have any kind of any brilliant ideas for mounting like these are supposed to be kind of like outdoor speakers i do it's gonna eventually get mounted here like this oh and i just ran out of time oh so for today we're just gonna stick it right here probably right there it'll look silly but and what is this wood-ish stuff wood-ish tm what else we got here harry potter fan but not of actually reading the books oh hold on there's a story behind that there's a story sorry i figured i figured there had to be i read to my kids every night but not harry potter that's our next series okay so we read through all of this is all the chronicles of narnia we read through you ever heard of atlanta stories best book series ever my kids cried when we read through it really we are legitimate readers in this house i read my kids every night that's good super important we're on half blood prince with my son i've been doing harry potter with him the girls were a little young we found it a little scary which is really cute all right what else can we poke around at here now this i already know this is super cute the jar of awesome contains ticket stubs for everything fun they've done for the year and then at the end they smash it on the concrete and then get their fingers all cut up digging through the stubs to see what fun stuff they did exactly you don't smash it do you no okay fair enough safety first all right what else we got here let's start digging through stuff each these are definitely stolen from work because they have work cable ties on them everything i have have cable ties uh-huh yeah but these are ltt cable ties and see sonic cable ties wow a dvd player that's good technology right there google homed up though play my favorite song it's gonna be something really embarrassing not what i imagined yeah but i've got two girls or eight and nine i just i was just expecting something like a little more hardcore you know that's what i listened to at work hail storm yeah yeah for sure without further ado let's actually get this show on the road then shelby i see you've got a big roll of rocketfish speaker wire here i guess this is what's going to drive our front speakers but the surrounds are wireless right yes okay perfect oh and we've got more speaker wire why do we need this much speaker wire i've collected it over the years and i've never used it all right okay now you said that you wanted to remove this mantle piece here and get the tv farther back so the idea is what you want to take this off yeah see these see these two brackets there should be just two screws are we going to gain that much more space though because this looks like a brick it is again nothing okay let's not do it well i mean it's i don't know it's it's a couple inches last time i heard that counts or use this takes less than that hey look you work in the accounting department you know the importance of lttstore.com all right there it is lttstore.com all right woodworking grade eight 10 out of 10. hey clarence have you ever used the bathroom in 105 yeah okay do you know that weird picture on the wall there's not much time in there there's a super weird picture it's like a a bird lizard scorpion thing in the desert oh that was so that's my grade 8 art project oh really i did not get 10 out of 10. that looks better doesn't it i was about to say i can't tell the difference i like it okay good if you're happy i'm happy now is there any reason we couldn't just mount that today what do we need for that i'd want to put a 2x4 backing up there to make it a little stronger do you have a 2x4 i do yeah you seem like the kind of guy who would have a two by four i mean look at this innovative strategy to keep the table up here you know what i don't have i don't have the right length screws no screws oh i've got screws but they'll poke out the top of the table do you have bolt cutters i don't have bolt cutters but i got an angle grinder angle grinder will do ready for some power tool action yeah all right please tell me you have eye protection you're at home but you're still technically at work you can tell he wasn't gonna he wasn't gonna use this why i gotta be here to supervise for all the goodyear 32-inch monitors are going to do you if you can't see anymore those are definitely not protective glasses well that might go in start it with these ones sorry oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yes okay so i'll keep i'll keep one good one and then i need i need three more cut off i'll go outside and finish the rest okay i believe you know i thought i was a pretty janky boy then i went to clarences and david's place how much sentimental attachment do you have to this what is this called like a side table or whatever if we poke a hole through the top i can patch it okay i think that's in the right spot and as long as we can just have a mark good okay i'm in ah nope you know neither were you did we no no no we're good okay oh sure okay yeah fine okay yeah sure okay okay great okay dude perfect getting toasty here and all we've done is mount the center channel it's kind of on there isn't it i mean if you didn't know you wouldn't know nobody's gonna know everybody's gonna know nobody's gonna know can i humbly request that we at least move them to the outside of the of the tables i'm worried about this chair actually interfering but if they fit absolutely i just put them there because i didn't think they fit what i really want is to get them two feet up i feel like it's a tall tall order i'll build two platforms off each side two little wings and i can put it on top okay i mean here's an idea decorative speaker speaker stand i have two of those you have two of these now what i would like is just some like blue tack or something like that so that we don't get vibration passing through to the the decorative subwoofer here what color plato do you think linus is going to want i'll take acoustic yellow what i'm imagining is you ever made a snake yep maybe play-doh snake so i want two snakes one at the front one at the back and it'll just help us keep the vibrations from passing from the speakers to the thing under it to be clear this is not a perfect solution clarence is going to build his wings and then that will be the proper solution in 10 years okay so we've got our front actually i guess that's it then because the others are wireless so where's your transmitter for these guys that's this that's part of the intel extreme tech upgrade yep got it that's for the rears and that's the sub oh perfect okay did you research this one or is this something that someone else advised you i've never heard of this before yeah sorry which one oh no i did research it oh okay cool this seems extremely straightforward you got your power in you got your subwoofer and line in speakers in and you got your speakers out subwoofer out volume knob yeah not a whole lot to it hey linus does that do both speakers and sub yeah it looks like it because i got separate boxes for the sub oh well i don't think you need that oh cool where do you want the sub there oh well i mean in that case why do you why are you going wireless to the sub it's right there you can go wired yeah do you have a do you have an rca cable yeah he's got an rca cable he'll find it i know why linus i don't have one long enough oh but wait then you bought a wireless subwoofer kit instead of a cable yeah oh okay yeah thanks until in that case we'll probably need the separate box anyway then so maybe you had already thought of that but just forgot did we talk about like why we choose this we didn't really have a good reason other than that i have a very good reason well i thought you just told the system cut is good but i picked wireless because i hate wires do you have any flexibility on the positioning of the subwoofers there any reason not to have it in this corner wireless move it all right my main concern and the reason for doing this is just that i don't want any more wireless devices in the room than we absolutely have to have because yes wireless has the benefit of your wires but it also has the drawback of potential interference so if we can have just one system i would prefer that i think you've stolen more cable ties than anyone else so far lttstore.com yeah but i'm the cable management master well i don't know if cable management master is necessarily the term i would use it's not even plugged in clarence it's never been used it's their cable management it's easy to cable manage when you don't have to plug anything into the wall i was waiting for you to come install it well at least you didn't wait for me to come paint your wall that was that was the worst one yeah that's right andy you're welcome where'd you get this thing from craigslist craigslist okay perfect simple for out okay you wanna power on the back unit and we'll see what happens here [music] it did not grab our rear speakers but it grabbed the subwoofer i'm gonna have a look at the front right wiring here it seems fine on this hey linus this has a volume switch it was almost off oh well that could be it you know what okay these are loose here's what i think happened this is the this is one of those speakers i forget the term for it right now but where you can drive the tweeter and the woofer separately and it's not set up that way right now okay see the inputs are just bridged but these were loose so i think what was happening was we were just driving the tweeter [music] oh watch it there there was a seventh speaker run it again [music] it's running these as subwoofer maybe that thing can't run a sub stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop mute nope ah i figured it out i felt these were more rear channels because of their positioning so i plugged them into rear and it comes up on the report oh no rear detected but it never actually tries the test tone so let's get them into the surround the regular surround not surround back ports and then i think that'll address it [music] yay yay story really starts whoa oh yeah four months ago on my team's first mission the sub works yes the sub is working oh yeah oh yeah a little bit compared to how bad the time is shaking yeah looks so much better too looks good doesn't it yeah it's way better you know what i think i'm gonna do get some black cloth and cover that speaker with black cloth heck yeah while i disapprove of the height of your tv i absolutely approve of the fact that you don't have any motion smoothing or any of that nonsense turned on we've taught you well either that or it was already set up and you didn't touch the settings when you wanted the christmas party i said it the way he said now the only thing left is the weirdest part of this upgrade the mattress topper i'm experiencing some regret about our strategy of taking everything that was in our way and dumping it here oh oh well we'll move it okay here we go we're basically just playing the the one free space game because i don't want to end up buying you a new bed i'm gonna let you do the actual crawling around before you open it let's rip all the bed sheets and everything off oh for sure okay you'll see if it breaks it's not because i touched it i'm trying to get a donut it's it's trying to expand as i as i try and slide the slip off of it is this the right size i think so it looks a little short well is it going to expand give mattress topper time to rise to intended size so yeah i think it actually just needs to sit here for a while oh i learned something the other day do you want to know how to put the sheet on right first try every time yep the tag is in the bottom right corner it's one of those usb port type things where i would try it this way then this way then this way again until finally settling see lifehack i was today years old when i learned that this guy with them with the memes with the young people slang well you gotta try it you gotta tell us how it feels all right i mean it's probably not reached its final state yet but oh okay dude lie down okay okay yeah i could get used to that that's nice all right good night hey thanks intel for sponsoring until extreme tech thanks intel this was clarence from accounting we've got upcoming man we've got brandon coming up we've got kaufman coming up and if you guys are looking for something else to watch you can check out the whole series some of my favorites include dennis riley's was amazing andes was awesome that's the one where i broke the bed not entirely my fault bye guys
