i thought i'd share with you some interesting insights i had into connections between 
mathematics and music. lots of people have talked about those connections; the idea about the notes that we use to play music have very mathematical basis, you know, going right back to pythagoras' discoveries. whole number ratios determine the kind of notes that we find harmonic. rhythm clearly has a 
lot of mathematics in it. in fact, the fibonacci numbers were discovered not by mathematicians, fibonacci; no not at all, actually discovered by indian musicians because it counts the number of rhythms you can make out of long and short beats. but i wanted to talk about something a little bit more conceptual and a use of mathematics in a cunning way to to make a composition. and actually almost like a shortcut to composition. a mathematician's favourite composer? top of the list probably comes bach. because of this idea that bach uses a lot of mathematical tricks as a way of generating music, so his music is highly complex but actually at its heart are the use of mathematics as a kind of shortcut to generate extraordinary complex music. indeed so much so that some of his music he writes almost as little puzzles for the player to kind of unravel; and these puzzles are a bit like code. in fact i would almost call bach the first computer coder because he's got little algorithms that he uses in his music which the player has to somehow understand and expand into the complex sound world that bach creates. so you see this in musical offerings. so the musical offering is actually a lot of variations on a theme that a king played to him and he then improvised on these ideas. but he then went away and wrote these lovely little pieces of music based on this theme but he used kind of mathematics to generate the music. let me show you an example of one, this is one called the crab canon. so this is- actually interestingly i got this the wrong way around - this is in fact how bach wrote the music. it looks like just one line of music where you'd just be playing this piece of music but what's curious is when you get to the end of the music there's the little symbols you usually begin a piece of music with but they're at the end. so what bach is asking you to do is to actually play this forwards and backwards, he's asking you to start at the end and play it backwards at the same time. so this little symbol here at the end of the piece of music is actually code he's using to generate a two voice piece just 
with one line of music. here we see sort of symmetry, playing the two together to generate music. his artistry really is being able to write a piece of music, then apply a little bit of mathematics to it, to create something that together makes something beautifully harmonic and complex.
- (professor, not being a musician i) (have no clue by looking at that. how) (different do those two pieces of music) (sound when you flip it?)
- that's really interesting. i think you'd be hard pushed if i played you both of them separately to hear that they were in fact the same piece of music just played in a different way, and i think that's the cleverness of bach. so it sounds like two completely different voices; and if you think about it, one starting at the end of the piece and playing backwards, the other one's at the beginning. so it'd be very hard i think for you to hear that connection because you know you've got to almost hear the whole piece to really understand that, oh that's the same piece but just turned upside down. you know if you just randomly write a tune, turn it upside down and play it together, it's not going to sound good. so the art of doing this is to to find something that will work where you do these kind of symmetrical tricks to generate a piece. one in particular i wanted to show you, because it actually relates to a beautiful mathematical shape that many of your viewers probably have seen before, a mobius strip. absolutely amazing that bach wrote one of these little canons that, when you understand it mathematically, you realise oh my gosh this is actually playing a piece of music on a mobius strip. sometimes people think this crab canon that's what i just showed you is a mobius strip, and there's a wonderful video you can find on youtube which pretends this is a mobius strip. but frankly that's a cheat and i'd like to show you a canon that bach wrote that genuinely does deserve to be put on a mobius strip. people might have heard of a beautiful piece of music that bach wrote called the goldberg variations; which is actually again 30 variations on an aria that he starts with and there's a lot of mathematics that goes into that piece as well. but following that he then wrote 14 of these little puzzle canons - again, there's a little bit of code which you've got to unwrap and understand how to play the piece of music. so one of them, the fifth of these 14 canons, he just writes a line of music and then tells you at some point you've got to reflect the music in the horizontal line. so when a line goes up he says actually i also want you to play it simultaneously going down; but he then puts this little symbol which makes you realise doesn't want you to play that immediately he wants you to play it a bit like a canon. so a canon is like those rounds you play at school where one half of the class starts singing-
"frere jacques, frere jacques" and then the second half of the class joins in a little bit later. so he says, okay, i want you to do this: you're going to play this line of music, you're going to turn it upside down but play it a little bit later, and together that's going to generate this fifth canon. i put it on long strip of music here. so these are the two voices, one is a reflection of the other just delayed in time. if i now take this piece of music and i make a mobius strip out of it - so i'm going to take this and do my little twist and then we're going to wrap this around here. you know, you can make a mobius strip out of any piece of music. the stunning thing is that when you then look at this piece of music actually the notes that are on one side are exactly the same notes as if this thing was see-through. and in fact i've prepared one for you earlier on a piece of plastic paper. so you're going to play this by running around the mobius strip. so you will start on one side and you will go through but when you get to the other side you're reading the reflection of the the piece; and so this is genuinely music played on a mobius strip. bach's genius is to find something that just sounds beautiful when these two- two- the one side of the mobius strip is played together. you know, it shows why bach's contemporary, mizler, really was right when he said that bach's music is the process of sounding mathematics. and here we're- we're hearing the sound of this mobius strip with this fifth canon. (professor, do we know anything of his) (education or his writings or anything) (that indicates this 
was a passion of his) (or has it all sort of been found) (retrospectively?)
- i think there's just too much evidence to show that bach knew exactly what he was doing. first of all, these canons are written in in a code. they're- he understands what he's doing, he's understanding that yeah i'm doing a reflection, i'm shifting- you know these are symmetrical moves that you see made you know like on walls of the alhambra. symmetry is all about these moves, reflection, glides, so it's clear that bach knew what he was doing. also, if you go to something like the goldberg variations there's just so much structure in there that you can't just randomly come across. for example, in the variations he makes sure that all the different combinations of rhythms that are possible are realised in some of the canons. you know, you can break a bar up into two beats, three beats, 
or four beats; and each beat might be quavers, triplets, or semiquavers. he realises there are kind of nine different combinations you can do of those three things and three things - you can't just realise that randomly. so there's a lot of evidence, and in fact at the time bach and his contemporaries set up a society. it was called the society for correspondence in the musical sciences or something like that. it was a collection of people coming together to talk about the ideas of mathematics and music and their connections. and bach insisted on being the 14th member to join that group because he was obsessed with the number 14. why? because bach's name, when you translate it using kind of like this kabbalistic idea of turning letters into numbers: b is the second letter, a first, c third, h eighth - add those up you get to 14. so bach's signature number - and he uses it even in his composition - he always felt was 14. bit like a football player with a number on their back; bach's number on the back of his shirt was the number 14 and so he insisted i want to be the 14th member to join this group.
- (here's my question: what number is) (du sautoy?) yes i should find that out, it's probably- let's hope it's a prime number. (i'm going to calculate it. 
i'm dying to know now.) make sure you see the video description for more videos and a podcast with marcus du sautoy. there will also be links to his latest books, details of his performances, and plenty of other useful information.
