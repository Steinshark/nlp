- i gave my friends one
hour to spend $10,000. and while they were doing that, i smashed their cars with meteors. and after that, i took them all to a dealership
and bought them new cars. you each get $10,000 to
buy whatever car you want. you guys have one hour to spend $10,000. here you go. go spend 10 grand, have fun. - when's it start? - it starts now. - let's go, let's go. crank it up. - bye. so what store do you want? - best buy. i mean, we only got an hour. - what else? - we have giant meteors, a crane and a forklift. we're going to take a meteor and we're going to put it on weddle's car. we're going to take another meteor and put it on marcus's car. both of them have no idea
that we're doing this. and then we're going to
take a bunch of mannequins and put them in chandler's car. and we're also filling
chris's car with bouncy balls. basically, all four people
out spending $10,000 is going to get pranked. but for clarification, only these two getting smashed
by meteors, get new cars. let's do it. this one is too small. outer space wouldn't send this. this one right here. this one goes on marcus's truck. can you put it on their jake? - no. - all right. chandler knows we're smashing their cars, so he's going to stall
them a little bit longer, so we have more time to smash
their cars with meteors. but what he doesn't know
is we're also buying time to fill his car with mannequins. love you, chandler. - let's go get a mower! - this is like when your
dad takes you to home depot and you don't want to go to home depot. - an amateur football player, right before the playoffs. - very good, let's whip it. so i just bought a lawnmower. but this isn't any lawnmower marcus., this is the cadillac of lawnmowers. - the bugatti. - the bugatti. - it does have hydraulics. - we're in marcus's car, but before we destroy it with the meteor, i want to show you how terrible it is. okay, i have it in drive, but i think that means neutral. from what i heard, it's one off. yep, it's one off. how is this even street legal? marcus, why is your car beeping? and why does it smell like my grandma? - struggling there? - it's stuck. - it's stuck. - somebody help me. all right, car number two is jake weddles. there's literally food everywhere. i see a french fry. - it smells like pizza in here. - it does smell like pizza. marcus' smelled like his grandma, jake's smells like pizza. it does start. i'm shocked. i'm going to take this
car for a test drive, then we're going to
smash it with a meteor. then we're going to give him
$10,000 to buy a new car, which is a lot, 'cause
this car's worth $800. and i'm also giving him
$10,000 to spend on rent. geez, how much is this going to cost me? - a lot, dude. - okay. i need a loan. oh, okay, right off the bat, this does work better than marcus' car. what is that sound? what is that? okay, it stopped. think that means i'm going to live. besides the french fries, pee stains and what is that beeping? - we're going to get kicked out. we're going to get kicked out so fast. - whenever best buy sees us coming, they're like, oh god, i got to get a camera, so
i can record my standup. i got to get in oculus, that's some funsies and
something for my gf, you know something nice,
'cause i got this money now. - so jake and marcus don't know this, but at the end of the day,
they're getting a new car. and jake was like, oh,
this is really cool, i'm glad i got to be a part of this, this is really fun. he doesn't know he is about
to get a freaking car, bro. he's going to wild out. - chris! - yeah? - they got it. - oh. - all right, should you build him a pc, or
should we buy one from here? - i can build him a pc
from parts from here. they sell parts here now. - there we go. there we go. - all right, i want the best pc ever. - we getting the boys hooked up right. - so before we can smash
this car with the meteor, we got to take everything out of it. the first thing is head to toe pure oil, a gift card, a wall charger. this cute little toy. the hat that marcus wears. this. mouthwash. a tissue. - ew. - barbecue. clothes. - is this beast wear? no. - and next up we're doing weddle's car. it literally just looks
like a bunch of junk. sorry, weddle, we're just
going to leave it how it is. all right, this is taking
way longer than we thought, so we're going to tell
them we need another hour. i'm going to unmute it. - what's up man? - hey, so we're really taking a while to spend our $10,000. so we're increasing the
time limit to three hours, is that okay? - yeah. we'll go get
ourselves a nice lunch. - i got to catch you later,
we're about to drive off. - okay. love you bye. - bye. - he didn't say i love you back. - what am i at right now? - don't make him do
math bro, math is hard. - you're at 604. - oh bro, you good. yeah. - bro's, look at the receipt. we wildling. dude, we're the new mr. beast, bruh. - look how long it is. - look at that thick boy. that's a thick boy right there. woo! - all right. so we put a gopro up there, hopefully that looks cool. i'm sorry for what we're
about to do to your car. we're going to buy you a
new one worth 10 times more. - all right, houston, we have a problem. - so, it is smashed, but
it's not smashed enough. i wanted it to do like a u shape. so, everyone sledge hammer it, especially you viking, have fun. oh my god! there we go. yeah! so according to my calculations, weddle car has been hit by a meteor. i wonder what weddle is doing right now. - i'm a king today. look at this, my kingdom of seafood. - all right. now onto marcus's. putting meteors on cars takes a little more time than i thought. so i'm going to call chris
and see what they're up to. - hey, what's going on? - how's your day going? - pretty good. how's your day going? - great. we're closing up. we're going to the final two stores. how are you guys doing? - we are taking a quick
break at red lobster. - that's, oh- we still have a little ways to go, when do you think you'll be done by? - oh, we can do this all day, 'cause we are planning on getting the eyebrows done afterwards. - yeah. keep going, go do your eyebrows, go do a bunch of things and we're good. - okay. sounds good. - all right, see you in a
little bit. keep me updated. weddle's car has a meteor, now it's time for marcus's car. i'm sorry for what we're
about to do to your car. bring the meteor. all right, i'm ready. i don't want to get hurt. wow. a meteor fell from the sky. - i didn't know this was a mall, i thought this was like a home depot. - have you never been to the mall? - no, never. - what? - i never had red lobster either. - what? - yeah, i know. - what? - you guys are taking
me on a journey, man. - i've destroyed a lot of cars in my life. we speared this one. we flipped this one. shot a cannon at one. i don't know, just play
the rest. we've done a lot. now we're going to start
smashing in the car with some of these items. here you go. here you go. here you go. just destroy it, have fun boys. just go hard. jake, you get the little one. here you go. yeah, don't complain, just go beat it up. that's what i like to see. marcus, your truck
belongs to the junk yard. - yes queen. yes, queen. - all right, now it's
time to spray paint it, to make it look like a meteor. - i got to pick your shoes out. - oh god. oh god, yeah, sure. that sounds fine. - what'd you get? - i got some shoes so i can go jogging. - oh, the vapormax. tough. - shoes. - and socks. - now it's time to fill
chandler's car with limbs. alright. - don't forget heads. - another butt. so as we're filling chandler's car with just tons of mannequin limbs, i wonder what he's up to. - i'm going to get a pinky ring. - you're going to get
an actual pinky ring? - should i get one? - i like thumb better thumb. - thumb ring? what the? - anyways, can't be better than this. that is creepy. next, we're going to put a
lot of balls in chris's truck, because he likes balls. what? pink is what chris wanted. okay. yep. cool. - hello. - hey, so we just finished. where are you guys at? - we're at the mall. - go ahead and start
making your way back here, whenever you're ready. we just finished all of jake's
shopping, so we're good. - we'll head back to the church. all right. bye. - what do you think their reaction's going to be like? - so the white car is weddle and he's going to be kind of funny, he's a comedian, he'll have a one liner. the truck is marcus. he's literally going to scream. he's going to jump up and down. he's going to be going i guarantee you. chris and chandler,
they don't see it coming and they're just going to be like, what? - let me just tell you guys, the fun never stops. - are we going to go shopping again? - yep. - that's them, they just pulled up. oh boy. oh boy. oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. - hold on. it's only one, but it's
only one white truck with red stripes like that. - dude. - what is in my car? - why did they do it to my car? - weddle and marcus are probably shocked. they had no idea. - dude, marcus is not
getting out of the car. - my car is on fire! why is my car on fire? - i didn't do it bro, i didn't do it. - i had change in here. i was going to do laundry with my change. - what is he doing? - bruh! - didn't you pay attention
to that spongebob episode? the pioneers used to ride
these babies for miles. - where? - marcus is- - who's marcus calling? - who knows. - is he calling 911 on me? - i'm about to facetime my mom right now. - yo, come record this man. - okay. - it got hit by a meteor bruh. - you got a low rider now. - what do you think of your new car? - i better have a new one. - i'm sure it still runs. did you have anything valuable in it? - speakers. - did you? - sounded really good. - oh really? - i mean, the engine might
not have sound really good- - yeah, because we took it on a test drive and it was screeching. - how do you, this is so heavy. - they're 8,000 pounds a pop. - it came from space. - your car only weighs 2000 pounds. - you weighed it? - yep. - oh. - you guys already
