almost everybody whether you live in a small rural village or a large urban metropolis has access to the entirety of human knowledge through a small device like this in their pocket that is an insane feat but only a hundred years ago in the 1920s radios were just coming to the homes of the american citizen they ran anywhere from 40 to 100 which in today's currency is almost a thousand dollars for a radio so how do we go from a thousand dollar radios to a 10 single board computer with over a thousand times the processing speed of those devices back in the day well you can thank this rock for the technological explosion that's happened over the last hundred years and not specifically this rock but the element that's found commonly in this rock is silicon but before we talk about the technology that silicon created we have to discuss a technology that silicon replaced in the 1950s there were computers but they weren't the same as the ones we have today computers in the 50s were all controlled by vacuum tubes as the name implied a vacuum tube was a glass tube that contained a vacuum on the inside that would control the flow electricity through a heated plate by heating an electrically charged plate referred to as a cathode inside of the tube the electrons on the plate would undergo thermonic emission to the anode on the other side to control how many electrons went across this gap in the vacuum a control grid was put in the middle that would control how much electricity went across the gap for the sake of electronics being able to control the flow of electricity with electricity is fundamental to create logic circuits even in the early 1940s data was stored as a series of ones or zeros electrical voltages that say that the voltage is either on or off lot project gates are a way to do logical operations on whether or not two signals are on and off for example an and logic gate will be positive if both ends of the and gate are on or another example is the nor gate the opposite of or if one or the other is on then the result is zero using these logic gates together you're able to create circuits that represent human logic and the foundations of computer programming by combining one or more vacuum tubes you're able to create logic like the nor gate the not or gate or the nand gate the not and gate by combining the nor gate and the nand gate together you can effectively create the logic for any circuit now vacuum tubes as the name implied contained a vacuum and only worked under those conditions because they are made out of glass and required heat hence thermonic emission they were extremely bulky and impossible to maintain if the glass broke on the vacuum tube for example the vacuum tube no longer transfer the electrons and you no longer could have the logical property of the vacuum tube as the circuit grows in complexity the circuit also physically grows in the size that it occupies because of how large vacuum tubes work this made any vacuum tube logic circuit very heavy and power hungry because of this these devices were extremely expensive and hard to move around for example this circuit here which is huge power hungry and expensive is a flip-flop circuit used to contain a single bit of information so how do we go from a single bit being this size to billions of bits being this size and sitting in my pocket this is where silicon comes in silicon is classified as a semiconductor a semiconductor lives in the gray area between conductors and insulators a conductor for example like copper that easily transmits electricity it conducts electricity and glass which is an insulator that conducts no electricity a semiconductor will or will not conduct electricity based on some variants in its physical prop properties such as the material's temperature now a semiconductor on its own is not very useful the conductivity of a semiconductor is not predictable or exploitable in a way that is useful to electronics engineering to make a semiconductor more useful one must change the electrical properties of the semiconductor to make it more useful for electronics engineering in the early 1940s the patent was released for the ability to turn a semiconductor into a more useful material referred to as doping to dope the silicon and make it more useful the silicon atoms were blasted with atoms that are either more negative or more positively charged than the silicon by doing this you're able to create two types of semiconductors that could be used in electronics by doping the silicon with a more negatively charged atom you create a donor or an n-type semiconductor or by doping it with a more positive atom you create an acceptor or a p-type semiconductor n and p-type semiconductors on their own are both equally pretty boring but when you put them together this is where the magic begins to happen by putting a p in an n-type semiconductor together you create what is called a p n junction the pn junction is the foundation of all electronics in the modern era and is the foundation of the diode and transistor electronic components where the p and the n semiconductors meet a barrier is created the p side has holes for electrons and the n side has free electrons to give by putting these two together you create a barrier where electricity can only flow in one direction this on its own is the diode now this is where silicon comes to life and it's awesome if we then take two pn junctions and make an npn or a pnp device we create a device with three fields we have a collector an emitter and a base by applying a voltage at the base we're able to control how much current flows from the emitter to the collector and what does that mean what have we done we have created a device that doesn't use vacuum tubes that is able to control the flow of electricity from one part of a circuit to another we have created a device that will replace the vacuum tube that has no vacuums and no heat required this device known as the transistor heralded the electronics revolution of the 1950s and 60s transistors went about and replaced every vacuum tube and monitored electronics and shrunk the size of machines used to occupy entire rooms down to circuits that could fit in the palm of your hand the first transistor was invented in 1947 by scientist bratton shockley and bardeen at bell labs in holmdel new jersey interestingly enough the first transistor they invented actually didn't use silicon at all it used germanium which is an element that was thought to be more easy to find and easier to produce and cheaper than silicon the problem with germanium was two things one germanium actually ended up being more rare than silicon as mining technology advanced in the 1950s but also germanium broke down at 80 degrees celsius chemically which meant meant that as the transistor was used in amplification settings the germanium would actually melt in those transistors in 1958 jack kilby and robert noyes took these transistors and turned them into ics or integrated circuits that allowed you to compute extremely complicated digital logic and its ship that's about the size of your finger this also made electronics more reliable by reducing the amount of parts in a system that could break and reducing all the logic to a single chip if that ship went bad you buy that same ship and replace it as opposed to having to have an inventory of thousands of different capacitors and resistors that each could break individually integrated circuits in the 1950s and 60s were extremely expensive because they were hard to produce but as time went on new methods of manufacturing allowed for these devices to become cheaper and cheaper to produce in bulk methods like photo lithography that use light to create patterns of transistors on silicon wafers as well as atomic disposition that allow manufacturers to produce very specific layers of chemicals to create ics in mass all also these processes have made it easier for transistors to get smaller and smaller therefore reducing the size of electric devices for example taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company or tsmc has plans to produce a two nanometer transistor in 2025. two nanometers is an insanely small size so small that you're actually going to the point where you have issues in the realm of quantum physics about how the electrons are behaving inside of the transistor despite these issues the transistor has brought significant change to the world upgrading us from the early days of vacuum tube technology to the day where i literally have access to anything i want to know in my front pocket we could not have gotten here without transistors and we could not have gotten transistors without the rock that changed the world silicon if you like this video hit subscribe and we'll see you in the next one foreign
