northern australia is australia's last frontier and also its most vexing economic development puzzle people have long dreamed of turning its vastness into a bountiful breadbasket it might be possible but there remain formidable challenges in the way for over 30 years starting in the 1960s the australian government built a series of dams to divert the waters of the 650 kilometer or 405 mile long ord river for irrigation over a billion australian dollars went into the project since 1950 and the water eventually did flow but a maybe surprising thing happened the farms would not make money northern australia is one of the largest land masses in the tropics in this case the tropic of capricorn it spans the states of western australia the northern territory and queensland at about 3 million square kilometers or 1.2 million square miles northern australia is about the size of india by itself it would be the seventh largest country in the world yet despite its vastness very few people live there only about a million mostly in a few small urban areas like the city of darwin within this massive area is the ored river valley it's formerly located in the kimberley region in the state of western australia it is named after sir harry george ord governor of western australia from'77 to'80. the ored river region has long been a high potential target for a dam since the'70s explorer alexander forest first surveyed the area and noted that cotton and sugarcane could be grown there in the 1940s the kimberley research station was established to study the area's agricultural potential scientists noted the presence of crop pests and questioned whether such an irrigation project could be economically viable despite these initial misgivings the western australian government asked the federal government to consider an ord river scheme and in 1958 the commonwealth passed a bipartisan plan partially motivated by the upcoming elections as originally planned in the 1960s the project would be executed in three stages it would start with the creation of a diversion dam to irrigate ten thousand hectares of land after that would be the construction of the main dam a project to create a very large permanent reservoir fully realized this would add another sixty thousand hectares of agricultural quality land to the area the final piece will be the construction of a large hydropower station stage one of the scheme the diversion dam later to be named the diversion dam at kinonura began in 1963 and finished two years later at a cost of 6 million australian dollars 83 million in 2013 dollars the federal government now had 10 000 hectares of agriculture quality land 31 cotton farms were founded to begin producing the cash crop and the town of kuninura was established to serve as an industrial base for the cotton industry having finished this first stage of the project the federal government quickly turned to executing the scheme's second stage but that same year economist bruce davidson published the book the northern myth this famous book was very critical of the ord river project davidson argued that agriculture in australia's north was in general uneconomic especially in cash crops like cotton and rice the north already had a large agricultural industry made up mostly of sprawling dry land cattle farms the land mostly cultivated grass for grazing their presence hinted at the land's inability to support high-value high-effort crops like cotton or rice even if the water was to be made available regardless cotton output in the ord did boom throughout the 1960s but as feared insects and other pests attacked the cotton crop farmers spend 50 percent of their total budget applying pesticides up to 30 times a season furthermore the area did not have robust rail transportation links as a result goods had to be trucked in and out sending costs sky high farmers stayed in the market only due to the presence of explicit price supports and subsidies from the government such a situation should probably force a re-evaluation of the entire scheme why move forward with these expensive irrigation projects if the farmers need additional subsidies to stay in business but the federal government felt that they had to move forward with the scheme for political reasons they first wanted to keep their campaign promises and second they wanted to develop agricultural jobs for the local aboriginal people a people by the way who has never consulted on the project's first stage and since then has received title to the area and third they saw the national security value in developing the australian north there is a risk in the area being too depopulated such a fear dates back to world war ii when people thought the japanese might have invaded the continent thus in 1969 the government moved forward with building the ored main dam but at a reduced scale from the original plan completed three years later the dam created one of australia's largest freshwater reservoirs lake argyle at a cost of 48 million australian dollars 700 million in 2013 this expanded the total amount of irrigated land in the area to 14 000 hectares that same year in 1972 the federal government removed the cotton subsidies the cotton farmers lost their ability to compete against growers in other parts of the country and those farms quickly closed down studies in 1978 confirmed that those cotton farmers were unable to profitably farm in the area without subsidies from the western australian state government again harsh conditions crop pests and high transportation costs were the reasons the poor results finally convinced the government to re-evaluate things and the hydropower station the third part of the plan was never built the improvements of what is now referred to as the ord stage one were not super encouraging but over time the agricultural industry in the valley began to literally bear fruit recommendations from agricultural scientists led to improve crop diversification and a move away from broad crop fields growing perennial and annual horticultural crops like bananas rock melons watermelons and mangoes brought the first signs of success later on improved pest management and new gmo variants brought chickpeas soybeans and indian sandalwood throughout the 1980s and 1990s the ored river valley's total cropped area rose from less than 3 thousand hectares to almost 13 000. production value grew at a mean annual rate of 21 despite this there were still major setbacks some initial success in sugar cane production showed some promise and soon sugar turned into the ord valley's great hope eventually in 1995 a mill was built at its peak the mill produced and exported 55 000 tons of sugar a year but a global decline in sugar prices the mill's small scale and the cost of trucking the sugar to the nearby port of wyndham led to its sale in 2000 and complete dismantling by 2008. today half of the original 14 000 irrigated hectares is for indian sandalwood it is great that the land is being used but these fragrant long-lived trees don't need a lot in terms of maintenance in other words these farms don't employ a lot of people and according to wikipedia it takes about a decade before they are viable for harvesting it's really long term finally in 2008 the cabinet approved a 220 million dollar expansion of the ord project water and road infrastructure would be built to service a thousand hectares of land this was expected to complete by 2011 a construction time of about two years a second expansion was added a year later as part of a 4.7 billion dollar economic stimulus package passed in response to the global financial crisis this allocated 195 million australian dollars for the construction of 27 social infrastructure projects including educational and health facilities the political impetus behind the expansion was again that the ord valley could be a food bowl for the growing middle class of the asian nations such an expansion would shore up the local economy and provide jobs for the aboriginal people of east kimberley in 2012 the government granted a 50-year lease to the kimberley agricultural investment company an australian subsidiary of the chinese company shanghai jungfu to develop this 8 000 hectare land parcel this would later expand to 13 000 hectares if all went well with later expansion plans however this entire expansion drives all extensive delays and cost overruns firstly the 220 million dollar irrigation expansion project was underscoped and the originally cited completion time of two years was unrealistic the project was finally completed in 2014 rather than 2011 and this pushed back everything else additionally the original 220 million dollar budget grew to 334 million dollars a 52 increase most of these costs went to construction project management and administration legal and environmental costs as well as the cost of building a workers camp made up the rest troublingly when the auditor general requested a more detailed breakdown of the individual costs one could not be provided so we're not quite sure why this went over by so much requiring an additional 91 million dollar grant from the federal government kimberly agricultural had originally proposed a future investment of 700 million dollars including 425 million dollars for a sugar mill capable of producing 500 000 tons of sugar and ethanol annually that would be greatly expanded as the ord scheme developed by 2016 though partly due to the delays in the original irrigation project none of that had happened yet the company had cleared just 1 600 hectares with about half of that used for growing chia and sweet sorghum the second part of the expansion plan the 195 million social infrastructure construction projects completed on budget but not on time the original complete date was 2010 but final completion came in may 2013 three years late with regards to social outcomes for the whole expansion project there were tangible albeit unmeasured social benefits life was improved for the community thanks to the new buildings like an expansion to a local school and 200 aboriginal people worked on the irrigation project 21 of total employment and above expectations most of this was as i said unmeasured but real anyway i'm going to end our brief breakdown here in the year 2016 but the federal government continues to scope out further possible investments in the area this includes assessments of up to 30 000 hectares in cockatoo sands and 9070 hectares in the mantania area so it seems like successive administrations hold out hope that further irrigation projects can eventually lead to agricultural success in the ord and in some ways they are not wrong you can definitely see that literal green shoots have emerged from what before had been very rough land but at the same time you have to say that these governments have poured a whole lot of money into the projects with seemingly little to be had for it counting public money alone over a billion and a half australian dollars have gone into the venture since the 1950s yet today the cattle industry still dominates the wyndham east kimberley area both in terms of agricultural output and employment same as it did all those decades ago so what's going on here fundamentally i think it goes back to those core issues raised by davidson back in the 1960s ord valley agriculture is at a disadvantage in the market and lacks business viability that will not change even after the water becomes available northern australian soil is not rich enough to grow many high value crops the area is too remote to truck inputs in and ship outputs out and there is a shortage of cheap available labor to tend to these crops especially with the mining industry involved in the area too all these obstacles require money to overcome raising farmers costs but on the revenue side they have to compete with low-cost labor competitors in the asian tropics for instance australian mangoes versus indonesian mangoes as well as compete against the high value experienced farmers in the australian south who have been cultivating soils there for over a century the revenues can't balance the costs without subsidies from the government the government will have to decide if that's what they want to fund on an ongoing basis in lieu of other opportunities northern australia on the whole continues to attract proposals for agricultural development but there is a reason why these dreams have yet to turn into reality without close study of these circumstances these breadbasket projects might again turn into bottomless money pits alright everyone thanks for watching that's it for tonight remember
