we accidentally put an influencer in jail and today i want to tell you the story of how it happened 24 hours ago i listened on a call as the popular instagram influencer jay mazzini pled guilty to many of the crimes i accused him of two years ago and finally today i can say it's no longer alleged he said he did it and now he faces serious prison time for his scams now not only that he also has to pay millions of dollars in damages and this is such an incredible win for this channel for what this channel represents fighting for victims holding scammers accountable that i just kind of wanted to take a second to celebrate it because now if you're an influencer in the past you were able to just say oh i've got featured on coffeezilla nothing's gonna happen but now you have to wonder you have to wonder what am i going to be doing in two years what are my plans because look probably nothing's going to happen to you but there's that one percent chance now that maybe something will and that's the point now we get to strike fear in the hearts of these scammers influencers are going to be launching new nfts wondering is coffee still coming for me and the answer to that question is yes of course i am now i do want to obviously say i think this goes without saying but i'll say it anyways i cannot take credit for all of this or even most of this without your support none of this would have been possible without the victims who came forward on this channel none of this would have been possible and without law enforcement who put in two years of like actual legal work to make this happen none of this would have been possible so i'm not trying to say i cuffed the guy or say anything like that but this channel played a small role in bringing this guy to justice and i am incredibly proud of that because as i said in the title this was absolutely not the plan total accident you guys know i mean i run a youtube channel most of the time we cover scammers nothing happens it's a meme on this channel like hey we covered this guy we have hard evidence that he scammed people and nothing happens so i fully expect it when i covered james that it would be more of the same he'd get away with it but that didn't happen because i i think i can talk about this the way all this unfolded was so bizarre because one day my wife gets a call and she's like hello and they're like hi can we speak to me coffee zilla and we're with so and so some three-letter government organization and my wife literally hung up on them she she thought it was a scam you know i guess i've taught her well she's like no shot you would have had his real number and she comes to my office she's like hey there's this new scam going around these guys are pretending to be like you know this real government organization and they say they wanted to talk to you whatever obvious scam and i'm looking at her i'm like is it though like let's he was very it's very real so i call it like so i come back that's what i'm saying this very much almost never happened i mean this could have very much accidental so i call him back and i'm like sorry about that and so then i talked to them for a bit and a month later you know i'm watching this guy plead guilty to a lot of the very things that we accused him of sorry i saw him get charged two years later we see him plead guilty to the stuff we accuse him of and yeah he admitted to wire fraud wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering which i think the as i said the recommended sentence is eight to ten years which is just insane and i think just sets such a good precedence for people who think they can scam online and get away with it they think that just because you're an influencer the rules don't apply to you and clearly that's not true so yeah i just wanted to tell this story i don't think i've ever shared that part of it before because you know things were still getting worked out and you know it's just it's just wild that a little channel like this could have done much of anything or made a difference and and yeah i'm really proud of you guys i'm proud of what we did and i just wanted to kind of celebrate it's a it's a really big deal i'm proud of it and thank you guys for sharing this journey with me if you haven't seen it it's wild it's been a wild ride thanks a lot i'll see ya
