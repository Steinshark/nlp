i want you to stop typing on garbage and i've got just the thing to make it happen with some help from our labs team and my new robot friend here i intend to make sure that you never get fooled by flashy marketing again it presses it stresses it undresses hey yeah not all the cameras on you yep cave here is programmed to do all sorts of useful things but most importantly he's designed to give you some of the most accurate and precise keyboard data on the market so no manufacturer can get away with bs in their product specs ever again be afraid keyboard makers be very afraid afraid of this segue to our sponsor zoho1 zoho one brings together sales marketing finance analytics and support in a single unified platform to run your entire business try zoho won today for 30 days using the link down below when your corsair k70 pro or logitech g915 rolls off the production line it goes through a series of qc or quality control checks to make sure that every little piece of it is within the manufacturer's specified tolerances do the switches work do they chatter does the rgb light does the chassis line up is the cable freighter the logos upside down or off center all of these things and more are checked before your keyboard goes into the box out the door and finally lands on your desk but a quality controlled product is not necessarily a quality product brands love to use words like precise but then stay conveniently quiet when you ask for details how precise what is your specified error tolerance i mean think about it if the force to push down w and s let's say was allowed to be plus or minus ten percent the difference could be as much as 20 between them is that going to cost you a critical hit what if you were to push the space bar here instead of here will it feel the same will it work at all with the flex of ryzen 4s we intend to find out it's got seven degrees of freedom can move payloads as heavy as three and a half kilograms and can reach over 780 millimeters we've spent months getting this guy up and running to a degree that we deem satisfactory to start sharing the data with you okay second jake show me what you got is cherry mx's plus minus 10 accurate what what actually works so far well we haven't actually started cherry mx but on this particular keyword what we've done is we've taken it we've placed it into the build area and tightened these little screws up against it so that it doesn't move it is moving that's well only if you push it the robot's not going to move it what we're doing is we're taking the computer vision okay and we're actually taking a series of different frames we're composing those over top of each other after we do edge detection so we can actually see where each of the keys are so we can tell the size of the key the shape of the key so once that's done the robot will move down onto the center point of each key press down measure the force as it travels and then measure it as it releases as well doing this gives us not only the force graph for the switches being used on the board but also it lets us know if any of the switches are out of spec but how accurate slash precises it what is this exactly it looks a little suggestive this is antoine's handiwork it wasn't my first choice okay what this is this is a 3d printed finger and effectively it's a finger yeah it's a finger for sure pg show this is actually connected to the force load cell built into the robot so when we press down we're actually able to record the precision at 0.001 newton so really really fine detail this is way better than what we had during our like last tour where we had like a prototype thing of this oh way way better yeah we replaced the previous system because because the gantry system that we had actually has issues with moving and vibration this is really stable with a high amount of repeatability which means that we're not going to run into those issues and dirty our data we want things to be cleanliness is it supposed to be doing things like were we going to start it at some point yeah as soon as as soon as we have a cue antoine can hit e and it'll start moving yeah yeah yeah yeah it will move fast whoa hey whoa how you doing okay well yeah do the thing i mean did you stop it no he didn't but we moved to the keyboard that's all is this one of those things where you like get the demo ready for the ceo and then the ceo leaves and it didn't actually it wasn't actually working of course this is all pre-programmed and then you move the keyboard it took an image of the area and detected where the keys were yeah and then we moved to the keyboard yeah i see so obviously it hasn't can't see it okay it's too close to a new image yeah we can do it i guess if i'm like bumping this in the middle of the thing that ruins everything oh yeah we're not going to use this data for any publishing this is just to show you and to show liners what you're seeing here is an hsv version of the camera image and this is for calibration purposes so if the camera gets bumped or moves what we're going to do is we're going to find these four points here and we're going to do a d skew on the image to make sure that we're looking at a level field so once we've done that it's going to take the 50 frames of video run the edge detection on each of them and then composite those together and that way if there's any autofocus issues we're able to bypass that how long does that take it's done right now it's not 100 perfect but we have a new computer vision higher who it's her specialty to make things like this work we're working on it and actually we're looking at moving away from computer vision to a 3d laser profiler and that we hired a person to do this and then immediately they're out of a job no no no good she's actually she's a machine learning and computer vision specialist the same skill set applies to the 3d image that we're gonna get okay from the profiler okay but it's laser thing it's a laser with lasers okay yeah no sharks but lasers okay i'm just gonna ask whatever it's attached to can we name it shark what the 3d laser profile is going to do is really clean up the image we don't have to worry about lighting we don't have to worry about changing the environment and because it's just looking at the height map all of the gaps between each of the keys presents a huge distinct drop right meaning that we're going to get every key every time whereas right now we get them shadows we've got i guess ah that's the point of this this is the light blocker 9000 and they did not want to have this on here for the shoot because it looks janky but what we had to do was put this on here to get even this good of an image because once you change your lighting and have you know a shadow like this it's really easy to get an extra key detected on that line what we do have is the ability for the person running the test to actually remove and add boxes if they need to after a full test run of 100 some odd switches cave is going to tell us with certainty how many of them actuate or send a signal to your pc whether they actuate early or late compared to the spec whether the travel distance being reported by the manufacturer is accurate if the bump in a tactile switch is where they say it is and these might sound like very boring little details to you but they're the kind of thing that you don't realize is a problem until you are thighs deep in a gaming or writing session and you keep accidentally freaking crumpling that line any error from our point of view should be the fault of the user and not of the peripheral and small deviations like this can make a huge difference when muscle memory is at play do you guys remember this viral video showing people tripping on 36th street subway station in new york that stare was less than an inch out of spec that's less than 15 percent of course this only helps us if we can test every keyboard can we do that oh buddy let me tell you right now we're able to test this keyboard in 30 minutes and i know a few places we can actually find time savings i think we can get it down to 25. i can see one place we could probably save some time like if we have that laser depth map we probably wouldn't need to start like exactly the key and then go down slowly and i guess the slowness is so that we get nice clean readings exactly it so right now we're actually going to a fixed height that is higher than any known keyboard we've found right okay and that way we know we're never going to crash into it because that would be bad it would be very bad like it's an expensive robot you'd go right through the keyboard and probably damage the robot tell me something though no user would ever press a key like that so so after we hit everything slowly have we considered going back and doing a fast hit and looking at what that looks like we have we've also actually considered hitting the corners as well for checking for key binding i've just been told that our new procurement hire has 150 keyboards on order already with our goal being to test 200 by the end of this year starting with the big names like logitech corsair and razer then moving on to the other top selling keyboards on amazon but that only tells us about the field what about latency or other concerns like repairability what this history does is measuring the total system latency so from the time you click on the keyboard to the time you have a response up on the display like amazon flash to automate this process we've got a solenoid right here that presses the key for us then once the key is pressed the signal goes to two places it goes to this nvidia ldat detector box and it goes to the accompanying software on the pc by measuring the difference in time between the signal reaching here and the muzzle flash appearing here we can find out how long it takes between pressing a key on your keyboard and your character moving on screen this kind of real world testing is really important because it allows us to quantify the importance of say high polling rates in keyboards it'll also help us discover if there's more to latency than just the pulling rate it's pretty rudimentary for now and what we want to do in the longer term is set up a usb breakout circuit that's tied to a logic analyzer then watch the usb packet as it crosses the wire but that's going to take a little bit of time for those of you wondering by the way for bluetooth we'll just be using a dongle one question i have about this is right now we're using a 360 hertz monitor which is the fastest available for now but as faster monitors become available will that make our old data no longer applicable if we switch and use say a 500 hertz monitor dear data will still be relevant because my goal is to have the end-to-end latency and still subtracting the system so just the pc and the display from the keyboard latency so you would have just a keyboard latency okay so this part would still make sense in the long run right how are we going to remove the display latency from the keyboard latency locally nvidia in the ldat system give us the the pc latency so we just take that value subtract it oh this is being said i'm not a big fan of that method that's why we are working on on the usb breaker and music analyzer just the idea is to have both value or real world value sure and the theoretical value and the reason that that matters is because you might see a theoretical value that's half the time of another keyboard but in terms of the difference that it's going to make to an actual game might be functionally zero because that makes up such a small portion of the total latency that it's just negligible for example you can have a keyboard that is one millisecond as the late 107 milliseconds or two milliseconds seems like a lot like two times more but when you take the full end-to-end latency it might be the difference between 15 and 60 milliseconds how the hell are you going to test 200 keyboards by the end of this that's a great question that's a wonderful question because it's going to be you right so far just me of course there's a lot more to evaluating a keyboard than just collecting data about the key switches and the latency one of the other big concerns in the lab is repairability for instance how easy is it to access the screws do you have to pull off little rubber feet that you then can't read here once we have our website up and running more on that later we aim to list all the screw types and tools required whether or not there are plastic clips holding pieces together any extra steps you might need to get it apart and tear down pictures so you can see for yourself what's inside the board you're buying we'll also be giving points for whether or not boards have hot swappable pcbs for switch replacements and detachable cables because not having to solder in order to repair your keyboard makes it much easier for regular users to keep their electronics out of the landfill we also want to use our articles to contextualize this information i mean it's all fine and good to see a key switch actuation force graph but how does it feel our aim is to include comparisons then against popular switches and keyboards to help set you in the right direction do you like the feel of mx blues but want something quieter do you like the actuation force of your amazon basics keyboard but wish it felt less mushy and looked nicer we've still got a long way to go we already talked about moving to a high-speed 3d laser profiler system instead of a camera so that we can get 3d images of each board and the website isn't anywhere close to being ready while we do have several test plans drafted there are still a lot of questions to answer around ergonomics and dimensions and key rollover and ghosting connectivity bundle and packaging software firmware backlighting extra controls and of course sound these are all things we haven't even touched on today but we do have plans in the works for them so stay tuned the ultimate goal is to create an information repository with a detailed breakdown of test results pictures from every angle maybe a rubric scoring system i'll be arguing hard against it but it might be unavoidable and most importantly to all the enthusiasts out there a sound library where you can listen to each keyboard in its stock configuration one of the biggest problems with keyboard audio tests online is a lack of consistency which we hope to solve by using the same space and desk materials namely deskpad from lttstore.com as well as the same microphone so that you get the closest sound possible to hearing it in person lofty goals indeed and as you can see we're
