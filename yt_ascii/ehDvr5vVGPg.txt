let's talk about pumping ducks guys you all know i'm a fan of the pump always guess respect the pump but what i'm not a fan of is a pump and dump this is a technique that has now become illegal in the stock market but right now because it's not regulated is in this gray area with crypto and a lot of people are promising easy gains thousands of dollars doubling your money if only you join their pump and dump group all right guys welcome to the ultimate crypto pumps today i'm excited to share with you guys that in this video you will learn how to pump and dump in finance huge profit i invested 8 000 and got 1600 back join our pump at them ultimate cryptocurrency and you will have the best experience ever so i trying to figure out how it works joined multiple of these discord channels promising me easy riches to figure out how this scheme sort of works now we're going to go to the board we're going to talk about it but let me say up front tldr these are massive scams designed to bring you in make you feel like you're part of the group in reality you're the sucker that's the whole game is that you if you are just joining one of these groups thinking you're gonna make a quick buck you are the sucker and frankly i don't know it's one of the few things that i don't feel too bad for you if you fall for this if you're trying to get in on somebody do a pump and dump and rip other people off and you yourself get ripped off that's not good okay i can't feel too bad for you but this is a big warning to all of you who are seeing these big pump signal groups big pump telegram groups they are fraudsters they're con men they're liars tricking you out of your money so if you have a friend or anybody who's you know thinking about getting involved in one of these these are all the reasons you should not be in the explanation of how the con game works let's go to the board shall we ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking about you guys know we're talking about talking about the pump and dumps ladies and gentlemen this is what it looks like a lot of these are run on discord or telegram two of the more popular you know messaging services with groups so this is galactic pumps is one of the ones that i joined i also joined voyager pumps big pumps signal you know things like this and let me walk you through how this works okay so there's multiple days where they run pump and dump these pump and dump schemes right so for example this is the 29th of april pump and dump dude they're shameless by the way when law enforcement starts to get ahold of this when regulation starts to get ahold of you guys you guys better run you better hope that you're anonymous right but right now this is all being done right out in the open 22nd of april pumping up they're doing a pump and dump about every three to five days and i quickly found that the multiple groups that i joined a lot of them work together so for example voyager pumps will work with galactic pumps and they'll pump the same coins so what is going on as you can see they use this kucoin 29th of april and they pump the same exact coins now we're gonna go over the basics before i explain exactly how this fraud works because a lot of the people in this group don't realize that they are the suckers first of all a pump and dump is where you artificially raise the price of a stock or now a cryptocurrency artificially there's no reason it's raised other than you're investing a bunch of money hoping that other people get in on it and then you sell off to them now typically this is done with like kind of less known less popular coins or stocks and this is because it's easier to move the price of something that is cheap right that is doesn't require a lot of volume to move a lot so they pick a bunch of like random you know stocks or coins you've never heard of before so in the example of the 22nd of april pump which i actually was witness to here's how this works put up this bot and they say it's a fair bot how they pitch it to people is that we're all receiving a random coin from this bot and nobody knows what it is before it gets released now this is a lie but we'll talk about in a second so they so they give you this coin so this is what that chart looks like normally right you have a lot of kind of random price movement when you go to the time of the pump this is what it looks like it is a very clear pump and dump here at one o'clock is the pump and then every little candlestick is another minute and so it literally it's a pump and dump for like five minutes right so the pump happens in minute one and then it sells off very quickly now that you know what a pump and dump is and what one looks like though why is it a con why is this a scam right for someone to win in a pump and dump someone also has to lose like obviously right like if somebody's gonna make money somebody on the other side has to be losing money and here's how they get you okay because they try to tell the people in the group that they're you're tricking people outside the group they tell everybody you know we're gonna post to social media we're gonna fool them see here's one such message from this guy devin s owens this guy's asking how many people in this group or in this discord are left holding the bag he goes in this discord very very few it's the outsiders that get shafted bots that scan the market and people waiting for trending coins see that's the idea is like if we all pump this coin together it'll go trending on one of these crypto exchanges and idiots will buy in that's the idea and then we'll all the people in the group will make money we're haha we're all in the know we're scamming the world and meanwhile it's the outsiders that are getting tricked and they even encourage people to go posting their social media about the coin and whatever and pump it so that they can dump their shares or their coins onto those people and make money now that is the lie though because the truth about these groups and all these things is that the sucker is not outsiders it's actually the insiders see here's how the scheme really works so you take this coin right that they pump and dumped on april 22nd they said that hey we're gonna get social media we're gonna get outsiders in on this coin we're gonna get outsiders to buy what you're buying right like to buy off of you and then get they're the ones that are gonna get dumped on but if you look at how long the pump lasted it only lasted a few minutes long like five minutes in total not enough to get a coin meaningfully on trending so what's really going on is that if you look back at the volume history of this coin is that you see something very interesting you see a pattern of by pressure over here slow buys all the way up to the date of the eventual pump do you know who that is those are the insiders ladies and gentlemen that's right there's an insider within an insider club in all of these pump and dumps so there's an inside group who orchestrates this whole thing who gathers people in who's who monitor it who sends her comments and they say hey guys we're going to all pump and dump together but they know beforehand what the coin is so they spend weeks buying up that coin slowly so no one really notices and then the second that the buy the buy signal gets put out they put in a sell order and sell off to you at those insane new prices so the people who think they're insiders are actually outsiders and the only thing that is true about outsiders holding the bag is that you were the outsider all along i don't know if any of that makes sense but that's how these things work guys and when you go to the comment section of these things people are going oh i lost money i lost hundreds of dollars i lost thousands of dollars and they can't figure out why they thought they've done something wrong and people will tell them oh you were just too slow but you weren't too slow you're just not on the inside of the group this group is conning you which is ironic because you're trying to con other people and then you yourself are getting caught there is a window if you're the fastest clicker in the west though no it's not about being a fast clicker it's about literally knowing beforehand what the coin's going to be but i think what's most crazy about these groups is just how widespread and popular they are despite being such kind of obvious scams once you've gotten burned once i don't know how many people are aware of this they have 450 000 members just in this one group or sorry 171 000 and this one group telegram group but across all their little platforms or different discord groups they have 450 000 almost half a million people participating in these strange pump and dumps which are so obviously built to just benefit like a few people in the know and there are a bunch of reddit threads on this about pump and dump schemes but i just thought i'd make my own video because i think they can be really dangerous these big pump signals any any kind of pump and dump scam they always say that they have outsiders but actually you are the outsider and that's just what i wanted to come on here and say please don't get involved in these ridiculous schemes they're built to prey on your sense of like fomo your sense of wanting to get in on this big those big gains but the reality is you can't it doesn't matter how fast your fingers are it's about knowing beforehand what's going on and if you think you're going to be a winner here that's them preying on your psychology i mean literally you have to know you have to be in the inside circle to win and at that point you're just lying to people to make money again i never knew that these pump and dump groups existed until i joined them i didn't know how many people they had involved and it's disgusting to me that nobody's regulated these things yet but i think they will be regulated soon and you better be careful because if you're caught holding the bag it's gonna be a bad time all right that's basically it see ya wake up and smell the coffee
