we're here at asml in san diego where they have possibly the most advanced machine on the planet inside the processors of your phone and computer are billions and billions of transistors that are only nanometers in size how can they possibly create something that's that small by shooting molten tin with the world's most powerful co2 laser 50,000 times a second yeah in here they design and build the tools that are used by chipmakers to build the most advanced processors in the world and i cannot wait to show you everything minus whatever their lawyers cut what they can cut though is this segue to our sponsor build redux with simple to navigate customization options and competitive pricing compared to building a pc yourself build redux will help you dominate your favorite games with a perfect pc for you and not another different person they can get their own check them out at the link below when you hear amd or nvidia are producing 7 nanometer chips it is really easy just be like well yeah they always keep on making smaller transistors every single year and technology goes on but how the heck do they make a transistor that small with great difficulty the whole process is kind of like a big overhead projector from school there's a light source that goes through the image that you want to project and then there's some mirrors and lenses that make sure everything arrives on the screen in focus only difference is that for lithography the light source is one of the world's most powerful lasers and the screen is silicon since the early 2000s chip makers used 109 93 nm deep uv light provided by an argon fluoride laser even in 2001 they were already making transistors smaller than 193 nmm how the heck can you etch something that's smaller than the wavelength of the light that you're using the most important equation for all of this is ra's resolution criterion this equation here is what tells us the smallest detail that is possible to create for a given optical system and wavelength over the next 20 years through more advanced optics imaging through water on top of the wafer printing a single layer multiple times and using strang looking chip patterns chip makers were able to continually make smaller and smaller transistors at some point though the wavelength is going to be a problem and if you don't address it you might i don't know get stuck making 14 nmet chips for the next 7 years now creating light with a smaller wavelength than 193 nm is not very difficult for instance they do it all the time time in x-ray machines at hospitals the problem though is those x-rays famously go through everything including mirrors and lenses not fantastic if you plan on using it an optical system now it turns out 13.5 nanm or extreme ultraviolet is basically the smallest wavelength you can use that still mostly bounces off of mirrors producing this 13.5 nom euv light though is what the incredibly smart folks here at san diego have f figured out there are multiple ways to create 13 1/2 nanm light but the best way is to blast tin with a laser and turn it into plasma the problem with just pointing a powerful laser at a block of tin though is that along with euv light you've also just well you blasted tim with a laser there's enough liquid and gaseous tin flying all over the place to ruin just about anything let alone a lithography machine that can be taken down by a single piece of dander since shooting a block of tin was out of the equation the folks at asml had the insane idea to fire liquid tin droplets at over 275 bar and then shoot it with an insanely powerful laser twice the first laser pulse is called the pre pulse which hits the tin droplet just hard enough to change it from a spherical droplet into more of a pancake shape which maximizes the amount of 13 1 12 nanometer light produced emitting a bunch of that sweet sweet euv the plasma is made right at the focus point of this concave mirror which is special esally layered and coated to ensure only 13 1/2 nanm light plus orus 2% gets reflected and sends 150 wats or more of euv into the guts of the lithography machine anyway let's go look at that big ass laser before that though i need to get all suited up in a lot of factories you put on ppe to protect yourself from the machines although here we're protecting the machines from us just a single hair blow a laser up terrible t make sure arms don't hit the ground look at how rad these shoes are i joked that they're trying to protect the machines but clearly they're also pretty good at work safety do you imagine if we fell in a hole andrew set that back to zero oh my god this entire room is a laser made by trump in germany that powers the euv light source when the tint is shot into the chamber there are multiple detectors that need to figure out the location and velocity of the droplets with micrometer and nan precision this look location data is used to time when the laser fires which starts right here now this is the seed laser which is only a couple 100 w from here it goes through a bunch of isolation optics and then it ends up in a power amplifier this guy right here on its own this power amplifier can operate as a 25 kow continuous laser and it was actually designed to weld cars together on production lines here though they have excited the co2 so when the source laser gets fired the amount of photons gets massively multiplied like 10 to the 11 times they then run the beam through three more power amplification stages just to make sure that they can truly and completely annihilate some tin in total this laser delivers 25 kw but that powers average pulses over several seconds instantaneously it's about 20 megaw of power here the laser and the light source are on the same level so you can see it goes across here down and over but in an actual fab this laser would likely be stored in the basement and then pumped several floors up to the source there is a critical problem with this approach though on their own the four power amplifiers don't care which way the light is traveling and will very happily amplify a signal going in reverse tin is also quite reflective so when the early prototypes some of the laser bounced off got amplified by all of these amplifiers and then lit the source laser on fire not the desired outcome to say the least to overcome this they have employed literally every passive and active isolation technique to ensure that no reflected laser light makes its way back through the amplification chering here we can see the liquid tin delivery system the tin travels through this tube under immense pressure and is shot through a minuscule nozzle at 275 bar on the tip of the nozzle is a tiny peas electric cryst crystal that vibrates in such a way to ensure that the droplets come out in a very specific strand that later combines into droplets that are perfect for laser sniping this entire process happens 50,000 times every single second so right here's the actual droplet generator unit so on the top you can see the heater and then this big old gun barrel looking thing is where all of the liquid tin gets shot out of originally they used to use a solid piece of tin and heat it up before shooting but that required turning the machine off to reload it every so often huge problem now the whole system uses liquid tin which can be much more easily replenished for extremely low downtime since these euv lithography machines are the most expensive parts of the fab about $150 to $200 million a pop they are designed to be the bottleneck of the entire operation this means any time the euv machine is down the entire fab goes down and heaps of money is lost for hundreds of millions of dollars of investment it makes sense that these things need to work 24 hours a day 7 days a week and all maintenance downtime needs to be planned in advance currently asml has achieved nearly 90% uptime with their euv machines and they're on track for 95% uptime by 2025 what we see behind me right here is the source so this right here in an actual fab is the light source for the whole lithography machine so right here that right there is the metr ology unit so that sees how much light they're making the quality of it they can test it out see how well they're doing but normally this will be sent straight into the guts of the big old euv machine behind me they're doing droplet generation qualification so that means that they're shooting the tin out here and having a look at it to make sure everything is working just fine and it also means that we can see the tin that's going through it just looks like a tiny little spiderweb but all all of that just tiny tiny little pieces of tin micron yes yes are we allowed to say that to qualify the droplet generator they have a camera there with the shutter speed timed with the droplets that are coming out so we can see these two dots right here and as long as there's no nonsense around it she's good to go they look at this for 4 hours if there's any problems then back to the lab of course the problems aren't over yet we just hit a piece of tin with a laser hard enough to make it hotter than the surface of sun and it only takes a couple shots before everything gets too hot and everything covered in a mess of tin now the collector mirror is water cooled but that has more to do with temperature stability than the heat of the plasma to deal with the heat instead of water cooling they pump hydrogen gas through the floor this hydrogen absorbs the energy of the laser interaction and then get sucked out the top of the machine along with all the bits of unv oriz tint two new problems though first is that the more hydrogen that enters the vessel the more energy you lose meaning you can only use the exact amount of hydrogen that you need or you're going to lose a bunch of efficiency and as a bonus when the hydrogen is close to the tin when it gets lazed the h2 molecules get ripped apart into two hydrogen-free radicals which are then scattered across the innards of the source if those hydrogen-free radicals hit some of the liquid tin it will start to bubble and explode so more liquid tin everywhere and terrible time basically the hydrogen cleanup team needs to do a really good job to ensure that everything gets carried out quickly and completely or your $1.3 million mirror will have a very expensive trip to the cleanup room everything we've talked about so far though is only the first step of the lithography machine the light bulb so to speak in the past for deep uv light they would use a series of lenses to properly focus the light but euv just gets absorbed by lenses and also most mirrors to overcome this zeiss created the world's flattest and probably most expensive mirrors by layering silicon and miminum they were able to balance almost 70% of the incoming light meaning the system needs to use as few mirrors as possible to maintain high efficiency just delivering a circle of light though wasn't enough some features can be better etched by using a different pattern so using an array of micrometers is how they deliver that in the past how they do it for euv i don't know they wouldn't tell me for ip reasons the light then bounces off of the reticle which is four times larger than the target and makes its way onto the target which is held on a magnetically levitating platform well that is getting printed a second wafer is measured to ensure it is placed with nanometer accuracy so at the downtime between prints is only a couple of milliseconds the process then continues with each print either the pause positive or negative the image is imprinted the wafer is then polished to remove the photo resist and the whole thing starts over again as soon as possible they will move from euv to an older process node not just because the older nodes are cheaper but also because at the end of the day we need to end up at the size of a wire sadly you can't solder to 7 nm here they aren't just researching how to build euv light sources though they're building the final components that will be used in production at tsmc samsung intel or micro a lot of the components are assembled by hand by highly skilled technicians although over time each process is slowly being automated to take human error out of the equation over 40% of the parts get recycled and reconditioning here which makes sense given that even the housings of the components can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and they take care of even just routine maintenance yeah it turns out that they empty the tin into these super cheap water bottles that are just off aliexpress wow that is heavy i can't pick that up in theory we could probably just hook it up to an lt water bottle although i'd recommend just sticking to water ltd store.com from here the source is shipped to the netherlands where it is assembled and tested with all of the other euv scanner components from across the world the final euv machine is then shipped to the customer via three full 747s and 20 transport trucks where hopefully it will crank out cutting edge chips for years account in the future asml will start shipping high anda euv machines so this is the source for one of those right here and the concept is similar to what we've already seen but with improved optics and reliability based on improvements they found over the last couple of years it is likely euv will be the last wavelength required for lithography since with future improvements the limiting factor of the resolution will become the size of atoms from there the only real option is quantum but that's a discussion for another day anyway huge thanks to ryan and alex for spending a bunch of
