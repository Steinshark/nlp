this computer is going to break youtube how do i know because it is going to the spiffing brit that's right the one and only king of youtube exploits asked us to build on the pc with one requirement it must be cooled by t which is stupid so we did it that's right friends we will be using actual literal tea to cool a computer to what end well because we can't also because see sonic loves it when we do this kind of crazy stuff and they sponsored this video to everyone else for whom this will be extremely hard to watch all i can say is please forgive me the first step of building a tpc is of course making yourself some tea here we have some yorkshire tea from taylor's this is straight from yorkshire and britain and here we go some good smelling tea now you might be wondering why if this is the teapot i have a three other teapots and that's because one of these is going into the pc the case is still getting painted but you can get a basic idea of what i'm thinking so vertical gpu is going to be going right here and then the teapot is hopefully going to be pouring into it now how exactly we get you know the tea into the pot and out of the pot not entirely sure getting the tea out of the pot is easy enough we're just going to pull a little cystoscopy jam this down in there she's done the more difficult bit is getting the t in so i think we're going to have to drill a hole in the side right here i have no clue how it's going to work i have this diamond drill bit i don't know if that doesn't work out i also have an aluminum teapot and this really is a drill into according to the instructions you want a stream of water and to start at a 45 degree angle and then turn it straight how that'll go and let's find out sorry it's too hot [music] okay it's working wow that just worked that was way easier than i expected whoever would have thought that just reading the instruction and buying the right tool would work as for the other hole i'm just gonna apply a little bit of lube here oh just went right wow this is going so much better than i expected haven't quite decided yet if this is going to be the reservoir or just a spot that water goes through but we can worry about that later the hard bits are done there's a hole in the side we have a tube coming out of it this is going to be fantastic with the tube and the next problem is mounting now i have this hand for my kia and i sort of have two options here the first is to hold it like this chop the base off and make a mount so that it attaches to the top of the case and then it can be held something like that and pour tea down into the gpu now i'm a little bit concerned about you know just all of this staying together and teapot ending up somewhere in between i don't know falling out of a fedex truck in the middle of the atlantic so instead i think we're going to hold the teapot like we do here in canada like this which is definitely a thing that we do here and it's not just way easier to put it on like so how's that for the gpu we're going with pny's rtx 490 so this thing is an absolute beast 24 gigabytes of ram don't even have to worry about skyrim mods filling up all of that now pny did have some very very tough stipulations that we had to follow they said well we'll send you a 40 90. but only if you also use 32 gigabytes of our ddr5 6200 megahertz and our two terabyte pcie gen4 ssd she's a twist my arm guys that's i wish more people had stipulations like that cheese first step of water blocking the gpu is just remove all of the screws and then just very gently pull up on the pcb oh dear oh just like that for the gpu cooler we're going with the ace block gpx from alpha cool and this should fit they're not entirely sure it's very early days for water cooling rtx 490s and because nvidias are apples they don't give their partners boards early cannot wait for tea to just clog these micro fins it's gonna be so beautiful next you have to apply the thermal pads to your gpu block or to the gpu itself for thermal paste we're going to be using thermal grizzly's cryo knot this stuff is fantastic and there we go we have a water cooled gpu now alpha cool did warn us beforehand that p and wise version of the 4090 is very slightly different than the founders edition it has this just what is it like half an inch of pcb on the back here just so they can have their rgb headers that's the only difference and i think it's fine oh guys nicholas has been working on the paint for this case for the last couple of days and it has turned out so good take a look at this right here oh heck yeah and all it cost us was the irish viewers on this video let's see if we can get all the parts in here first thing to go in is this motherboard this is the z790e strix from asus and it is a freaking beast and also this one has a feature that most motherboards do not take a look at this andy it is positively covered in vaseline just oh she's a real greasy boy look at that this is because we kind of set tom's stuff on fire just just a little bit go watch the videos later next up is our cpu we have this core i9 13900k and we've verified the quality of it making sure it'll go up to 6.4 gigahertz she's really quick look at the fins on this andy what an absolute monster holy crap the basic plan seems to be coming together 360 right there 420 that's going up in the top we've got our pump rest combo that's going to be hidden down here i kind of want to make it seem like the teapots are reservoir even though for practicality reasons it's not teapots up here but we have a little bit of an issue yeah yeah there's all of this space down here where you normally have a pump res combo or something like that but instead it's just kind of empty i was doing some exploring of what to try to do in here and we might actually be able to just take off the back of this box slide it right over top of this obviously i can't do it with the actual box but it'll look hopefully fairly similar i decided that using the hand to mount the teapot was a pretty terrible idea and i also decided that me designing it was also a terrible idea so tynan did yeah yeah at least for the first pass made a nice little adapter so first thing it appears to actually hold the teapot which is great the next part is figuring out exactly where it's going to sit and how it's going to look that might be a little steep we should also check clearance on the fans oh yeah that's a problem i don't even need to check to know that that's a problem okay that's good to know more iterations to go here yay it turns out that planning loop around a teapot is actually kind of annoying first of all this thing's rather big so just physically fitting it in the case took us roughly this many tries now it goes in pretty well you can come over here and have a look only problem is this tube in the back very slightly hits it but that said we can start planning out everything else another problem with designing around a teapot is that everything in here is directional so water has to go in there out there in here out there i originally planned it in a way that makes a lot of sense for the water cooling bits but it turns out that that would have the water going up into the teapot not acceptable had to completely redo all of it all of this kind of it's going to be a bit of a mess but i think it's all going to be worth it when we see the t go right into the gpu it's gonna be so beautiful one other very fun thing about this build are these fittings now these are from i buy power and they're little shark bite fittings these are prototypes they don't exist yet but maybe if you guys like them they'll start actually producing am i testing these things work really well so you can just push it on like so yep it's on there nice and good and i can just pull on this so hard yeah it does not want to come off but then you just push the fitting in a little bit sharkbite comes undone and boom we'll be doing hard light and water cooling the same way that we always do cut a piece of tube that's a bit too long let's take the little noodly boy in the center so that you don't get it too warped i recommend putting a little bit of water on this just to sort of lube it up then heat gun bend it sand it down to size and we should be good when our next print is done it looks like everything's going to work out water cooling wise but it is going to make it very difficult to get access to everything else which means i think it's time for us to talk about our sponsor see sonic going in this case is the prime tx 1600 and this thing is a freaking beast like just first of all look at the size of this box and then look at the size of this boy i don't know if you can see it here but look at the size of those high side caps what an absolute beast this thing is as i'm sure you guys already know we absolutely love sea sonic here they're brave enough that they sponsored a video where we bought just an absolutely massive power supply tester to test their power supplies against everyone else that's how much they believe in their stuff it comes with a 12 year warranty and i personally have a seasonic power supply in my case and also just a seasonic case which is also really good maybe check that out as well anyway should we put this guy in there i guess it won't be permanent we need to find the acrylic panel that goes right here but what a beast the prime 1600 does come with these excellent black cables they feel really durable and are much better than the ketchup and mustard that you had in the past but what they don't scream is i worship the big ben that's why we got these cables here oh have you ever seen such a british 24 pin we're in really good shape today if our newest print just works it has been fantastic to have such fast printers here we have the bamboo lab x1 carbon and also the big old pantheon i don't know pantheon printer by using both of these we're able to rip through six prototypes in a day with any luck this guy right here is our final print this clears the tube right here we are in good shape we are in fact not in good shape [music] fits great wow and all it took was that much material on the back of the case we're going to laser etch in the spiffing brits watermark across the whole thing which it turns out was fairly non-trivial because the watermark is a well it doesn't repeat properly this meant that poor nicholas here had to basically just recreate the whole thing from scratch yesterday but we're gonna finally be able to do it one other really smart thing that he did is instead of having the watermark on an angle we're taking the whole back panel and putting that on an angle so that the laser when it cuts it isn't going to be leaving any fuzzy edges these lines should be real nice and crisp because that's the way the laser is traveling looking at it getting this teapot in there is going to be rather difficult we have a bit of an order of operations problem we planned on just bolting it in here but there's kind of an issue where in order to bolt the teapot in we need to remove this radiator but in order to get this radiator in we need to remove the teapot so yeah that's a bit of an issue to solve that we're going to be using these little guys they're called heat set inserts so this right here basically you stick a little soldering iron up its bum and then you just press it into the plastic there plastic melts and then once the plastic has you know dried you have a little fastener in there this will require some small changes and all of our holes to be completely accurate to where they need to be but all that's very doable and we need to do another print anyway final v2 of the mount seems to have worked to hold the teapot in place we have a rubber gasket an acrylic piece and a bunch of washers it's it worked now you might have noticed that the gpu is gone that was so that i could easily attach things like the rgb headers and the front panel i o gpu is going back in now and the connectors that are behind it are not going to come out because i have just covered them in hot glue there's nothing worse than having super fiddly hard to get connectors behind a water cooled gpu absolute nightmare stuff to attach our soft tubing we're going to be using server grade fittings from alpha cool that also have shark bite fittings in them this is so dumb but like so awesome at the same time are we going to run t through it yeah yes green tea or what no english breakfast yeah i have to get this little chain of fittings in there somehow it's all covered in vaseline now it's all in here and if i can just get this tube inside look at this brandon we have a pc with a t-pot in it i'm sorry dear viewer but my plan was to lie to you just fill this whole thing up prep everything make sure all of it's good to go so then later when we're filming we could just fill it with tea and it would all work fine problem is things have not been going so great you see this leak tester here well it very very slowly has been losing air and i have no clue from where last night i spent the better part of two and a half hours just fiddling with the leak tester trying to figure out what in here possibly could be leaking i have absolutely no way it's the slowest leak ever like it doesn't even move if you just look at it try two leak testers that's not the problem i'm just gonna fill it with water and see where water comes out because we basically know this is going to leak i'm leaving the power supply out of the case and the only thing that's powered is the pump let's just leave it like this for a couple minutes and see if we find any drips are we dry oh good word dry i figured it out it wasn't too bad turns out just this fitting right here needed to be a little bit tighter and by a little bit tighter i mean a lot tighter i just had to absolutely send it with these pliers she's all wired up but it's it's back here so you don't see it it's totally fine anyway loops together loop's not leaking anymore let's set her up tidy up the back a bit fill us in with some tea i don't know why but for whatever reason ram will only work in the first two slots so the a channel and also it only boots in slow mode i was having a bit of issues with this motherboard and cpu beforehand but i was able to just down clock the ram a bit and it was fine now it's just not working at all to solve it i grabbed this 3900 kf that we had sitting around for a different youtuber that i'm going to make a pc for very soon but maybe this is a spiffing brit's new cpu if this goes in and just works i didn't think beforehand that the vaseline that was in there would be the problem but just so that you guys don't say that that's what the problem is i have removed all the vaseline and checked all the pins there's no crap in there or anything i'm guessing that there was something wrong with just the memory controller or the pins in this and just how it was mounted slightly differently with this cpu cooler was enough to knock her off kilter totally well here's where we find out if things are bad or catastrophic catastrophic fortunately nothing actually got wet there besides the case in the table let's try this again come on come on remember he's still training oh she works all right cpu is dead that's absolute best case for us ah look at this four sticks of ram 64 gigabytes of memory we are back in business also sorry you don't have a quick sync encoder tom i don't know deal with it first of all can i say i love it the union jack color scheme mwah but what the hell is this pump it's the alpha cool whatever this is oh my god it's full of tea smells so good it's because the the box of tea goes over it once it's all filled ah oh excellent is this gonna leak no why would that leak what do you mean why would that leak look like with that leak yeah look at it there's a big giant gap in it yeah so look oh it's fake yeah it's totally fake it's totally fake oh i love it yeah that's part of why i got this pump i was hoping we could fit it in there we tried to do like reservoirs and stuff but like getting something in pretty easy getting something in and like attaching a fitting afterwards great though you get all the effects of the the tea pouring into the gpu but none of the risk of well it pouring everywhere else yeah exactly anyway do you want to make some tea i do i see we've got a few different methods of making tea from classic to bougie well this is actually for making coffee but i think it's going to be very helpful for us because when you make tea there's a lot of particulate so we'll make the tea then pour through the filter here wait shut up you're not actually going to put tea in it are you it's the tea cooled pc linus is that sanitary will it like rot how old what do you mean no it's fine i don't think you know this for a fact where did the pt nuke go oh my god you're gonna put micro food into the loop then you're gonna put an antimicrobial agent in it look at the look on his face that's what he actually intends to do 100 but tom asked us for a pc that's cooled by tea do you want to put something that's not tea because you were going to make brown coolant with dye no we have tea how do you want to do this we can either make tea in the teapot and then pour through the pour over or we can just make it in the tea if we don't make it in the teeth okay i mean come on i think it should be really strong and we have to hold our pinkies out like this always oh my god that's a lot of tea bags well yeah but it we need to take what are we playing halo anyway it needs to look like tea in the loop now i have to confess i'm pretty ignorant when it comes to tea and coffee so what exactly makes this useful for removing particulate matter well it doesn't the coffee filter yeah i thought there was something special about like the shape of it or something i mean look okay you showed me a fan that works by vibrating a thing and a cooler that works by vortexing air so if you told me there's a special shape that gets the particles out of coffee i'd have believed you nope that looks pretty strong to me here we can give it a quick pour oh well before you do that you can pour yourself some yeah give it a taste make sure it's good also tea that is that is strong so why don't we let that steep for a second and do some finishing touches sure on the case on our cable panel here we need you know it can't just be left white so i have a little bit of an idea what's on the inside of that panel there's nothing on the inside of that panel david the canadian government will give you a picture of the queen for free oh shut up as long as you have a canadian address they will send you a picture of the queen for free so that's what this is so we need to attach her to the back oh god no i haven't told the viewers this yet but there was a mix-up in our fittings so we have custom made fittings these are the first 30 in existence in this computer cool but they screwed up and sent us the wrong ones the correct ones just arrived right now they're exactly the same except these ones have tiny little teacups and stiffing brit logos on them these are amazing i think we can do it i think we have to do it yeah we have to what choice do we have we have to have the t ones okay well that was quick that was easy you know this is wider right no it isn't it's fine yes it is no it doesn't it is well but like the bits that matter aren't wait what is this what is it for the potato fashion you're gonna put that in the brits pc oh that doesn't no one talks about that linus he's just sweeping it under the rug one one thing one thing before you do that before you do that oh you got all right that's boiling water alex yeah well you're supposed to use the goose neck but i didn't so just do that let that go through all right oh because then you get all of the flak flakes off the filter paper taste paper as well oh the taste yeah the taste it's not gonna drink it alex well i don't know i can't live knowing that i sent the spiffing brit some papery ass tea this is extremely hot tea hopefully our cpu doesn't shut down due to overheating before the radiator can cool it off oh yeah we ready are you guys ready we need to get slo-mo of the tea pouring out of the teapot so we gotta [music] foreign i'd be lying if i said i didn't absolutely love it it's very frothy not really ideal tea for cooling our cpu temperatures are only 40 degrees yeah the tea is already not that hot wow i'm just getting a little bit of foam out i'm starting to get a little bit yeah no i think i think that's about all the foam we're getting out of it so hopefully he's okay with foamy tea now you can never say we didn't give you head and ah time for another adventure we're taking out the funnel now ah you said this was gonna be so spicy alex we got this we've seen so much worse than this oh yeah that's actually fine i do have to wonder how much performance we're giving up compared to water did you take a before or no no okay oh that looks so cool wow holy crap this is amazing what was the laser doing just now it was engraving it but how does it go easy oh go easy this is why i asked what the laser was doing i got the simple answer of engraving which was sort of helpful but what i really needed to know was that we were lasering through blue paint to white paint so when i was getting a bunch of white stuff going you know all over everywhere i would have known if that question had been answered that i was scrubbing too hard and going through the blue paint so don't look too closely but whoo okay yeah the top half looks great see look how good the panel looks this thing looks amazing oh that is awesome wow what i wanted to test was how many blocks of cheese we can spawn in at once luke did this test a while ago with a 5820k and was able to get 8 000 rolls of cheese all right thousand blocks of cheese there we go all right all right thousand blocks of cheese not too bad two thousand ah should we just do a couple more i would 1200 you know wait what what the crap did you just put down four thousand blocks four thousand blocks of cheese is our computer even stable alex it needs more tea okay thousand cheeses all right we did a thousand no problem really can't do 2 000 cheeses well how did luke do so much cheese oh the cheeses roll away from him maybe there's too many just like in the frame here we go now wait for them to settle wait for them to settle in a little bit here oh my god i love our cheese avalanche okay hit her again hit her again oh yeah 250 frames per second in shadow of the tomb raider 1440p absolutely cranked the problem is clearly with skyrim not with our computer because this is running fine to commemorate spiffs number one video though which was of skyrim callanan made this fork give me where does it go let's stick it on the back enjoy your computer hope you love it as much as we loved making it and as much as we love our sponsor it's the sonic oh it's see sonic so they just sponsored the whole video yeah oh well they make great power supplies it'll be probably the most reliable thing in here given that everything else is cooled by tea they offer up to 12 year warranties up to 80 plus titanium efficiency and units everywhere from the most affordable to the most overpowered on the market no matter what you need to power see sonic has got you covered they really wanted us to show off that it was actually running in the computer oh so here here it is see sonic if you guys enjoyed this video you might also enjoy the build that alex worked on with nerdforge it is incredible
