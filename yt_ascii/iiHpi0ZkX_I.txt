20 years ago okay calm down guys according to douglas j j being javascript crawford inventor of jason which was originally referred to as gizmal has officially said we should stop using javascript 20 years ago i was advocating for javascript my story i remember that he actually came to our university and advocated for javascript on the server and said it was going to be easy i kid you not he gave examples of making it run in serial and in parallel easy javascript i love it i am this is not me exaggerating at all the story was that javascript is a much better language than anybody knows and that if we use it properly we can do amazing things about it [music] yes you know haskell it's a much better language than anybody knows and if you just used it right you too would know how good it is pick i'm so sorry ask alone oh my goodness and it can change the world and in fact that happened but now my evangel is that we should stop using javascript that it has so many congenital defects it really is a smelly language there's a [applause] [music] yeah you tell them yeah i stood up and stepped on my headphone cord almost ripped my head off let's go let's go crocford i can't believe your middle name is just on though okay great take i'm loving it i love it javascript just a lot of crap in it and it's still maybe for its field of application the best language in the world for doing that kind of stuff but that's not good enough we should be i do agree with that and i think when he says field of application i i assume he means browsers he's not talking about servers i just don't think it's the best on the server moving on to the next generation of languages it used to be that we'd get a new computer languages about every generation i'm going to start with fortran and then c and c plus there was a lot that happened in between all that okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa fortran to see it's gonna be some offended people out there okay just saying just give me a couple offended people out there wasn't java and javascript and so on and then it kind of stopped there are still people developing languages but nobody cares one person can make a programming language a really good one but you can't get adoption for it there are lots of terrible mistakes i believe he just said the story of nim nim i'm sorry i i'm positive you're a really great language nim a oh all the people out there are gonna hate me for this v leg i'm positive it was a really great idea i love i loved it v-lang i love what you did he's not talking about zig there's at least four people that like zig okay minimum no odin's actually used odin actually has really great odin is a specialized language for some things so odin's great odin will do fine it's in the way that the web works in the way our operating systems work and we can't get new ones we're just stuck with this crap and and they keep piling new features on everything and the new feature is always create new problems and it doesn't have to be like that we could be using a really clean operating systems with really clean languages and really clean run times and doing all this stuff in a much more reliable way but but we don't seem to want to do that is this one of those the future if is that what this is is this literally that meme the future if we didn't use javascript he's describing c plus plus 100 i think so i think this is actually saying that c plus plus is truly the end game language this is an older video for sure this is just a cut out of it i mean i problem is is that momentum makes a language live for a long time and the more momentum the longer like i still think javascript is a great introduction like introductory introductionary language right it is such a good starting language you gotta move on right like you gotta learn something else you gotta you gotta spread your wings okay a little bit try something else that way you're not just javascript build the whole time thinking it's the greatest language in the universe without any idea that there's other introductory there you go thank you introductionary that's not a word prime i think people could just get stuck as a one language andy because it feels easy right don't settle on the first girl yeah i guess why do i even read you chat chat i've done javascript for a generation douglas crawford 25 years old it's time for the next thing and i don't think that should be a a considered a radical point of view i think it should be a normal evolutionary view i actually do agree with that and that's why i think that's why i do think this you know like we just got done watching that that wazex or we got done reading about wasps i actually really think that this that could very well be the marker of the next thing right something that has actually going to dramatically change how the world looks i'm actually pretty excited about that i'm hoping now it could avail to nothing which is the huge possibility but you never know you know what i mean you never know hey guess what the name it's not tom my name's not tom my name's my name's not tom i'm not a genius i'm just a man who writes javascript full-time 44 40 some hours a week for for netflix i work at netflix by the way though netflix
