hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about both fake and real transmissions used in electric cars so the car we are sitting in is the audi rs e-tron gt which has a two-speed transmission in the rear however in the future it is probable that we might see something like a multi-speed manual transmission yes with three pedals including a clutch pedal and with a gear selector but it's completely fake and so we're gonna go through all of this starting with why real examples of transmissions are used in electric cars and then working our way towards fake ones being used so this audi e-tron is in a very rare spot because not many electric cars use a multi-speed transmission it's pretty much just this and the porsche tycoon which is its you know sibling and so for this vehicle why are they using a multi-speed transmission well the answer is simple it's for acceleration if you look at the torque going from the motor multiply that by the gear ratios of the various two speeds one and two for that rear motor and then you divide that by the radius of those tires well then you get the wheel force the force that is pushing this car forward and you can see that that force is going to be greater when you're in first gear than when you're in second gear and if you then take that force and divide it by the weight of this vehicle you can see your maximum theoretical acceleration based on that wheel force so that's about 1.25 g's when you're in first gear and about 0.82 gs when you're in second gear now this is using a small assumption in that this has the same torque split as the porsche tycoon i wasn't able to find a torque split for what the front motor and rear motor are actually supplying but assuming it's very similar to the porsche tycoon which it's the same motors and it's the same transmission and it's the same battery pack so i assume it's going to be pretty close so for this vehicle as you can see you get better acceleration in first gear that switches over around 50 miles an hour so you can actually feel that gear shift and then your acceleration is reduced but you get to exchange that acceleration for a higher top speed so that's what gears do they give you you trade off whether it be top speed or torque and you select which one you want so for the example of this car you know why don't any other evs use a multi-speed transmission well remember we're talking about the equation force equals mass times acceleration so you can use gears to increase that force or you can simply increase the power of the motor so if you have something like the tesla model s plaid which has an insane amount of power it doesn't need gears for torque because it already has so much torque if you look at something like the model 3 performance which actually has a very similar 0 to 60 time as this car right here though it's significantly cheaper and down on power it has a lot less weight you know you take out mass from that f equals m a equation you get greater acceleration so there are ways around not needing to use a multi-speed transmission if your goal is increased acceleration but the reason why electric cars don't use transmissions with multiple speeds isn't purely because of acceleration it's because electric motors are very different from internal combustion engines they have an extremely wide rpm range and they make efficient power and good torque across that entire rpm range whereas a combustion engine you know it can't really operate below about you know maybe 700 rpm and it doesn't rev all that high and if it does rev really high you know there's examples out there of 15 000 rpm motors if it does rev that high well it's gonna have a narrow power band so you need to make sure it's geared appropriately to take advantage of that power band so electric motors really have this perfect torque curve where you start with peak torque and you maintain that peak torque until you reach peak power and then you maintain peak power and that is something that you can't achieve in a combustion engine so whether or not you like combustion engine more or electric motors more factually electric motors have a much better torque and horsepower curve and because they rev so high this means you can reach high speeds even if you're using just a single gear ratio okay so why in the world would you use a fake manual transmission in an electric car and how would that work so before we get into that discussion i don't want to let audi completely off the hook here because although they do use a real transmission they also pump in fake sounds into this cabin so depending on what mode you're in they change how much of that fake sound you get but no matter what you can't turn it off you will get this fake electric motor kind of rumble within the cabin here i have it in its quietest mode because you know it doesn't make all that much sense basically what you're doing is you're saying well there was this old thing that worked differently and so we made it like that and that's the reason why you're doing it which isn't a great reason in my opinion so let's think about this new modern cars pipe in engine noise using the speakers because new modern cars have much better sound deadening engines are quieter but people like exhaust sounds right so you put in that through the speakers so it still sounds like you're getting that really cool experience but now we're switching to an electric car which doesn't make those exhaust sounds and still using that same logic to say well the old thing used to be like this so let's make this one like this even though it has nothing that's going to make these weird rumbly sounds we're just doing it because that's what people were used to so let's just do it like that the exact same logic applies to modern cars which use cvts these continuously variable transmissions and so these transmissions are designed so that you don't feel the gear shifts and yet we built in these set ratios even though they're designed to operate at any ratio we built in these set ratios so they felt like the old school transmission so you had that noticeable gear shift you had that noticeable climb and rpm so cvts are designed to operate where you don't feel the ships where they operate at the most efficient point or at the most powerful point depending on where your foot is on the pedal instead we created this design so that they are less efficient not as fast and you have more harshness because you're creating these gear shifts which are really shifting between set gear ratios but they're not needed it's not how the product is designed to work and when you ask well why would you do that well the answer is well there was this old thing that worked differently and so we made it like that it's not a good answer which brings us to fake manual transmissions so toyota now has a patent for a manual transmission and an electric car and that car has three pedals yes a clutch pedal it has a six-speed gear shifter you know for you to select as the driver and so from an operational standpoint this is all it's going to feel real but be fake so when you press that clutch pedal what happens well you can't accelerate in a car with the clutch pedal pressed in you have a disconnect between your engine and your transmission the same thing would happen in this ev except it's all pseudo you know it's just making it up when you press in that pedal it says hey you can't accelerate anymore because the clutch is pressed in now the same thing will happen with the gear selector so gears again as mentioned earlier in the video you're trading off top speed for torque so in lower gears like first gear and second gear you can't reach high speeds but you get lots of acceleration you get lots of torque in those higher gears you can reach higher speeds but it won't accelerate quite as much so here's where the trickery really comes in and the clever thing that toyota did in order to simulate this so you have your gear selectors and let's say you're in first gear well if you look at an overlay of what an electric cars torque curve looks like and then you place on top of that what it would look like if you were in a combustion car with similar torque and you're going through these different gears so you can see first gear you have more torque less top speed second gear you get less torque a bit higher top speed and you go on through six gear and by the time you get to sixth gear you're not making much torque but you have a nice top speed and so all this electric motor is doing because electric motors have very fine control over how much torque output you have is mimicking what torque you would have if you had different gear ratio selected there's one gear being used one gear and you're mimicking these various gears by choosing to limit torque so yes you're intentionally limiting torque in certain gears in order to make it feel similar you're giving it that you know low torque and those really low rpms to make it feel you know internal combustion engine like and so you're doing all these things to make it feel like the old thing that it has nothing to do with and if it was designed all on its own never ever would this make any sense to do but there's this nostalgia effect for why you're making an act like that again if you ask the question why would you do this the answer is well there was this old thing that worked differently and so we made it like that there's not actually a good reason if you're trying to use logic to understand it but here's the thing if you were to put me inside of that electric car which has a single speed electric motor but it was given that fake manual transmission and i were to go out on an autocross course or a track i bet you i would have a ton of fun in it even knowing that all of it is fake because i really enjoy driving manual transmission cars i am a squirrel-brained primate like the rest of us and dumb things make me happy so i think it's really stupid i think it's pointless but i bet simply from a nostalgic standpoint because i grew up learning on a manual transmission car and most of the cars i've ever driven and owned have been manual transmission cars so i find a joy in that because it's what i know i bet i would really enjoy it even though it's fake so i can't say it shouldn't be done i bet i would have fun messing around with it even though i think it's silly i think it's dumb and i don't think it makes any logical sense so while i have the opportunity to drive this really nice car let's chat about it a little bit and it is a really nice car it's insanely quick just like all the expensive electric cars are very quick in a straight line this is a heavy vehicle over 5 100 pounds so there's quite a bit of mass here as far as visibility it's kind of terrible not so much out the front it's okay out the front but looking to your blind spots and looking out the back it's very narrow back there you do have cameras all over the car which you can use the menu to look through so it is helpful with the cameras but visibility overall is pretty bad overall i think this is a very enjoyable very fun car to drive here's the thing though the car as it sits is about 162 000 that i'm sitting in and there's another thing out there that's kind of this small problem and that's the porsche tycon so if you look at cars like the toyota 86 and the subaru brz they're the same car made by different companies right and so this and the porsche tycon are the same car made by different companies the thing is you don't really think about toyota and subaru as being like ones vastly superior than the other right they're pretty equal as far as like reputation and like you know luxuriness like it's not like you think one is super nice and the other isn't that nice right but there is a difference in perception between an audi and a porsche i think that's pretty clear and so with a car that costs a hundred and sixty thousand dollars ego is going to play a role right like you're not buying a car like this because you need it ego plays a role in really expensive cars people like you know being perceived as whatever while they're sitting in them and so the perception of porsche is stronger than the perception of audi i think so and so the thing is if this isn't that much difference in cost versus a porsche tycoon turbo why would you select this knowing that like hey you're gonna be bragging to your friends oh i drive a porsche or an audi like porsche just sounds more impressive and personally i don't care what the badge is that's why i drive a crosstrek and a miata i don't really care but people do care and so if you're spending 160 000 and you're still saying i drive an audi it's like it's cooler to say you drive a porsche so i feel like it's probably a hard sell to get people into this because you have to specifically like audi now there are some things i really like about this like the touch controls for the vents here you know it's physical movement for the vents and you've got you know i like having i can select my seat heater with an actual button versus like in tesla where everything's done on the screen there are reasons why you might like this and i think it's a very nice car i just think for 160 000 you might as well get the porsche tycon so really maybe it just comes down to looks and i do think this looks really nice so you know maybe maybe that's the ultimate deciding factor between the two vehicles thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them below
