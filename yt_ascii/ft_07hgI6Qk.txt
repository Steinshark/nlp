how null license plate landed one hacker in ticket help i don't even know what this means but i'm very excited about this i mean i think the real problem here obviously is just trying to get a license plate in california that's probably where it's all at alerts good call good call chat hey hey this is this is why we pay you what we pay you all right joseph tartaro never meant to cause this much trouble especially for himself in late 2016 decided to get a vanity license plate by the way this is just a strange practice as it is okay i'm just throwing that out there like i don't want to spend a single second at the dmv like if there's a way i could never go to the dmv i want that option and so the fact that you have to do extra dmv to get a vanity license plate nuts to me nuts i dude i don't i don't understand this i do not understand this a security researcher by trade he tick he ticked down possibilities that relate to his work sag fault maybe or something to do with vulnerabilities sifting through his options he started the typing null pointer and caught himself after the first word no nice love this funny the idea was i i'd get a void for my wife's car so our driveway would be vol a null and void and that's actually i mean it's funny it's funny again extra dmv this is again dmv is the first ring of purgatory okay and not like the happy purgatory but like the unhappy purgatory elysian fields i'm pretty sure that's what it is in dante's inferno or that's ring one of hell right terrible place to be the joke had layers though as well new and as he explained in a recent talk at defcon hacker conference null is also a text string that in many programming languages signifies a value that is empty or undefined to many computers null is the void wow the setup also has a brutal punch line one that left at one point facing twelve thousand dollars of traffic fines wrongly sent his way he's still not sure if he'd be able to renew his auto registration this year without paying someone else's tickets and thanks to the kafka-esque loop he's caught in it's not clear if the citations will ever stop coming okay i'm i'm loving this okay i'm loving this i also want to figure out how to get my license plate to become null you know what i mean like how's this like how what is this little ticketing system that's going on where you can get some null null set and it is defcon talk toto played up the idea that he had initially hoped a null plate would get him out of tickets that once fed into the database of offenders the violation quite literally would not compute but he says now that pranks weren't actually his initial focus if anything he was surprised as california dmv website let him register null in the first place the first year as a null driver was uneventful but when it came time to renew in 2017 the dmv website no longer accepted null as an option it broke the website specifically the site told him that the license plate and vehicle identification number he had entered known as the vin were invalid but was still able to use a reference number to renew he didn't think much more of it you know i would say as a security researcher this should have been his first warning i entered in my credentials and the website stopped working so i just got around it you would think just right there would be like uh i just up and i probably need to go figure this out now i probably need to figure this out right now oh is tj still my title yeah let's get tj the hell out of here tj get the hell out of here tj by the way teach a dv i don't know if you know this but he streams on twitch and youtube and generally self-promotes everything at all points all right anyways he also didn't think much of the ticket he got in early 2018 for not having the appropriate registration sticker on his license plate suspects that someone scraped it off and used it on their own car he thought about fighting it but the fine was only 35 dollars so he decided just to pay it and move on with his life you know hindsight's 20 20. five dollars a month for 35 for for seven months is 35 right so like think about that so if you were to subscribe to say me you know that's seven months worth of payments or you could just press the like button that's for free you know what i'm talking about let's see then came the citations dozens of them deposited in bulk in his mailbox parking violations stand stop violation fines of thirty seven dollars sixty dollars seventy four dollars eighty dollars from fresno to ranchero to cucamonga i've never been to fresno says of the california city i've been to fresno i think by the way this is insane nor had tartaro gone to the statewide parking related crime spree instead of paying that 35 ticket it appears that a database somewhere now associated null with his personal information which means that anytime a traffic cop forgot to fill in a license plate number on the citation the fine automatically got sent to joseph the tickets were for hondas toyotas mercedes has an infinity by the way infinite classic infinity driver right infinity day judo are you still in here judo are you still here because you know what judo do you have a customs license plate do you have a cl do you have a custom because this kind of seems kind of like a a judo move right here okay infinity custom license plate they seem to go one-on-one he's gonna get offended and practice judo on me now dr says he received two tickets written at cypress college within hours of each other for two different vehicles he would have had to swap the registration during his lunch break worse yet the incoming citation seemed to apply retroactively i have tickets from 2014 ads i didn't have the plates back then oh this is so good the fines were all sent by a private company called the citation processing center which while processing parking citations but calling them tartaro says proved fruitless i have reached out to this company and they're basically saying that i have to prove without a doubt that these hundreds of tickets aren't mine trying to speak to a manager went nowhere he's like you've got to mail all these back to us doctoro declined worried about potential losing the paper record of the missile misallocated fines but the next day he says he noticed something odd in the public online listing of citations maintained at the citation processing center's website he had given them an example of a spec a specific ticket he had gotten that implicated a honda online that record had been changed to an infinity with or toronto's tarantos wait that's not his name wait i thought i thought it was spelled differently am i yeah torrantos okay that i got a little mixed up there okay got a little mixed up in this article okay you can't just start changing the spelling because it ruins my my ability to say it and then now i get all confused and now i feel like i can't say the name anymore oh my goodness what just happened here you can't just do this to me okay it is emotionally painful who is toronto my immersion is broken okay hold on shared a side-by-side comparison of his paper copy in the apparently altered database version of of his part at defcon talk after i had a phone call directly after the phone call those same tickets where i still have the physical printouts in front of me right now say that their make and model were modified tartaro says hey taste the a citation processing center employee said that while she was aware of the taro's situation the company was unable to comment tataro next turn to the dmv oh my goodness this is by the way again i hate the government okay this is just a classic example of why the government sucks this sucks which he says it worked with the citation processing center to void out the bulk of tickets that had had inherently come his way that successfully got the amount owed down to 6262 as of last weekend but didn't solve the core problem more tickets continue to trickle in the database still had him pegged never get pegged okay trust me just as something you need to understand in this moment getting pegged specifically by the dmv is just the worst experience okay it's just the worst experience i one time was driving along and somehow i got my association with a warrant and my car information like tied together in the system i got like held at gunpoint i got thrown in the back of vehicles just ridiculous for like nothing i did nothing okay i did nothing and all of a sudden the next thing you know i i'm getting arrested  this whole experience just don't get pegged okay that's the moral of the story even though all this remained mostly unconcerned well this is what happens when you make enough money not to be concerned okay most people hit with multi-thousand dollar bills wouldn't be like hey you know i got i gotta make a few phone calls do a little this do a little that not a big deal right like that's crazy if someone just sent me a ten thousand dollar bill i'd my pants remained mostly unconcerned the cpc was just a private company he could keep working with the dmv to avoid the fines as they came in which was an annoyance but not a catastrophe wait till your credit score starts getting destroyed he had successfully registered his car the previous year despite the cpc citations piling up but just days before defcon according to tartaro he says he received a notice that the california dmv would not let him renew his registration unless he actually paid some of those fines okay if you're listening don't push off what could be done today for tomorrow okay you know you know you know you know why'd you renew why'd you renew okay why why would you want to go again why would you want to get back on this miracle round okay why what like after after all of this you're like yeah i'm trying to renew still but it's not letting me what's that all about you know what i want to do i want to be on the dmv phone once a month clearing fines with them so i'm gonna renew my license plate it's like dude how about you just don't renew it okay just come up with some other one come up with say fault me daddy or something like that i don't know pegged by dmv okay there you go there's your license plate enjoy it now that the dmv is enforcing these tickets that are falsified and let's see it changes everything he says at the moment i cannot register my vehicle without paying the tickets but i can't pay the tickets because it admits guilt and the minute i admit that it opens me up to all the other tickets i'm in basically a really bad situation really the situation has improved somewhat in recent days at least calculates that tickets assigned to his car still tallied over 6 000 when he last checked on sunday when wired looked up the null plate in the cpc database tuesday let's see after asking the company about the charges it showed only 140 worth of tickets remaining both from fresno f in fresno effin fresno doesn't see this as much of a of a reprieve he's glad the tickets have vanished but he still wouldn't need to pay the 140 to register his car and there's no guarantee that more fines won't show up along the way change your license plate it also is hard to know where to turn for resolution mr thought of situation appears to stem from policies set by local parking authorities which the dmv has no control over california dmv spokesperson marty geenstein ginstein ginstein said from the dmv's perspective our system recognizes his personal plates and shows he is eligible to renew his registration online assuming he pays the fees oh my god good i'm i'm a spokesperson for the dmv and i would just like to let you know everything is good just pay the fines that's all we're asking okay just pay a couple fees we're looking good prank or not i thought it was playing with fire by going in with null in the first place he had it coming says christopher null with your name is christopher you're telling me christopher nall has some opinions about the word null a journalist who had written previously for wired about the challenges his last name presents all you ever get is errors and crashes and headaches oh no if anything nal says guys [music] oh no this reads like an onion article this is the onion oh my goodness is this the onion babylon b what the hell am i reading here the problem has gotten worse over the years the minimum viable product concept has pushed a lot of bad code through that doesn't go through with the proper level of testing null says adding that anyone affected is inevitably an edge case a relatively small problem not worth devoting a lot of resources to fix null has himself to deal with countless annoyances from american express dropping his last name all together to bank of america refusing to accept emails from nullmedia.com domain so you're you're telling me he's the null exception is that what you're trying to say i didn't let's see yeah i didn't feel comfortable changing until i knew it was actually solved wow what a great article what a great article and also i hate the government the name the primogen
