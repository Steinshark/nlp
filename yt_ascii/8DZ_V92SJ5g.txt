most of the time i pick my own cases but occasionally someone will give me a case and it interests me enough to where i want to see if i can solve it just to challenge myself such was the case today guys i'm in the studio at night it's 1am where i am right now and how to basic the most mysterious man on youtube reached out to me talking about the post malone and weakened music video asking any way you can figure out how much they got paid for this and what he's referencing is this music video where they promote something called moon pay as they buy board apes now obviously this has to be paid and it got me thinking i also would love to know now traditionally these deals would be private but now with crypto i don't think a lot of these guys are aware that it's all just basically out there i decided i wanted to look to see if we could find out for ourselves how much someone like post malone and an a-lister star gets for something like this so blatantly shilling a crypto in the middle of his you know music video with the weekend how much do you have to pay someone for that kind of exposure well when i took the case i wasn't sure i'd be able to figure out and i just want to walk you guys through my process of thinking so we can figure this out together let's jump into it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective and i wasn't sure i'd be able to do this one guys so let's start with what we know let's bring down the board let's watch the video a little bit right let's see what we're looking at here here it is the new music video from none other than post malone and right away we see that something is different because there he is oh we're being cool oh but look at that what's that post has his phone out and he looks like he's buying a board ape which is an nft on something called moon pay which i've never heard of now obviously this was paid for but the question is how do we find out how much they got paid well the easiest way to do it is to find these guys wallet addresses and hunt down to see if they've gotten any suspiciously large transactions around the time of this music video dropping now we already have a clue i don't know if you can see it yet this right here the nft he's buying on moon pay right away this is a unique collectible and if we find out who owns it if they actually bought it you know in the music video we don't know but if they actually bought it that's a good place to start to find out where post malone's wallet is so to start out we're going to go to open c and we're going to find the board apes project and now the thing we're going to do we can't go through all of these there's 10 000 of these instead we're just gonna try to sort through these with the picture we have here already it's an eight with a cowboy hat on on a gray background and the eyes are bored now this has already narrowed the field quite considerably but none of these are exactly what they had in the music video if we enhance their the skin is like this zombie color and so when we sort by that we find nothing okay so it looks like maybe it's a dead end maybe they really didn't buy that nft but if they didn't buy that how can we find out what they did buy well this is generally where i just look around for news articles whatever to see if these guys have ever posted about nfts and because influencers can't help whenever they buy something expensive to talk about it it turns out that yes post malone actually did buy a board ape just not the one that was shown in the music video similar this is the zombie thing but it's on a blue background and sure enough we find it right away now if we take a look at its history here it has been bought recently by this account right here now right away i'm suspecting this is probably post malone but we have to check further so we'll go to his ether scan account to see if he's had any suspiciously large transactions recently that might be from moonpay and so here we are at ether scan we plugged in this guy's address that we suspect is post malone but now all we need for confirmation is just whether you know they got a large transaction around this time so i'm looking around i'm looking around and moonpay moonpay.eth is paying this person which again if you remember is literally the brand he's promoting in his music video so i think we got the right guy and how much are they paying him drum roll please how much does it cost to get post malone and the weeknd to buy an nft with your platform the answer is apparently 175 ether that's right in two transactions post malone or the wallet we believe belongs to post malone got paid 175 ether which is equivalent to a little over 750 000 or three quarters of a million dollars that's how much it costs to get one of these a-listers to talk about your put you in their music video and buy something on your platform now i'll tell you guys right away i already looked for the weekend side of the payment i couldn't find anything my guess is either he got paid in cash or because it's post malone's music video maybe he paid for everything and just he did the deal right maybe it's just a clap like that i have no idea but i was ready to ship off my answer to how to basic and wrap up this case but i you know one thing was just tickling the back of my mind i just had a curiosity how many seconds did this thing appear on this music video this moon pay i wanted to know how much does 750 000 buy in terms of ad time actually how long does it appear on the screen and how does it compare to something like a super bowl ad in terms of cost to get someone like post malone to promote you on his like hottest new music video versus like just like a super bowl ad so for comparison guys i ran the numbers on a 30 second super bowl ad and it costs'3 thousand dollars per second for a 30 second commercial guys now in comparison we're gonna compare this to post malone and we're gonna time how long this moon pay is on screen and see if they should have just bought a super bowl commercial let's watch together ready as soon as i see it on okay i'm starting the timer i'm stopping the timer that was six seconds 5.85 seconds actually so if we plug that into our calculator we get a 134 000 only slightly cheaper than the super bowl ad i mean just a little bit more baby and your your prime time i mean i know these crypto guys are competing for all the biggest influencers to promote them right now but i wonder if this is actually going to pay off for them or not i don't know i guess only time will tell but anyways i hope you enjoyed that guys i hope this was a lesson in how public the blockchain is it took me about i don't know at 10 actual minutes when looking this stuff up on my own to find all this out i was happy to solve this little case for how to basic and i hope you guys learned something about how you can do an investigation of your own thank you for watching that's basically it see in the next one [music] but things will be different if i was balling
