everybody wants to lambo these days but the question is how do you put a literal flying lambo on the literal moon many would tell you the answer's dogecoin what what is dogecoin dogecoin dogecoin is back what is your thoughts on dogecoin right now it will probably cease to exist in a five-year time frame dogecoin is likely to reach the 20 mark yes dogecoin there's been a lot of talk about it is it the biggest thing to happen to finance since tesla or is it just all smoke before during and after doge day which is april 20th or 4 20 for the more sophisticated among you many people have been talking about doge and many of you have come to me to sifu the to the owner of the 10 million dollar studio with burning questions people like my buddy graham what is dogecoin is this sustainable all good questions now normally my response is just a string of useless buzzwords i like to confuse people so the bitcoin maximalists don't freak out and jump me and say you know some i try to give them something that can be interpreted either way so i can't get in trouble i usually say something like this oh there is ico coming so you must make sure blockchain ledger d5 fintech and you know about that cause bitcoin go to the moon wall street bet globally flower bees are now on sale i did just check the alpha dogs and did you go discord server ruby doobie now normally that scares people off they they don't stick around for the rest of it and that's what i'm happy with but people keep asking about doge so today unlike my normal answer i'm actually going to give an answer what i think of doge what is the case for dogecoin what's the case against dogecoin we're going to talk about it all should you respect the pump always guess respect the pump i respect the pump in all assets all right long story short it's probably a huge bubble now before you guys jump me and say he's a no coiner that's how they get you they go you're a no coiner or you're gonna say i'm a hater or jealous because go bur let me just say this look i'm a i'm a fan i'm an investor and a long-term believer in the future of crypto broadly but i simultaneously hold that belief and also the belief that like vast majority 98 of crypto projects are gonna blow up in the next five to ten years and completely fall apart while the real winners are gonna be slow projects with actual utility and usefulness and to explain why i know many of you are already typing in the comments angrily that doge will be the all-time greatest crypto ever slow down let me explain to explain we have to go back in time to the dawn of the world wide web before memes were ever a thing before rick ever rolled anybody and don't worry this is all coming back to doge it's called the dot-com bubble which i know most of you don't know what that is but it was a period of intense speculation about the internet and the future of tech companies in the late 90s here's basically the central thesis of this time period the conclusion that we came to rightly or wrongly so was that the internet was going to fundamentally change the way business was run across the board in every sector of business so basically because the internet's gonna change anything you gotta get your piece you gotta make sure you're a part of it so you can get huge gains and companies were popping up left and right with you know just attaching their name to a.com and getting millions in venture capital people were literally just throwing money at any project that had a modicum of a modem and internet access and to just give you an example of how crazy things were listen to what happened to this mortgage company when they attached.com next to their name when seth werner changed the name of his first mortgage network to mortgage.com and went on the net the estimated market value jumped from 100 to 800 million dollars now in case it's not obvious the point i'm making here is that you can basically replace a few words like internet with crypto and get a synopsis of the current state of investing and speculation within crypto you could describe it like this crypto is a game changer it's here to stay let's grab a piece of some of these future companies and get huge gains this is exactly what the people during the dot-com bubble we're thinking it's the same impulse and look 27 years later we should be able to learn some lessons and apply it to today because while it isn't the exact same similar principles apply and look here's a clip from a com documentary to explain some of the insane culture and just in your head replace dot-com with crypto replace internet with blockchain and i think a lot will probably resonate here with the current state of crypto speculation over and over again scenes like this one would play out at the dot-coms on the day their company's stock went public employees would watch the value of their stock options soar making paper millionaires out of many of them between 1990 and mid-2000 more than 4 700 new companies debuted on america's stock exchanges everybody thought they could get rich quick everybody across from retail investor to investment bank we had this period where money was growing on trees which is totally cool while it's going on i'm sure it was totally cool and i'm sure also if you questioned at the time any of the arbitrary like dot-com valuations you would have also been deemed a hater or better yet like your anti-internet just because you don't like you think some of these companies are overvalued but eventually obviously what goes up must come down then came the crash i mean it was absolutely horrendous billions of dollars of value was lost overnight wiping out a lot of million dollar companies here's the interesting thing the long-term thesis that the internet is here to stay is true though and a few notable exceptions from the dot-com era survived such as amazon.com and yes if you would have been smart you would have invested in them for pennies on the dollar and left the rest of them alone but how does that help us today i think the irrational exuberance shown by today's market like in crypto with dogecoin with all these huge cryptos that are exploding overnight with big clout being a one billion dollar company in a month look it's driven by a true idea i believe is true which is that crypto is going to revolutionize the financial industry and potentially more but the valuations of individual cryptos are almost completely divorced from reality at this point just like the valuations of individual tech stocks were divorced from the reality back in that day too and just like young inexperienced tech founders were getting millions of dollars in venture capital crypto teams are now doing nothing and getting billion dollar market caps overnight like dogecoin for example just passed the valuation of ford you know like a real company with real revenues and a meme coin driven by pure speculation stimulus checks and a bull market hey it's worth more that makes sense right no safe moon is another crypto which we will be covering soon guys it's exploded recently we're gonna cover it as soon as we can reached a billion dollar market cap also in a month of launching think about that this crypto coin nobody knows if it will be successful pure speculation billion dollars it's completely insane 98 of these projects will fall apart mark my words and look i think the smartest thing to do if you realize all of this and you recognize this is you just try to learn from history this cannot last all these cryptos you know simultaneously succeeding and reaching higher and higher highs eventually there will be a crypto crash and any influencer telling you otherwise telling you like unironically to the moon bro they're lying to you everything is speculation on who will win long term and most of these valuations are going nowhere but zero the truth about crypto is that a few winter coins are going to dominate most of the market while the rest eventually get crumbs just like today google facebook amazon they just dominate the market and you know your average blog doesn't it isn't some giant success now am i telling you to stay away from crypto altogether though not at all i think if you look at the dot-com bubble you could still get great companies for pennies on the dollar who have survived till today but catching those winners was not about just like blindly listening to all the hype and whatever it's about doing the opposite you have to ignore the hype and pay attention to fundamentals i can't believe i'm saying this not pumpamentals okay and it also means you have to be careful and realize you could be wrong wildly wrong about who's gonna last and if you're gonna go invest make sure it's money you can afford to lose now with all of that said what are the so-called fundamentals of dogecoin well let's listen to the most bullish dogecoin fan the meme lord himself elon musk the point is that dogecoin was invented as a joke as essentially to make fun of cryptocurrency and that's why i think i think there's like an argument like fate loves irony like the most entertaining outcome is the most like what would be the most ironic outcome that the the currency that was invented as a joke in fact becomes the real currency right oh no absolutely to the moon to the moon yes the meme hypothesis of economics capable of explaining things such as game stunk it's a good idea honestly it's a novel theory the fact that dogecoin isn't trying to be anything but a joke like and that being why it's attractive to speculators it makes some sense when you think about why it's so viral but and i sound like the old dad on the line going you kids look dude fundamentals everyone care about dude fundamentals are so lame now but really we have to eventually ground our valuations in some kind of like actual use case i mean it's all great to be the meme stock until people actually start using cryptos and then it's like okay well what does your crypto do that i should actually put money in it and that's the whole problem with tech stocks in the 90s was nobody was looking at are these companies actually useful and valuations weren't based on real revenue and they crashed because of it and this is where i completely disagree with mr i will put a little dogecoin on the literal moon elon musk the most memeable outcome is not the most likely one look i've just given my opinion here i know i'm not linking my mind to a monkey like elon musk is but i think if you look at tech the most value creating company was the most likely outcome google facebook none of these were meme stocks they were companies with actual usage actual like use case so in the same way i think cryptocurrency like right now when nobody's really you know won yes meme stocks are gonna win but when people actually start using cryptos the one with actual like usage in the real world will be the winner whether that be defy exchanges like uniswap or stores of value like bitcoin that's why i'm not going to be investing in dogecoin and i encourage no one else to do so either and if you are someone who's still a fan of dogecoin i think that's fine if you look at it for what it is which is gambling right things like dogecoin safe moon a lot of these coins they're just like big plays that probably will die off very soon and if you know you're investing in something that's gonna fall apart i guess do what you want with your money right now i think there are some secondary cases about dogecoin too like that there's one person holding 30 of the total currency and i think there are some other problems as well but the most relevant point is this will dogecoin be a crypto that stays around or is it gonna be a flash crash i think it's the latter that's why i don't hold it and if you disagree i'd love to hear why because whether you're a fan of doge safe moon bitcoin ethereum or you don't hold any of them you can always pump one thing for sure zillow absolutely for free you can pop the stock by liking and subscribing and i appreciate all of the support thanks for watching hope you enjoyed this deep dive and i'll see you guys in the next one wake up and smell the coffee [music]
