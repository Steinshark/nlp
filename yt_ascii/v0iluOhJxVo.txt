- hello and welcome to
mystery tech, my friends. it can get real wacky, real quick. jesus. - [matt] oh, that might've broke. - [austin] (laughs) - [matt] moss. - moss lab. is this for growing (slap)? - [matt] no. no.
- [ken] yo. hey, oh. - [matt] no, it's not. - [ken] let's go. - [austin] what's it for then? - we're a wholesome family show. - [austin] it looks like
a whole forest inside of a water bottle? - [matt] look on the side. - [austin] moss humidifier
and air purifier. am i just not familiar with
the magical properties of moss? it has moss air, moss
filter, cotton filter, water spray, control ball. do i have to like grow stuff? - [matt] that's what i'm not sure. so this was in like an indiegogo thing. - [austin] oh, of course it was. - and it took, months. - so basically someone
took an air purifier. - okay. - and the idea of a chia pet. - [austin] okay. - and combine them together. - okay. does anyone know
the safety precautions? number one, do not ingest the moss. - [matt] dammit. - so let's see what we've got here. so we have our moss filter.
this is the moss air. they also have some balls. and i don't know why i have
balls in my hand right now. - [alex] that's how you control it. like i'm not even joking. - you control what? - [alex] you control
the machine by like moving the magnetic balls. - you play with the balls? - [alex] yes. so this is perfect for gamers. you get to play with balls, and you get to touch grass
all at the same time. - oh god. ah. no. not grass. no, it's moss. it's fine. okay. you know i've read these,
these instructions. - [ken] oh sure. touch balls it's fine. touch grass, oh god! - (laughs) well yeah. i only wanna do one of these things. okay. this is my moss. oh, well you know what? - [alex] oh, it sounds like real moss. - [ken] oh! - it smells actually very delightful. would anyone like to smell the moss? - [matt] yeah, yeah, sure. gimme a whiff. oh my god. that is nice. - it is lovely. - [austin] it's incredibly delightful. so i'm going to attach this
until i get a nice solid click. (click) ah, i got it. okay, cool. alright, activate. well, i see why they say max level, 'cause it just spilled everywhere. - [alex] oh my god. - it's fine. - [matt] now we're gonna have moss growing on the table. oh my god. - [ken] why would you do that? - [alex] use a paper towel. - look. you know what happens, is if you spread the water out, it evaporates faster so you don't have to clean up your
mess. i've done this. - [matt] i swear to god
if we come back in here and there's moss growing on my table. - so hold it for three seconds. ah! - [ken] oh, how lovely. oh, oh! - [austin] there we go.
it's doing the thing! - [matt] we got a (slap)
in here now. (laughs) - so wait, what do i do
with the balls though? can i play with the balls yet? i shut it off. oh. oh, it blocks it. now look all the, the steam
is going into the moss. oh, i don't know if this is the way this is supposed to work. - [ken] taste of your own medicine. - [matt] is this terrarium mode. - [austin] now it's coming out the bottom. oh. so we're watering the moss by, oh, that's kind of clever. how much was our moss air humidifier, air purifier and thing that's gonna get me demonetized? - [alex] ] it is $110. - considering how over the
top this entire thing is, that's actually not crazy. not sure how to review this in any other way besides,
i think it's cool? this episode of mystery tech
is sponsored by whatnot. whatnot is the most fun place to find tech deals on the internet. i've done a few whatnot streams already, including doing a bunch of giveaways, selling a bunch of mystery boxes. and all my items have started at $1. but this time around i'm going to be teaming up with keevado. not only do we have giveaways this time, including a meta quest 3,
apple watch, and airpods. but every single item of tech that we sell will all be starting at $1. so definitely be sure to drop
by the stream this wednesday, march 20th at two o'clock pacific time. we'll have some of the
time zone conversions here. and if you use my link in the description, you will get yourself $10 off if you are a brand new whatnot customer. i will see you on whatnot, my friends! where we'll have fun and whatnot. alrighty.
- [alex] brrr. did you just say brrr? - [matt] brrr.  it's so cold in here. - is it though? i think
it's perfectly reasonable. - [alex] brrr. - okay. the fact that this bounced,
and it has no give. it's via dubai. hmm. - [matt] this is something
that seemed like your type. - my type? - [ken] (laughs) my type,
i see what you did there. - are you making a joke
about my preferences in life? - [matt] yeah. - [austin] all right. what
are we looking at here? a jacket? oh my god, it's really heavy. what the? oh my, oh good lord. - [ken] (laughs) - all caps when you spell the man's name. - [ken] (laughs) so this is the ny jackets. it's just a bunch of
like pillows basically, but it has a bunch of keys on it. well, you better believe,
i'll put this on. - [matt] it's cherry,
cherry pillow switches. - it's, well, so it's like
a, i think, is it leather? no, vinyl. very vinyly. okay. how much was the all caps jacket? - [matt] for the record,
it's supposed to be white. - okay. - [matt] so it's a
little, little yellowing. - [alex] $220. but keep in mind the original, you know, technically if it ever
existed that you could buy it, it would've been like over $1,000. - so, okay, some thoughts. because it's like a regular jacket, it has like these like,
sort of like pillows on it. it is not only heavy but incredibly bulky. so like i, this, this
is how high my arms go. - [matt] i'm not gonna lie. it doesn't look horrible on you. - [ken] yeah, it's actually kind of fine. it says fu on the back, but otherwise. - [austin] does it? can you
take a closer look at that? - f. u. - so, let me just try this for a second. - [ken] wait the zippers a hashtag? - [matt] yeah. - wait, wait. did you hear it? - [alex] yeah, it's like the air is rushing out of it, basically. - [matt] the problem is i see it. - if you two would like
to be stylish like me, you can visit austinevans.com where i will be the exclusive purveyor. i'm not sure why i'm
doing that with my knees. going to put those knees down. i'll be the exclusive
purveyor of the cap jacket. okay, so that's a bunch of little boxes. ah, marques key cap?
marques makes key caps? is this a, this a real just? no. no marques doesn't make key
caps, andy made key caps. - [matt] andy makes key caps. - yep, i knew it. i knew it. i knew it. - [matt] with marques' logo on it. - [austin] (laughs) alright. so we've got a number of key caps here. so these are dbrand, mkbhd key caps. alright, i'm down. let's take a look. all right, i'm gonna
do the black one first. let's see what we got. watch this just gonna be a pure matte black key
cap with nothing on it. - [ken] gee, i wonder
what makes you think that? - that's a matte black key cap alright. it's so small. it's kind of hard. like, you know, like most of the time when you like pick up a
material, you can kind of tell. oh, this thing's like plastic or metal. it's so small, it's actually
kind of hard to tell. it feels quite nice
though. can you hear that? - [ken] if you want a reference point. - oh god. this stupid thing. all right, so this is
the cybertruck keyboard. wait, you already got one on here? - [ken] yeah, andy,
andy sent me all of these and he was like, you can have one. - we also have a, i assume red one, which is probably the one
i would actually wanna use. ooh! that red looks so much better. so it's got like a little
bit of like shininess. it's actually sort of like embossed in. that looks so sick. ooh. and the silver. so
there's black, red, and silver. i actually might like the silver the most. obviously that's not like a
normal like marques color, but the silver looks good
and it really shows off just how metallic this key cap is. alright, i'm gonna try the red one. the red one feels like that's the move. yeah, it feels really
nice. how much are these? because i'll tell you, i'm
getting a sense of some real heft and quality with these
very tiny little key caps. - [ken] so each one is $30. - yep. - [austin] i was actually,
i was gonna think 40. - [ken] yeah. thought i thought.
i thought i thought so too. it's actually not as much as i thought. i mean it's a lot for singular key cap. - of course. but, um. there's also
an austin key cap too. - [ken] wait, really? there is? - you know about this! - [ken] wait, what? - [matt] tiny. - no, no. we did a thing with
drop. you can go on drop. go on drop.com and look austin evans. - [ken] you mean corsair.com? - [austin] you've seen
this key cap before. look at the, you've, the key cap. - [ken] oh, yeah. - what? i have my own key cap! you can get on drop. - [matt] well no one requested it so. - we did it as a, as a charity thing. it's only five bucks. - [matt] well, look you were the charity case
on that one, my dude. - okay. yes. the marques key cap is far superior to the austin key cap and it's real nice. but there's also, - [matt] i'm famous too! - look, my key cap might
be on sale right now because drop's trying to clear 'em out. we support st. jude.
it's for a good cause. so, uh, mkbhd key caps, better
than the austin key caps. um, these are real nice. thanks andy. and marques and and adam and dbrand and
everyone else, but thanks andy. - (grunts) - that is fragile. do not throw. (laughs) okay, cool. so something fragile that you're not supposed to throw from ebay. love it, love it, love it. - [ken] tell us! - wait, i know what this one is. so not too long ago we did a
very cool item on mystery tech, which was a powerbook titanium. so after everyone thought that that was a hilarious, wonderful segment. i went on ebay, slightly
inebriated as usual. and i looked for one of the most iconic items that has ever been
presented on a keynote. - [ken] the ipod? - no, no, not that one. no, no, no. not that one either. look how small this device is. it keeps seeing smaller and smaller. - [ken] gee, i couldn't tell
through all this packing. - behold, my friends one of the most influential computers
of the 21st century. - [ken] the 12 inch macbook? - no, the original macbook air. wow. this one's (slap) up. wow. wow. it's just gross, feel,
feel the texture of that. it feels like someone like freaking dragged it through the dirt. so if you're not familiar, the original macbook air was brought out on stage by steve jobs. he pulled it out of a manila envelope. it was a very famous moment because this was back in the days where computers were still pretty thick. even macbooks at the time
were still like yay thick. and the idea that you could
have a ultra portable laptop that was this thin was very, very cool. - [matt] i need a shower
after touching that. - [austin] well. was this a problematic
machine in some ways? yes, it was. but we'll talk
about that in a minute. let's admire just the sheer engineering
that went into making this a system in like 2008, i think? you get your little pop down ports, got mini displayport, usb
and aux hiding together. you've got your weird little magsafe that goes down for reasons. there was a lot of very custom engineering that went into this. password is 1-1-1-1. sick. - [matt] great, now everyone's gonna know. - (laughs) i'm not sure how we can tell on camera, but we're gonna just take a minute and give this a little wipe down, disinfecting wipe and, hm, hand sanitizer and maybe
a little bit of fire. and then we'll, we'll show this
macbook hopefully in action, 'cause it is legitimately a
very, very cool piece of tech. so with some disinfecting
action happening, one immediate issue i'm
seeing here is the charger. so this, this does use magsafe, which as you can see is very
easily magnetically removed. but because this is so thin, it goes in basically facing down. so if i'm just gonna
use this on the table, watch, i'll plug it in. okay. and then. it needs to basically be
propped up on like a box or something to actually even charge. now i had a second gen
macbook and it was lovely. the second gen macbook air i
think was a terrific device. but the first gen had a lot, and i mean a lot of compromises. that being said, we've got our
box, we've got our charger, which looks like it's taking a charge. let's see if it actually works, shall we? hey, and the screen works.
now gimme some macos action. - [matt] look at that flicker on camera. - i'll tell you the flicker you're seeing is not what i'm seeing in life. yeah, there we go. apple logo. when this macbook was sold, one of the biggest downsides
to it was performance. now they worked with intel
to develop a custom version of the core 2 duo specifically to fit in a tiny little
motherboard, right? again, this is years and years before tiny ultrabook style
computers were common. this is also before ssds were prevalent. so this uses a 1.8 inch hard drive. you know the hard drive that
was in your ipod classic. yeah. so, the biggest problem with this is not only the
fact they didn't have a lot of performance, but the hard
drive speed was atrocious. that being said, this was a 2009 model. oh, look at the click
on that track pad. wow. and there's no right click either on it. so we got ourselves a two
gigahertz intel core 2 duo, two gigabytes of ram,
which if i remember right, was the only amount of ram
you could get with this. i don't actually know
if that was an upgrade. nvidia geforce 9400m graphics. this has a 1280 by 800 display,
which looks kind of bad. and it has a ssd? - [matt] yeah. - huh? could you get this with
an optional ssd? 128 gigs. like it must have been
if you bought an ssd with your computer in 2009, that must have been an
absurdly expensive thing. for context, this system
when it came out was $1,700 15 years ago. considering that this has an ssd, i'm actually gonna open it up and see. it's actually really snappy, and it's also updated all
the way to mac os el capitan. which is, i mean, several
years out of date. but i mean this, this is
actually kind of impressive. i mean, i spent like 150
bucks on this thing, right? so i don't think anyone should go out and buy one of these to actually use. but as a history piece, as
something that was like a massively, massively
influential piece of technology. this is really cool. i'm using the magic of a phillips
screwdriver and that's it. we are inside of our macbook air. all right, let's see what
we're working with here. wow, that looks modern. alright, there is a lot going on here. so not only do we have our airport or our wifi card here,
a quite large battery, which is 40 watt hours. actually it's not that big,
but it's very physically wide because this is such a thin device. you've got your ports, which are kind of sticking out the side here. but here's where it gets wacky. so this is our ssd and our motherboard, which is fairly small. especially for the back in the day. but it actually looks like
it's got soldered on ram, which again, must have
been the first time. i can't imagine any other system having soldered on ram back in the day. maybe something really weird and custom. and then look at this. this is the ssd. so this is a 1.8 inch drive. now again, this was originally
the same sort of form factor that we have inside like an ipod. so even like a regular
2.5 inch laptop drive was way too big for this. this is a first gen product. but you look at this,
you look at the design, you look at the thinness,
you look at a lot of the, the decisions they made here. and you tell me that this
is a 15-year-old laptop. that is crazy to me. can i get a, oh yeah. - [ken] oh yeah. - i didn't finish that. i was going to. hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. don't. put the tungsten
cube down gently. gently. thank you very much. this my friends, is one of the most expensive items we've
ever put on mystery tech. a massively expensive and massively heavy solid cube of tungsten. which weighs many, many, many kilograms or pounds in freedom units. this thing is heavy. what is that? are you sure you wanna throw that? oh, it's really lightweight. - [ken] the fake. - okay. this is the hyperspace lighting
company's hypercube nano. so it's a nano hypercube lighting accoutrement to our tungsten? this is quite the item.
what am i doing here? okay, so it's a cube.
thankfully much less heavy. - [ken] wow. - all right. so we got ourselves a big old cube that i assume. - [ken] it's the allspark
robots in disguise. wub wub wub. - [matt] wub wub wub. - megan fox. - [austin] (laughs) - so what i see here is a cube, which looks like it has
a large number of leds to go all the way around it. - [ken] oh, i think i
already know what this is. - i, is it gonna be one of
those like infinity cubes? so i'm gonna plug this in. so the way it seems to work is, uh, we plug it in here. it comes with an ethernet cable, which i will run through the stand, and then i plug my ethernet
cable into this little dongle. - [ken] dongle? wait, ethernet? - [austin] it's got
ethernet, which goes to this, - [ken] it's power hoarding. (laughs) - i think it is for some bizarre reason. and then i plug this into usb-c power. okay, so we're, we're
gonna plug it in and? - [ken] wow. - [matt] oh, oh - [austin] my god. so you can see that as i
sort of rotate it around, it's got a series of leds and mirrors. so like you can just go and go and go. - [ken] that's kind of incredible. - [austin] so, because you've got all
these mirrors, look at it. when you line it up, it looks like it goes on forever, dude. that is so cool. how much was the hypercube nano? - [alex] it's $170. i mean, that's kind of a lot
of money for some led strips and a bunch of little
mirrored compartments. but this is pretty cool. - [matt] what's better than two cubes? - three cubes. am i right? now that's a cube right there. we got ourselves the led
mood lamp controller. is this just a big ass cube? - all right. - [matt] no. - can someone help me pull the box? - [ken] oh my. - [austin] just pull. behold my friends. the big, ass cube. what am i looking at right
now? it's just a big cube. oh wait, (thumping) oh, woo. - we got ourselves a couple
of buttons down here. so we have a dc in. it looks weirdly
waterproof for some reason. and then we have a little hole for things. we're gonna plug it in.
let's see what happens. okay, so off, on, r g b! - [matt] now imagine this outside. - [ken] oh, okay. - [matt] and it's
waterproof for some reason because this is an outdoor seat. - [narrator] (bruh) - [ken] this absolutely
looks like something that apple would just have in like
one of their press thingies. - [joanna] yeah. put
the seat on the table. - [ken] why do you, why, why did that
pop into your mind first? - [austin] i gotta say,
it's really bright up here. i feel like i'm ascending to a, a higher realm of spirituality. - [matt] we all wish, but.
yeah, don't get our hopes up. - [austin] so how much is
my hyper cube butt pillow? - [matt] a steal. - have i got the items for you? whether it's the trippy cube where you can see directly
into your own soul. a nice bouncy rgb butt illumination device. or a tungsten cube. the austin evans channel is here for all of your cube related needs. and all you need to do is
subscribe to the channel and ring-a-ling the ding-a-ling button, which sadly is not in a cube shape, but i'm working on it. - [matt] oh my god, nope, okay. - [ken] we are going. well, can't wait to get that insurance. okay. okay, okay. okay. - [austin] i'm okay.
