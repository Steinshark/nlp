[music] so the way smartphones normally work is you get a phone one year and then about a year after that you get that phone's successor but oppo have taken that convention and just i was sat here just four months ago telling you about the oppo reno 3 pro and yeah i'm about to tell you about the oppo reno 4 pro so this is the packaging took me about an hour to realize that you can actually see the word reno going vertically up the box kind of cool you get inside that and it's pretty standard oppo fare but with one twist it's an almost plain white box you get a clear case your instruction manuals and a sim ejector tool the smartphone obviously usbc cable pair of earphones and this is the important bit a 65 watt charger that's a lot of watts okay this is the phone so the reno 3 pro was a good 400 phone the reno 4 pro is its 4 month later successor so the reason i'm making this i guess the question that's on my mind is how much better can they actually make it a fair bit reno 4 pro can fully charge in about 35 minutes versus 55 minutes or to put it another way if you started charging them at the same time then by the time the reno 3 pro is hit 25 the 4 pro is on almost 50. it has a better chipset a snapdragon 720 g versus helio p95 so if i run a quick antutu benchmark the arena 4 pro scores around 280 000 versus 200 000. that's a 40 improvement in a gap of four months which is huge and because they started integrating graphite into the cooling architecture the temperatures are lower too i actually ran this benchmark three times and by the time we were done the renew 4 cpu was at around 34 degrees the reno3 49. they've given the display a bump the new one actually looks remarkably similar to the one found on the oneplus 8 which is a good thing that phone is like 35 more expensive so that means a 2400 by 1080 amoled 90 hertz panel with slight curves and i've actually put a fair bit of thought into this whole concept of putting a curved display on a mid-range phone but i think it actually makes sense from oppo's end a lot of tech people were not the biggest fans of curved displays because they can be impractical but i think because this is a feature that you basically never see on mid-range phones to an average consumer it kind of elevates it it makes the reno4 pro look immediately higher end than it is it'll probably sell more units and to top the whole thing off they've redone the design now i actually thought the reno 3 pro looked kind of nice but i think next to the 4 it does look a little outclassed mind you the arena 4 is still made of plastic it still has that single speaker and the headphone jack on the bottom like the reno 3 but it's the way they've created this slightly coarse grippy finish which it makes it feel very similar to the matte glass on the one plus phones the only way you can tell it's plastic is that there's a slight bit of flex in the material and it's about 20 grams lighter when i first picked the phone up i thought the batteries weren't inside so at this point i'm thinking this is a lot of improvements for a four month gap this looks like a miracle 40 faster charging 40 faster performance better display better design but the one thing i've noticed is that even though the camera module has definitely gotten bigger since last gen i wouldn't say the cameras have necessarily gotten better but oppo has tried to compensate for this by adding even more features to it most of them good some of them not for example something they call night flare portrait mode you're probably used to the idea of a night mode and a portrait mode but this is the first time that a company is actively encouraging you to use them together and this mode basically brings out the light in the foreground and exaggerates the bokeh from any background lights behind you i totally get that for a purist even the concept of this is vomit inducing but for me personally i'm actually not bothered with whether it's real or not this quickly became one of my favorite features i was taking photos sending them to friends and they couldn't believe they were taken on phone they can also technically take 108 megapixel shots and this is software based so they're not going to be as good as true 108 megapixel shots but they are noticeably more detailed than photos taken on auto one thing you do feel the lack of here is optical image stabilization it would probably be the first thing i would add back in if i had the choice but to try and compensate they've added ultra steady video mode which increases the frame rate and irons out bumpiness and this also actually works on the front camera which you don't normally see and i quickly discovered that there's actually quite a few interesting video modes one that lets you filter out just the red blue or green light i don't think i've ever seen this before and this ai color portrait which gives only the human subjects color and i have seen this before but what makes it better here is that instead of flicking on and off when it detects people the color fades in and fades out which feels less jarring than i'm used to seeing okay couple of things that i'm not a fan of this is technically capable of shooting 960 frames per second slow motion but when doing so it looks like it's only actually recording at a quarter of that and just using interpolation to create intermittent frames so it doesn't look 100 real and the night mode on the reno3 pro was probably one of my favorite features for a mid-range phone it was exceptional in the dark and the arena 4 pro is good but not as good it creates higher contrast night shots which can look better at a glance but zoom in and it doesn't get as much detail in the general photo quality is fine here and it shoots photos quickly which is important if you don't have optical image stabilization because it can help to prevent blurring like this photo here was taken while going 70 miles per hour down a motorway and it still looks crisp the front camera is okay it's not as good as the 44 megapixel dual selfie camera on the reno 3 pro but it's fine no real complaints about it and it does still support front camera night mode and that is pretty much the reno 4 pro it's not an everything upgrade but considering that it's come out four months after the reno three pro considering that oppo have basically used a third of the time frame that companies normally have between phones it's more than i expected it takes a lot of the things i liked about the reno3 pro like battery life like design like display and it makes them better you can get a full two days of use out of this thing and it left me with just two constant reminders that this isn't a flagship phone the lack of optical image stabilization and the average haptics in the phone i find this such an interesting case study because i mean flagships aren't improving 40 every four months so are we going to get to a stage where the mid-range very quickly starts to catch up with the high end because at this rate of progression it wouldn't take very long i don't have an exact price for the arena 4 pro by the way but i've been working on the basis that it should be around the same ballpark as the renault 3 pro if you enjoyed this video a sub to the channel would be incredible my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
