there's got to be a way and i know you've done videos about this but i'll just say there's got to be a way to both love your ancestors and also be honest about their sins yeah there's got to be a way to do that and and right now it seems like we can only do one or the other that's actually a function of idolatry it's an image of idolatry because one of the things that happens is that because we don't have the fractal relationship because we don't have this hierarchy that leads all the way up to god we actually expect of these lower rungs to be perfect and if they're not perfect we hate them because they're not perfect and so there's a sense in which if things were properly laid out and we don't treat these figures as idols to worship them or to cast them down either way that we we see them as just manifestations that are great because they're not god you know all these leaders all these heroes have dark sides obviously there's no way around right yeah then we could celebrate their heroism and also recognize their sins good this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world foreign [music] i am very excited as usual to be here with richard roland for the continuation of our universal history series this time we're actually going to look at the idea of national epics and the way in which different nations would tell their own story how in some ways they they tried to pop out and to have their own their own particular vision but then also how that ultimately still fits into the idea of universal history so i'm excited to go along with this so richard it's good for you to be here thank you before we get started i will say more about this at the end because it is cleverly related to our topic today but uh graceful segways abound in this in today's episode but we have a i have a kickstarter going it should basically already be live when this video drops or within a day or two so they'll be linked down below it's to a tabletop role-playing game called amborea role-playing in the world understood light if you want to know what the world under starlight is and why we're doing it as a role-playing game and not some other medium i'm going to answer those questions at the end of the video it's funny when jonathan when you posted my it was here at the kickstarter like the landing page you know like a couple of people in the comments like on youtube or whatever were like you know christian shouldn't be you know role-playing gameplay i know yeah right well so anyway i'm gonna talk about i'm gonna talk about actually very soon i'll be doing a video with father dick and nicholas kotar where we'll be talking about that question specifically but but also so i'll say more about that project at the end because it's kind of related to the topic of today's video but yeah so part of the reason i wanted to talk about this is because i have recently met a bunch of like symbolic world folks in the wild sometimes unexpectedly you know usually they just show up at my church shout out to samuel if you're listening samuel who came to vespers on wednesday night and he's like wait what are you doing here well this is my church what are you doing here but you know but no it was it was great but so i've been talking to some people who are kind of new to the symbolic world in the universal history train and so i thought it would be useful because we've been doing these videos for almost two years now i think crazy yeah maybe actually two years i'm not even sure anymore amazing we've been we've done been doing them for a while so i thought it might be useful to revisit a little bit and maybe kind of putting some new terminology what we mean by universal history because one of the things that i've noticed in my conversations with people online and in person is that sometimes people sort of get a little confused about what we mean by medieval universal history and we'll mistake it for things that look similar but maybe have completely different goals so that's we're gonna start go for it so the symbolic medieval universal history is let's say sorry i'm looking down at my notes it's a combination of the of what let's call the christian mythic content and by mythic obviously i think everybody should know by now i do not mean faults right but christian mythic content in the in the sense that it's a myth that we live into a sacred story etc so there's a christian mythic content which is obviously the bible is also the apocrypha by which i mean the actual apocrypha not the director's cut of the bible and then it's and then it's also it's also like the lives of the saints and then all the squiggly folklore traditions weird stuff you know dog-headed saints and the head of saint john the baptist flying around haunting people we were just talking about before the recording started like stuff like that like all that stuff that's kind of out there more on the margins of the tradition that's all kind of part of this christian mythic content yeah so it's that plus the mythical content of greece and rome and specifically the great classical epics the homeric epics and the aeneid like if you want to really drill down to to the core of that yeah and there's a little bit of foray into more local mythic traditions i'd say like scandinavian traditions but but the greek and roman mythological always ends up being connected in some way even to those scandinavian traditions yeah so i'll get to the the more local stuff here in just a sec because that's the next part of this right so but this is the this stuff together right becomes the i i was i've been thinking about it like in terms of hierarchy but it's almost like when you when you hear me say a hierarchy in this instance it is better to understand it as like a series of like nesting dolls rather than like something that's really top heavy and like an upside down pyramid or something like that right yeah it's a fractal like it's the best example of a fractal it's like little identities exist in larger identities and connect you know vertical the biblical narrative you could say right and so this container of the christian mythical content plus greco-roman civilizations mythical content the container of those two two things together becomes a container which is like large enough and sort of robust enough to then contain this multi-tiered hierarchical identity within it so this is this is so identity in the ancient world unlike the way most of us think about identity today we'll talk more about that later is it's hierarchical that is it's conveyed from the top down or from the outside in right if you're thinking about nesting dolls and it begins with god and it ends with me so you have the you have god right and then you have the sort of like the the almost parallel streams and i realize there's a whole very long-running historical debate about who has priority the pope or the emperor or whatever or if you're in these you've got the patriarch and the emperor but in any case you know you've got god and then you've got the the pope or the patriarch and the emperor and then down from there you have these various increasingly localized principalities so if we're talking about the church then you've got under the patriarch you've got like there's the holy you know the base is your local bishop and then your local bishop there's the priest that he's basically deputized to act on his behalf like all the way down to you and then if you're talking about that on a national level i mean it's not for nothing that the original like diocesan structure of the like a diocese is a is a roman imperial like uh division of geography and and people like so like the original like metropolitan diocesan structure of the church in the early centuries was basically they just used what the roman empire kind of already had in place right so that you would have you would have these these increasingly local nested identities that are basically parallel yeah it's important because you know when a lot of modern historians when they notice the gestures for example that some local what they would call a warlord makes towards the emperor who is like so far away and they have nothing to do with they tend to dismiss that as just irrelevant and or just and just you know just words but but it if you understand the way that people saw identity then you can see that no this gesture is very relevant to how they anchor everything together and make every and make everything make sense in their world yes so in the way that that worked for like worldly power structures or ecclesiastical power structures it also works for stories so at the at the top or the outside you have this uh oh and the other thing to say about that that you know social ecclesiastical hierarchy is that there are holy people a good example would be like your local patron saint right holy people sort of exist outside or kind of bridge the hierarchy in unexpected ways so if you live in a small medieval village in central europe or something like this you know you've got the emperor and the patriarch and everything way up here way up above you but then like there's also your local patron saint maybe it's saint nicholas right so like if things are if things are really getting out of hand so you you have a you have a a path of like appeal let's say right you can you can go to saint nicholas and he can go around i mean you know he can go around the the pope or the patriarch or the or the emperor or whatever and to kind of like help you out in your situation so you've got holy people and of course the prob the problem with the problem with modern people trying to understand this is we all want to be the person who's outside the hierarchy right and it doesn't you know but it's but it's really just the holy people and when i say holy really hear that not just in a sense of this is a good person or a nice person but that in the sense that this person is sanctified or set apart because there are there's also such a sort of a thing as let's say like the secular holy person which i'll come back to in a minute right so anyway a secular in this holy person in the sense that somebody's like a secular but they're but they're set apart and because they're set apart they're also sort of operating outside the normal hierarchy of things yeah so it's in some ways there there are ways in which the hierarchies these are when i said like in terms of a system it's it's like fail-sized in the hierarchy yes yes yes that's the way to i mean it's not it's not as simple as that but it's a good way for people to understand why the hierarchies are never even even when we talk about hockey they're never just this simple top-down thing they have a a kind of variability and and ways to to shortcut when things go wrong along the along the hierarchy itself actually so before we started talking about before we started the recording we're talking about the arthurian stories a little bit and the like but the night errant is a good example of that kind of a person in in that sort of story right because they they have this role that puts them outside the normal hierarchy so they show up in like a barron's district and the baron is evil and he's awful and he's oppressing people and it's like well where's the king why doesn't the king know about what's going on but but actually the night aaron he has like a he has a pipeline to the king right so he's here from the round table he's here from the king's court and he sets things right and then he goes back right he goes back to the court when it's over so anyway that's that's an example of that kind of thing so if this is true for like you could say social ecclesiastical hierarchies it's also true for the hierarchy of stories when we're talking about universal history so we start with this kind of one grand foundational story which is sort of mythic the the the the mythic content of christianity plus rome right that's the ground foundational story into which you have these increasingly localized identity conferring patterns the story of well now here's what here's the story of my people when we converted and then beyond that you might have here's the story of my city or my village and beyond that you have you have like here's my family history all the way down to this is how my parents raised me and all of that stuff and of course what i'm really describing is the idea of tradition yeah right all of that stuff confers identity at all these different levels but it has the capability to kind of each of those levels to be nested and obviously obviously there are certainly places that converted i mean this is why we actually kind of started the series with ethiopia right is because there are places that converted that were outside the roman empire so in that case they're they're actually like the best proof case for like how this works because it's not like they had any like political you know yeah they had no political reason to play this game yeah no right there are meetings for the in the same way another great example they had no exact no reason because people always say that it's just constantine and rome and like we have several case examples where that seems to not be the case right right right right so so yeah so any of these identity conferring stories can be aggregates or a pastiche and actually this is better and this is another thing that to kind of point out this is why for purposes of what we're doing here i'm deeply under interested in questions like authorship yeah doesn't actually matter right and the reason it doesn't matter is because certain kinds of things not everything but certain kinds of things actually have more authority when either we don't know who wrote them or or made them or when the person who wrote or made them is it has become a mythic person in some way right so to give some some examples of this actually a really good example of this is the divine liturgy and the the divine services in the orthodox church yeah right there was no committee that at any point in time sat down and said here's the way we're going to do things and there is not there's not a regulatory body across all the orthodox churches in the world that says all right everybody we're making this change to liturgy this year right it's not how it works you can dig down into the history and i've done this and there are lots of people out there who've done this you can dig down in history and figure out oh this part appeared here yeah or this prayer we this prayer maybe came from saint john of damascus or you know like the the but even then that's a saint that's a holy person that is somebody who's become a mythic person right but it's actually because it wasn't just created by committee that it has the kind of the weight and the authority and the sense that you can't just do whatever you want with it yeah right it comes down from heaven right yeah it comes down from heaven right that's the that's but when we say something like that that's what we mean we don't mean that like the typical one dropped out of the sky it's landed on someone's head somebody else somebody's people you know [laughter] what a silly what a silly image yeah but yeah we don't mean that but what we mean is that this is this is really it passed down through the life of the church right as opposed to it appears like it appears and so because it's the same with some of these icons not made with hand you know people yeah yeah yeah there's a way in which the idea that the icon not made with hands was never made by anybody i understand i don't want to be i want to be careful right it's like the idea that these icons appear they kind of appear out of nowhere they find them in the water they they find them somewhere and they they're kind of not they're just they just happen and we don't know who made them we don't know where they come from but there's always there always is like material causes if you make spend a lot of time to try to dig into them and that's not how we receive them so that's why we we kind of see them as this pattern kind of descending from above and manifesting itself in the world that's a great example of this because yeah there are some icons that that you know we do believe when we say they're not made with hands maybe you know what we're really saying is you know there's something miraculous about the creation of this icon right the the the icon not made with hands right the one that christ you know made of himself right that's the that's like the ultimate example right but but the but yeah when it comes to some of these icons especially the mother of god you know where this icon appears in the field right the curse word icon i think is a good example of this there's another icon i can't remember the name of it now but i i got to venerate it when i was in lithuania it was this tiny little sort of russian village church and really large icon very beautiful and it just sort of they found it in the field one day yeah where did this come from how did it get here right and so so it's a nikon not made with hands not because not because anybody there is saying nobody ever painted this or touched this but it's just sort of it was just received right it just came from heaven in that sense right so yeah typically speaking for these things like they have to have some kind of a mythic authority right this is why i mean eve all the way down at a fractal level this is why sometimes when your parents tell you something you won't listen because you know your parents right but then some other adult who you do not know as well they tell you the same thing and suddenly it's got cachet yeah yeah right but i mean this is actually why is the jordan peterson clean your room it's like why is it there right right everybody thinks it's genius it's a perfect example perfect example but but i mean i mean for instance this is why it's actually you know better if you don't know what shenanigans the pope or whatever bishop or like whatever patriarch so and so is up to like it's better if you don't know those things actually because it you know because the the mythic let's say like the mythic distance that's actually part of the way the hierarchy is supposed to work yeah right and of course this inverts ultimately at the moment of communion when when everything gets you know collapsed into the single point but but it just is like a normal way of operating through your life yeah it's better if you don't know i want to say something about this the hierarchy of stories too that's important for people to understand is that this again is is one of the problems of our thinking is that we tend to confuse quality and quantity in the way that we see things and so when a lot of modern historians look at these these these original histories they'll notice that there's like i said there's a gesture at the outset which says something like you know we're connected to this son of noah or this related relation to the the the trojan war or whatever and then they'll go into their national history and spend a lot of time on it and so they'll tend to dismiss the first part and say well what's really important is this yes just because it's one sentence or one page or one paragraph doesn't mean that for the people who wrote it it isn't primordially important to be connected in this way that it wasn't like the reason why they even wrote their national story is based in this first little part that you dismissed and you don't you don't think is important this is such an important point that you're making here because i've had conversations with like old norse scholars and stuff you know about the what's sometimes called the younger era or the prose etta which is we'll get to it eventually but it's basically it was like this is where like most most of the stories from norse mythology probably come from this text but the text itself is a it was a manual for poets written by a christian man name snori sterlison right in the you know 14th century i think 14th 15th somewhere in there anyway long time after paganism had already died out and he's writing these stories down because norse poetry requires the use of what are called kennings which are nested references and sometimes they go several levels down and so if you don't know the story that's being referenced by the story that's being referenced by the story then you won't know how to use this in your scaldic verse and so poetry as an art form was kind of dying out and so snorri tries to basically gather all the old stories and i strongly suspect when he didn't actually know the story he just made something up that sounded good to him but anyway nothing against him it's just like some of that some of the stuff in there is i think a little questionable if if you wanted to really convince me that a a seventh century baltic pagan actually believed like this is what they thought about thor or something but anyway but but the point point being point being that that so he writes it for that but then he begins it with this very actually quite quite a long chapter which connects it to the christian story and connects it to rome where you find out that all the norse gods they're actually refuges from the trojan war and they were actually famous men at one point and powerful wizards and all this other stuff right and so i would but when i when i've talked to norse scholars like scholars of old norse literature about this you know i'll mention something like well the the prosetta you know it's got it's it's got these features to it and it's you know it's actually from a christian perspective because of this stuff and and to look at me like you're crazy i'm like well what about the beginning though and then they'll say oh well we don't count that that doesn't count that's not you know like that's he just had to do that so that the church wouldn't you know as though as though nobody in christianity like had ever you know told the story before like you know and so it's just i i have a hard time even articulating how much this sort of thing irritates me so yeah those those little bits there's like the little pro m at the beginning of sir gowan and the green knight which connects which connects the whole establishment of the kingdom of britain of which arthur is now king connects it to brutus on the fall of troy yeah and all of the stuff like that was actually deeply important to understanding what the arthurian story was even about so much so that you know like that particular brutus gives his name to some of the like early arthurian poems the lion man's brut for example but without that without that context like the story wouldn't have been the same to them but of course no the stories are actually about you know you know feminism and power struggles and like all this other stuff and so just that's way more convincing right yeah yeah yeah right right right right right um i'm actually probably just still irritated about the sir going the green knight film yeah came out a couple years ago still pretty salty about that but anyway okay so the other thing to mention when we're talking about these these kind of nested hierarchies of stories in which is really what i mean by medieval universal history right is is that folklore has the same kind of function as like your local patron saint as folklore is something that kind of is able to jump outside or like buttress the hierarchy kind of from the outside and so folklore will often just like bring two things together that don't really like you know these two people could not have lived at the same time or the these you know this you know well this obviously happened here or not here or something like that but folklore can collapse those distinctions in a way that supports the symbolic structure of the hierarchy yeah in the same way that your patron saint can like collapse the distance between you and the emperor or or whatever so yeah yeah well i mean you see that even in hagiography right what is it you know you can do it with saints because they can kind of come back from heaven and do things you know what is it yeah yeah who is it i forget that is it saying demetrios who is the who's the empire oh oh yeah during his life right it's like you know god forgive me i can't remember right now i know me too it's horrible but they say demetrios is shown in an icon killing a king like killing and and and it's not during his life it's like you know after i'll think of i think it was saying it as probably like before the end of the video but yes yeah so the ground grand foundational story of the christian world is the gospel you could say especially the story that's from genesis to acts and then the apocalypse right but especially the grand foundational story of the christian world is the passion and the resurrection of christ and this is why in traditional christianity there's so much emphasis placed on holy week or passion week and on easter or posca i mean if you want to if you want to get like irrationally irritated at english language christianity a great book to read is a book by an english historian we've i've talked about it before on the show but an english historian named eamon duffy and he wrote this he wrote a bunch of great books about prayer in the middle ages but he has a fantastic book called the stripping of the altars and one of the there's a long chapter in this book on basically how they celebrated posca or the easter vigil in england before the reformation and just like your average parish church and it's so it's so orthodox like it's so it's so similar to the way that orthodox christians are used to celebrating pasco or easter today and and like and and you just sort of realize oh no we had this at one point and it was all stripped away from us it took me a while to get over that yeah to be honest with you right but so then after this you have a wide range of stories like we're talking about with increasing locality that nest the local and the specific within the universalizing and the cosmic so our universal history series we've been mainly focused on these kinds of stories this is what we've been mainly looking at right how did people groups as they converted nest their identity within the christian and within the roman story even when they themselves maybe fell outside of the empire and just to to emphasize again before we get into the next section is that these identities they they stack or they nest and if you don't understand this then you will make the mistake which as as i'm going to try to argue is basically the mistake of of 19th and 20th century nationalism yeah which used to create something that's very top heavy right where it's it's more about here's the narrative that actually has to control and oppress everything beneath it rather than serve as a container for it yeah that's really that's really important and that's when you can see i mean in general that's when you can see how when any identity goes wrong is when it doesn't respect the normal nesting of identities that are below it right it's like as a a family a father it's like okay the father is the head of the family but the father is the head of the family in the way that is there to make his children and his wife be fruitful and and and and and succeed and be themselves right and have their own lives ultimately and so that's the way that all identities should function now that's the way god functions and that's the way that already all identity should function that's why people are when we talk about nationalism they become very tense because they always think that all that means is like you said you know the way that the third reich presented their nationalism yes this completely identity that takes over but it's not just the third right greg napoleon and all of a lot of modern national identity had that that feature but it was not a feature of ancient thinking yeah i think a much overlooked vision in scripture is nebuchadnezzar's like first dream right the one i think it's his first one but the one of the tree right so he has the everybody remembers like the vision of like the statue being destroyed by the the you know the stone cut out of the cut out of the mountain you know and but the the but in his vision of the tree right it's the idea of the tree of course the tree is the king right the tree is is this beautiful tree it gives shade to the plants beneath it and also the birds of the air come and nest in its branches the wild beasts kind of gather around it but that's what that's what the king is supposed to be and you could say that that's what whatever your your story that gives identity that's what it is supposed to be right it's supposed to be this tree that you know the birds of the air these various principalities and the beasts of the field which are you know the things that are lowered down right they can come and still they can find shelter and shade and protection and of course in in his dream ultimately he's because of his pride the tree gets cut down but the point the point is that this is what this is what the king or you could say like the the grand story like whatever it is that's what it that's how it's supposed to function yeah yeah and obviously this didn't always like function perfectly but there is but it but it it functions surprisingly well let's just say right even when you have even when you have somebody like the pope saying i think it's maybe the fifth century saying okay nobody in the west is allowed to read the book of enoch anymore you know but then there were still places on the you know the outer branches of of the west you know in in scotland and ireland and the british isles particularly where where people kept all of these things right they sort of kept them they still remembered them and it was still part of again not just like a book and a monastery but you know teaching from enoch teaching from the apocryphal books was actually a major part of parish life in anglo-saxon england right and so there's there's a there's a there was space even when you when you had somebody who tried to totalize things in some way there was space for this stuff to kind of fit in yeah and but one of the reasons why that's why it's hard for us to think that way is that because we live in a technocratic society we we confuse authority with power because we have the we have the capacity now for authorities to have indefinite power and so when when the president or whatever when the the authorities say something they can implement it completely into all the way down whereas in an ancient world that wasn't the case you know the pope can be in rome saying whatever he's saying and he's going to have influence but it's not it he doesn't have the means to enforce it all through christendom and so there's always this organic variability that that installs itself just naturally by just normal human mechanisms so yeah along comes the protestant reformation right and the result of the reformation it has to be remembered that the reformation took place in germany right it's primarily at in his beginnings primarily a german religious movement right obviously it gives france and switzerland and england other places but originally it's primarily a german religious movement except that the reformation didn't take place in germany because germany did not exist germany is a made-up country fake news everybody no germany's germany's a made-up country right there if you look at a medieval map there's no germany on that map nope nobody who lived in the place that we called germany now would have called themselves germans actually they still don't call themselves germans but but a really fun game is actually what's the name of german in other languages and like every yeah what do you call what do you guys call it in french alma yeah right right uh because like the all of maine region right right so so it's yeah nobody who lived there called themselves germans right this this german but germany is a modern construct yeah but the way that it was built the story sort of begins in the protestant reformation i don't have like a ton of time to go into this but let's say that as a result for the protestant reformation we got something called the 30 years war in western europe which is one of the bloodiest periods in western europe actually not not the middle ages right but but this is this is now in the modern period 30 years were incredibly bloody struggle between roman catholics and protestants over basically a very small slice of a very small slice of western europe yeah and the result the end result of the 30 years war is something called the treaty of westphalia and one of the things that comes about as a result of that treaty is that they decide okay your religion will be determined simply by whatever principality you live in so like if you live in this little province and some of these are quite small basically the size of what in texas would be a county i don't know do you guys do you guys call them parishes or counties or like what's your what's the what's the unit in canada beyond the city yeah we do have we do have something like that i forget what they're called yeah yeah yeah accounting yeah yeah so but basically these very small principalities and your religion if you live there would just be whatever the official whatever the religion of and so what happened was that instead of instead of the instead of the the identity conferred by the christian story being kind of the at the very outside level is that it collapsed down actually several levels into the hierarchy and so it goes from being here's a universalizing story of passion week and posca right of rome and greece of the trojan war and you know saint john the baptist right all these things like this is our universalizing story that kind of is the container that holds everything together and now that collapses actually several rungs down the ladder right to now it's actually secondary to your political identity now once you kind of understand when that happened and how that happened you can then understand how it's actually a pretty short trip to go from there to now my religious identity or my spiritual identity or whatever is something that i confer upon myself personal personal right yeah but but also like but isn't that also like political identity also has collapsed down to that level now yeah so you're you're you you can freely associate with whatever political party you want at least in some parts of the world but you know talking to the united states you can freely associate with whatever political party you want and and everything about your identity has collapsed down to the level of the self of the self so when all of this is going on though and before it kind of gets all the way down to that level in the primarily in'th and 19th century europe you have the emerging of was sometimes called the search for the national epic yeah so why do we need the national epic because we're not part of an empire anymore holy roman or otherwise we're not part of an empire anymore and we are not part of and we're not even part of the same religion anymore right it's a bit i mean and listen nowadays protestants roman catholics orthodox like we can go out together and we can have a beer and we can talk about our differences and all these different things nobody stabs anybody and that's great i love that don't get me wrong but if you think for a moment that somebody you know in the 30 years war believed that oh the roman catholic over there and and me we're the same religion basically and we're just quibbling over a few small differences like they this is not how people thought yeah yeah they weren't killing each other over small differences let's say so anyway so you don't you're not held together by the same religion anymore and you're not held together by the same and and you're not even held together by like the the sort of like the imperial story right and so now what we need to do is just try to find some other narrative that can collect and hold our identity together and this is the this is why there's the search for the national epic so something a lot of people don't know you're of course aware of jacob and wilhelm grimm the brothers grim yeah right and they're famous for a bunch of fairy tales which they did not write they're the fairy tales that we know is like the fairy tales of the brothers grim they were edited mainly by wilhelm but but they didn't write those stories yeah what they did was they went around collecting all the oldest stories like the the children's stories is what they would call them but they went around just like correcting all the old wives stories and all the old children's stories and things like this from these these tiny little idiosyncratic you know valleys in different places and what is now germany and they're collecting they're collecting these stories because the oldest stories preserve the oldest words and jacob grimm is a philologist he's interested in really old words and so his two great works that he composed were the largest and most comprehensive dictionary of the german language which has ever been created and then also the the a an accompanying volume sometimes it's called teutonic mythology or german mythology or something like that it's got its own name in german which i won't try to pronounce here since we're on the internet but anyway you've got you've got these two massive volumes one is this is the german language and the other is this is german mythology and yeah they're both fascinating works his tutank mythology is let's say has a lot of problems from the perspective of modern scholarship because once again there were a bunch of gaps and he just tried to fill the gaps in by guesswork essentially and then but the fairy tales were you know basically he was sending his grad students out because grad students are the the mindless minions of the academic world so he would send his grad students out to basically collect these stories and then later they edited them together in a volume and that turned out to be much more popular and and let's say more enduring than the other two works yeah but what a lot of people don't know is that following the german revolution sometimes it's called the march march revolution when the when the national assembly of the national assembly of the german people is like the first german parliament was what came together jakob grimm had a seat it wasn't just a seat in the parliament but it was like a special chair not really and he had a vote and everything else and he got this enchanted with politics it didn't really last but the reason that they gave him this spot in the like the very first german parliament ever was because he was he was the great german philologist he was the great german you could say storyteller in that he was telling by collecting all these old stories and trying to package them and arrange them what he's actually doing is creating an identity that is german yeah an identity that's based in that's based in the language that you speak and who your ancestors were more than it is in what your religion is or where you live or those other things and so one of the great you know questions of the time was well you know as there as the german state is being founded and there's there's lots of like little revolutions and different governing bodies and all these different things it's difficult to to track even if you have it all laid out in front of you but basically one of the big questions that they're trying to answer is what does it actually mean to be german but it's not a religious question anymore right it's not a it's not it's not you know you know so like what does it mean to be german and obviously eventually attempts to answer that question are going to develop in some really kind of unhealthy ways yeah yeah and more nationalistic ways the way we understand them now right right the ancient world that like if there had been some kind of german identity let's say in france there was definitely more of a let's say a basic french identity even though all the regions still there was still that issue where all the reads and like your french identity was basically that you know you're somehow related to the king of france like that's where your french identity comes from you know you owe allegiance to the king but then you probably don't speak french you don't speak the same french right in france does you speak some other local dialect or whatever and and you don't see that this allegiance to the king of france as this totalizing thing right as this thing that it's like i am french and the way even that the french would understand that today yeah yeah i mean that's the thing about nationalism as opposed to let's say the older mode is is that your national identity is now much more totalizing to the point that it has the ability to actually obliterate the things beneath it i mean obviously well it's the french is a good example when napoleon took over he basically you know imposed parisian french on the rest of france right to make it one language he he he he basically imposed a education system on to all the different regions and those that you know and you can see that all like during the revolution you can see that happening it's wild you know the the the the local places that resist the revolution you know they get they get slaughtered and people just get slaughtered because they they there's this one thing nacion right that that's where even the idea is is kind of born right this idea of a citizen of a nation the way that we just did it now yeah and it's a sort of a weird extension you could say of like the the old really old classical idea of the city-state yeah but now impose across many cities and over a very large geographic area until you get to these places where you have the situation today where modern nation states are so impossibly large i mean this is part of why i keep demurring on like when we're gonna do like what's the symbolism of america video right part of it is is that like which america yeah like well don't you think that one of the reasons for the success of america has been that it had had been at least for a while had been able to kind of recast that multiplicity right a sense in which there were local traditions local places you know people people in different regions just have different ways of living and we kind of don't feel like the like the the centralized authority has the right or the capacity to impose ways of being ways of thinking on on the people in the local areas yes there yes there is a uh i think that was part of a lot of the early genius of the american project and the two the two things that really challenged it and maybe broke it although we'll see we're still i mean we're brand new country so we'll see but one is one is the the creation of the interstate highway system yeah you know the ability you know which is very importantly it's like it's like now it's the artery right the the arterial system that connects the country but very importantly like it's it's owned and paid for by decentralized power the federal government right but then also and also along with that you know kind of developing as well as the is the there's something in our constitution called the interstate commerce clause which basically gives the federal government authority to regulate anything that might possibly touch interstate commerce and i don't want to get like too much into like american constitutional stuff and politics but you could just say that the the the kind of the brilliance of the great localized pro uh you know being able to recast that locality like you just said that start that is that started to break down when those two things and obviously airplanes have made things worse but yeah but anyway but it's interesting because here in canada we can really see where that leads to is that it actually leads to extremes in some ways you know here in canada we're seeing the other extreme where as we know as the federal government becomes more powerful it's creating this sense that you know diversity only diversity like we don't have an identity this is this has been now the the the way that the the government is framing it is that canada is a is a nation-less nation right it's a post-national nation we don't our only value is openness like our only identity is diversity and so it's almost this like weird collapse like this i like how you guys took took the like the joke about canadians being hyper apologetic for everything and just like what if we turn that into an identity like what if we turn that into her when i did and so and it's interesting because in quebec we we have a weird fractal thing about that which is that in quebec they're trying to hold on to their identity but they really think of it in terms of nation like really in terms of the french project in terms of nation and so it's all collapsing because they're trying to like impose language and impose identity over over the over quebec but they also but they don't feel it it's not an organic thing and so as they're including they're like you know we have this massive immigration policy recruiting all these people but they have to learn french and they have to they have to kind of fit into this weird thing it's like well it's not it's all not working like there's something so inorganic about about about that in in let's say in the roman empire you would have had let's say groups of barbarians that would come and maybe settle and they would negotiate with the local person and they would let them settle they would kind of they would keep their identity but they would also pay homage to the romans but it would be of way more organic natural way but but it's almost impossible to do now yeah yeah so we thought we would get into politics so much i know i know well i mean i it's my own fault for picking the subject right yeah because it's like it's it is kind of especially as you get closer and closer to modern times it becomes more and more inherently political so you have as as as the old idea of the empire holy roman or otherwise right as the old idea of the empire recedes as christianity as a central unifying story as that gets pushed more and more to the back burner let's say you know as a result of the enlightenment projects and everything else something has to step into that space to fill the void that says like well okay how do i know i'm finish right how do i like what does it mean to be finished like finland has been part of the you know talking talking about the 19th century now right so finland's been part of the russian empire for a long time right but but but like you know nobody in finland speaks you know like the same language that tsar speaks and everything so like what would a finish identity what would that look like yeah right and so they're trying to figure that we figure that out and answer that question and because so much of the enlightenment project looked back at a very how do i say literally a very monochrome version of the classical period right i say literally monochrome because you know that you know they go over to greece or rome or whatever and they'd see here's all these beautiful old white marble pillars and temples and things like this and so they assume oh everything must have been like this and it's so clean and it's so orderly and all this different stuff and then for decades for many decades like when whenever whenever uh evidence would emerge that this statue or that these pillars had been painted like i mean we go we've gone to church with greeks like you can't tell me those people they paint those statues come paint those statues come on come on right but but but whenever evidence like this would surface they would destroy it yeah because it destroyed this sort of pristine monochrome hyper-ordered vision that they had kind of created out of the classical period and you realize nothing like that but but that's that's the vision that they kind of created for themselves and i think it was so appealing because it basically offered a a structured ordered framework that was is like oh look how pristine things were before it was touched by christianity and christianity is what brought in all this awful color and texture and actually diversity right into the classical project right and so anyway so this is the way that this is the way that that that they they were thinking about it at this time and so looking back at the classical period they said well they had the aeneid they had the iliad and the odyssey so if we're going to create a finnish national identity then what we need is a finnish epic and so i'm just using this as an example because it's probably my favorite from this period as there's a guy named elias lonerot who went around and basically collected all the old finnish songs about the the the sort of like the ancient heroes and the creation of the world and you know a lot of the stuff only survived in folklore right so he goes around and he collects the songs from all these people who you know can't read they can't write but they have hours and hours and hours of poetry just memorized off the top of their head and he he collects all that stuff together and then he synthesizes it into a single epic work called the kalivala now there was never any such thing in like medieval finland it's a made-up epic it's made up of real parts but it was created it was synthesized it's by the way extremely dope very beautiful it's been well like one of the most i i think actually especially in my young life but even now like one of the most influential pieces of poetry that i've ever read so i i do recommend it it's awesome and it there were parts of it that also had a huge influence on a lot of tolkien's development because because it was really i mean it was just being translated in english when tolkien was a kid oh yeah that was like it was a big deal but you've got other examples of of the search for the national epic beowulf is my favorite the only reason we know about beowulf the the only reason the manuscript isn't muldering somewhere in a library totally forgotten is because when they found it a lot of people started saying oh well maybe this is maybe this is our national epic and so they would say oh well maybe beowulf maybe it's started out the date with the danes oh it's the danish national epic because a bunch of the characters in it are danes there's a danish king in here right and then the germans said no no it's a german national epic because it's written in anglo-saxon which is a west germanic language and so is german so this is a german national epic and not until like almost a century later did uh the english come along and say well actually it was written in in english so but but there are no english characters in the story right so it's it doesn't really qualify there's not anybody's complicated yeah it's just not a national epic it like it doesn't fit the bill but a lot of people wanted it to be in so that's that's how it kind of rose to prominence obviously you've got like you know the probably the actual german national epic right the the niva london lead that like which you know wagner's whole ring cycle is built off of that the sagas of the icelanders which which all together you know for the icelandic people that's their shakespeare and obviously you know the the sid for you know people on the iberian peninsula and i know at one point the song of roland roland was supposed to be the french national epic right but it's such a it's such a it's such a strange story to be a national happy because it's a sort of defeat and yeah you know and it's like well defeat is okay lost causes are actually some of the best most successful national ethics but but it's i don't know it just it doesn't seem to fit the bill for what france is now i was thinking about this earlier obviously you're closer to french culture than i am but i if i had to pick something that now is maybe like the great french national epic it might be something like les mis yeah that's what i exactly what i thought when you were when you were talking yeah because i was sort of guessing in the revolutionary in the revolutionary mode it's something that seems to function yeah as something like that and it's got the right kind of scale but it's also like a deeply humane work in a lot of different ways yeah and it's not as mythological like because they are modern a modern nature and then of course when it comes to the celts like the the the scottish irish banks welsh like when it comes to celtic people you have so many national epics it would be hard to even pick one they're sort of the people that like legitimately just had all the stuff like right there for them because because basically celtic history is just an extremely long history of lost causes and heroes like all the way from you know ancient times and like the the tane all the way up to like bonnie prince charlie and all that stuff which has which which has a uh like his whole story has this kind of mythic flavor to it despite the fact has happened you know relatively recently historically speaking so what all of these things have in common right is that they're they're they're things that for something to be really effective as a national epic typically speaking it's gotta belong to a mythic past so this is part of why it's very difficult to speak of like what would be the american national epic or i assume the canadian national epic though yeah the pro the thing with about that is that the french canadians have access to a national epic but they basically don't want anything to do with it because it's so catholic you know like the story of the early settlers who came and died and were kidnapped by natives and tortured and yeah like there's it's a it's a it's a really beautiful and intense and and and some of the early like samuel de champlain was a was an astounding character it's just that he was so catholic and so christian that that people don't talk they just can't hold it in them to to tell that story well that's interesting yeah i i i'd be really hard put to like to say like what's the national epic for america but but again i think probably america's just too large like you have to think of it in terms of regional epics and a lot of a lot of our big regional stories obviously see a lot of the big regional stories of the american southwest also deeply catholic stories yeah and of course american culture as a whole is extremely anti-catholic there's there is you know the the thing you know like i can't you can you can barely even talk about this on the internet right now but or even in you know polite company but something like gone with the win right the film right is is is very very close to like something like a regional epic for the deep south yeah which is not quite the region i live in but it's pretty close and obviously that is you know that that that story you know for good or for ill it's got to be discarded now you know and obviously there are problems with it but also but also you know a lot of people found it to be a really beautiful and compelling story so but you know so but but there is something like the wild west the antebellum south yeah the wild west is has it has definitely has has its mythology that is a real mythology yeah wild west is yeah mythology that's pretty powerful yeah so so there is there is something like mythological time and what i'll be really interested to see is you know who knows what's going to happen you know the next two 300 years but you know a few hundred years on like what is what what's our what's our mythical past gonna be it's great that you're hopeful that america will last that long i'm an extremely optimistic person i don't know what to tell you sorry to be so so he's got so many crazy things are happening right now no i mean it's a it's a wild wacky time like i have no idea what's gonna happen but i mean i'm i am a very optimistic person so that's one thing so let me ask you a question yeah so how do you see so let's say now you know we're kind of thinking about this and this rediscover your stories rediscovery of legends yeah do you think that there are ways for us to because there are in these national epics are beautiful and powerful but like you said there are some ways in which for example wagner is is almost demonized because of the way that the nazis use wagner right right but the the mythical elements of the story are powerful and could be very useful today do you think there are ways that we can recapture kind of re-thread some of these elements together to to to maybe rediscover this more fractal relationship you know that that used to be the ancient way of thinking i mean yeah yes i think and i not only do i think it can be done i think it's got to be done yeah because i mean there there are a lot of like great like there's a whole genre of of novel called like the southern gothic novel right that is that's really built around the the the the romance and the trauma of the southern united states right and so but but basically it was just built out of people like trying to work through this stuff by telling stories about it and i think that i mean wagner's ring cycle for instance has already been extremely successfully retold in the star wars franchise yeah um you know like the first three star wars films are wagner right it's like operatic in its scope it's got the same like use of light and darkness everything else the whole idea of of the sun replacing the father right you the sun has to kill the father in order to in order to ascend right that that whole idea right super wagnerian fiend so i think but i but i think that i think that yes these stories have to be retold and we can retell them in a way where we're also kind of honest about you know there's got to be a way and i know you've done videos about this but i'll just say there's got to be a way to both love your ancestors and also be honest about their sins yeah there's got to be a way to do that and and right now it seems like we can only do one or the other but that's that's actually a function of idolatry it's an image of idolatry because one of the things that happens is that because we don't have the fractal relationship because we don't have this hierarchy that leads all the way up to god we actually expect of these lower runs to be perfect and if they're not perfect we hate them because they're not perfect and so there's a sense in which if things were properly laid out and we don't treat these figures as idols to worship them or to cast them down either way that we we see them as just manifestations that have that are gray because they're not god you know all these leaders all these heroes have dark sides obviously there's no there's no way around it right yeah and we could celebrate their heroism and also recognize their sins like it you know and and some ways you know i think that the idea to to cover their sins to some extent in the sense that you know we we want to emphasize the positive because we want them to be examples in their good things towards us like you know what's the point of of just pointing out all the evils of the people that came before you what you want are examples but if you can't find examples then how can you get better like how can you even live up to the beautiful aspects of what has been given to you yeah yeah i don't know i'm trying to solve the world's problems right now but we we need to do it first of all by telling good stories like yeah yeah let's do it but that's how that's how this starts so so just a couple more things about the national epic and then we'll we'll i'll segue into into some telling good story stuff hopefully yeah so all of these things let's say you know when we go back and we talk about you know beowulf or the kalebala or the the ring cycle or something all of these things have the capacity to be nested into the christian story right not just historically but still now right you know like this you know elites don't want you to know this but storytelling is free you can just tell stories right but if you don't do this i mean this is the problem right this is why things got really murdery in the last century right is is that if you don't nest them and you try to put on you know i think idolatry is exactly the right language for it if you talk about more weight on them then they can bear then they start to develop some problems first of all just for one thing just insufficiently universalizing right so like what do you what do you do if you're trying to tell a story about german people living in this country we made up called germany well now what do i do with all the people who aren't german right turns out the answers to that question were pretty ugly right one step in but the other thing is that there are there's still a step in the in the downward fragmentation of identity right these stories did not were not enough to hold identity together over the long run that's right and that's a that's important because it's like it's now we can see patently that is true yeah it's like maybe when those stories were cast and when these nation national identities were cast you could have prophesied it and people could have believed you or not believed you but now as we noticed everything turned to mush we realized that no those stories these national identities even here in quebec it's because us it's like a very short concentrated time you know it's like we went from the 1940s 50s as the most catholic place in the world to the 1970s with this major nationalist movement to basically the 2000s where all of that doesn't matter anymore and we're all just global mush i mean pretty fast here in the u.s especially like growing up you know very like conservative fundamentalist right we had the founding fathers right we didn't have any saints but we had the founding fathers right george washington benjamin franklin thomas jefferson all those dudes right and there was a lot of work expanded in trying to really build up a kind of a christian mythology around them even though many of them we're not christians many of them you know universalists atheist deist etc but but there was a lot of work put into trying to basically build up a mythology around that as well if we could just get back to these guys then america would be what it's supposed to be right and just as a story it's not strong enough it's it doesn't have the capacity to confer identity you know like what do you do with people who don't fit into don't fit into the story or what i mean you know like you know even in in your own like whatever declaration of independence like who are the not people all men are created equal women slaves yeah that's a different thing but matt yeah i mean and i'm not just here to like rag on my country yeah yeah sorry that i live in but but but my point is my point is that that story is itself is actually great right those those men actually lived you know yeah flawed human beings or whatever but actually lived interesting lives and did courageous things and it's not wrong to love them or praise them but if you try to put on them the weight of the whole american story it's it's too much it's too much they can't can't hold it right so the other thing is that very often this kind of story one of the deep flaws that it often has is that very often this kind of story is not participatory all right there's there's really like now this this differs i mean a lot of the if you're really into american history there's a lot of pretty cool participatory things you can go to the east coast you know and do you can go to you know washington's farm and like they have like a bourbon night there once a year and think like you know okay i mean there's there's a really cool place called colonial williams williamsburg where everybody's like dressed up in period costume and they try to stay in character and you know that's all fun so so like there are some ways you can participate in the stuff but but but ultimately it's not very participatory right and then you then like well okay but what if you're black how do you participate in colonial williamsburg right so it's like there's like different there's just is one of the one of the problems with this kind of story is that for a story to really confer identity it's got to be something that you can actually participate in you can make it a part of your life so it's happening uh james taylor talks about this i mean for orthodox christians this will be a really familiar concept but james taylor in a second age he talks about this idea of you know chirotic time the idea that that this moment that's maybe a mythical moment or something that happened 2000 years ago becomes closer than yesterday right that's what happens at posca is that at posca the resurrection of jesus christ a historical event a mythical event all these layers to it but at on the on posca night on easter night it becomes closer than yesterday yeah right in terms of you know and so most of these stories don't have a capacity to do that and when you see people at least not completely yeah not competitive capacity to do that yeah you can celebrate the fourth of july or whatever they're thinking right right yeah fair enough but like you said they don't they don't they they just if they tried to stand on their own as the totalizing identity they they they end up being dangerous actually yeah and then of course i mean one of the questions we've been dancing around for a long time is and then what if you're a brand new country right well what is your mythic time right and i think we've kind of addressed that yeah so let me let me let me give just like a couple of like practical applications for people it's the baptist preacher in me i can't totally get away from it but also there's a couple of practical applications but then also a little bit about the project that i've been working on and why it's tied into all of this so if you wanted to if you wanted to like comment all of this stuff and you're trying to figure out like what do i do with it what do i do with this universal history stuff it's very it's very fun to like how do i how do i actually participate in this and integrate this into my life the first thing that i'd say is for like for you as a christian the liturgical year is your epic it's your sacred story it's one that you can totally participate in we have this prayer in the evening or as part of our evening prayers in the orthodox church it comes from the service of complin and it's addressed to the mother of god and i'm not going to unpack this or defend this for our protestant friends out there please understand we mean something by this that's maybe not well anyway don't freak out i'll be happy to explain this sometime later but we have in this prayer we say you are the salvation of the race of christians now salvation we mean like a lot more things by salvation than you know like a they're dying and going to heaven yeah then dying and going to heaven so that's how we're talking but she's the salvation of the race of christians in what way because christ comes from her right and in that sense every single christian is descended from and is a child of mary yeah right but the thing to kind of focus in on there is actually that last bit the generation or the race of christians that when you pass through the baptismal font you become something more than just your you know this is why saint paul you know this is why the church can simultaneously we can talk about there's no jew greek bond free male female but then also preserve distinctions between those things in important ways yeah we can do both because of this right and this is why i mean it's tied back to my my long-running theory right that you're not really a christian country until you have like a definitive national icon of the mother of god you know that's when you become that's when you become a christian people right is because there's some connection between her and the incarnation some connection between her between the land between the yeah between yes yeah all this body right it's all these things that are there yeah the the that which holds right it's like that's what that's in some of the motherland or however you want to think about it all these all these ways of describing it so then and i'll say this especially to my like fellow orthodox converts right is that just sort of understand and accept you've received a faith which is you know like cereal greco jewish in its origins right like all the early writers right all the all the early hymns all these different things they're not written by people from america right so you're receiving this i know it listen that's a dumb thing to say but also it's like it's like weirdly freeing to realize that so just like realize that you're you're receiving this faith that's so much older than you and that wasn't made with your tastes in mind and when people get like really like let's say agitated about how you know well when are we going to enculturate when are we going to have like a single american jurisdiction when are we going to have you know like american culture really represented and what about the music and yeah yeah yeah you know all that stuff like like just like settle down yeah settle down and and accept the faith that you've been given and but know that by doing so by just like faithfully saying your prayers going to the services participating as fully in the life of your parish as you can that you're not just hopefully participating in the salvation of your own soul but you're also participating in the salvation of your ancestors and of your culture and i cannot stress enough how important it is to fully accept and receive this depositive tradition if enculturation is ever going to happen in a natural way yeah it's just like we're talking about committees can't do it it won't stick it's gotta naturally arise it's gotta just it's got to just arise out of so that means of things that we won't be able to describe afterwards so that in 500 years when the autospholis orthodox church of texas has officially replaced hummus with guacamole as the lenten dip of choice you know like but but just like nobody will remember how it happened nobody remember but it's not like the way we do things in 500 years we'll have american orthodoxy for good or for ill it'll exist right and but but we're not going to get there by like just trying to force things so yeah anyway so save your family cultivate just kind of a normal holy life and wait a few hundred years and see what happens but yeah so all of that with that graceful segue just real quick here i know the videos kind of gone long but just to talk a little bit about the project right so it's on kickstarter right now there will be a link down below where you can click to it and go i would love it if you would go and consider backing even just like a couple of bucks to watch the project or whatever if we get enough people backing then it kind of like favors it the algorithm and then kickstarter will start promoting itself and it'll have a much larger reach yeah but just to say something about this project why is this a thing that i'm doing why is this really important or significant what's it have to do with the symbolic world and symbolism and all this stuff when i was growing up i was part of a you know you know came out of just extremely fundamentalist conservative american christianity you know in the deep south all that stuff so growing up in that but also growing up alongside a a chinese culture because you know because we came from a missionary family and they adopted and so a lot of like chinese relatives and things like this and you know like the actually the food that i grew up mainly eating was like chinese food so like for me that's nostalgia that's oh that's mom's cooking right is is chinese and because she grew up over there and you know a lot of her siblings she has you know chinese siblings and everything else so i kind of grew up like in this one culture but also right next door to this other culture and yeah i mean to the point that you know mandarin was my second language as a child and so i grew up right next door to this other culture that that was was actually really rich and old and had a sense of its own aesthetic right a sense of philosophy sense of aesthetic sense of storytelling and you know certain way a certain mode of expressing things and this is like bright and colorful and then the thing that is you know the lane that i'm in is just like very beige i mean literally beige i mean aggressively we chose to like make our churches as a color like why but anyway and so trying to wrestle with that as a young person is how this project was birthed and it started out as trying to trying to answer the question well what does it take what does it what what do you need to have a culture and so when i was young i started reading beowulf and the song of roland first and then like a lot of the other epics medieval epics and i became totally in love with this idea of the epic and the national epic and all this different stuff i hadn't you know i was pretty i was like 10 or something at a time so i hadn't really connected the dots on like you know you know where some of the stuff ended up leading yeah if that's what you were reading at 10 will forgive you richard yeah yeah yeah yeah well anyway so so i i just fell totally in love with this stuff and and so and you know later on as my as my literary powers grew i began to basically attempt to compose a national epic like do what tolkien did but tolkien did it mainly linguistically at first and i am a linguist so there is a lot of that in here but i was mainly focused on the idea of like what's the what would be the story that could be then passed on like that people would get their identity from and then as i grew older i came to understand more and more that it's not enough just to have a story but that you actually need a sacred story and you need like a sort of a sacred participatory narrative and so i kind of went from there to developing you know to doing these kind of what-if questions tolkien and lewis lewis especially famously used to talk about this you know that when he was writing you know the narnia stories he really just started out with like a what if well what if i change this one thing right and so for for me my what-if question was like what would assaulter be like in a fantasy world like how would you like if if you know if god is still the god of the fantasy world but but the christian religion the incarnation hasn't happened the christian religion doesn't exist but like you know like what would that look like how would that play out and so and so like how do you how do you make a like a fantasy religion that is still true it's not idolatrous that's not demonic et cetera but also you're not just like doing fantasy christianity which is which is in my opinion is actually is actually worse it's actually worse so anyway so i started developing and kind of tinkering with these things and then you know the histories and the poetry and everything else kind of developed into this much larger mythic cycle and in a you know in a nutshell all the stuff that i've shared with you today and all the stuff that we've shared over the last two years of our symbolic world universal history conversations is stuff that i originally worked out by doing this you know i'd go read like an irish story or i'd go read the kaliwala and then i would try to try to figure out what that story was about by writing a story like that so so like working out my ideas but trying to work them out in this creative way because for me the creative always has to come before the analytical and so as for as for you know why it's a tabletop role-playing game like i said i'm gonna do another video soon with father dick and nicholas kotar where we talk about that particular medium but basically the short version is i think it's a powerful and very overlooked storytelling medium there are a lot of um it's almost the only thing left it's almost the only means left that has that of telling a story that's not totally controlled by by hollywood and by you know the big five publishing companies and whatever big three or whatever it is now but but just like there's there's a stranglehold on storytelling and like to to to ever get back to where we could even make a good christian film yeah we've got to first learn how to go all the way back and just like tell stories around the around the campfire yeah i think that's a great way to phrase it it's almost like a kind of laboratory of storytelling it's like yeah it's been around and learning what stories are made of and then people recognizing as they watch people make decisions in the story yes like watching what the results of that are because they have real real kind of consequences i think i think if you phrase it that way i mean i don't see how anybody could object because we don't know how to tell stories anymore and and so and this is the great thing is that as a storytelling medium it's participatory yeah right which is the whole reason it's a role-playing game is because i've been working on this stuff for years and one day a good friend of mine was like hey would you just run a game for us setting because i've been doing a tolkien game for a long time would you just run a game for a set in this world that you've been working on because i would like to know more about it but you know it's kind of poetry is pretty inaccessible to a lot of people etc and so we just started doing that and then it kind of spun out from there but but what i would so what i would encourage people is if this sounds cool to you and you're not freaked out by it maybe go back to project check it out but but also also to to encourage everyone that we need to be telling these stories like it's it's weird like lately i know a lot of people like you but also other friends who are who are trying to get films off the ground and things like this where we've been talking for years and years about okay as orthodox christians as traditional christians etc we need to get out there we need to start telling stories and making movies and things like this and we're the people with the most beautiful tradition so let's share that with the world etc and then as soon as like people start trying to work on these projects and get people to fund them like everybody just kind of dries up and they're like oh i don't know about this fiction thing and i'm not sure about this what about this little detail and you know and like people suddenly get really cold feet they get really really nervous and i want to i would encourage people to boldness and of course yes we're gonna make missteps i'm gonna make some you're gonna make some but well we have to do this because you know this because at the end of the day this this deep fragmentation of identity has come down to now where we have multiple identities warring within ourselves or who we're supposed to begin what we're supposed to be and what our body should look like and everything else and if we don't have some you know if we can't return to a narrative framework that at least offers you know we don't have an emperor we can't force this on people but if we don't return people to a narrative framework that at least offers to heal them and reintegrate them into this kind of nested hierarchy this nested framework that ultimately comes down to holy week like if we can't if we can't offer some people uh an alternative in that way that we're we're letting them now we're failing them and we're not really we won't we won't effectively communicate the gospel right the reason christianity spreads the reason it takes off when it goes places is because you know obviously with some fits and starts and mistakes and everything but it always finds a way to contain the culture right where you can where you can then be a russian or you know again russia also made up country but yeah you can be a you can be a muscovite or you can be a a kiavite or you can be from nav garage or you can be from vilnius or you can be from london or you can be from paris and also a christian yeah and those things nest in on each other so yeah you know that's actually secretly that's what the whole project is about so i hope people will check it out cool so remind people tell them the name and until when they've got to do this because yeah it's called amborea role playing in the world under starlight it's launching on kickstarter hopefully the same day that this recording drops out on youtube and i think that it's going to run for a month so i would encourage people to get out and back it all right everybody you heard richard and so richard thanks again and we'll be paying attention to to to the kickstarter and we'll talk again very soon thanks thanks jonathan
