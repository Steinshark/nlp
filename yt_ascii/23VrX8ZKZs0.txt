ladies and gentlemen welcome back to tata steel 2024 it's the first major chess event of the calendar year and it features many of the world's top players mixed in together in the masters group and the challengers group we've got everybody from hans neeman to dingly ren the reigning defending world chess champion competing this is round number three out of 13 so we are just getting underway in the tournament lot of story lines already developing i'm also not home so i'm currently at my grandparents house i'm vis isting for the day and i am bunkered up we've got some family photos there if you're lucky enough to tune into this recap you get to see baby photos of pudgy me my face was much more circular i got some more photos back here by the way just take a little this is good right here this striking resemblance of myself and you know there's there there's me and a cactus we are we're both wearing a hat i was i was cool kid man you you can't mess with me also that's me right there on a boat with my uncle and i have a dinosaur tattoo on my face so i was i you know i had face tattoos before they were cool maybe i should get one again anyway that's your that's your treat for tuning into today's video and today we've got some very very fun story lines but none bigger than the storyline of the return of the world chess champion will he be in good mental and physical shape how is his chess going to be how do you even play at a high level after not playing chess for eight months is it going to do him any favors he started off very slow kind of easing into it and today he struck he's playing against gukesh by the way we could be looking at a world championship matchup potentially right like if gukesh wins the candidates we can't forget that gukesh is literally playing in the candidates tournament in a few months which is going to be in toronto ding plays his true and tried e4 e5 which is the meta top level nowadays we have an italian with d3 and c3 and now white has a plethora of possibilities will he put the bishop on g5 how is he going to expand on the queen side will he expand on the queen side well all of that gets answered relatively quickly because gukesh plays bishop to g5 when the bishop goes here it's generally going to be attacked and then it's going to go here and then at some point black is going to play g5 this line is all the rage nowadays in chess things go out of fashion they go in fashion right now this is very much in fashion at this very moment in the chess world now we have bishop a7 to get the bishop out of the center so it's not going to get hit with any of white's pawns gukesh puts the knight on b5 as you can see from the time management both guys still very much in their preparation and now we have this move g5 dingly ren for the first time spends 8 minutes plays the critical idea of the position and now we have opposite side castling you get a position like this someone's going to lose people don't draw these positions this is an e4 e5 italian where black overextended in front of his king and castled this way white castled long to now create attacking possibilities and not have to worry about having the king over there and ding is completely not concerned in fact ding has absolutely no attack on the queen side none i mean he it's going to be really difficult for him to develop anything going here it's kind of like for white you know white white really is going to be the one calling the shots he plays this move d4 ding takes unafraid unconcerned undaunted unfaced pushing all of his pawns trying to deflect some of gk's pieces knight h4 and now ding plays a nice idea he takes the knight with the bishop and gets rid of his bishop and just grabs this pawn just grabs a pawn in the center of the board now the queen's looking this way the queen's got eyes on this the queen got eyes in the center you know black could potentially do something like this on the diagonal black is still very very very overextended though and the position is it's a very dangerous position he's playing a very dangerous game but this is the equivalent of calling the bluff in poker right we are calling the bluff in chess and now we have to see will he be able to will he be able to spot the best defensive resources ges now makes plays rook d2 which is considered a miss by the computer i don't really know why it's considered a miss it it it preferred bishop d3 and then knight g6 utilizing the pin right the pawn is pinned so it can't actually capture he goes here and now apparently the impact of the pawn is felt as ding just consolidates his position and now you realize that white gave up that pawn a couple moves ago right this pawn and it might not be for a good reason ding consolidates centralizes the queen and actually it's white who really can't do a whole lot of moving here rook e3 now is just the exacerbating the demise ding plays knight g7 and he's just going to trade pieces tra queens trading rooks and he's just going to win the end game because he's a pawn up a clean pawn up ges does not go out into an end game rookie 3 fe3 he is still trying to get into a fight but now it is ding who is going to punish gukesh for playing the way that he has look at gukesh feasting on those pawns but rookie eight and i told you a long time ago that okay the ceiling here seems to be cracking that's that's that's what old houses do if you hear cracking and random house noises in the background i'm i'm i'm sorry that's just apparently what's going to happen this is this is a feature of the house it's not a you know it's not anything taking away bishop f4 queen goes to f5 and now there's going to be pressure over here knight a2 knight d3 and dingl dingl ren wins this game in emphatic fashion he wins this game in violent fashion as he plays knight a2 queen b1 queen g1 which pressures this and this then he plays knight to b4 check and wh's king marches out into the center of the board and gets brutally brutally trapped among the black pieces and he resigns king b3 dingler would have played queen to d1 the king cannot escape this is how the game could have ended king walking out to the a3 square and now black probably has several ways to win but the simplest is to just checkmate in two moves i think i'm going to go turn off the heat because i think it's the heat is causing that so i will be right back and you you will just see an empty chair okay tremendous ah i love recording recaps this is all new in the in in the in you know in in gotham recaps generally we have you know high quality editing no we don't anyway dingly ren win dingly ren dingly ren wins a beautiful game completely swarming gukesh and showing that there's levels to this you know gukesh 17' years old 2730 recent candidate clearly the future of india in indian chess along with prananda dingen says no no no no no i might be out for eight months but but i'm still king ding len i got some more epic games for you by the way this was perhaps the worst game of the tournament i'm not insulting these guys i'm just saying in terms of quality these guys woke up today and each drank about five coffees they showed up today and just and just just what these guys did was unbelievable so this is this is param makulu versus nck abdu sov and we have a we have a reverse sicilian english opening so very provocative and then here we have this gambit this ridiculous gambit that's now actually quite popular and very very difficult to to play with white the idea by black is not to play the four knights but rather to attack the knight and allow this and the thing is with black if you try to defend this pawn you're going to lose it cuz why we just go queen c2 you actually just can't guard the pawn but what you do instead is you play c6 this completely idiotic looking move but it's actually too dangerous for white to take there's a line here knight takes knight takes knight takes d5 take take knight g3 h5 and actually by some shocking t of events this evaluation is completely wrong this this stockfish doesn't actually understand the opening that well it doesn't get how poisonous this is but actually black's position becomes very very very very decent like low depth stockfish does not understand actually how annoying this is which is why parhan plays this okay he spends a bunch of time and plays queen a4 he already thinks like 12 minutes on the fifth on the fifth move of the game and the idea is to prevent d5 because the pawn cannot take back because of the pin so nobec plays queen e7 clearly still in his preparation and now param invents the move he plays f3 so you still can't play d5 but he's also not going to try to win the pawn and now we get pawn takes knight takes braham basically says look at least we're both out of theory nbe is not out of theory not out of theory look at the time management baram takes the center nob develops bishop now baram thinks on his own plays this move move c5 baram down 25 minutes on the clock early he wants to put the bishop on d6 that's his idea noy castles spends a little bit of time realizes you know what maybe i don't need to fight back because you know there's some line there white can play like there there's a line b6 cb knight a6 trying to take back which and then you know like i don't know it's some ridiculous computer line here again this stockfish doesn't quite understand it yeah nbe says yeah please by all means put the bishop on d6 i don't care queen e3 good luck taking my rook how ridiculous this d just straight up hung a rook but you can't take the rook because after bishop takes white has no moves white doesn't have a move like if you try to play knight d1 i'll move the queen out you know i'll play like queen e4 then i'll put the bishop back on h h6 then i'll play d5 and i'll play knight b4 i'll play bishop f5 white just can't develop white is smoed so these guys just get a completely absurd opening completely absurd and then and and then knight f2 and and rook e8 what what even is this what the hell is what is going on i'm telling you bros just had like five coffees each i mean what this isn't chess why why are the pieces all standing around like that would would huh h4 for who it's cuz it's really difficult to make a move you play g3 bishop g2 you develop your bishop but you hang m that's not good you're not going to castle cu there's all this open space or maybe you are b6 knight g5 param is still trying to go for an attack bro my boy p just playing g4 who is he trying to attack and with what army well actually as it turns out this restriction on the black position is proving to be very annoying and nck nock's got a really odd set of pieces back there that he can't really get out he plays queen d5 and now baram does castle what the what what yeah and he's winning baram castles and he's winning norbeck for whatever reason played this goofy system where his position's like a pinball machine like it's like like they're flying all over the place but nothing's actually happening and after take take it's over param is completely winning parama is completely winning no plays knight takes c5 if you take the queen there is this now the winning move here for white the only winning move is to move the queen out of danger and attack the knight not queen b4 not queen b4 and not queen c2 which is played in the game but queen a3 the point is now there's queen c4 check getting this queen out of the way but after king b1 the knight's really hard to protect because if you play knight e4 i have e3 hitting the queen the queen's got nowhere safe to move queen's trapped crazy literally trapped in the center of the board that's not that's what happens when you play with fire you could get burned all right instead we have queen c2 and suddenly nck chucks the knight completely he just chucks the knight the knight's dead but it's dead in a way where he actually gets some sort of an attack that's apparently not the best move apparently he should have started with knight d5 but like i said this was the worst game thus far in this tournament i mean i'm telling you when 2700s play worst games i mean the quality is still like astoundingly high but when these guys play yeah rook b8 b4 queen a3 check and look at this king now rook h3 baram tries to get some some defense here now rookie three a brilliant move brilliant move disconnecting the defenses of the white position if you take this with the rook then i will play knight takes and you can't actually take with the bishop because i'll play queen b4 and geometrically you're mated if you play king c1 looking for safety i force you to b1 and then you just lose i play bishop a3 i'll mate you in a couple of mov maybe bishop c3 to inom you over here if you play rook takes e3 i'll play knight takes e3 and then i'll also just destroy you if you you know if you don't if you don't do anything about that now if you take with the bishop the same problem i play queen takes b before i play bishop c3 rook e3 disconnects the defenses of the white position now i take the rook and now just cool cal collected h6 if the knight returns to f3 knight takes b4 position falls apart and that's what happens in the game white has all these beautiful pieces but in chess the two most important things are material and king safety white has more material right now i mean technically white has a knight for three pawns but it feels like white has more material cuz black hasn't even moved the bishop doesn't matter king safety white's king is way too weak look at this i mean look at nb just firing away tell me how this bishop comes to life without even moving right takes on g it's come to life without even moving queen queen here pawn takes f3 dust settles queen takes c8 black is up four pawns you can take the knight but then i will play queen g4 check at the very least i will win back my bishop this was one of the most absurd games i've ever seen between two 2700s my boys just showed up today wanting to get into a ridiculous little battle and parham played some really provocative early chess then it was noer backck who got himself into a horrible position by playing in a very dismissive manner i mean allowing param to get this massive attack building where he was like sacrificing a pawn to create attacking possibilities that black couldn't defend himself against and then param just blundered he played queen c2 if he played queen a3 he would have won the game probably in like seven moves straight up he just got a winning position and missed e3 he missed that i guess he he missed that winning idea which is kind of insane next game i have for you is from the challenger section we've always on upset alert there we've got hime santos latasa from spain very strong grandmas and we have divia deshmuk who is i don't know 17' 19 i don't know but she's she's from india and she's international master i don't think she has any grandmaster norms but she's just like one of the young indian women that's been cooking recently very interesting to see a matchup like this cuz it's 200 points difference but i think the skill level is way closer than 200 points i think like these tournaments like t steel they they allow some of the best players in the world to to to mix together and and potentially challenge each other in in situations where they might not actually get chances to do that anyway all of this is a nso indian this is a main line e3 bishop d3 none of that matters you're not going to get quizzed on this anyway we'll start you know we'll start we'll start analyzing the game where they're no longer in theory as you can see from divio who's blitzing out a bunch of moves she is still very much in theory age6 and in case it's not clear like white clearly is going to go on some sort of attacking stuff she plays rook b1 here still in her prep 15 moves black plays b6 she plays g f4 so black is down 42 minutes from the opening what black had to play here was pawn takes d4 and then after some exchanges the position is is or maybe she's supposed to take with the e pawn first but maybe you're supposed to lead like this but there's a lot of lines where black can quickly trade and the position is kind of clarified but he tries to keep the tension with b6 and and she just plays f4 and the idea of f4 is to plug the rook into the attack that's really all you're trying to do if pawn takes f4 you could take with the pawn but then you lose some center here so you would probably take with the rook there we go bishop to e6 now how is diva going to mobilize her position she her position literally is going to fall apart completely unless she goes for an attack so she plays bishop e4 putting some pressure black slides the queen now bishop b2 and the idea is very simple she just wants to open up like this he stops that obviously now she plays queen f3 which loses some advantage the computer really wanted rook d1 it really wanted rook d1 and just go for it clearly she didn't like it she went here but now black is able to consolidate she continues to poke but now he's able to come back but obviously she still is building up some sort of attack and and and this is still very much on the table like if she's able to to activate the dark squir bishop black is going to die he's going to die okay he plays f6 she plays queen g3 she's still poking he gets the king out of the way she plays rook g4 he defends himself with queen f7 and i told you if she is able to open up the position black is going to be in a lot of trouble he's going to have to be really careful cuz her position is very very very well coordinated it's defending it's attacking he undevelop to activate the rooks she plays d5 now black's position is dire he's still defending himself very well queen d3 plays rook g6 and now queen f is necessary to guard all the pawns the queen has to monitor every single pawn he goes here i mean i l i've been telling you the whole game like if she's going to activate the bishop he's going to die she sacrifices the bishop and the integrity of the entire black position completely just falls apart bishop takes f6 it's a square that black seems to be protecting three different times it's not protected it is not protected at all it doesn't matter how you take back of course you if you take back with the pawn it just go directly for your king okay i'm going to go directly for the king there's a series of moves there rook h6 king g8 i'll play queen g g3 so you can't block because i play rook g6 right so now here and now the king's going to run away or maybe not maybe not there's no way to run away i'm going to get rook f6 also have rook h7 and the attack is just too strong the knight is not participating in in anything it's it's just simply defending and i'll hunt the king into an x-ray and i'm going to win the queen so bishop takes f6 he takes with the knight she takes with the rook she sacrifices the bishop she sacrifices the rook when the dust settles she grabs the king slides out of the way she gives a check queen h4 the king is defended the pawn is defended the pawn is attacked and the rook has backup white is down a full rook in a queen and rook endgame and yet is completely winning it's incredible the point is that the threat is rook f6 to win the queen the threat is also rook h8 and rook h7 so you can't defend anything and the worst part about this position is that she's not interested in winning the queen she plays this the kiss of death of the pawn and the king now can't even escape so now it's not a threat against the the the queen the threat is rook h8 and queen h6 which will lead to checkmate rook h8 and also queen f6 which is made so he goes here now she goes here point is now king is hunted meress out into the open rook e8 rook e8 queen d5 brutal the only move is king d7 walking into the skewer haime santos latasa resigns this is probably divia dm's best win ever but i'm who knows she might have be beaten some other very strong gms a very big upside in the challenger section big win for diva indian fans rejoice the indians are on fire another decisive result this one in the master section alexander donchenko anish giri denko gave an interview recently by the way highly recommend you go look it up it was on the tata steel youtube channel it was with fion st anon and alexander donchenko i've never heard him speak in my life and he is a shockingly normal very very funny interview view and charismatic man and that's very rare when you're 2 2650 2700 like chess grandmasters need media training most of them not an e giri anish giri should give the media training if anything danchenko very funny very interesting guy and yeah i i wish him nothing but the best now here's something very fascinating anish giri played d4 d6 that is interesting because with black now you are basically provoking e4 and uh the ps defense sucks at 2800 2700 level it's a great opening for like most of the bess players but like if you gave players an option to play the ps or like literally any other opening or not show up to the tournament they would choose any of those options white just has too many easy ways for an advantage now what did anish giri prepare did he prepare a filor like was he going to play knight bd7 c6 like that that fidor is a very interesting maneuvering open i don't know and we're never going to know because we have a king's indian then we have not a king's indian we have an old indian i'm not i'm not saying anybody's old by age i'm for anish is i'm not calling him an old indian i'm saying this is bishop f5 like is one of the ways to play black could also castle and play like knight a6 and c5 black can play c6 or knight c6 e5 is a kings indian okay there's like 47 different ways to play it but he plays it like this knight c3 and then he doesn't even castle he's waiting for danchenko to castle finally they castle white is going to try to play e4 knight d4 knight h4 maybe play c5 black is going to wait it's black's position is very flexible rook e1 trying to play e4 anish puts the knight on e4 responding to his opponent's plan his opponent also as you can see down a lot of time in the opening a lot of time anish clearly shows up ready to fight and anish is up like 40 minutes on the clock clearly making denko very uncomfortable and i will just say that this is a shocking opening for anish giri like anish giri is a practical man except on twitter where he's just the like an absolute goblin demon but in his opening preparation he's you know he plays like he plays like meta openings i mean he's very well prepared he equalizes with black with white he pushes for advantage and comfortable positions but he's not like known for crazy dynamics clearly he's this is a calculated way of playing and trying to play for a win bishop d2 bishop c3 and yeah i mean anish plays typical kings like i mean he takes the center and now a big decision for white do you take on bant i told danchenko is a is a is a very principled man he does take on pant and anish just gets this position where i mean black ain't playing this for a win anytime soon except he is he goes for mate danchenko plays h4 allowing the queen in but there is no mate so the knight's got to go nish got all the he's got the rooks in the back he's got the knight in the front i mean i don't know how he's going to attack here but you know maybe he'll prove us wrong he plays a6 preventing knight to b5 danchenko really would love a knight trade he would love a trade of the queens as well i mean if we get queen g2 take take he'll be very happy knight goes to e3 and now n got this game looks like a blitz game i mean he's got connect four right off the off the home rank got all the pawns there and now it's just about like potentially slowly moving forward f3 donchenko finally bites makes a move and now giri plays d5 and rook d7 queen f7 it's sort of like unstoppable force meets a movable object nobody really has a breakthrough queen d2 cd i don't know about cd cuz you allow the knight forward that was a very very very impulsive decision i might say he he took and he tries to clarify and his idea is e4 this was denko's main idea that's why he took in the center cuz like i'm going to get i'm going to get the piece out of the way yeah giri now plays a very annoying move plays a5 and i feel like maybe danchenko either missed or overlooked the idea here missed or not overlooked underestimated this is a very powerful idea you don't actually have to move the knight because of the pin and now the knight gets to go to b4 and if the knight can live on the outskirts of the board before jumping into the position again black is going to be in good shape yeah and that knight is untouchable he relinquishes defens of it because it's defended enough and the rook at the bottom is still unguarded zenchenko strikes back but one minute versus 17 is not going to do him any favors anish giri finds a beautiful sacrifice not a sacrifice he a trade takes the rook takes the rook and now the knight jumps out you cannot get this position is still defendable if you're stockfish but it's not defendable if you're a human f4 he takes that was the 40th move the move where he gets bonus time in chess we get bonus time on the 40th move and actually here maybe white could have survived a little longer but rook f8 and the knight is coming in from the outskirts as i said what a game by anish giri what a game who now has two and a half out of three two wins with black that is what we call big chad behavior by mr giri and his media training class will be next thursday and the last game of the day j and june women's world champion versus jordan van forest interesting match up here because we have two story lines we have j and june who has had two very very good games she drew against yanomi it's fascinating to see how how she does when she's given an opportunity like this to play in the event jordan van for is do zero out of two and not only is he zero out of two bro shows up and plays a modern okay like i said like a ni giri p's defense is garbage at the at the high level the modern defense might be even worse at classical chess level but it's about how you play against it like hearo plays this all the time in blitz but there he gets three minutes on the clock also don't forget this is an opening suited for a player that is a ridiculously strong defender and creative player and that is what hikaro is now j and jun plays this setup with knight f3 bishop c4 queen e2 hikaro played this against me and he made me want to quit chess but i am not as weak as jordan van forest no i am not as weak jordan van forest is not as weak as me i'm sorry that was a that was maybe that's what i truly believe no anyway both sides castle and it's it's just a solid game i mean we just get a normal game we trade pawns and knights and now she plays bishop to h6 trying to target jordan's position and we get a queenless middle game okay so he's going to try to pressure here we're going to see what happens with these two pawns she plays bishop d3 and jordan plays b5 and already kind of has no problems in the position you know he's it's really it's really going to be a matter of like what are the plans here and if you're not really familiar with the ideas of the position it could be it's very easy to like get like she plays rook b1 which which makes a lot of sense cuz she trying to move the knight but rook b1 is like you know and she spent like 13 minutes on it which is like ah i wish there was a better move but there's really there's not a whole lot that's better the knight goes to d7 and is ready to go to c5 now she plays f4 right she's trying to kick the bishop bishop slides in rotates and it's it's tough to even targets target black's weaknesses like if you play bishop e2 to try to attack the the pawn i just go b4 now you got to go here i'll defend myself your knight can't reenter the game and you have a huge weakness maybe i won't even do that maybe i'll just take right away or play d5 blow up the center cuz you can't take right lot of tactics a lot of a lot of interesting stuff the players do a little dam here with the pawns and jordan is just loading up the cannons i mean he's playing knight f6 and e5 is played d5 is played and in this position white actually has a tactic but she plays it backwards she plays knight takes d5 and the idea is to get the second pawn with a pin and with pressure but instead of that stockfish liked bishop takes b5 it wanted to sack the bishop get it taken then take like this hit hitting this and after rook a7 you have knight e7 check threatening to take the bishop and then take the knight so black would go take and take this is what stockfish liked it's probably equal of course two pieces for a rook are always nice but these are very weak pawns and white could get an end game where she has two connected passers but she does it the other way instead of sacking the bishop and keeping the knight she sacks the knight and keeps the bishop and now jordan is able to to begin a consolidation phase she gets three pawns for the piece but knight f8 and it's not the same as having a knight a knight would have put very unique pressure on the black position a bishop is just sort of swinging and missing and now black begins unraveling right he he untangles himself right rook d2 knight goes to e6 the knight goes to e6 threatening the bishop on the g5 square and it's a very very very tough tough position now bishop h6 now jordan begins firing away with his pieces here the kn should have went to f4 apparently to try to threaten this because after this apparently e6 here is seizing back a little bit of that momentum but she moves this pawn and now jordan is able to kind of consolidate fully rook e6 desperate times calls for desperate measures but that bishop is by the way still just right and that's chess sometimes you just make these decisions and it doesn't pay off and and that and that's just sort of how it goes she had to sack the bishop and and put the knight forward the idea here with pawn to e e6 is to disconnect black from the action knight takes f5 would lead to pawn takes f7 check king f7 and maybe you get a little bit of counterplay but probably black is still just going to win in the long run but for example rook c7 king h6 rook b7 rook b7 bishop c6 rook b8 take take and maybe your two pawns will do something in the future maybe they will go on and do something but very tough position to play of course and ultimately yeah jordan put a rook on e2 and r a1 and swarmed in and the game is over so jordan's on the board juan jun stopped she's on half out of three jordan has one point a lot of other results i will i will give you a standings update tomorrow when i am back home i actually couldn't crop anything on this laptop overlay but it's round three so you know i think it's ala fua and anish giri right now tied with for first two and a half out of three and in the challengers i think it's a big tie as well that's all hope you enjoyed the childhood photos of dinosaur tattoos on my face and dingly ren is back dingly ren showing that he has no signs of rust doing very very well that's all i have for you today get out of here
