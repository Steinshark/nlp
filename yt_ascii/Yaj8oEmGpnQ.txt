vrooom! hello everyone and welcome in this video, i'm super excited to be testing out the jaguar f-type svr all wheel drive five liter v8 575 horsepower now i've tried out the f-type r and it was one of my favorite all time vehicles and all this does is step up the game this is, of course, the convertible version uh, but they take the 0-60 from 3.9 seconds down to 3.5 seconds, top speed from'6 uh, if you are in the hard top uh, with you know, the spoiler and the correct setting up to 200 miles per hour and, so an incredible vehicle, 575 horspeower uh, but of course the supercharger, mixed with the exhaust, when you put your foot down [the foot is down] [laughs] that is what this car is all about it just, you just get pure joy, and it's this combination it really is the combination of the supercharger uh, so you have this immediate throttle response when you put your foot down and the sound so you also accompany that torque that immediate torque with, from the exhaust the combination is just seriously unbeatable. it is such a fun vehicle to drive uh, the transmission in this car is absolutely phenomenal. this zedf 8 speed, was the first automatic transmission that i'd really felt like okay i'm okay with automatic transmissions. before i thought that it either needed to be dual clutch or a manual gearbox. uh, it's brilliantly smooth, it's incredibly fast and, it's it's just an unreal transmission and it's just a regular automatic, i mean you know, 8 speeds, so you've got aggressive gears you can bring the revs up, put your foot down get into some serious torque very quickly uh, the car is playful, i really do like this uh, vibrant blue exterior color and you know, some of the changes for the svr, of course it has the additional power over the 550, that's purely tuning that they've done they've also removed some weight out of it so not only is it more powerful, but it also weighs less about 55 lbs and that has been done through the exhaust uh, which is a titanium inconel alloy so, super sophisticated stuff and, also the wheels, uh, so a forged alloy wheel uh, that takes about, i think 20 or so lbs vs. the stock, f-type's wheels er the base f-type's wheels so you pull some weight out, you give it more power um, and when you take the top off, which is, truly amazing once this top is down, and you get even more of that sound in here from that exhaust, uh, it's a really special vehicle it does have an active rear spoiler, so it does, you know, influence the coefficient of drag, and the coefficient of lift, depending on where that spoiler setting is, so pretty cool that they've incorporated that uh, but you know, it's kind of got this old school appeal to it that i really like with the you know, it's a five liter v8 it is a v8, uh, it's supercharged and you know, something that kind of lacks in a lot of the modern vehicles even vehicles that are super quick uh i've been driving driving the gtr, today you know some other super quick cars out there that are turbocharged you don't get the resonpse, uh, that you get with this when you put your foot down because it's supercharged, and you just have that instantaneous knock of torque planting you in your seat and then you just, that roar, and those pops man, this thing is just truly a joy to drive so you do have different settings you can put it in i've got it in dynamic, and then in sport mode, and so the sport mode here basically will just keep the revs up uh, if you don't choose to do your own shifting uh, and usually automatic gearboxes i say "you know what?" "just let the gearbox do it thing-let the gearbox do its thing" and it's usually fine um, because a lot of the manual transmission the paddle shifters aren't quick enough to kind of react to what you want them to do this one's fantastic. it's a great gearbox um, and it's-and it's a great, you know, feel to it, super smooth which you know, usually you get smooth or quick, not both and this transmission, it's just amazing how smooth it is as well as quick now, they also do have an option for carbon ceramic brakes and i believe they said you can take off another 45 lbs uh, vs., you know, the st-the standard steel brakes so, they have one variant here uh, that they were saying the hardtop, and it's got you know a certain package setup where it's 110 lbs lighter than the f-type r, with an additional you know  25 horsepower so, just amazing that they've pulled out a good amount of weight and, you know they've upped the power and so the f-type r is incredible and the svr just takes it another level further this thing is just, man it's violent, and i love that [laughs] as you can see, i can't help but, you know keep this smile on my face the whole time, even if i am following a honda civic at 40 miles an hour. this thing is just a joy [laughs] listen to that wow [laughs] [laughs x3] so there's a little taste of the joy that can be had in this vehicle truly one of the fav-my favorite cars i've ever been in this thing is [stammers] [laughs] i can't even come to words, this is this is sad. it's sad that i's making me this emotional. uh, usually i'm, you know, spock that can't can't smile, and man this thing is just unbelievably fun it brings you back to a primal self where it's just like, you get joy from loud noises and quick movements, and it's just like, it's very silly, that that is what, you know brings a human to be like "aaaah!" you know, super joy, but i'm just babbling nonsense at this point this is what this car has done to me i'm totally sober, i guarantee it, but man, this thing just has like it just dumps dopamine into your brain it, it's unreal. it's a unreal car uh, i wish i could say that, you know, it was affordable [laughs] it's not so, that's the downside everything else about this car is just pure brilliance it is unbelievably good and you know there is a little bit of playfulness to it you can tell that even with all wheel drive uh, you could definitely get this thing sideways if you wanted and the traction control system as is keeps it pretty tame but there's a little twitchyness to it. uh, which is cool, you know it's a little bit of a beast and you've gotta know what you're doing when you're playing with it, so i enjoy that. hopefully i've said something useful in this video i feel like i was mostly just giggling(hehe) uh, but if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thank you so much for watching, and get yourself a jaguar f-type svr [laughs uncontrollably] that's just not fair! that's just unreasonably good. listen to that, jesus! [laughs] oh my god this thing just asks for police to pull you over.
