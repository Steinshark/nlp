the chinese communist party's anti-corruption drive continues and one of their recent targets is kind of interesting donghong had been a former disciplinary inspector earlier in his career furthermore he's a former aide to wang choshan former politburo standing committee member and head of the central commission for discipline inspection today he serves as the vice president of the people's republic of china wang chisholm got his start in chinese politics because he happened to know the right people but he climbed the ranks because he knew how to fix things wong has become one of the senior politicians people are most familiar with other than xi jinping himself but first i want to take the time to talk briefly about the next agenometry email newsletter just just a quick talking i

subscribe and i'll try to make it worth your while you can expect a new newsletter every four days at 1am taiwan time thanks wong was born in 1948 in the northern province of shanti in his youth he worked in the countryside as a farmer as a member of the sent down youths an initiative during the cultural revolution xi jinping had also been one such youth sent down to diangiah village and it is there that wang and xi would become good friends wong would also meet and marry another princeling the daughter of former first vice premier yao yi ling they have an adopted daughter together wang studied history in college focusing on the history of the republic of china he will continue that history study for three years after graduation at the institute of modern history his work there got him recommended to the central rural policy research department in 1980 he was one of the four young intellectuals who impressed the communist old guard with suggestions for agricultural reform chanyu and one of the party's great officials would praise his suggestions in 1988 wong then embarked on a career in finance officials transferred him into the china agricultural trust and investment corporation he was very successful there eventually becoming party secretary and president of china construction bank today china construction bank is china's second largest bank after icbc it is in the finance sphere that he began to make contacts with other global elites like henry paulsen wong did major outreach with western finance partnering with morgan stanley in creating china's first joint venture investment bank cicc limited wang and henry paulsen would meet again when henry became secretary of the treasury wong's performance would get him assigned to guangdong where banks there were suffering the after effects of the 1998 asian financial crisis with almost half their loans in technical default wong was structured the debt of several state-owned enterprises and returned the mega province to relative financial health the debt experience during the 1998 asian financial crisis would elevate wong's prospects within the party working in business someone told me that you gained credibility and success in an organization by putting out fires that's how you get promoted and that's what wong did wang was then appointed as party secretary of the province of hainan his goal there would be to help the province recover from a real estate bubble that popped in 2000 he would only serve there for five months before suddenly being reassigned 2002 and 2003 saw a large outbreak in the previously unknown virus sars china's first response to the outbreak was to insist that the country had it under control i'd written about this in a prior video in april 2003 zhang weng kang then minister of health told the press that beijing had 12 cases of stars and three deaths that same day jian yin-yang retired head of a military hospital directly contradicted those numbers by publicly declaring that he knew of at least 120 cases at his former workplace this was immensely embarrassing the party lost confidence in zhang and abruptly decided to replace him in beijing mayor meng nong wang chishong left this post as party secretary of hainan to assume the position of beijing's new mayor as mayor wong brought new urgency to the sars crisis he mobilized the people to build a star's hospital in northwest beijing and began enforcing a quarantine to stamp out the outbreak the quarantine would succeed and wang would serve as the mayor beijing for four more years after that he stepped down in 2007. huang would reach the pinnacle of power in 2012 when the party selected him to the politburo standing committee he was named the secretary of the central commission for discipline inspection or ccdi i have previously profiled the organization in an earlier video as i mentioned in that video anti-corruption has been a critical part of the party's discipline operations for a long time but as a member of xi jinping's inner circle wang helped the ccdi align with xi's vision for the party if you get what i mean under wong's chairmanship the ccdi ramped up its checks and inspections it would kick off an unprecedented anti-corruption drive that targeted quote tigers and flies alike nearly 9 000 officials were investigated and real quantitative evidence exists showing that this renewed activity drove down party cronyism and corruption in some form there's been talk that not having any biological children makes wong less corruptible as ccdi secretary i don't quite see that as being true as he does have an adopted child in addition as my video on cronyism shows there's a whole lot of cronyism going through family members like siblings and spouses you don't need to have a biological child he served as ccdi secretary for a single five-year term in 2017 wong stepped down from the standing committee as he at 69 years old had reached the unofficial age limit for senior level politicians said to be 68. the party has never really outright confirmed that its senior members need to retire by a certain age xin ping for example doesn't qualify in fact they've denied it in public but actions speak louder than words and the man stepped down from the ccdi his successor was chairman jiao leichi who is currently the man holding the position after stepping down from the standing committee wang was voted in as vice president of the prc by the national people's congress 2969 to one brave vote as president xi's close comrade and trusted firefighter it appears that wong continues to exercise extensive influence behind the scenes especially when it comes to foreign affairs i wouldn't though say that that's quite unusual retired communist officials are frequently consulted from time to time there is a lot of conspiracy mongering around wang chushang which is interesting people are looking at recent events trying to connect the dots trying to come to some weird sort of conclusion for example this donghong arrest as well as the recent persecution of huang family acquaintance renji chang and then you have the exiled chinese real estate tycoon miles guo known for his youtube channel in association with steve bannon banging the drum and specifically targeting wang with allegations and conspiracy theories huo's youtube videos have a real big following especially amongst conservative types and the chinese diaspora abroad i haven't reviewed miles accusations but from my perspective it seems a bit far-fetched wang and xi have been together for literally decades wang has been entrusted with a number of really important job responsibilities correct the ccd likes to take down subordinates before the main guy but these recent events seem to be more associates and co-workers and subordinates rather than his inner circle his students so to say not to mention miles credibility is kind of shot after his laboratory virus claims anyway juan continues to work closely with xi and i wonder if he's going to retire as soon as he is getting up there in the years and he seems to have a lot of outside interests i emphasize with his love for history and voracious reading habits guy like that i bet all that he wants to do after this long career is to sit at his house read and talk with smart people about history things all right that's all for now take care of yourselves see you soon
