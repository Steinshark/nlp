so let's face it learning how to code is really hard and being good at coding is even harder it's very very difficult whenever i recommend to people that they should start learning how to code because it's such an amazing and useful skill the objection that i always hear is but it's so hard but i can't do it but you need to you know think and be mathsy and all of that so most people don't end up trying and the ones that do end up quitting when it gets hot but the case that i'm gonna make in this video is that yes coding is very hard but that is precisely why you need to learn it and i'm going to explain what i mean using two graphs and the first graph we're going to be using is from a book called the dip by seth gorey it looks like this on the y-axis you have motivation and on the x-axis we have time so we're talking about motivation as a function of time and the way it usually looks like is something like this when you start off learning something new your motivation is very high because you're very excited about the fact that you're being introduced to this new exciting world and it's all these new things that you've never even heard about that you sort of start learning the basics of and you're sort of very motivated in the beginning because you have your end goals in mind and then whatever but then the going gets hard and you hit what's called the dip your motivation drops very drastically drops all the way here you start realizing that what you're doing is actually very hard and you sort of get over the early excitement you hit what's called the tip when your motivation goes down and this is where most people quit most people cannot get past this hump of low motivation and they just end up quitting because it gets too hard however if you get over the dip then what happens your motivation starts to go up and eventually it doesn't get quite as high as it was in the beginning but you sort of get over it and you get to sort of a baseline level of motivation where you're used to it and then you start to get sort of at least somewhat good at it and it becomes more natural to keep going but the thing is as i said most people quit here so by definition if you get over this dip if you get up here you will have something that most people don't have you will have learned to code or whatever you're trying to learn and you're at a point where most people haven't reached most people haven't reached this point so you will have a relatively scarce skill that most people don't have and realize why this is important we need another graph this time from basic economics okay so many of you might know that i didn't actually study computer science in university i studied economics and then i sort of transferred into going to software engineering and if you wanna know why you're gonna watch this video where i talk about how i learned how to code in four months and why i transfer over from economics and banking into computer science and social engineering i forgot most of my economics basically but there's one concept that i remember it's the most basic economics concept of all type it's called supply and demand and it looks like this wait actually how do you do this again okay so it looks like this quantity of workers on the x-axis and you have a salary or the wage on the y-axis and then you have the demand curve which basically tells you for each level of salary how much demand is there for workers in that field good thing for us for for us people who are learning to code is that for the tech industry demand is extremely high so that for any given level of salary there's a relatively high amount of demand so the demand curve is going to be somewhere up here whereas for some other industry like i don't know cleaning it could be like down here or something like that because coding is a skill that there's actually an insane amount of demand for that's why the demand curve is very high which is good for us and there's the supply curve and here's where the fact that the coding is difficult becomes very important because if it was very easy to learn to code if it was very easy to get the skills to become a software engineer then the supply curve would be somewhere like here so for any given level of salary there'll be a lot of supply of workers which means that the salary for koda people would be relatively low i hope you're following however in reality because coding is hard and as we just saw most people quit in the dip that means that there's not a lot of people in the world relatively to demand who know how to code which means that the actual supply curve is much higher it's somewhere up here and in the labor market equilibrium demand has to equal supply that means that for any given level of salary there's relatively few people who have the skills to be software engineers because getting those skills is not very easy companies have to pay software engineers a lot to convince them to work for them instead of the competition because there's so much demand and not enough supply to fill all that demand so you can see that there is a high salary and this is just a general fact whenever something is hard it means that most people by definition won't be able to do it which means that by definition there's less competition for the jobs that require those skills and coding is one of these kind of skills and it's one of the few industries in the world with this ridiculously high demand but relatively low supply if you know how to code you will have a skill that's extremely valuable that most people don't have that you can leverage to get a very lucrative career for yourself that also has very good work-life balance and you'll always have opportunities for you if you're a computer software engineer you will always have opportunities so coding is hard and that is precisely why you need to learn it because in order to succeed in life you need to know how to do things that most people don't know how to do anyway that's just something i've been thinking about again if you do want to learn how to code it is very hard but if you do things right you can actually do it very quickly and personally i did it in only four months and if you want to hear more about that make sure to watch this video next where i talk about how i learned how to code in four months and even got a job as a software engineer at the end of it i promise that video is even better than this one so definitely definitely definitely go watch it right
