you've seen one keyboard you've seen them all right wrong we spent hours combing aliexpress for the coolest wackiest finger candy that we could find and well we ordered all of them how is this even a keyboard got this foldable to match my phone wow i've got a freaking laser keyboard whatever that means but aside from the meme boards some of these cost serious bucks so they better at least be you know good enough that what the heck oh i get it this one is supposed to be waterproof and silent it's all over my lap and only 13.50 wow that's less than the price of this towel from lttstore.com that i'm using to clean up the mess one moment please portable durable and comfortable they say and 4.7 stars with 59 sold and 15 reviews wow that's actually pretty promising oh my god this is so much worse than i could have possibly anticipated i mean i thought you were just being a diva ploof was the one who prepped this so if it's not a 400 mechanical keyboard it's basically but wow david do you have a close enough up view to see how when i press one key the entire keyboard domes up can you see it shifting way up here no backspace come on come on you have to work fine oh oh my god 65 words per minute 85 accuracy i blame the non-functioning backspace okay maybe i just gotta shake out the water the credit everything they claim is basically true it does roll it does appear to be waterproof and it is silent and comfortable okay hold on we're gonna try one more time last time last time i swear to god it is not working that's gonna be a nay goes in the pile oh nate like this segne to our sponsor oh no i fix it celebrate ifixit's 20th anniversary and grab yourself a pro-tech tool kit this summer using the link down below next we have the doquo wired keyboard with expansion dock type c hub usb 3.0 hdmi adapter docking station for ipad huawei samsung backlit keyboard watch this this is a good trip oh yeah i was a busboy in another life pcie bus oh i kind of like this it comes with two little feet so you can adjust the angle if you want oh god wow is this waterproofing the keyboard or is this a dust cover are you sure there's only one way to find out proof to me ah all right dokuo this is an extremely short keyboard cable right it's right in the name it's a dock this then goes to my laptop and then my power adapter goes here it's pretty cool you've got hdmi out micro sd sd and four usb 3 type a ports that's way more i o than most laptops have oh oh one of them's usb2 they got the color coding wrong super cool the card reader works the power pass through works the keyboard works it's not great all that docking capability plus a hundred watts of pass-through for your laptop aluminum construction a backlight and okay yeah it's over a hundred dollars even when it's on discount but as long as the typing experience is okay i can't say i'm generally a big fan of round keycaps but 114 words per minute 96 accuracy for me that's a very good result the usb cable is extremely short but it's mobile focused they really talk a lot about ipad and using it with your laptop so i guess i kind of get it and at least it's thick you know what i'm giving this one a yay good pile where's the good pile i wasn't expecting to have a good pile next up is the h18 plus air mouse mini touch keyboard large how is this even a keyboard kinds of operation mode touch mode and keyboard mode request this key to switch between the modes what key do i press to power oh oh i think i saw some keyboard there for a second this looks utterly unusable however whoa there's your mouse and that oh yep definitely one at a time does it have a gyro yeah that's a big fat no you know as a weekly user of a very similar product from sodeco that has a little keyboard and then is a gyroscopic mouse i gotta say i don't like this having to choose between having a touch pad at all and having a keyboard at all is a real bummer hello world kind of put my finger on what's so off about this it's an ortholinear layout no offense no offense if you love ortho the notes say don't know what you'd use this for but whether it's a media pc an nvidia shield apple tv having something like this kicking around so that you can enter passwords and things like that can be an absolute godsend and it's a relatively small investment at 20 bucks on sale 22 words per minute nice i'd say the main benefit is just that if you need to enter special characters for passwords this is going to be a little faster than using your game controller or your tv remote i am really excited about this next one though the foldable bluetooth wireless keyboard with touchpad ultra slim pocket folding keyboard wow as advertised she folds she unfolds and she's got a keyboard and a touchpad i wouldn't mind if the height was the same across the board is there any reason it's not it just i think it's just because of this kind of faux leather texture on the back of it it's a carrying case this along with these cleaning brushes are apparently a bonus for being among the first 30 orders yup that's a makeup brush this is obviously just a charging cable it's type c though that's pretty nice i want to see if it just works over a wire because sometimes bluetooth devices do not there's a lot to like here multi-device connectivity gesture compatibility on the touchpad the inclusion of a full number pad i'm not a huge fan of the fact that it doesn't appear to connect over a wire it only charges over a wire but hopefully it's a pretty quick pairing process let's just wait how do you turn it on oh there should be a switch inside oh okay we figured this out we figured out the problem aside from being plugged in hold on i bet it just starts working too here we go you have to power it on no no but we actually have a chance of that working now cool we're in pairing mode yeah bluetooth keyboard here we go i believe yes bluetooth is not the best connectivity standard for a trackpad that's a little laggy and now that i look a little closer at the keyboard there's some neat functions here like the fact that you can switch between ios and mac and android and windows mode including the functions of the f keys but the layout is a little funky yeah you got this numpad over here which is great but you're also going to be way off centered and they've crammed all of the alpha keys into a very small space boom that t is cut off and v okay 88 words per minute with 90 accuracy i mean considering that this is just for blasting out a quick memo when you're on the go on your ipad or something like that i kind of like it especially for 33 dollars it'd be nice if it automatically turned off or went into standby instead of having a physical rocker switch but it gets over 30 hours of battery and takes just an hour and a half to charge so at least it's a quick problem to remedy what i'm giving this a yay because of my phone that's still pretty big and why carry that around when i could use a laser projection keyboard i've been aware of these for quite some time but i have never had the pleasure or from what i've heard displeasure of actually using one let's see how this goes it's got micro b for charging power button one of those little strap pass-throughs because what you're going to carry this on your wrist i guess of a warning because it's a laser all right so okay it just starts immediately blasting out laser so that's good if you're not familiar with these the way they work is they have a depth sensing camera of some sort and then they have just a laser projector so that you can type like right on any flat surface in front of you i don't see how to pair it oh oh sorry what did you pair it with before you know what i think it's online i can try yeah oh okay way to go proof yeah if you disconnected it should automatically go into pairing mode according to the instructions in the meantime we can have a look at the product page for this superior durability that makes sense no moving parts lithium-ion battery compatible with ios 4 android 2.1 windows xp and above i mean to be clear they're probably not wrong it's just that whenever you see such old operating systems on a product page your question how current the design is this is interesting though am i able to move the keyboard or shrink and grow it i'm gonna try to do something with it hello world holy crap it actually works i don't have a semicolon okay so my home row is here which puts my spacebar way over to the left what the devil is this diagonal arrow you know the answers to these questions what does what what does diagonal error oh it's dim now i am connected you i was trying to type i am trying to touch type we got real close real close i'm pretty sure i already know the answer to this one but let's go ahead and do the typing test anyway whoa i'm touch typing oh 22 words per minute accuracy 91 at 32 bucks i mean i could see picking it up just for a party trick but beyond that i'm sorry but this is an a how is this a keyboard bluetooth compatible wireless rgb mechanical keyboard with two knobs small gaming keyboard it's adorable i mean it's really cute wait okay shut up this has a hot swappable key switches i can't tell what this is is this for enthusiasts or children it uses type c it's pretty modern this actually feels like a reasonable quality like braided cable connection mode wow it does it does bluetooth as well question why can't i open the setup software after downloading it answer check whether the antivirus software is intercepted set it as a trusted file to run it oh god well if our channel gets hijacked again you'll know why there's a red light here that seems to stay on regardless of the position of the switch yes let's start at the left a b c d e f a b c d e hey what about this one a b c d e f whoa okay one three six four one two three five fours damn i've been informed i'm not expected to do a typing test on this which is good it's just intended to be a macro pad this switch flips between the three layers which have to be programmed using their software how safe that software is i have absolutely no idea but it claims 20 days of battery life and allows you to connect either via bluetooth or via a wire it's certainly cute the build quality is a solid okay it's gotta be an a because it uses this like random weird software this one i have really high hopes for this looks sick yeah it's a tablet keyboard 28 bucks they've sold a whopping 13. what are these sales numbers i really gotta wonder how sustainable is it to do the tooling for these things that costs money anyway the point is it has rgb which i'm not sure how to use but i'm sure i'll figure out at some point oh didn't include a usbc cable oh there's a power switch though okay oh yes okay that's pretty sick chiclet style keys all the f shortcut keys that you would expect for an ipad or something like that okay how do we pair though oh correct yes function c hey it's flashing all right i've got it wow it is not very great to type on i love that the battery looks like this it worked oh wow wow that is shockingly laggy wow this made the previous bluetooth what look amazing hey you know how the top end mice these days will use greater than a thousand hertz pulling for blah blah smooth etc okay it doesn't bode well for typing accuracy if that's the polling rate let's give it a shot what the hell just happened open my inbox one moment please foreign holy i just hit 120 words per minute with 97 accuracy on this piece the trackpad is nigh unusable but as a keyboard i can't argue with the results here am i even that fast on the real keyboard on my laptop do we need a do we need a point of reference here 12 94 accurate i was having some focus issues there not gonna lie but you can't deny the results here if the trackpad was better this would be a definite yay just because of how slim it is i could see for students this just being absolutely killer and the layout is it's it's compact but it's not stupid everything's kind of where it's supposed to be you're not going to be fumbling for the backspace or shift or anything critical like that for only keyboard use i can't deny the results all right it's a yay i doubt the same thing is going to happen here though this appears to be an attempt at making a gaming pad but all they've really done is hack off most of a keyboard i don't see the point i love your notes for this one how the f is this ultra slim yeah there's nothing slim about this at all this is a full height like mechanical ass keyboard except it's not even a mechanical keyboard it's a membrane keyboard lift up any of the keycaps they just just sprayed it they just sprayed the whole thing black with the keycaps installed there's overspray everywhere this legend is going to come off immediately this is a cheap piece of crap is it at least cheap it's four dollars and 64 cents well i mean that's something especially with a backlight although i shouldn't be that impressed because it's basically a third the price of a cheap rgb membrane keyboard and it's a third of a cheap rgb membrane keyboard this is what they were going for you know with ergonomic improvements and a d-pad and you know a gaming pad right but this is what they ended up with you know i'm about to justify the existence of this of this with a 10 keyless you end up in a more ergonomic position nope stop stop face palming okay no i'm serious i'm serious though if you are a low sensitivity gamer and you don't want to use a gaming pad you just want to use a regular old keyboard that's a lot of extra mousing space i mean this is a piece of crap but i could see something like this having a reason to exist yeah i could i could at least use a couple more of these like maybe give me give me one more you know one more column here you know what it's an a but but it's a it's a potential for yay if it was a little better and i'm gonna do the typing test oh crap that one i could have typed damn it but i have no backspace zero words per minute zero percent accuracy and you're out of here bringing us to the machinery key probably the most ordinary mechanical keyboard of the lot except that we wanted to get an idea of what a 250 dollar mechanical keyboard on aliexpress might look like even if it's on sale for 117 dollars you know what though fault they're stoil that that actually looks pretty it includes a dongle with a type c cable adapter for 2.4 gigahertz functionality it also connects via bluetooth it has what whatever the devil this is okay we're gonna have to figure that out it includes both a keycap and key switch puller no way does this have hot swappable key switches okay that's pretty cool at this price point yes yes it does these are very cheap switches what the hell is g-rule backlight rgb backlighting and i just you know am i just out of touch with the keyboard scene or does this actually seem kind of not that bad oh yeah at 250 obviously it's totally out to lunch but this is clearly like regularly discounted so injection molded pbt yeah they feel really good kind of liking this thing oh they have some really cool color schemes too why did you pick the green and yellow one ploof and it's wireless and it's as cool as you are oh i figured out what toggle bar does i wouldn't be surprised if it's programmable in some way but it goes to desktop it's the it's the no i'm actually not mom don't worry about that there's nothing on my screen button perky rgb giant 4000 milliamp hour battery yes confirms that the toggle bar can be configured to things like pause play skip brightness volume realistically anything you want hopefully you don't need their their software for that oh i like this volume knob though of course it all comes down to monkey type though 116 95 accuracy yep it's a mechanical keyboard all right posting one of the best results and look at this i didn't even notice the back this thing looks freaking cool with that said the labs did take a quick look at this one because given that it was one of the best performers we were kind of thinking oh this thing could end up with a recommendation is there anything that we're not noticing and they did notice that the input latency is all over the place anywhere from 10 to 30 milliseconds on wired and 20 to 40 on wireless which is pretty unusual for a keyboard of this caliber they actually asked for it back to do even more testing maybe we'll have a comment pinned with some more thoughts and you know what else we're going to
