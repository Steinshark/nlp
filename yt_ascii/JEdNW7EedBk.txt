this is what this past week truly felt like oh you would like some money here you go oh you would like some money here you go money here you go money here you go everyone money this past week i took you with me to share with you what i spend in a week and although i am usually really good with keeping track of expenses it's something very vulnerable and scary putting out what you spend in a week but i mean we are family here so we're gonna go along and i'm gonna share with you what i spend in a week okay but before we start this video there needs to be some ground rules and bear with me just stay with me here first of all i really want to point out that this isn't every week is very different for me and this week contained a few things one i ate at home a lot and in this video i'm not going to be one of those people who are like well i ate an egg and when i bought the case of eggs there was a dozen in there so that would total the egg to be 60 cents or whatever i'm not i'm not doing that i'm counting strictly what i spend in a week every week might be different but i just want to clear that up second thing i wanted to clear up is i have multiple sources of income so what works for me might not work for other people and on that note i also have a partner we live together we own our place so that also affects how we spend money and okay the last thing i will bore you with for these side notes is i do do a lot of investing and saving i'm not including that in this video as i'm not a financial advisor you know that's a whole other topic that if you're interested in let me know if you're interested in investing but for this video this is purely just what i spent in a week okay if you're still with me let's get started okay i just got to pilates pilates is around 25 per class which sounds insane when you say it out loud but honestly if you're going to any workout class here in toronto that's pretty much average if not even i would say low at this point compared to a lot of places so i don't do pilates every day but i definitely do it about two to three times a week and then i do other workouts at home i know i could just do all my workouts at home for free but there is something about as someone who works from home and is at home a lot because i work at home okay i think i've said home like 20 times in that sentence about getting out of the house throughout the day just to from mental health and working out for me is a huge one okay just finished pilates oh my gosh it's so sunny that was a really good workout i think i'm gonna go well i know i'm going back home now oh i didn't include parking parking for this was for an hour was four dollars and i'm not even right downtown toronto i mean i'm close like very close but not even right downtown so four dollars for an hour i don't know if that's good or bad but it's a reality okay so i went to shoppers got the highlighters so basically we had bread let's let's rewind a little bit after i finished pilates i had breakfast at home it was eggs and some veggies so made that at home and then really had been at home working the entire day and then paul needed paul's doing like a work from home day two he usually is in meetings and out and about but today he's home and he realized he needed highlighters and i also wanted to go to the house and get some errands some groceries so i decided to go get them for him the highlighters were the highlighters highlighters were 4 73 then i had to get a pepper a green pepper a onion and some sour cream we're going to do like mexican bowls tonight and that came to 721 and i think please use i mean the green pepper alone was two dollar'8 sour cream is 2.99 and then there's also let me share i'll show you so there is that for the day 7 21. we have all the rest of the ingredients at home yeah also i know i'm wearing this is really bad you saw my shoes and socks and like this massive over this is called working from home the true working from home okay today is tuesday last night for dinner i'm here with paul by the way last night for dinner we by the way last night for dinner we made dinner at home with some of the groceries that i told you i picked up made like a mexican style bowl so stayed in to eat last night and now we are getting gas for my vehicle one of our vehicles anyways and what's this video called the first time getting groceries no it's i'm doing i'm doing a video where i go through what i spend in a day you're not allowed to watch this video oh for first time getting groceries it should be cold second i did it twice in my life okay but no we're getting getting gas right now the tank is almost empty i would say so [music] okay what is the total we get premium in this vehicle let's see 141 141 that's good thanks brother [music] [music] [music] okay after the grocery store on tuesday we basically went home had some charcuterie then had some friends over for dinner i didn't capture it on camera but essentially we ate what some of the food not all of the food that we bought at the grocery store so other than the grocery store we didn't spend any money on tuesday okay wednesday was a very painful day for spending because how it started wednesday started by going to get coffee which was 375 for a cup of coffee insane i know and then it was followed by paul and i we ended up going for brunch we went to this really cute spot and the total for brunch was i wrote it down here it was 42 37 insane i know i feel like i'm always saying that but the kicker is the kicker is we got a ticket that was unwarranted so we ended up parking and i have it right here actually i don't have my personal information no i'm not [music] no it's not okay we got a ticket the ticket was for 30 and it was it's ridiculous because the thing is we parked we paid but paul we paid through an app so paul put in the time and it was a time span of about one minute we can see from the phone app to the time on the violation the ticket and what happened was by the time it loaded the payment loaded a ticket person had already come around so we must have been leaving to go the restaurant and the ticket person would come it's ridiculous so then we're like why don't we just go online and fight it you know like see what that is but the problem with that is it costs 15 to put in a complaint or whatever it's called to fight it so that's half of what the ticket is right there then you have to book and wait to go on for a zoom meeting to contest or to fight the ticket so at the end of the day is the extra 15 really worth my time like what is my time worth what through doing all that so i did end up paying it which went on to wednesday's bill as well wednesday for dinner though we ended up having leftovers and staying in and watching game of thrones we are hooked on game of thrones really late to the party here but yeah so we've been binge watching it okay i know i said i'd be honest in this video oh but it's hard but i'm going to be because it's so embarrassing so today is thursday and i had breakfast at home i was doing emails doing ketchup stuff as a reminder i'm not fully working until next week so it's a little bit slower for me this week but i need to get my nails done i get my nails done probably probably once every month maybe every five weeks no we're being honest it's it's once a month and it's around i believe with tip like everything included it's around seventy dollars i'll confirm that one there i should know this but i think it's around sixty five 65-70 anyway so that's once a month we're going to get the nails done but i'm like still kind of hungry so i ordered a smoothie and a coffee and like this is not cheap i'm telling you eating out is not cheap you spend you will blow all your money eating out if you're not careful so anyways i will show you the total here in a second okay so i told you i got a smoothie and i got an americano and i'm not gonna lie i'm kind of horrified to show you the price for this the price for this for the two things was okay well i don't think you can see what i'll tell you it's 23.22 that's insane for a smoothie and a coffee it's because it's like this place that's all like natural organic the smoothies like i don't know made of magic apparently anyways it's not a constant it's not a normal thing for me but here we are okay let's go spend more money get the nails done okay thursday as you've seen was already off to a rocky start but it got really rocky at the end i'm gonna share this with you even though it wasn't an expense out of my pocket or paul's pocket for example but we ended up going for dinner to one of the nicest restaurants in toronto called canoe and it was ourselves and another couple so a total of four people they treated us for dinner and i just wanted to share this with you i'll share some clips here of it it's this beautiful restaurant we had appetizers main courses dessert some people were drinking i wasn't drinking but there was a lot involved in the night and it was a really wonderful night but with that and with fine dining comes a cost and as you can see from the photos it's beautiful there but the cost for the dinner was just under 800 and yes i know it's crazy but i just wanted to share it with you because it's kind of fascinating to me the world of fine dining and how it really is about an experience so this does not count towards my total spendings i didn't buy dinner they treated us but i just wanted to share that with you as well what it could have been like okay all right the lighting is terrible here but it's okay we're on our way for dinner paul and i paul's running a bit late so i'm going to meet the driver downstairs okay so driver which is uber is 52 it's an uber black we are not driving tonight i'm actually not drinking tonight but we're not driving tonight just because traveling is going to be a nightmare so that is the next expense here should be my outfit you got skirt a little top on these shoes italy [music] [music] thank you [music] it's so embarrassing to film in public i feel like as the week went on i got worse and worse with filming so i apologize but you get to hear me talk so it's good or is that bad i don't know but friday friday every friday we have a house cleaner come it is something that we think is worth the investment because it saves me time paul time it helps i work from home so having a clean house that is organized really helps me focus and be in a good mental state so the house cleaner is 135 per week and that is something that is just kind of built into our monthly budget so friday i spent 1 35 most of the day was at home because i was working and just getting ready for the next week and then i did have to pay our phone bill i have it on my phone it's myself and paul's just because i use more data than he does fun fact about canadian data providers or cell phone providers there is so little competition i think there's three maybe four total providers throughout canada i mean in the states there's hundreds and because there is so little competition they charge you insane prices for data to use your phone so our phone bill for two people for one month was 300 now before you go what the heck tiffany why do you even live in canada this actually was incorrect so i spent part of the day on the phone with them saying this is an incorrect phone bill because usually for two people it's around 120 and the reason it was so high is because someone at the company that were that we use for our cell provider changed paul's plan that there was no unlimited long distance so he was calling he calls a lot does a lot of business with the states and he was calling the states and getting charged like i think it was 70 cents a minute or something like crazy so anyways after speaking with the phone providers for what felt like hours actually probably was an hour they ended up agreeing with us or you know to whatever degree and they will reduce it but right now the phone call is 300 and it will get down to 120. so i'm going to wait to pay it until it gets down but yeah that's a crazy fact about canada is the lack of data or service providers really allows the existing ones to just charge you a lot of money okay that is the total i spent in a week and as i mentioned it really can vary some weeks are way higher some weeks are way lower this is just what it is toronto is a very big city it's very expensive and i love it here but yeah anyways let me know if you have any questions comments leave them down in in the comments and if you haven't already make sure to hit that button for more tech coding career videos and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [music] you
