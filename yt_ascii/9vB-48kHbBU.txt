- we built a lego house
using 1 million legos, i think. somewhere around there. a little bit of the house fell off, and if you're wondering what happened, this happened. so i have this lego house, but it's empty. so we're gonna build some
furniture to put in my new house, then i'm gonna live in it for a day and then we're gonna hit
it with the car at the end. whoa! so the first thing we need to
do is build some furniture. and everyone knows the staple
of furniture is a toilet, 'cause i have to poop. - can i throw my poop? - sure, chandler. as
long as it's at garrett. - what?
- all right. let's build a toilet. garrett, you're not
invited to my mario party. - what mario party? - yeah, 'cause you're luigi. - yeah, no. he's waluigi. - ew. - you forgot the most important part - what?
- you gotta run your pipe. all right, here you go. gotta put your plumbing like this. there you go. now it is plugged in. - that's for the water but now we need something to,
like, dispose of the poop. first off, let's put our handle on it. there... there's our handle. toilet's done. - there you go, there's
your poop and pee hole. - is that a dead fish? oh, my god. - you want a goldfish? - i'm watching you. - i would never do that. - how long has that been there? - probably like four weeks. i don't know. - why did that not cross my mind that that had been sitting on the floor for like a whole month? the next most important thing
in any household is a tv. - all right. - 'cause without a tv, how are
you gonna watch our videos? - look, there's one playing now. - no, that's a bad one. i like that one. - that one's a good one.
- yeah. whoa, that's our merch store.
you should go buy some. all right, guys. we have our
lego tv, playing minecraft. there we go. what do you think? how
do you think it looks? - looks pretty good. don't you need somewhere to sleep? - i do need somewhere to sleep. - so we should build a bed, right? - yeah, let's build a bed. all right, i got my handy-dandy bed. hand it on through. this is actually the way
you're supposed to put a bed in any house. all right, guys. i have a bed right here. as you can see, it's pretty comfy. what else am i missing? should i build a desk? - yeah, you need a desk for your... - i think i do need a desk. i think the tv should go on a desk. viewers, do you guys see
these things right here? it would take forever to
build a desk outta them. - they're puny. - see this in my hand? watch what happens. it grew big. - oh my goodness.
- yes. - video games are real.
- yeah. dude, watch. see these two? in the words of kanye, "that was very cool." - wow. - aboard, aboard, aboard, aboard. - putting it down. all right. dude, there you go. - how do you like our tv stand? it's perfect for watching mrbeast videos. i got chris another present. he's really gonna enjoy this. hey, chris-
- hey, get out, man. - whoa, whoa.
- i'm pooping! - dude, dude. are you done? - hold on. all right, i'm done. - you're done?
- i'm done. - i brought you a present. - oh, that's beautiful. t-series is nothing but a
child compared to pewdiepie. - well, actually that's
saying t-series is stupid, like a child. - oh, 'cause children are stupid. - and so is t-series. - i'm gonna put this right here. you did very good. i'm very proud of you. - are you? thank you. - that's this right there. - there's no rug! i can't go into my million
dollar mansion with dirty shoes. chris, let's go buy a
rug. let's go to walmart. we'll be right back. chris.
- what's up, man? - to be honest, it's been a long time since we rode in this lego car. - it's been, like, what,
three months maybe? - oh, nope. make it, make it, make it. all right, guys, and as you can see, we are here at walmart. just gonna throw her right
in this parking space. did you lock it, chris? - yeah, it's locked. - wait, let me just make sure.
- all right. [mrbeast] yeah, it's locked. chris, pick a number between 1 and 30. - ah, six. - i don't really care what you think. i hope the lego car's still there. it was probably stolen
while we were shopping. we got our rug. and then we got some snacks 'cause i'm living in the house for a day. - if somebody heard you say, "i'm living in the house for a day," they'd be like, "wow, poor guy." - huzzah! i guarantee you, when we
get back to the lego house, at least something's gonna be missing. - it's lit up.
- oh my goodness. dude, the lego house looks
so much better at night. - you know what it looks like? it looks like a big ol' spaceship. - and if you're wondering where our stuff- - the fortnite cube. - yo, that is our... that's it. can we have a large pepperoni pizza and a large cheese pizza? - yep. anything else? - and can you make sure you deliver it to the lego house in the backyard? - okay, it should be there
in the next 45 minutes. - awesome. thank you. - hey, have you ever delivered a pizza to a lego house before? - never, i don't... this is cool. are they like actual little legos? - jimmy. jimmy, where are you? - what's up? we're here in my lego house. - oh, hey. yo, dude.
- come over here, man. - i didn't know you had a lego house. - first off, who are you
and how'd you find this? second of all...
- why are you stalking? - isn't this the most lit party ever? - well, i'm garrett and i
think i should know you, but, i mean... - yeah? - i guess i don't know
about this lego house that you have here.
- oh, apparently, garrett doesn't know how
to play along with skits. - i guess not. - honestly, guys, i had a
lot of fun playing games but i know you guys gotta go to bed, so i'll see you later. - see you, man. we gotta film tomorrow.
- see you, man. - yep. - oh, wait. you look
like you're kind of cold. do you need a blanket? - i mean, i could use one. - nice little eagles blanket. - all right, guys. i'm gonna head to bed. i'll see you tomorrow. do you think i'll get a
good night's sleep here? - definitely. night, night, jimmy!
- night. - it started raining last night and i had to bail on my house. and before i can recommend
a lego house to you guys, i need to make sure it can
stand up to all the elements. so we're gonna see how it
holds up to earthquakes, a hurricane, a 50 cal, everything. we're gonna test it for you guys, so if you, one day, buy a lego house, you know you'll be 100% safe, 'cause safety is our priority. being a youtuber means lots
of fans come to your house. one thing i don't like
about the lego house is that it really stands out. and if you're a youtuber like me, it can bring a lot of fans to it. like, literally, i've
been living here one day and there's already fans outside. like, seriously, how did
they find my house so quick? it's literally been a day. us people that live on the east coast recently got hit by a hurricane. so i wanna see how this
house holds up to a tree, because if you get hit by hurricane a tree might fall in your house and i don't know if a lego house is more durable than a real house. all right, guys. drop the tree. it withstood a tree. - broke the tree before
it broke the house. - now we're gonna see if this lego house can withstand a 50 cal. fire, chris. - all right, you ready? - yes, sir. - wow.
- wow. it's a little bit of bowing, but looks fine. - tastes fine. tastes good. - that tastes good.
- chand, you wanna taste it? does it taste like gushers? - tastes like gushers. - all right, guys. chandler asked if he could throw his poop, as you remember, in the circle video. any other questions? - can i throw my poop? - he wanted to throw his poop. chandler, now is your
time to throw your poop. go ahead, man.
- my time to shine. - go hit it. - look at the stick on that. - dude, i think you're dehydrated. - that's chandler's poop, all right. - chand, you got poop on the 50 cal. my mom never let me
play basketball inside. oh, man. the lego lamp. is this why my mom wouldn't
let me play inside? now, we're gonna see if the
house is fortnite-proof. would you say that's fortnite-proof? - hmm, honestly, it withstood pretty well. the structural integrity... - what are you doing-
- chris! - it is fortnite-proof. now, let's see if it's minecraft-proof. - chris.
- chris, again? - yeah, guys. come on. - dude, this is funny. we should play a game, "how many times can you hit
it until it all falls apart?" - oh, that was a hefty one. - i'll come in right after.
- all right, come on in. - chandler, man. we're having fun. come on in. dude, that's not the door.
the door's right there. - this is the door. come on through. - hey, guys. - hello.
- hey. hi. all right, guys. now we're gonna see if this
house is earthquake-proof because we get a lot of them around here, so let's see. hey, earthquake time. - earthquake. - this thing is really springy. - here. - no!
- oh, are you okay? - oh, my god. you went through the floor. - my feet. - cameraman down. - all right, one thing, i'm glad we did this test. we did not equate for the floor, we were only equating for the walls. - yeah, see. look, the walls are fine. - that's pretty fine
to me, just the floor. all right, there we go. problem solved.
- problem solved. - next, we're gonna test
the security at my house. i hired a professional
burglar to try to break in. as you can see, we have a
state-of-the-art keypad here that the burglar does
not know the code to. and watch what happens if he goes in without the code
- warning, warning, warning, warning, warning,
warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. - get outta my face, boy.
- warning. - and there you go, that
is the chandler 2000, deters robbers by yelling
"warning!" in their face. the viewers are trying to
break into my house, chandler. - warning, warning, warning, warning. - you can buy your own
chandler at shopmrbeast.com. - disclaimer, we do not have chandlers but you can get a good shirt like this. - hey, take your clothes
off. what are you doing? what are you doing? - stop, mrbeast.
- no, stop there. you can keep the pants on.
- oh, my bad. but chandler, you should
take your pants... no, i'm kidding. nice strike! - oh, wow. it really did. it went all the way through. - actually, chris, here you go. i'm gonna need you to kick
it to confirm that's a hole. - i got one better for you. - it is a hole.
- wait, hold up. is that your butt? - that is my butt. - and that's your head?
- that's my head. - that's a hole.
- all right. - my house is always getting egg. so if i'm gonna live in this lego house it better be egg-proof. - yeah.
- all right. throw an egg at the bottom. let's see if it's egg-proof. no, that's the top, chris. the bottom... that's the bottom. darn it. i thought it would be egg-proof. i, like many other people, forget to take my car out of reverse. so now we wanna see if
someone driving a lego car, in reverse, accidentally
hits my lego house, will it destroy my lego house? because if a house is not
reverse-proof, is it a house? thought so. - oh, no. i left my car in reverse. oh, geez.
- oh, man. - oh, no. kowalski, analysis. - oh, we hit your bed.
- the house is lego-proof. - it is lego car-proof. - here, let's just make here.
- let's test it one more time. kowalski, another analysis. - your bed is leaking out of the house. - it is?
- yeah. - do you think hitting it again
will fix my bed, kowalski? - yeah, i think that did it. it sounds like your
house is lego car-proof. - hey, let's hit it from the front. so we hit it from the back, now we gotta hit it from the front. - whoa.
- whoa. - kowalski, we need another analysis. can you confirm, kowalski.
is this destruction? - we broke a board in it. - whoa. - hey, i just wanted to
confirm. is your house broken? all right, come on in. just come on in. come right through, come in. i need some more... - you know what, is
there a damage in here? - there is a little. the
minecraft tv is okay, though. - wait, let me see. no, my creeper! wait a minute, this looks fine. this has a little bit of egg. - yeah. that's stuck on there. - that's it, this is it. - no.
- okay. the house looks intact. - yeah. we'll buff it out. - i have a very special
announcement to make. one of you guys who followed
my instagram, mrbeast, will get this house. isn't that exciting? all you have to do to enter is go to mrbeast on
instagram, check it out. we're gonna post lots of photos, maybe even behind-the-scenes
content of this video. go to shopmrbeast.com because lots of my videos
are getting copyright-claimed and we could use the money. so, wait a minute, did we just spend an
entire month building this, this was over a million legos, just to tear it down, guys? - yeah.
- yeah. - yeah.
- sure did. - why? - good content.
- yeah. you got house insurance, right? - yeah, yeah.
- no, are you serious? [music] mrbeast6000, oh [music] [music] mrbeast6000, oh [music] [music] mrbeast6000, yeah, you know his name [music] [music] he changed it once or twice [music] [music] but i think [music] [music] it's here to stay [music]
