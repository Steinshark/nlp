hey what's up guys i'm kv hd here so ces is always a pretty all over the place usually pretty wild show this year i actually think was better than most there's a lot of interesting stuff floating around i walked around on the show floor for many many hours saw a bunch of stuff playing cameras at it so you don't have to this is the best of what i saw so a lot of people have asked me what was the best part was the best thing at this year's show and to those people i've been saying the sony car which i think was the biggest surprise that no one saw coming so i'll start there so sony had a car in their booth and hot take i think it looks better than almost every other electric car or any other car out there and better than a lot of the cars on the streets today but before we get too excited no this is not a car that they plan on shipping or letting real people buy and drive at least right now what they've done here really is put together a one-off prototype car that's a demonstration of all the different technologies sony makes that they feel they're kind of already in the automotive business so you see sony does a lot of stuff they make camera sensors and their sony alpha cameras so this car has rear facing cameras instead of rearview mirrors there is radar and lidar sensors which are all needed for self-driving computer systems and the interior that i didn't get to play with had a massive display and a ui that also all seemed to work fairly well which makes sense because sony also makes computers and smart phones too then the rest of the car stuff like brakes and tires and things like that they had help from a company called magna to build it out and that's how they ended up with a fully functioning working car so i asked about specs and i was told quad motors 0-60 in 4.6 seconds and a top speed of 149 miles an hour not that these specs actually matter because you can't actually get one but i was really most impressed by the design and that's why i want it to be so real it had some tesla and some porsche lions like a nice hybrid between the two of them the whole thing was this satin silver so no ugly glossy paint with fingerprints or anything like that and it also helps that it was lit really well so yes only came to ces people were expecting maybe at ps 5 but they would be silly to waste a ps 5 announcement at ces so we got a car you know what might have caused even more confusion to me though samsung's new phones so for the first time they actually showed in their booth what i mentioned in the last video the samsung galaxy note 10.1 galaxy s 10 light now since we already have galaxy s 10a i was confused so i asked the samsung reps that were at the booth are these flagships and their answer was well no these are light flagships so take that for what it's worth so these phones both have a 6.7 inch 1080p flat oled displays with the selfie camera cut out in the top middle they both have 4500 milliamp hour batteries but no wireless charging and they run a snapdragon a 55 in the s10 light and a similar exynos 9810 in the note 10 light and they both have this new rectangular camera bump on the back that we're expecting as a design in the new flagships in a couple weeks although the camera situations are slightly different on each of them the note 10 light has 3 12 megapixel cameras a wide a 2x telephoto and an ultra wide simple enough but then the s10 light has a 48 megapixel main camera with super steady shot video then a 12 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel macro camera and then note 10 light also adds the stylus of course and a headphone jack but it's the only one not coming to the united states so why exactly do these phones now exist like i guess you could ask that about a lot of things that's ces but to me it's confusing because samsung already has some pretty great mid-range phones in their lineup like the a 51 and the a 71 but either way these will slot in around i've been told the $650 range and they'll tide us over until we do get that galaxy s 20 and galaxy fold to then oneplus showed a concept phone at ces the oneplus concept one with electrochromatic tinting glass on the back of the phone that can both hide the ugly camera bumps of the future and act as nd neutral density filters for photos and videos i did an entire separate video on this concept phone so if you want to check that out link right below that like button it's a good one and they brought to ces an entire piano made of 1 + 70 pros all smartphones [music] okay then i saw not just one but two different rotating tvs on the show floor at ces this year one from tcl with these rounded corners to match a typical smartphone display and one from samsung called the samsung cerro basically the idea here is we do so much streaming and content viewing from our smartphone that we might as well have our tvs rotate between portrait and landscape to appropriately frame the content we're watching without black bars depending on your smartphone orientation which i guess makes sense or we could just stop shooting so much vertical video anyway i also saw i stopped by the bosch booth quickly where also it was treated to a pretty interesting surprise which was an led activated sun visor for a car basically this entire rig is just a camera somewhere in the front of a car doing face tracking and then the clear panel in front of your face will block out the sun but still leave other areas you need to see like the road and the traffic light you're stopped at things like that and it worked pretty well not perfectly but it kept my face and eyes shaded tracked which was cool and then i could see other things okay cars so there were a lot of cars just like there are at every ces and there was one pretty wild mercedes one that i wanted to see but i didn't but that was apparently out in the streets and driving around it didn't even really look street-legal or real i fully didn't expect this to be a real car but i did see two real electric cars that i think coming up are gonna be while probably pretty interesting autofocus episodes so the ford mustang mach ii is one of them so the electric suv mustang it was there and i gotta say i'm not a mustang person obviously but this one here in the blue did look better in person than a lot of the mackey's i've seen in videos and photos it's a pretty normal size like a honda crv type of crossover size and it has a lot of cameras all over the place a lot of sensors but overall looks prefinished look pretty complete here i'm rooting for it though i'm glad for it is making this move now right now it's scheduled for 2021 so there is some waiting to do and it'll probably be at ces again next year before it even comes out but yeah the forward mustang mach ii was there and then so was the rivey n' r1t pickup truck also in blue and i was also sitting in their booth looking pretty complete as well and this one's scheduled to come out this year 2020 and i was told by them they want to start hitting the road with these around summer and delivering them to buyers by this winter so this is another one of the more promising electric cars that's definitely coming out then there were a lot of robots at ces but still again none of them were quite as cool as the omron ping-pong playing robot that i got to rematch with this year so this year the giant ping pong instruction robot which is just a combination of on ron's technologies again used as a showcase but not actually for sale this one will not just keep track of how well you're hitting the ball back to the robot but also how your emotions factored in so there's new cameras and things keeping track of how much you smile versus how much you frown and it's sort of trying to sense if i get frustrated or unhappy with something and it'll do that less but still help me work on my game which i thought was hilarious and it was all shown on the display live as we were playing really fun stuff and then some other little things razor had a tomahawk mini pc where thanks to an intel nook compute unit and a special case and motherboard set up and tiny power supply the entire computer is really small it's the size of basically a large external gpu enclosure you could fit the whole thing in a shoebox if you wanted to fascinating but i don't see that being super useful to me it's still cool to see and then i tried a racing simulator in the razer booth that was essentially fully suspended off the ground with realistic steering wheel paddle shifters a gas on a brake in a clutch pedal and dual projectors for full immersion and the most immersive part for me was the seat belt pulling against my chest when i slammed against the brakes which was wild and then i'll say it looks like samsung did finally make a tv with no bezels and i don't just mean thin bezels i mean literally seems like this is just basically a hundred percent screen to body ratio no idea if they're actually going to be able to ship this one or not but if they do i'm here for it i really want it so overall ces takeaways for me this year were number one 4k is still on the rise and it's not everywhere yet and 8k is now that new stretch i will say electric cars are coming and they're coming up quick and you can put alexa in pretty much anything ces is still fun and it's still home to all the craziest wildest gadgets in the world for a week in las vegas and i'm glad we made it out here hopefully enjoy the video thanks for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one pace
