[music] the pain is constant like the rain in this city i bought the dip but the dip dipped the name's coffeezilla and my biggest secret sometimes i wonder if the only bottom we're gonna find is at the bottom of a glass that's it i'm cutting you off wait why i've only had four or five drinks it's not about the drinks every time you start doing this narrator thing it's nothing but trouble not even my bartender understands my brooding anymore you're doing it again somehow maxwell can hear my narration which is strange that's because you have a tape recorder right there what oh look coffee i'll play bartender one more time but you've got to pick yourself up after this i mean what's this all about i just don't even see the point markets are down inflation's up i've got nothing but bad news what's the rush to do another depressing story wow that is so selfish it's all about you isn't it do you ever think of the people out there who subscribe to you or they're counting on me no i was thinking more that they're mildly entertained by you oh that's the pep talk i mild entertainment exactly you're getting it but what you're not getting is drinks i'm cutting you off for your own good at least until you do another case wait a second that that's not how you want to play this right i mean look i'll do another case for you but what about this story breaking news ladies and gentlemen maxwell the bartender is scamming customers not unless you want people to learn about how you actually afforded that 10 million dollar studio i mean an actual case like the three euros capital story all right all right we don't have to go there and wait three rows capital are you talking about that hedge fund that blew up last month billion dollar hedge fund and now they're on the run you're kidding i thought they gave themselves up nope no one has seen them for days and you know who that looks like a job for yup the police i was thinking more of mildly entertaining detective oh they didn't answer your calls huh no they screen robocallers all right you know what i'll do it strange as it is that's how the hunt for 3ac started we start our story in singapore at the front door of their office and no one's home as you can see mail's been collecting from all the creditors that have been appearing trying to get their money and crucially the founders suzu and kyle davies of three arrows capital are nowhere to be found which if you ask me is pretty good timing because they just went bankrupt they now owe people hundreds of millions to billions of dollars but here's the thing it wasn't always like this only months ago these guys were the golden boys of crypto hell 10 years ago nobody even knew who these guys were they were just a couple of traders in tokyo working at credit suisse so how did they go from that and transform themselves into one of the world's largest crypto hedge funds and then destroy it all in only a couple of months well today we're going to find out [music] it was 10 years ago that the founders of three euros capital decided they were tired of making money for someone else and quit their jobs to start their own hedge fund they claim to have mostly used their own capital to start you know a modest sum so we started with around a million of personal capital and almost immediately they were very successful despite not having enough money to play in the big leagues that they wanted to get to they weren't worried three euros capital was confident in two things their ability to make money and their ability to borrow it if they couldn't make it yeah we had one period where we had we need we desperately needed to raise capital it was prime brokers and basically one day they came to us and said you need to have almost twice as much money as you have and my mentality at the time was well just give me like two months we i think we made 100 return our first like month and a half like give me two more months i'll make it for you and they were like no in two weeks you have to have that money or close your account and so i had to get on the phone i raised it in a weekend but i had to get on the phone i called prop trading firms in chicago and i got one two wires funds by monday and this attitude of pure confidence you know either i can make you a hundred percent in two months or i can go borrow it on a weekend that was just kind of how they operated and this attitude might sound arrogant but because they were winning it was honestly kind of contagious and earned them quite the reputation they became really popular for their super bullish attitudes and became popular for promoting something called the super cycle in crypto the super cycle was an idea pushed by their founder suzu who believed that unlike most markets which go through periods of boom and bust bull and bear markets crypto was different they were on the verge of mass adoption and because of that crypto wasn't going to go through a bear market again he says in a tweet explaining it this is not yet another cycle it is the end of cycles the one where after bitcoin flippings gold it doesn't flip back the one where web 3 supersedes web 2. and he would publicly say that he had tremendous conviction in this idea that things were only going to go up and thought anyone who had low conviction was quote gross to be honest so i want you to ask yourself what would you do if you're on a hot streak of trades you're not afraid to borrow money and you're convicted that the number's just gonna go up well you might do what three euros capital did which was borrow as much money as you can and dump it into bullish crypto place you know the michael sailor idea go mortgage your house and buy bitcoin with it only they didn't do that because mortgaging your house is for poor people but they did something a little more clever three arrows capital went to all of the biggest crypto lenders in town from celsius to voyager and more you know the people we've been hearing about lately and they told them all hey you guys know us we're successful traders we're low risk and we need a loan it's sort of the equivalent of going all around town and getting as many credit cards as you can and maxing them all out and by the end three euros capital had borrowed from 33 different lenders a total of not one not two but 3.5 billion dollars and of course the question is what are they going to do with it well they made one of the biggest bets of their entire life they were going super long on the super cycle theory except this time turns out they were wrong crypto or digital currencies have now lost two trillion dollars in value holy crap i literally just got wiped out the most destructive wealth event in the history of crypto with probably about 50 billion dollars just wiped out i think this is like a cascading effect right and i don't think it's honestly over yet when the crypto markets crashed in may of 2022 this led to a massive crisis for three euros capital because all of a sudden they weren't the prophets that they thought they were they didn't see it coming kyle davies says this in an interview the tara luna situation caught them very off guard and their lenders noticed all of a sudden they start approaching them saying hey we're a little worried here can you get us our money back and kyle davies tried to reassure them he sent them a paper saying they had the money i mean it wasn't exactly a proof or anything it was a one-page document that says they had a net asset value of 2.3 billion dollars which isn't much proof at all and this was on may 13th and it bought them about five days before someone realized that you can just make up numbers on papers and send it to people and so on may'th some of their creditors approached them again this time blockchain.com they called kyle up and said hey well maybe you can give us some of our money back and allegedly kyle told blockchain.com that if they recalled any of their loans three euros capital would boycott all their products basically threatening them because of this blockchain.com decided to give them a longer time to repay fast forward another month kyle's trying to borrow 5000 bitcoin from one lender to try to pay a margin call to another lender except he doesn't get it and it's at this point that kyle finally starts admitting to some of the lenders that if crypto markets keep declining they wouldn't be okay so naturally what do all these lenders do well they panic and try to get their money out but this time is different instead of picking up the phone as usual with their confident responses of oh we have the money or if we don't have the money we're going to double our money in two months anyways there's no answer at all instead all they get is this a tweet from suzu we are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and are fully committed to working this out but the insiders knew this wasn't true torreira's capital wasn't in touch with anyone it was like they had vanished off the face of the earth one of their close associates said they had ghosted people and because of this these lenders who now are left with 3.5 billion dollars missing now started to collapse themselves and have their own problems we've already talked about this with voyager and celsius just to name a few and their last hope is to figure out where in the world these guys are with all of their money and they could truly be anywhere because as they declared bankruptcy rumors started to come out that maybe three arrows capital had been a little naughty with their money according to reports the duo had bought a series of mansions and a 50 million dollar super yacht which according to a signed affidavit this yacht was intended to be larger than any yacht owned by any singapore billionaire which is a strange flex coming from guys who now weren't billionaires and since i know you're probably curious what a 50 million dollar super yacht looks like if you're okay with it we'll take a tour of it as i explain what happens next so if you just come aboard for a second the 52 steel san lorenzo you get 52 meters of stunning views and swimming pools which is all allegedly purchased with borrowed money top it all off with stunning dining rooms a full gym but in my opinion the main attraction here is this 2019 tweet from their new owner suzu climate change talk is cheap but sailing the seven seas on your yacht as an international fugitive is expensive it's almost like he was dropping hints the whole time but like i said we don't even know if he's on this yacht as an international fugitive or if he's in one of his other super mansions because let's not forget when he wasn't on this yacht he was busy living in a multi-million dollar bungalow that his three-year-old owned which i guess i haven't explained yet suzu is the father of a multi-millionaire baby this is all because there's a trust in his name that owns their multi-million dollar bungalow but obviously suzu bought this house in the three-year-old's name so why do it this way well speculation says that bankruptcy courts probably can't get access to it if it's in a trust and that's not all three euros capital has hired lawyers that have been allegedly advising them on how to help shield those assets from creditors according to the signed affidavit which combined with the fact that nobody knows where these guys are things are looking pretty dim and all of this is just so sad in my opinion not just because they might get away with it but because all this money that they owe isn't just a number on a screen billions of dollars whatever it's really the bill that's coming due for regular investors all due to the arrogance of two traitors and the carelessness of these lending platforms who gave it to them because let's not get it twisted suzu and kyle davies were initially playing with their own money before all these crypto lenders gave them a bunch more of it so it's not as if there's only one bad guy here i mean how could these lenders not do more due diligence on the people they're lending customer money to i mean kyle davies was literally sending one page pdfs that said that they had 2.3 billion dollars and people just believed him so that's on the one hand the crypto lenders are at fault but of course on the other hand it's pretty clear that three arrows capital wasn't honest with the lenders either and i could do the whole pitch for regulation here but i'm kind of sick of doing that because you guys know that the real truth of it though is the ones that are actually going to pay for all this pay for these yachts are the regular investors who put their hard-earned money into these lending platforms that now are bankrupt but even in the best case scenario if they cooperate i guarantee the real winners are going to be the lawyers and suzu and kyle davies were already trying to make claims against their own company that they are owed money anyways that's basically the three euros capital story case closed well that's one down thousands more to go but strangely enough i feel different maybe maxwell was right about needing to work again or maybe it's just because the sun's coming out either way things are looking a bit brighter
