on tuesday eight brooklyn individuals were charged with multi-million dollar covid19 relief fraud by obtaining two million dollars in fraudulent unemployment benefits and they couldn't stop flexing about it i mean look i know it's tempting to flex on instagram but yeah if you're gonna commit fraud you have to stop ladies and gentlemen i'm doing you a solid here i gotta tell you guys i'm not trying to help scammers but come on we need a we need a better classic criminal here this town deserves a better class let's go to the board here right ladies and gentlemen welcome to godzilla home of the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host and today we're doing the thing guys we're going to talk about this fraud case absolutely insane of course you can see here that eight brooklyn individuals were charged with multi-million dollar coven 19 relief fraud we talked about that when you actually go into the specifics it was an unemployment scheme so as many of you know the cares act was in was passed because they wanted to give people extended or you know expanded unemployment relief they were able to submit false unemployment claims to get money from a government that was frankly overwhelmed but for some people like brian abraham carlos vasquez angel cabrera our manny miller all these guys it became more than a simple way to make a couple thousand it became a way to make an entire fortune by taking other people's information and submitting fake unemployment claims on their behalf the scheme turned into not only you know just trying to extend your own unemployment benefits it became an entire scheme to make millions so here's how the fraud worked there are two primary methods for filing for unemployment in new york state to make a claim the claimant was required to provide certain information including the claimant's name date of birth social security number and employment information if the claim was accepted the claimant was also required to establish on a weekly basis his or her continued eligibility for unemployment benefits the claimant would then complete this re-certification by answering a series of questions again online or by telephone so this is what these guys did according to the doj they submitted claims on other people's behalf made calls on other people's behalf and made a ton of money from it by loading up debit cards in other people's name and then they would go withdraw from atms but here's where these guys went wrong they fell for the number one trap of instagram which is seems to be trying to flex to all your friends and family with the money you're supposedly making but the problem is the money they were making was from fraud and so these people started to post to social media carrying stacks of cash fanning out cash and this is allegedly it is the money they made from fraudulent unemployment claims i mean i can't imagine a more scummy thing to do to take from honest people who are really looking for unemployment and really can't get a job instead you're flashing cash standing in front of cars flipping the bird i guess look let me say right up front i don't want to give these people too hard of a time i mean i looked at their age they're' to like 22 25 and yes that's old enough to where you should know better but they're also young enough to where this could be an honest mistake that haunts them for the rest of their life and it is very sad to think that they may have thrown away their lives for something so small and i do hope that they bounce back from this this is such a disease this clout chasing i mean number one they probably did it because they wanted a ton of money and they thought it was a funny scheme but then you're flexing online like you're a baller to try to be something you're not and in order to support that lifestyle you have to steal more money i mean like look at this guy this bro the problem also is like when a jury sees this you're done look just word to the wise no jury looks fondly on you flashing the cash of your fraud i mean it just doesn't work like already if you commit fraud you're they're probably going to go with the defense of like they were kids they didn't know what they were doing blah blah blah but then when the prosecutor shows you just flashing cash it's a bad look it it is i'm i'm sorry but it really is and you know i find it unbelievable that we still are seeing these things go on i told you guys last time we had a ppp chronicles episode where somebody they they were bragging on facebook about the new house they bought with their proceeds what is up with this epidemic of people bragging about stolen funds on social media why do you keep doing it stop it for your sake it's just not even for me i laugh at it i think it's funny but for you guys i mean i'm like come on what are you doing you're doing the old like hold the money to your phone like ring ring you're going to jail what are you doing what's the money saying to you right now bud why i just think it look i really do think when i'm looking at these ages''' 19 20 25 i'm it's like this is tragically young to be committing this kind of fraud and you know it does just make me sad it makes me sad for him two of the people armani miller and johann santos are still remain at large apparently they haven't caught them yet but six of these guys have been arrested and the way they got arrested is pretty interesting they were caught on security footage from you know the the atms and so they were taking money from the atm and literally the security cameras just like caught them and so this is also part of the evidence against them besides the flexing on social media you've got photographs of them taking money from the atm of other people's unemployment right that they somehow got their information they applied for unemployment benefits in their name and then they're taking that money from capital one bank supposedly to use it and to flex guys i hope it was worth it you clout chased your way to jail for the rest of you don't do it please stop okay and i mean i don't know what people were thinking that like you could submit a bunch of false documents and no one would ever find out i mean don't forget you had to make phone calls in these people's name and so these people apparently according to the doj's report here carlos vasquez for example they used their cell phone numbers as the third party's phone number and so when they were calling weekly about unemployment it sounds like that these claims were made like in the same guy's voice over and over so imagine you're an unemployment office going down your list and like 12 of the guys sound like the same guy because it is it's literally the same guy making the same answer every time oh yeah still unemployed terrible you call the next guy same guy and you sound a little familiar no no no no man not it's hard times hard times a ridiculous scheme made even more ridiculous by the flexing don't do it anyways that's basically it that's all i wanted to say thanks for watching see you in the next one this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
