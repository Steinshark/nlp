in an interview in 2015 apples marketing director revealed what we call the grand theory of apple he said that the job of the watch was to not need to pick up your iphone as often that the job at the iphone is said that you don't need to use an ipad for as long and that the job of the ipad is eventually to be so capable they'll never need to use a laptop each of these products is a computer and the hope is that one day the watch will be as capable as the mac is now the future is this movement towards smaller more seamless and more powerful technology just remember this idea i'm gonna come back to it so you've probably seen a headline like this how the smartphone will die in five years or how global smartphone sales are slumping but i would propose a different conclusion that in fact instead of all of that the smartphone market is evolving also massive shout out to surf shark vpn for sponsoring this video you only need to look at the sales charts to see that pretty much every company has falling mobile phone sales and there's a few reasons for it people are planning to hold on to their current mobile phone for longer than they used to you've got that pricing which is going up and up and we've just reached that kind of psychological barrier of $1000 for a phone which is making some people reevaluate and the third thing is iphones people who use iphones generally upgrade to iphones but because apple is slow to design in new phone designs and because iphones from five years ago are still getting the latest updates people are holding on to their iphones now for over three years as opposed to just two years on average before now here's the problem with this if smartphone sales continue to go down then a lot of these smartphone makers won't be able to remain profitable and so they're gonna have to leave the market the number of companies producing smartphones then goes down and you'll just get much less of that crazy exciting innovation that we're seeing now a lot of people are saying that it's all about to become very stale and very static now i wanted to start by not exactly debunking this but kind of reframing it the future is not as grim as this picture is painting it out to be and in fact is something to get really excited about here is a graph from 2018 that actually breaks down smartphone sales by segments it shows that actually whilst the sales of cheap phones were down by 10% and mid-range phones pretty much changed the sales of high-end $400 plus phones fyssas wholesale pricing by the way had rocketed up' percent and so whilst it was easy to just take the total figure of minus three percent and conclude that the market was declining all this is really saying is that consumers are shifting from buying cheaper phones to buying more expensive phones and so it's no surprise that they're keeping them for longer the usable lifespan of a flagship phone is going to be at least a year longer than your standard cheap throwaway phone you'll get updates for a longer period of time and performance that can keep up with applications years past their release so the point is yes phone sales are slowing down but a it's not as dramatic as a lot of people are making it out to be and be something bigger is happening the phone market is evolving right in front of us so let's take a quick look at what's next what comes after the glass break so i've got six predictions about the future of phones first up subscriptions will start to become crucial there's something that slowly crept into every part of our lives in the last 10 years whether it's spotify for music or netflix for tv and it is just starting to happen with mobile phones you might have heard of the iphone upgrade program you pay a monthly fee and apple basically makes sure that you're always on the latest iphone and you're always covered by apple care now we already know that iphone users are pretty loyal they'll generally buy an iphone and then keep buying iphones but this is the ultimate lock-in in this one move apple has made it so easy for its loyal customers to just pay a fee and never worry about their phone again they're going to worry about upgrading their phone they don't need to worry about transferring things between ios and android they don't need to worry ever again about breaking it they're completely covered and that is how apple is planning to sustain profits even when sales of these glass blocks globally are falling it'll mean that whilst the company is busy developing the true successor to the iphone the thing that's really going to replace it they don't need to worry too much about continually making really interesting really standout devices because their loyal customers are going to automatically be upgraded to whatever they produce ok now you're probably tired of hearing all about foldable devices and 5g but they are completely central to this whole thing remember how we talked about apple's grand theory the takeaway there was that smaller more seamless and more powerful technology will succeed well 5g takes us forward in that third element it makes your phone more powerful each new g whether it was 3g 4g now it's 5g has created a new baseline for what is possible every time we've seen this kind of leap in cellular data it's come with completely new applications that were not possible with the previous gen 3g allowed for video calling and freely using the internet on your mobile and 4g let people stream hd tv shows and play games online now that we've got 5g that opens up doors to things like virtual reality and augmented reality in a way that 4g wouldn't have been able to deliver my third prediction is the idea of a flexible form factor so you've already seen these foldable phones and this is addressing the other side to apples grand theory a foldable phone is already potentially smaller and also potentially more seamless and don't forget foldable is the first step into flexible and i really think that flexible is where these devices will start to the comments so woven into our lives that you'll forget they're actually there this leads me on to wearables and we need to make a bit of a distinction here the term wearables is often associated with these kind of gimmicky sports bands that can sort of detect your heart rate but what i'm talking about here is devices that carry more functionality than your smartphone but in a way that's even more seamless it could be something that wraps around your wrist but equally it could be something that's part of your clothing or even something that's potentially implanted into you wearables are what is going to bring us closer to augmented reality and virtual reality so you probably heard of mark zuckerberg the ceo of facebook even he has said that the future of facebook is wearable facebook is investing heavily in ar and vr and whilst right now these technologies feel a little bit cumbersome and require bulky bits of kit they are leading into seamlessness and i know i keep banging on about this word but it's the direction we are headed in we are moving towards a world with uninterrupted technology truly a virtual reality in fact i think this movement is already starting to take place if you take a look at this graph over here which shows smartwatch sales over time you can see a very clear trend smartwatches have picked up almost exponentially and in fact at the start of 2019 the same period where samsung barely broke even in other area the company reported a growth of 127 percent in watt sales this is that grunt theory of apple in action the fifth thing is that artificial intelligence is crucial for all of this it is what is going to allow devices that are this big to be able to replicate the functionality of devices that are this big this is a simplified example but let's say right now i need my macbook to edit videos and that's probably going to remain the case for the next ten years or so but you might know that using google photos your smartphone is already capable of using machine learning to edit simple videos for you using its understanding of faces places and objects with that in mind then it's not unreasonable to assume that in a decade's time google will be intelligent enough to be able to edit my videos for me in a way that would be a lot better than i could do all this computing power that power that makes people feel the need to buy massive desktop pcs is all going to start to be embedded in the cloud and we'll just be borrowing it every time we issue a command and that leads me on to commands let's take an example how do you usually interact with your smartphone you'll probably say touch but touch is much slower and less intuitive than voice and so i don't think it'll be long before voice commands will start to play a larger role and think about it if your commands start to only need to come from your mouth instead of your fingers as well and the fact that the power of your ever improving ai assistant is available on everything from your wrist band to your necklace why would you want to carry around a bulky phone anymore and for those of you who are curious i'd say the next step after voice control would be something along the lines of linking directly to your brain but that's a long way off and we'll save something for another video anyways to bring this all together the small phone as you know it is not just gonna suddenly fan or snap out of existence the way i see it going is wearables and small foldable display devices are going to become so capable that people will start reaching for their phones less it'll be this slow process where over a period of time the demand will fall until eventually the old form factor will be phased out and to be clear these new-age devices they're still technically going to be phones people are still gonna want to communicate with one another but it's just that they're not gonna look anything like this and speaking of stuff that's unlike anything you've ever seen before sir shark vpn is the most affordable vpn service out there so you pay 199 dollars a month and that gives
