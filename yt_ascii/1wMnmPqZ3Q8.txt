hello everyone and welcome we are sitting in the all new toyota gr86 so of course a collaboration with subaru so subaru's equivalent offering being the subaru brz so this is the new for the 2022 model year instead of the naturally aspirated 2.0 liter we now have a naturally aspirated 2.4 liter and a lot of people may have wanted that to be a turbo i'm very happy with the decision they made and the changes they've made to this engine i think it's fantastic so we're going to get into all of that [music] so a 2.4 liter boxer 4-cylinder and the way that this engine is larger is that they've increased the size of the bore so the pistons are now wider they have the same stroke so they move up and down the same distance allowing for more air in that engine which of course means more torque so we are now up to 228 horsepower at 7000 rpm same peak rpm as previously with the horsepower and then for torque'4 pound-feet of torque at 3700 rpm and this is quite a bit sooner however that's not really the full story so you'll probably often hear with this vehicle that the torque the peak torque is now way way sooner but if you look at the old torque curve the way it happens is it comes up it reaches a peak and then comes down and then it gradually increases as you go across into those higher rpms up to 60 600 6400 where you have your peak torque however it's just slightly higher than that earlier peak so it's not like you're getting a ton of torque sooner but the big benefit really isn't that different in rpm number which again i think will probably be overstated the big thing is that it's all been bumped up so similar curve you still still do have a little bit of a torque dip like you did previously not quite as severe but fortunately all of it's been bumped up so you have significantly more torque which is fantastic and this is once again using toyota's d4s injection so it has both direct injection for maximum power and then it has port injection for your low and mid-range power getting better efficiency in those zones so i like that they do that because i think there are some disadvantages of going just direct injection and so this one here using both and kind of getting the best of both worlds now as far as the transmission it's pretty much carryover you've got the exact same gear ratios in the manual exact same gear ratios in the automatic strengthens a little bit in order to compensate for the added torque however there is one difference in the final drive ratio so now we're going back to the original final drive ratios of the scion fr-s when that came out so 4.1 for the manual and 3.9 for the automatic versus the new manuals the 2020 manuals those are coming with the 4.3 so you're losing a little bit of torque in each gear because of that taller final drive however you have more than enough torque with the engine to make up for that difference so about 12 and a half percent more torque overall in every single gear which is fantastic and definitely noticeable now manual versus automatic honestly the decision is pretty simple and that's because the manual is just pretty much better in every way it's lighter and it's quicker and it has more aggressive gearing so 0 to 60 of the previous gen manual about 7 seconds now 6.1 previous gen automatic about 8 seconds now 6.6 so the manual is still faster and that's really because of the more aggressive gearing in all the gears even though you have that extra time for shifting because the gears are more aggressive you get to put down more wheel torque in each gear meaning you get better acceleration so gears one through six in the manual transmission every single gear is more aggressive than one through six in the automatic transmission you have a one-to-one ratio in fifth gear and the automatic you have a one-to-one ratio in fourth year in the manual so out on the track it was a very clear difference as far as which one i prefer driving i drove the automatic first and it kind of felt quickness wise like the last gen manual and then i got in the manual and i was like okay this is where this thing comes alive so really for the driving experience the manual is the way to go because it's lighter and it's got better gearing and thus it is quicker so why not a turbo well when you look at the weight of this car then you figure out why they didn't go with the turbo so it's only about 20 to 30 pounds heavier kind of depending on where you go i'll put up the weights on the screen so you can see the differences but it's not that much added weight and it's a significant amount of added torque and so as a result you get a car that weighs very similar to previously except now it has more torque it has that same lovely characteristic of the naturally aspirated engine very responsive you don't have to worry about turbo lag you don't have all the weight that would be added if you were to add a turbocharged system and all the intercoolers piping coolant beefing up the hardware in order to make that happen so i love the decision they made there they kept the weight down they did a few things to help keep that weight down the roof now being aluminum the hood was previously aluminum still aluminum and then the front fenders are also aluminum they also took weight out of the seats and so you know a little bit of weight out of the rear muffler so they've taken weight out in a few places to compensate for this larger engine that has now gone in it as far as the suspension similar style to the previous generation so we've got a mcpherson strut up front and we have a multi-link suspension in the rear now if you look at what subaru and toyota say about the rear suspension and they have the same similar suspension geometry subaru calls it a double wishbone toyota calls it a multi-link rear suspension and i was kind of confused and asked toyota about this and they basically said it's just kind of how they define it it's the difference they're pretty much the same of course they've got different tuning for each suspension and toyota's using different springs but same overall suspension geometry and that's just what they call it they call it multi-link and when i was looking at it to me it looks like a multi-link because you have that upper a arm like a double wishbone and then the bottom arm you have multiple linkages coming in so i would reference it as being a multi-link subaru calls it a double wishbone so how about this interior well we are sitting in the base version so it's a very simple interior that's it does come with a nice screen you've got nice automatic climate control you know touch points things like that they've actually added for the premium you've got padded where your knees going to be here it's kind of a hard surface for my knee overall you know you're not going to be impressed with the bass levels interior from like a quality material standpoint but keep in mind they've said with destination this thing is going to come in under 30 000 so it's got a really good price for the performance so i i'm okay with that i mean bare bones in here if you want the nicer interior you go with the premium here we just have these cloth seats they've actually got a little g in them that's what toyota says this little pattern here which is also on the front grill little g in that and then you can get alcantara with leather inserts if you go with the premium [music] buddy as far as visibility just like the last generation visibility is fantastic out the front large windows to your side yeah you've got a little bit of a blind spot that's kind of cumbersome right there but overall out the back looks good you've got plenty of visibility rear view camera so visibility is great in here and it's actually spacious you know i'm about six one i've got space in here when i drive on the track my helmet pretty much is right at the ceiling and kind of touching it as you know you go around corners and things like that but i do fit in it versus like an mx-5 i can't wear a helmet inside of and my head would just be way above the pillars so it can be done on a track i'd say if you're six foot or lower you're not going to be very comfortable if you're on the higher end of that but can be done and it's a great vehicle out on the track you've got a large screen here apple carplay android auto that sort of thing so nice to have that modern touch as far as comfort the ride's not bad i mean you know it's it's not super firm it's not super soft so i actually like the way that the ride feels and also these chairs even though this is the base version these are very comfortable seats so i don't weigh that much i don't sink in usually that much into seats and i you know i sing into these a good bit and it's actually really comfortable so i like the seats i like the seats in both the premium and the base version so the important question how is it to drive and i think a simple overall summary is that it's a lot like the old 86 except now it has more torque so it's pretty much better in pretty much every way because of that you got a little more more power without compromising on weight so the ride is very similar and i think that's fantastic you're coming with the same front rear brakes as far as size you're coming with the same front rear tires so very similar you're on 17s with the base version' inch wheels with the premium version same tire options primacy hp with the base michelin pilot sport fours with the premium version and you know on the track honestly those primacy tires because this car doesn't have all that much power yes it has more power now but because it doesn't have all that much power the premises are actually really fun because you just slide around out there and if you really want to get those lap times then the pilot sport 4s have tons of grip and plenty of grip for this car because it's so lightweight and so it does whatever you want it to out there so both of them good options whether you want to have a more playful experience go with the premises or if you want the more track focused lap time experience go with the pilot sport fours clutch feels good shifting feels good you know it's got that kind of subaru notchiness to it i like the transmission i like the clutch i like how easy it is to drive you don't have downshift rev matching which i think would be a cool feature for toyota to add unfortunately they do not but you do have rev matching with the automatic not that it makes you know all that huge of a difference it's more noticeable in manuals it would be nice to see it in it but that does not have as far as the steering they have made some changes to make the steering lighter physically so it's a bit simpler they now have an in-column mounted steering assist and it's all just one simple assembly as far as the steering you know it's kind of light i would say overall but you know there's a directness there there's responsiveness of course if you're on the pilot sport fours they have a bit better response than these premises but i think you're not gonna be disappointed with the steering it's just kind of light in my opinion but it's a light car that's fine for me the throttle is very nice especially with that added torque and it's just nice having a naturally aspirated engine i think when you're making a pure driver's car if the point of it is to be fun to drive naturally aspirated is the way to go because you get the most response out of it and i think response gives you that connected feel and as a result of that connected feel you actually feel enjoyment because the car is doing exactly what you want it to do and it has you know more torque now so you put your foot down in third dirty gear is honestly fantastic when i was driving out on the track i spent most of my time you know it's a fairly low speed track we're on and i spent a lot of my time in third gear and it's a fun gear it's got good torque to it so it's actually enjoyable i mean these things aren't rockets right they're about kind of just having fun in a low-cost lightweight vehicle and it nails it it really does now as far as the weight balance overall it's a 53 47 split so 53 of the weight up front so a very neutrally balanced car they've also taken out a little bit of roll bar in the rear so they went from a 15 millimeter down to a 14 millimeter sway bar in the rear giving you a little bit of added rear grip there and overall you know out on the track you kind of get this like full car slide to it when you start sliding and then if you give it enough throttle you know you get the rear end to kick out it's very playful so it has maintained that very playful nature of the 86 of the brc which i love i mean it's just fantastic now they have increased the ride height by about .2 inches so from 4.9 to 5.1 inches however center of gravity is actually down very slightly i think they said something like 1.2 millimeters so basically same center of gravity slightly more ground clearance and the difference being now you know you've got that aluminum roof and so you've taken out some of the weight that's up high and so you're able to keep that center of gravity lower overall though i mean this is the kind of car that i enjoy lightweight rear wheel drive two doors you know it's not overpowered there's nothing crazy about it very affordable you know as far as cars go these days especially performance cars most of them just keep getting higher and higher in price and yet this is going to come in under 30 000 with destination and what a fantastic driver's car at that you know you can drive it on the street or on the track and really enjoy yourself in this thing and i love that and i like that you can also be tall and get in it so you know rare that i say this but this is something i would genuinely buy like it's it's fantastic across the board there's some simplicity to it you know if you're looking for the nicest interior in the world you're not gonna find it in here if you're looking for the quietest interior in the world you're not going to find it here but if you're looking for joy in driving this thing delivers so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
