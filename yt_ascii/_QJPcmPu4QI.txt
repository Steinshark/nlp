how to build a universe in a computer and not just any computer a super computer what's the jaws phrase we're going to need a bigger boat are we going to need a bigger computer we always need a bigger computer i've built universities in various computers we have a supercomputer-ish here that it has about 000 processors or something which you can do some universes in but if you want to go for the really big ones i used a big one in switzerland with 128 000 processors so you log into it across the internet and put your thing in so the first thing i did was type in you know how much free space have i got and it came up with 1.6 petabytes so i had to look up exactly what a petabyte was because i thought i knew but that device is a thousand terabytes there's a huge amount of space available but it's frightening how quickly you can get through that space firstly you have to have something that is suitable for a supercomputer so it has lots and lots of processes so you have to have a job that can be divided up into little bits and it also has to scale reasonably well so if you double the number of processors does it halve the amount of time or does it just bring it down a little bit and so if you go to 100 000 cpus does it make it a hundred thousand times quicker or does it just make it 20 times quicker that's sort of thing you need to know before you start and then once you've done that then you have to set up the the whole environment so it's a batch environment you submit your job say this is what i want to run i want to run it on this many processors i want this amount of memory available i want to i'm going to write this many files and that goes off and disappears into the sort of ether and then at some point the batch system will come around and say right i've got enough spare room to run your job and off it will go it's usually sort of late sunday night or something like that so you can arrange for an email to come and so an email will pop up and said your job has started and it's very often followed by another one saying your job is finished or aborted because you've made some error that you you're not quite right so you normally start with a small subset of cpus and make sure that everything is going to work and just run it for half an hour or something like that and then you go bigger and bigger until you're confident that it will run across the whole time when you're working out whether you can parallelize this it's like a person digging a hole with a spade if you give them a hundred spades they can still only dig at the same speed absolutely yeah but then if you give a hundred people one spade they still can only take the same speed you need that magic 100 people with 100 space right yeah and you also even if you've got 100 people 100 spades they can't necessarily all get to the hole there's always going to be some restriction that's going to slow you down so you know it's it's it's trade-offs for those things how do you get around those restrictions what's the what's the way of organizing it you just have to sort of divide it up so in the case of this we're building a universal so we build up little sort of quadrants or or tiny bits of universe and a small group of processors will work on that and another group will work on a bit of it over here but eventually they do need to communicate because stuff grows up here and the gravity affects the stuff over here so they all have to communicate but you can go for a little while with sort of ignoring the outside or just working with the previous version of the outside world and then you have to chat amongst yourselves and say well this is the new state of it and then you can run for a bit further so it sort of goes in those lock steps every so often and also because your programs are not necessarily bug free you save the state of the universe so you you run for you know half a billion years or something of effectively universe time and then you save absolutely everything you can so that well you know everything everything collapses you've at least got that but you can also tell the program to start from that what we call a call it a snapshot of the data so you can start from there and then run from there so if it all does fall over but you've you've got a few billion years into it you can at least start from that point and carry on i think the clickbait title for this has got to be how many times you save the universe that would be a great click leak yes yeah yeah so having saved the universe how much data are we talking here for a universe safe well it depends exactly how big or how fine ingrained you're going to make it but you know typical simulation is probably a billion particles we use to simulate a universe each one of those has an x y and z coordinate it has a velocity so v x v y v z sometimes we keep mass or sometimes we just have all particles with the same mass sometimes we have other bits and pieces of information that we can work out at the time that are worth saving but it's fairly large you know it's in the sort of terabyte range for each of these snapshots and we might save five or six hundred of these over run so that once we've completed it and we found something interesting you know in today's universe we can actually track that back through the snapshot and say well how did that feature arise you know if we wander back we can see its history so you want all that data saved so yeah it's pretty big so as i said you know 1.6 petabytes but you're going through you know two or three terabytes each snapshot you save i'm just now thinking that those petabytes are not very close to us here what's the process of getting the data from the supercomputer to you well it's it's over the internet and it's typically frantic so another problem you have with the supercomputer is you only have it for a certain amount of time so you have allocated research time and you know i was finished on i think you know march the 31st so sort of the beginning of march you start to think about getting that data off there and even with the fastest internet connections it takes a long while to transfer you know many terabytes of information and you've also got to work out where you're going to store it because you can't we haven't got terabytes of spare space just hanging around so i do remember walking around asda looking at these stacks of dvd roms that you could buy and thinking i wonder how many of those i need to put in my shopping cart to actually store all this it turned out to be far too many so we didn't go with that so eventually we did find somewhere more locally that we could store it so you want to store it and then you can process it and start to analyze it and look for patterns in it but it's something you need to think of not at the last minute because it takes typically weeks to transfer this amount of data and that analysis the analysis doesn't happen on the supercomputer or is it just that you might use it and load it in somewhere you can do it on the supercomputer sometimes we have done it there but you you as well as having a time budget you have a cpu budget so you have so many million hours or something of cpu time so you could use it for running the simulation and you could use it for analyzing it or you might want to spend all your time running the simulation to its sort of nth degree and then do the analysis somewhere else somewhere else has to be quite big to read in these large amounts of data and process it but it's it's more tractable so we could run that on our nottingham supercomputer rather than but then you've got to transfer the data you know a chunk of time over to that computer and let it run and process it this is the old argument about a truck full of hard disks exactly yeah i was thinking could i just fly over to switzerland and pick up the data in a couple of large suitcases might that be quicker but anyway it wasn't asking to print it out for you punch cards that's the way it's the future if we just scroll forward in time we can see that as things start to happen we get to this point where everything starts to reroute and rather than going directly to facebook you can start to see it all w this is some actual cipher text that we'll be breaking later does it honestly start with zoos as in conrad's views yeah the reality of random
