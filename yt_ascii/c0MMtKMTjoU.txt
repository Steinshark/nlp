in his native south korea dr huang wu suk was a national hero he first burst onto the scene in 1999 has a cloning pioneer in 2004 and 2005 he published two papers in the world-renowned journal science huang's work was hailed as groundbreaking and he parlayed that attention into a large public and private backing dr huang seemed to be on the fast track to a nobel prize he seemed to do no wrong until it all came crashing down in this video we're going to take a look at the rise and fall of dr huang wu sook but first i want to remind you about the newsletter check out the newsletter to read the entire scripts for previously released videos including those you might not have seen before the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show huang was born in 1952 in buyo county of korea's south chung chong province wong's father died when he was young so he was raised by his mother growing up on a cattle farm he dreamed of becoming a world-class cattle researcher with the help of his relatives and scholarships he entered and graduated from seoul national university one of the country's most prestigious universities in veterinary sciences class of 1977. he received his doctorate a few years later in 1982 where he was noted for working hours on end without sleep after that he went abroad to hokkaido university for a couple of years as a visiting researcher after that he returned to south korea and joined seoul national university as a lecturer he became an associate professor in 1993 and then ascended to a full professor at the veterinary school in 1997. huang's research throughout the 1990s was on in vitro fertilization it was well regarded as an expert in livestock breeding in 1993 he performed korea's first artificial insemination of a cow a good career certainly but nothing to cross the front page news the south korean government has long wanted to make a splash in the biosciences back in the 1980s the military junta led by chun du huan wanted to replicate the economic success of the previous paktung-hee administration it was an anxious time south korea's economy was changing from reliant upon cheap labor and cheap energy to knowledge and science the government was gearing up a massive r d program in several priority areas several korean life science researchers lobbied the ministry of science and technology to include biotechnology as a priority for r d expenditure from 1983 to 1994 national r d expenditures and biotechnologies skyrocketed nearly 20 times then in 1994 the kim young son government announced that it would spend' to 20 billion usd over the next 14 years on its biotechnology industry this ambitious plan called biotech 2000 made up a significant part of the country's highly advanced nation development plan the goal would be for korea to catch up to other developed nations by 2007. dr huang first went mainstream in august 1998 when he announced that he had cloned a dairy cow named yong rong e which means splendor in korean and that it would be born in january 1999. this clone cow later announced to be born in february 1999 drew nationwide attention as korea's response to the february 1997 uk news announcement about the sheep dolly the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell somatic cell meaning that the cell is not a reproductive cell the united states had previously cloned two calves the same way in january 1998 charlie and george scientists from japan and new zealand as well so korea joined them as only the fifth country to accomplish this high profile achievement but people did point out a few weird things surrounding the announcement first huang did not publish a paper about his clone achievement though he did later file patents detailing some of the techniques he used to produce the clone second the first announcement said that the cow would be born in january but it ended up being born in february can a cow delay pregnancy that long these accusations did not prevent huang from being identified as a promising world-class representative scientist but no one what we know now was the cow cloning achievement legitimate we cannot say for sure both yong rongi and its cell donor passed away soon after the news left the spotlight dr huang's team did provide a sample for third party verification but it had deteriorated too much for a conclusive result so genetic testing cannot authenticate this particular achievement but there is some circumstantial evidence that implies that the cloning was legitimate get to that later i think it is worth taking a pause to explain the procedures and techniques behind huang's work somatic cell nuclear transfer is what we call the technique used to clone dolly the sheep we first collect two types of cells the first is a somatic cell from the person or sheep we mean to clone like i said before a somatic cell refers to a non-reproductive cell cloners generally choose cells from the skin or memory glands then we need to collect a second type of cell egg cells from a female of the same species these should be ready to be fertilized we then remove those egg cells nucleus using a needle from there we fuse together the donor somatic cell into the now nucleusless egg cell this can be done using electricity or direct injection into the cell this new egg cell is then made to develop into an embryo and then we finally implant it into a surrogate mother for it to develop just like with any in vitro fertilization voila we have a clone this technique was first proposed in the 1930s first done on frogs technical and biological limitations and manipulating egg cells meant that we weren't able to do this for mammals until dolly also one last thing clones aren't really clones like in the movies due to developmental differences and other such things it was for this reason that the first cloned cat named cece for copycat came out with a different colored coat the dream of course would be able to produce cell therapies customized to a particular patient especially those suffering from degenerative diseases like parkinson's but the process has its drawbacks the most significant is the low success rate it took 277 tries to get dolly only 29 ever became embryos and less than half of that got to be implanted despite a few optimizations we have yet to really improve these rates in the years since dali's birth they remain in the low one to five percent range depending on the species for instance a recent study on monkeys got four live births out of 301 embryos a 1.8 percent yield also if you're going to be using this technology to try and heal people you need to consider the ethical issues surrounding the destruction of an unfertilized human egg cell dr huang was not only handsome and looked like the perfect ideal of an academic he also savvily tapped korean nationalist feelings for instance dr huang fouled up his achievement with a second clone cow in april 1999. he named it gin e based on the famous korean geisha huang jini from the joseon dynasty a name suggested by the korean president kim dae jong in an interview with reporters huang said he wanted to improve the production capacity of native han wu korean beef in order to improve its price competitiveness against imported beef and increased farmers income he also thoroughly bought into the hustle culture life in one interview he said my calendar has only monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday friday friday friday there is no saturday or sunday his remarks brought pride and inspiration at a time when koreans needed a hero just a few years earlier in late november 1997 south korea had to take a humbling 60 billion dollar imf bailout package in the wake of the asian financial crisis dr huang followed up his cloning achievement with a few more announcements some interesting and others a bit strange first in 2002 he announced that he had cloned a pig with its genes modified to make it more conducive for organ transplant huang had an interesting story for these aseptic pigs as they were called he said that due to quarantine restrictions he could not bring live pigs in from the united states so he claimed to have smuggled in pig embryos which he cloned he compared the smuggling to that of the famous scholar and politician monong who smuggled cotton seeds out of china into korea those seeds founded a fruitful cotton industry for the country a year later in december 2003 he announced that he had successfully genetically engineered a korean cow to be resistant to mad cow disease like with the prior announcements there was no paper published for peer review he also told reporters that he wanted to clone the siberian tiger and the korean wild wolf because those heritage animals were facing extinction in their natural environment i don't think anything came of that in the wake of the news wong invited the korean president to his laboratory there he demonstrated to the president how he cured a dog using a stem cell treatment one of knowles leading political goals when he came to power in february 2003 was scientific advancement he upgraded the ministry of science and technology to a deputy prime minister position in charge of coordinating the country's research president noel was amazed by huang's achievement saying i feel like i got an electric shock this is not science this is magic huang and the no administration had close ties through one of the president's advisors dr pak ki young huang donated a quarter of a million dollars to fund her research regarding the social impact of his laboratory discoveries she helped boost his work and career through targeted policy in february 2004 dr huang published a paper in the world renowned journal science in it he claims to have produced a human embryonic stem cell via the somatic cell nuclear transfer method while it has been done before in animals this was the first time it has been performed for humans science and nature are two of the world's most prestigious journals with an acceptance rate of less than 10 percent so the 2004 paper triggered a swell of nationalist pride which he cultivated at a press conference in seoul he said at the heart of the united states i just put teguki on top of the mountain of biotechnology which once had been believed to be unreachable by 2010. the teguki is the name of the korean national flag also the name of a great 2004 film that i highly recommend the korean government had backed their star scientists research to the tune of over 65 million dollars allowing his lab at seoul national university to grow to employ 60 people in return dr huang included dr park the president's science advisor as a co-author on this 2004 paper a year later in june 2005 he had a second paper published in science in it he said that his research team produced 11 human stem cell lines from people of various ages and sexes just as significantly he claimed to have produced this using just'5 eggs via somatic cell nuclear transfer such an achievement if legitimate would have been a big breakthrough it would have shown it to be possible to create stem cells out of many different people's somatic cells as i mentioned earlier such an achievement if legitimate opens the door to custom-made cell therapy treatments for afflicted patients free of immune rejection concerns furthermore 11 cell lines out of just'5 eggs implies the success rate some 14 times better than anything done before it would have been a wild achievement if legitimate as a confirmation of his work's global nature huang's two articles included prominent american scientists as co-authors the second 2005 paper included dr gerald shatten a scientist well known in south korea and a few months later dr huang's team announced the world's first successful cloning of a dog this was an afghan hound born in april 2005 named snappy the name is short for seoul national university puppy time later chose snappy as its most amazing invention in 2005. much later two separate third parties from seoul national university in princeton verified snumpy has a legitimate clone of his nuclear cell donor considering this i reckon that dr huang's original cloned cow was also legitimate the snappy clone is indeed pretty cool but it is a bit overshadowed by some of the other things he has done coming so soon after these two publications in a prestigious journal huang became a national hero no individual korean scientist received so much mass media attention various tv networks featured him in various tv segments at his press conferences he made rousing nationalist statements like i want to print made in korea on stem cells and science knows no border but a scientist has his homeland then in october 2005 the noaa administration appointed him to lead a new world stem cell hub with the goal of creating the world's leading research center for stem cell technologies the government granted him tens of millions of dollars in funds to be spent over five years at the hub some of korea's largest private companies like samsung and pasco also contributed to huang's projects the south korean government awarded huang the best scientist award in june 2005. they issued a commemorative stamp with huang's work on it and the best perk of all korean air granted both him and his wife free passage on their flights first class one late evening in june 2005 two producers of a tv investigative program called pd notebook saw an interesting post on their discussion board titled about professor huang the author wrote i worked at professor huang's laboratory for a few years dr huang is a national hero and people respect him truthfully i was hesitant to write this story here because i don't have strong evidence and professor huang is one of the most influential scientists in korea after i tell the truth about his research to the public korea might lose international reputation in stem cell cloning field and i would be in danger however i believe that we cannot hide the truth and a reputation based on dishonesty should be quickly removed please contact me the producers reached out to the post's author who left their real name and number and met with them dr ryu young jun was the first medical doctor to work at huang's lab having joined them in 2002. he worked on procuring the eggs from various clinics preserving stem cells and drafting the paper ryu was the second listed co-author on the 2004 paper he eventually left huang's laboratory and returned to medicine he initially kept his silence but decided to go public when he found out that dr huang intended to treat a 10 year old boy with a stem cell therapies knowing the real effectiveness of huang's work ryu had to speak out the first issue that ryu brought up was that of younger female researchers being quote encouraged to donate their eggs ryu also told the producers that the eggs used in huang's stem cell research were paid for rather than donated furthermore the women donors were not told about the possible side effects of the egg extraction ryu's wife also worked at dr huang's laboratory and had been one of the many co-authors on the 2004 article she backed a statement that some of the laboratories junior members donated their own eggs the second thing that we were told the producers was that he felt that the stem cell data in both the 2004 and 2005 science articles might have been faked let us set aside ryu's second accusation and focus on the eggs first by the time you reached out to pd notebook people had already started asking questions about the eggs egg extraction is painful and can potentially cause side effects so such a process should be overseen so a few people wondered how huang managed to acquire so many eggs dr huang told the new york times in february 2004 interview that the 242 human eggs used in the first paper came from 16 unpaid volunteers dr huang reaffirmed this position in may 2004 when the journal nature the journal that did not publish the paper also questioned the source of the eggs it was the first serious pushback regarding his research it included an initial testimony from a phd student in huang's lab and co-author on the paper saying that she and a colleague had donated eggs she later called back and said that she had misspoken due to her bad english huang said nature's claim is totally groundless i swear none of my students donated eggs for the research for some reason the journal is trying to undermine our study nature's published accusation probably should have spurred an investigation by the south korean government and the hanyang university hospital's internal review board or irb but both organizations backed dr huang saying that his work had gone through a full irb and regulatory review which it hadn't the rb had requested monthly reports considering the sensitive nature of human egg collection but none were sent the irb approved the whole thing anyway the south korean government voiced their support for huang as well presidential adviser dr park repeatedly defended the country's star scientist and the ministry raised their financial support to 30 million dollars the highest number yet to prove his accusations rear led the pd notebook producers to excellent documentation at the hospital where dr huang sourced his eggs records also shown that at least one of the donors had been a junior researcher at huang's lab now let us touch upon the second data fabrication accusation ryu had left huang's lab after december 2003 so his assertion that the 2005 papers data was faked was not based on any hard evidence ryu's reasoning was that dr huang was indeed out of his element when it came to producing human stem cells so he had recruited a few experts from other institutions to help but many of them had left the stem cell's high success rate was already very suspicious huang's team then lost a great deal of experience and domain knowledge how was it possible that they succeeded so well pd notebook producers contacted the various co-authors of the 2005 paper under the cover story of doing a documentary they found that the majority of the co-authors never saw the 11 stem cell lines in question through an undisclosed source they obtained a sample of one of the 11 stem cell lines from huang's laboratory number two they tested it against stem cell lines widely available from a hospital for research produced using in vitro fertilization if huang's research was what it said it was then the results should show different genetics after all these 11 stem cell lines are supposed to be clones of a random undisclosed patient they should be different from the widely available stem cell lines but indeed there was a match they took these results to an october 2005 interview with kim sun jong who had worked on the human stem cells as a junior researcher he had by then moved on to the university of pittsburgh unbeknownst to kim one of the producers had a hidden camera they told kim that they had evidence of fraud and that prosecutors had begun investigation kim cracked and said that huang had told him to fabricate photographic evidence so to make it seem like there were 11 stem cell lines when in fact there were only two pd notebook eventually produced two episodes the first suspicious egg donation and wu sakuang's myth focused on the ethical egg donations the information about the fabricated stem cell evidence would come in the second episode shortly before the first episode aired in november 22nd 2005 huang's most prominent western science collaborator the american stem cell scientist dr gerald shatten announced that he would end his collaboration with huang shatten told the washington post that his decision was due to the egg ethics i now have information that leads me to believe huang had misled me about egg donation my trust has been shaken i am sick at heart chairman of mismady women's hospital which closely collaborated with huang held his own press conference a day before the episode aired saying that some of the other eggs were purchased from clinics and brokers at about 1 400 each then the actual program aired showing the medical record proof of the unethical egg acquisitions for the 2004 paper the episode really kicked the hornet's nest dr ryu had actually talked to a civic group first but while they believed him they didn't go loud because they were worried about the social repercussions for good reason a few days after the first pd notebook episode aired on november 24th dr huang held a press conference and confirmed that two of his junior researchers had indeed donated their eggs he also admitted that he knew about it but lied to hide their privacy huang denied coercing his researchers for donations and claimed to know nothing about the paid egg acquisitions but he nevertheless said that he would be resigning from his official positions including that of the stem cell hub public opinion in korea sided with huang many voiced the feeling that we shouldn't apply western standards of ethics to asian scientific efforts doesn't the average office worker sacrifice their body for the company's greater good every day why can't a junior researcher donate their eggs to a science project of national importance yahoo korea held a poll and 86 of the 10 000 plus respondents do not consider what huang's laboratory did to be an ethical violation the second episode would be the real bombshell the one claiming that huang faked his data the problem was that the producers obtained one of the two critical pieces of evidence under false pretenses the pd notebook producer had lied to dr kim in pittsburgh in order to obtain a confession the producers wanted to solidify their second piece of evidence the test results in november pd notebook acquired samples for the 11 stem cell lines from huang's team and sent them to two labs for testing confirmation the labs came up with just one valid result out of several marks showing no match with the patient a retest would be needed but huang's team refused to provide any more samples so to push them to cooperate the producers of pd notebook held a press conference on december 2nd hinting that the 2004 and 2005 papers might have been faked this backfired two days later december 4th a competing network ytn exposed this breach of journalist ethics they interviewed dr kim again who retracted his entire testimony saying that all the data in the 2005 paper was genuine that same day huang's lab held a press conference to refute the test data researcher professor kang seong kong argued that the november test results should be invalidated since the results were not replicable because only one of the marks had a result why dan's accusations led to a public uproar especially from huang supporters twenty thousand angry comments filled up pd notebooks discussion board korean netizens figured out the whistleblower's identity dr rio and sent him death threats he lost his hospital job and could not find another one until 2007. they made a 2014 movie about his ordeal as well as that of pd notebooks called the whistleblower 12 korean companies pulled their commercials from the program the network made a public apology and polled the second episode before it aired they also suspended the two producers for their unethical misconduct on december 5th a day after ytn network's ethics accusation in huang's laboratory team press result an anonymous user posted on the biological research information center brick message board a board frequented by young science researchers the post was titled in english the show must go on and detailed how the different photos of the 11 stem cell lines in the 2005 science paper were just one photo manipulated in photoshop wong's lab team quickly explained that what happened was just a mix-up and that the science paper would post the real photos shortly then came a second brick post alleging that the dna fingerprints between the patients and their stem cells in the 2005 paper were unrealistically similar small differences should be expected due to how the testing goes but in huang's paper they were precisely the same on december 8th 30 professors at seoul national university urged the administration to investigate on december 11th the university formed an investigative committee but even at this time people still largely believed in their hero scientist then it all collapsed on december 14th dr gerald chattan asked to retract his name from the 2005 nature paper and urged his other co-authors to do the same dr shatten also asked nature to retract the paper in full he said my careful re-evaluation of published figures and tables along with new problematic information now cast substantial doubts about the paper's accuracy on the 15th pd notebook moved to air their second episode including the now blurred out video of kim explaining that he was asked by dr huang to fabricate nine of the 11 stem cell lines that same day no sung ill of the miz medi hospital co-author on the 2005 paper and the guy who previously confirmed the ethical egg breaches did a phone interview in it noah said that he had visited huang at the hospital dr huang had self-hospitalized himself for exhaustion and heard that nine of the 11 stem cell lines were definitely faked the remaining two were questionable a day later dr huang himself emerged from the hospital and admitted that the 2005 paper had irrecoverable intentional mistakes he nevertheless insisted that he did indeed clone patient-specific stem cells and that korea still possessed that precious core technology the dream of korean-made stem cells was still alive but the seoul national university panel eventually concluded that those last two stem cell lines were created using normal in vitro fertilization their report said that huang had deferred to kim the pittsburgh researcher to do the work in october 2004 kim failed to cultivate the stem cells after many tries and in a fit of frustration went to ms medi to acquire stem cells he then mixed them into the experimental lines they grew and he claimed success huang did not realize the misconduct and was ecstatic kim went to mismady again and made five more lines for a total of six but in january 2005 an accident contaminated all but two of those lines huang wanting to publish as soon as possible told kim to fabricate photo and data evidence for nine more lines so to end up with 11. tests showed that none of the existing stem cell lines matched the patient's genetic profiles they had all come from mismady nobody but kim knew this research done much later also seemed to hint that huang's team inadvertently triggered parthogenesis asexual reproduction in their human eggs scientifically significant and worth noting though not what they were actually trying to do on january 20th 2006 nature officially retracted the two papers huang had attempted to resign from his position as a professor at seoul national back in his december 2005 press conference but the university would not accept it honor reasons i think on february 2006 the university suspended him and the month after that they fired him the korean public prosecutor took up the case and watchdog organizations began investigating huang's use of public research funds huang had mixed together public research and private use funds laundering the money through a series of accounts to make it impossible to track down their true source he was indicted for embezzlement and ethical violations after a trial the judge gave him a suspended sentence for showing remorse though he was fired from the university for fraud he was never indicted for it in court dr schatton said in a march 2006 interview it began as a little lie but snowballed with the passage of time he was continuously under great pressure to produce something personally he had great tenacity about winning the nobel prize he was so anxious to keep his lies from surfacing and to win the nobel prize goes on to point out that huang was a veterinary doctor he and his colleagues had not been equipped to handle the ethics and rigor of a human study and it cost them dr huang remains in the biotechnology field as i mentioned way back his cloning achievement of snuppy was legitimate so he has parlayed that work into a company for producing animal clones mostly champion pigs cows and horses but the occasional dog for rich clients willing to pay the 50 to 100 000 to do it vanity fair did an interview with him a few years back i read it and got the sense he seems much happier now i'm glad to hear that there's still people who support dr huang including members of the i love huang woo suck club they consider him the victim of a conspiracy which resulted in korea's indigenous technology being stolen by foreigners meanwhile in 2012 dr shinya yamanaka and dr john gerdon won the nobel prize in medicine for their 2006 discovery of transforming ordinary adult skin cells into pluripotent stem cells the dream lives on all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the
