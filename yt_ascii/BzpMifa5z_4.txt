breaking news ladies and gentlemen insider trading is legal well for politicians who says so politicians for the rest of us it's still illegal just in case you were wondering see our story today comes from nancy pelosi the queen the absolute goddess of insider trading she just made a legendary announcement today here it is we're gonna listen to it bear witness to it take a 49 members watch congress and'2 senior congressional staffers have violated the stock act the insider training law i'm wondering if you have any reaction to that and secondly should members of congress and their spouses be banned from trading individual stocks while serving congress no i don't know to this second one any we have a responsibility to report in the stock on the stock but i don't i'm not familiar with that five month review but if the people aren't reporting they should be because this is a free market in people where free market economy they should be able to participate in that okay it's a free market that's what she said should not ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks so this is absolutely insane what you're watching is her getting told that 49 members of congress have violated something called the stock act which the whole point of it was to prevent to stop insider trading and she says well look we should just all be allowed to do it anyways because freedom now i know if you're an average viewer you may not fully understand the scope of what's going on here so we have to back this up because the corruption just it just runs deep honestly guys i don't even talk about scams of this magnitude much mostly because it's just political people get weird about politics but also because this is a special kind of scam a legal scam where the people running the scam also make the laws so you know it's never going to be illegal to do what they do and even if it is you'll never pin them down as actually committing the crime so to give you guys some backstory insider trading is obviously when you know some public information about a stock and you go trade based on that information so for example let's say i have a company in medicine and i hear about a mysterious china illness that we may be able to treat if i know that information ahead of time and i go out and i buy or sell stocks based on that material information i have committed a crime right if someone from congress from the government nancy pelosi does the same thing given that they know non-public information all the time it is not a crime they they're they're allowed to do that well kind of you see it's a bit complicated obama signed this law in 2012 the stock act which technically made it illegal for congress to trade on insider information for this but the thing is is that no one's ever been convicted for this despite lots of calls of insider trading and the problem is it's not clear how anyone would ever be prosecuted for this because of something called the speech or debate clause which prevents congress from being questioned about things they talk about in their congressional duties or whatever what this means is if you ever wanted to convict someone for this you'd have to question them but you can't question them because of this rule in fact this was written about in the challenges of prosecuting congressional insider trading it's a law article basically they're saying look in theory this is illegal but there's not much of a way to actually find this out or pin them down it'd be like if i was banned from having like pink shoes in my house or something like that but i also had a law that said you could never search my house the question is is it actually illegal if you can never prove that i'm breaking the law if you don't actually have the ability to ever look into what i'm technically not supposed to be doing so that's the conundrum there's a law that they can't insider trade but there's no way to prove that they're insider trading because we can't ask them questions per this speech or debate clause thing but of course if that's the case then why do we have a bunch of reports from places like insider saying that the congress and top capitol hill staff have violated the stock act hundreds of times well the reason is simple because there's actually multiple parts to the stock act one of them the only real thing that actually is going on with the stock act is that they have to report what they're investing in at the bare minimum but they're not even doing that according to this incredible insider report on it they've identified 49 members of congress who failed to report their financial trades and then they go to list all these people who have failed to do so and surprise surprise they come from both sides of the aisle and they're making a lot of money on the pandemic ladies and gentlemen trading those tech stocks trading those pharmaceutical stocks ladies and gentlemen and this is what nancy pelosi was asked about and she basically dodged and said no there's no problem here it's a free market bro it's freedom bro but the thing is it's not freedom this is a problem these people go to these subcommittees they have all these special meetings with google apple they're expected to rule and make laws about these companies that they might have a vested interest in because they're investing in them or they're shorting them or longing them whatever and the thing is is like look even breaking these laws like this reporting law what's the penalty for it well if you break it you know what you pay a 200 fee that's right the price for not reporting potential insider trading as a congress person is 200 but get this even those tiny fines which is like less than a speeding ticket they don't even pay that apparently a lot of people have said there's no consistent penalty system and it's not even clear these people have paid the fines according to insider it's a situation that ethics experts say leaves the public in the dark lets congress off the hook and renders the stock act which is intended to defend against insider trading toothless so that's the real context here there's a law against instead of trading but it's useless and the part that's supposed to work this account reporting you know what you invested in isn't being enforced and so many people believe the solution is to ban lawmakers from being able to trade single stocks banning their spouses from being able to do that because for many of them it's not nancy pelosi who's investing it's her husband it's not rand paul who's investing it's his wife and they just happen to make killer trades the idea is they'd be able to trade the s p 500 mutual funds stuff like that but not be able to trade individual stocks like normal people because well they are not normal people and this just makes sense right like like if you're going to make laws investing in google and you know private information about google you shouldn't be able to then go and invest in how it's going to do tomorrow i mean the level of corruption we're talking about is so basic so bare minimum it's absolutely insane and so i and many people kind of support banning this and that's what nancy pelosi said no to said no the lawmakers we need access to those single stocks we got to play the stock market it's our fundamental right as insanely rich congress people and obviously what she's actually defending here is her right to get insanely rich from her insider knowledge like for example when her husband made a 5 million dollar profit from betting on google right before congress had an anti-trust bill i mean was he just lucky was that's the ultimate question like you have to really be born yesterday to actually fall for the fact to think that this is an insider trading you know was rand paul's wife lucky when she bought shares in gilead right before the pandemic that's a pharmaceutical company by the way that did very well they're the ones who actually make rim deserve i mean was that luck was rand paul's wife just the luckiest investor in the world or was it a crime right those are actually our two options are these investors just truly that good or are they committing crimes which are technically impossible to prosecute due to weird speech or debate laws that are on the books i don't know i'm gonna leave that up to you and here's what i want to leave you with as food for thought this is a graphic created by unusualwhales.com who tracks a lot of these politicians and it ranked the top 20 house members who purchased securities in 2020 and at the top of the list trading the most apparently was nancy pelosi or her husband at least and it's worked out quite well for her too since she's now worth 46 million dollars despite making only 220 000 a year i know that sounds like a lot but at her current salary it would take her 200 years to make as much money as she has right now and that would be if she never spent a penny and never paid taxes now obviously that's not the case she's not 200 years old despite how she looks where did all this money come from i mean it's just i don't know i don't know i guess it's just amazing to see all these politicians getting so rich just by being in the free market i don't know i guess my conclusion is this it's a scam but it's a legal one i guess for now so thanks for watching pump the stock see you tomorrow
