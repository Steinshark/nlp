i am coming to you from the future hey friends welcome back to my channel although i'm coming to you technically from the past when you watch this i did a deep dive into what technologies are trending what are the most popular technologies to learn not only for 2023 but looking ahead we are diving into some technologies that i haven't actually heard on a lot of lists when i did this research when i said what are the top technologies that are not only for now in 2023 but looking ahead are continuing to be in demand of the future what technology should you learn if you are someone who wants to either grow in tech or maybe you're already working in tech and wanting to specialize in an area that you know will be in demand for job security high pay whatever the case may be foreign i felt like this list wouldn't be complete or wouldn't be accurate if the first one wasn't this what is it you ask natural language processing this should be no surprise to any of you watching this video as you turn on your tv go on your phone everywhere we go right now we see how widely used ai is being adapted we see every company under the sun who wants to start integrating ai and this feels different this feels permanent meaning we saw this kind of rush of technology being used or this boom when web3 first came around which is still very in demand and still very popular but with ai we see companies adopting to it at a much quicker much wider rate is it bad that i'm wearing green or is it going to confuse me for that natural language processing is a form of ai technology that allows machines to understand the input from users so they can understand our human text if you will and know what to do with it and with natural language processing there are a ton of courses online which is the good news i'll list some of them here and i'll also make sure to link them down below it seems though as you can see based on these courses of course a common trend throughout many of these courses is the use of python so if you are already someone who uses python or is kind of tinkering around it's pretty much a great way to take a next step i'm not saying it's going to be an easy next step necessarily but it's a great thing to consider getting into unlike virtual reality which completely changes the user's perception it's all virtual augmented reality is super interesting in the sense that it combines both your actual environment with virtual reality so you are interacting with objects that are actually in the room but then also too with virtual objects laid on top of that many companies are now using ar to provide customers or users with a really unique experience and i'm sure one of the most popular games that utilize ar quite a few years ago kind of ahead of its time really is pokemon go pokemon pokemon am i saying that right which is it pokemon or pokemon it's the combination of having an overlay of this virtual reality while you are interacting with a physical world and as you start thinking about what is possible with this when you even think of that game pokemon go the possibilities really open up to such a cool and unique user experience by having them interact with the physical world but also additional elements i know recently i was at an event in new york city and they used a lot of ar for their shopping experiences there were mirrors i part of it was mirrors that you could see what you were wearing but you weren't actually wearing it so let me let me back up a sec you could see yourself in the mirror and then it would overlay different options of outfits that you could choose and that's incredible i mean if i don't have to go into another changing room to shop and try on a bunch of clothes the future is here so you can think of how that's used in so many different applications this is another area of tech that is continuing to boom and is not going anywhere anytime soon and next on the list is big data analytics you knew there had to be a data one in here data is the new oil or old oil at this point i feel like that saying has been said so many times big data analytics refers to using powerful computer algorithms to analyze large sets of information that will uncover hidden patterns and trends relationships etc this really helps businesses gain a deep insight into data they wouldn't have access to really understanding otherwise they can't spend hours and hours going through spreadsheets or files trying to understand this data some examples of data analytics include data mining algorithms for fraud detection recommendation systems based on customer behavior analysis and predictive maintenance solutions based on machine learning models next on the list is iot or internet of things iot essentially describes a network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors to connect the internet so it allows them to communicate exchange give data collect data feedback monitor essentially communicate to the internet and also to its users so you can think of iot as your coffee machine if you said in the morning or a great example of an iot is your thermostat if you have what are those those nest thermostats that you they will turn they're censored so based on their environment they will go up in temperature or down in temperature and we are really just on the brink of what iot is capable of we already use iot in so many of our home devices and it's continuing to grow that way at a very quick rate some experts predict one day we'll be walking down the street and all we will see are different iot things that we can interact with or tools we can use it's going to be pretty exciting this is an area of technology that is continuing to go grow very quickly next on the list is blockchain block chain is a technology that although has been around for a while now it's relatively speaking it's something that over the last few years of course has become extraordinarily popular thanks to cryptocurrency or not thanks to however you want to look at it and it is so widely used and continued to be adopted blockchain technology is continuing to grow and be adopted by so many companies i know our first thing that we often think of is cryptocurrency but it's being used in healthcare in a different identity theft in ways where you can verify this person is actually it think of it as your unique fingerprint and how that could help so many companies ensure that they're actually interacting or verifying this specific person next on the list is cloud computing it wouldn't be a list if we didn't include cloud not only that but it's because it is continuing to be a top in demand technology not only for 2023 but i'm not a better but if i was to bet for the future cloud computing if you want to put it in simple terms is the delivery of computing services so including servers storage databases networking software analytics and intelligence let me just put up a diagram here on screen cloud computing is something we talk about quite often on this channel and it's because it's continuing to really grow in demand the reality is as more companies adopt and go on the cloud the more they are going to need to use it the bigger they're going to need their storage capacity the more maintenance they're going to need this is a technology i personally am really really excited to see how it evolves in the next five or ten years is pretty much all companies to a certain degree are utilizing the cloud so what are some examples with cloud computing well one something that we probably all use every single day or most days is google docs or microsoft 365 so users can access the google docs or microsoft documents through the internet and you can be more productive work collaboratively because of cloud computing services that you are able to access your saved documents documents you've worked on with other team members it's all there another example is email calendar skype whatsapp essentially all these platforms take advantage of the cloud's ability to provide users with access to their data remotely so you can access your personal data and information wherever you want or wherever you are located imagine a world just as a side note imagine a world where we were only able to access these things because location dependent imagine all these digital nomads or travelers not being able to work while you're traveling i can't i can hardly imagine that world and next up on the list is machine learning one way i like to really understand or put simply what machine learning is think of it as a way from how you can learn from your experiences or get better at certain tasks over time this essentially is the purpose of machine learning or one of them machine learning can learn from their experiences and also improve their performance but of course instead of using human judgment or human experiences it uses statistical techniques to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns for example let's use a machine learning learning algorithm that is trained to recognize images of cats by analyzing thousands and thousands of pictures of cats over time it will learn to identify common features of a cat image so say it's pointy ears or whiskers once algorithm has learned what a cat looks like it can be used automatically to recognize new cats in pictures and one common machine learning algorithm that i'm sure we are all to some degree familiar with is neural networks neural networks simulate the way the human brain works with a huge number of linked processing nodes they are good at recognizing patterns and oftentimes play a very important role in applications using natural language processing so think of it as image recognition or speech recognition next up is quantum computing and i'm not going to lie what did i do before i started doing this video i went on chat gpt and typed in this exact thing i'll screenshot it actually explain to me quantum computing like i am a child because this is where where it needed to start everyone needs to start somewhere and i really like the example it gave so let me share it with you imagine you have a big toy box filled with lots of different toys whenever you want to play with a specific toy you have to look through the whole toy box to find it this can take a lot of time especially if you have a lot of toys now imagine you have this magical power that lets you look through the entire toy box all at once and pick out toy you want to play with this sounds much better right i agree okay so far so good well in a way that's what quantum computing is like instead of having to look through all the possible answers one by one like a regular computer does a quantum computer can look at all the possible answers right at once and pick out the right one mind-blowing this makes certain types of calculations much faster and of course more efficient than a regular computer can do and it straight and states at the end which i hope we all can take away quantum computing is much more complicated than finding toys but this is a great example for someone who's just entering or learning about quantum computing for this one i needed my computer quantum computing to me is something that's so fascinating and we're really just on the brink of but i can't i'm i'm still trying to grasp it fully other than you know some definition so here's what i've heard quantum computing is an area of computer science focused on the development of technologies based on the principles of quantum theory so essentially when i type in what is quantum computing for dummies it's a field of study centered on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum theory it's fascinating and i think we're just at the brink of what's possible with this and next up is robotics robotics is a field and technology that involves a design construction and operation and use of robots and well one of the main functions of a robot is to be able to carry out tasks autonomously so meaning it doesn't need the human intervention as it's walking or as it's doing its task and there are many different types of robots they don't all look like these cute little robots we see in images some examples of robots that are used in everyday life i mean by everyday life throughout the world i should say is let's say the roomba a popular vacuum cleaner that's made by irobot it uses sensors to navigate the room it doesn't need human intervention typically and also too it avoids obstacles while also cleaning your room another example that i'm sure we're all familiar with is boston dynamics robot this is a dog what looks like a dog and i want to take it home it's not even real that's how this technology plays tricks on your mind i see the boston dynamics dog and i'm like i need to adopt this dog but it's not even a dog and it can perform tasks such as carrying objects or inspecting hazardous environments robotics is an area i wish i got into when i was younger and i say that because it's continuing to become more and more popular especially as ai continues to grow in demand combining that with robotics is just a really interesting combination and it's one of those things for anyone who is hands-on and likes to build things and feel what they're actually building this is an interesting area the possibilities for robots are pretty much endless when you start thinking of what they are capable of in certain situations could you put a robot there instead of an actual human think of firefighters or people who are in dangerous situations could we instead replace those people the dangerous part of their jobs i'm not saying their jobs as a whole but the dangerous part of their jobs with a robot or have a robot a system pretty interesting alright there is my list i hope you enjoyed it i'm curious to hear your take on this are there some you agree with disagree with are there some that i missed leave in the comments and if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button give this video a like leave a comment i do my absolute best to answer every single one of your comments although i'm not perfect because i'm not a robot i do my absolute best i love you all and i'll see you soon thank you [music] too [music]
