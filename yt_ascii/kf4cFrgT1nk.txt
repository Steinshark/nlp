ladies and gentlemen i got into a fight you see chess content got a little bit boring so i decided to mix it up throw on some boxing gloves and get into my first ever exhibition chess boxing match now you may remember in december of 2022 i actually did commentary on a massive chess boxing event that was organized by lwig in los angeles chess boxing is a real sport and in essence what chess boxing is is a match that is split into a chess game with a certain set amount of time in rounds and boxing so essentially if you're losing on the chess game you could try to knock your opponent out so march 1st and 2nd i went to boston i was invited to the mit sloan sports analytics conference fantastic conference a lot of incredible brilliant people there giving present ations and there was a chess boxing demo day and the chess boxing that we were doing was a version of chess boxing called chess boxing fit so the format was split into a chess game but for the boxing we would be hitting mits so somebody would be holding ms and we would be tracking our heart rate and the power of our punches and my opponent for this chess boxing matchup was none other than the chief chess officer for chess.com danny wrench here's the format of the event and i will put time stamps on the video player first we played a baseline blitz chess game 5 minutes to show how we play chess when our heart rate is at its normal state then we began the three boxing rounds the first two boxing rounds we had to memorize a combination and the third boxing round was just punch one two for a full minute straight to elevate your heart rate as high as possible obviously in a real boxing match you can just go at your opponent but the point of memorizing a combination was to engage our brain throughout the process boxing round number one was a onew slip the punch cross duck under hook hook that's a long combination boxing round number two was all punches it was one two uppercut uppercut uppercut hook hook and round three was just ones and twos and so let's see how i did in my first ever chess boxing exhibition here's the baseline chess game we drew colors behind the back and i selected the black pawn i actually really wanted to play with the black pieces cuz i'm very confident in my caroan even at a peak level of exhaustion danny started with e4 which i was aware of and then i played the caroon now keep in mind at this point we are wearing heart rate monitors and everything my heart rate's around 88 87 my resting heart rate is usually like 55 it's gotten into the 40s in my life when i've been in good shape but obviously here with all the craziness around it was about 80 85 it would touch 90 danny took and then he played c4 this is the pan enough and this is a 5minute game so you know it's a little bit longer than a traditional blitz game i really wanted to ease into it and also i wanted to win this game because i knew that technically i was a better boxer than danny because i've boxed more than danny but i had no idea how i was going to perform at a level of exhaustion if you've never boxed before i highly recommend trying it at least on a heavy bag or on ms you will learn very quickly you are not in shape at all now to my surprise danny played bishop g5 i was very much expecting like a slow positional game i haven't played this line in a while but this is a line that invites a lot of complications and so i played knight e4 which i think fits my style very well this is a very very sharp and provocative line of the caroan and the point is to hit the bishop and the knight right away and then induce kind of bring forward this move d5 and knight e5 there's a very sharp line here white plays queen d4 black plays f6 defending the knight knight white wins a pawn intending to take here and then black plays like queen b6 and e6 and so on it's very sharp very complicated but danny played a move i'd never seen before which is queen d2 and already i was on my own and you know a good sign of of of of whether an opening is any good or not is how you react once the opening phase is over so here i thought a little bit i i thought about f6 i i really would like to play e6 but i can't bishop f5 and by the way we have these noise cancelling headphones that you're going to see yeah they they didn't work at all so like we could hear robert hes doing commentary in the room so robert hes is talking everybody's talking but we can't get specific moves we've got to think about our position here and so i played bishop f5 and i thought bishop f5 was a very clever move just defending the pawn enabling knight to d3 check which is now defended and in the future i will play queen b6 and rook c8 i was a little worried about this move c5 but i don't think it's a particularly good move i hadn't gotten to punching yet and i hadn't been punched in the head yet cuz it would have been illegal i also thought for a second i blundered a piece like i was very nervous throughout this whole experience cuz again it's a spectacle a bunch of people are watching you and you don't want to look like a fool but this is complet no you just play queen a5 and white has to lose the right to castle and will'll find themselves in a whole bunch of trouble if you you know if if they're not careful so danny went bishop e2 and i decided to play queen d7 which unpin the pawn and you know i just want to play e6 and develop my bishop and i want to castle danny went f4 which i thought played directly into my hands and here i saw a very nice simplification of the position i played knight to d3 check he probably should take my knight because otherwise he loses the right to castle and then he played knight f3 very simple decision now for myself i found a very nice idea here to to kick out his pieces and quickly get mobilized f6 only move is bishop h4 and now i am preventing knight e5 and this is one of these rare rare cases my king might actually be better on f7 than castled so i'm getting my bishop out to c5 i'm threatening him with queen e6 which is a fork of the pawn on c4 and already i realized right away like th this is actually exactly why i wanted to get a caroan on the board cuz i i know this opening really well and even at a point of complete and utter and total exhaustion i was like i'm confident that i can win in aaroon you know eight times out of 10 let's put it this way danny castled so danny gave away upon the center of the board he tried to attack my king by sacrificing a pawn but like i said my king is completely safe on f7 there is no knight e5 check and now my plan is to go here bring my rooks and just be up a pawn and you'll notice that pawn which was the entire like it it was born via the opening like when i played knight here that pawn was literally born in the center and then it transferred like that so that that that was that was a c pawn i mean just think about it that was my se c pawn look at my c pawn d5 that's my c pawn going to d5 that's my c pawn going to e4 and now that pawn goes to d3 so this c pawn lived quite a quite a life it made it through the entire position and i got the exact position that i wanted i i traded bishops i brought my rook to the center and my plan was look invest fully in this pawn like i i'm noticing danny's going to create some counterplay with things like rook c7 i'm noticing that danny is going you know maybe queen c5 and stuff like this but i thought if i just trade and bring all my pieces to the center it's going to be impossible to deal with this pawn it's two squares away from queening so just naturally i'm thinking i've got to be able to win this game so he plays queen to a5 and i played b6 simultaneously retargeting his pawn in the center because his queen can't protect it guarding my pawn in the corner i played rook e4 which was a stupid move rookie rookie 4 i played because i just wanted him to think like i was sensing the danny was slowing down here and not liking his position but rather than playing the very simple queen d5 i decided to do this which was kind of just dumb cuz you know he played here and he could have taken my pawn and then i probably would have gone for his knight but danny went to trade rooks with me and i found this nice defensive idea bishop d7 so now i have about 45 seconds he has 15 and i am threatening all sorts of nasty stuff i very quickly push my pawn play bishop g4 the queen is hanging the knight is about to be opened up rookie one is on the way and i mean danny had like 3 seconds so he just took my rook but he resigned and i was very happy because this was an extremely smooth game like i don't beat danny very often in games like this we always have very complicated back and forth games i was very happy to win this game and again i'm like i i i think i have an advantage going into the boxing because they're going to measure our heart rate how technical we are well now we start the official chess boxing portion so it's one round of boxing remember the first combination one two then we slip boom and then you're going to see that you're going to see a little bit of bloopers anyway roll the tape here is here are some highlights of the round one of the boxing match slip two we're starting in three two one and time in right side had or i'm sorry left side had one up if it comes down to one differential we subtract one we are already 10 seconds in we're looking at that punch power still very equal 31- 31 33-34 still going levy looking clean danny fighting like floyd mayweather with that lead hand down philly shell style i don't know if that's intentional or you know just happening we're halfway through the round let's make some noise for these two heart rates are going up let's get heart rate cam what did that heart rate look like 156 to 80 who's who danny's high danny's higher so danny's up to 156 levy is keeping it nice and low at 97 an impressive low heart rate while boxing i hear the exhales from levy every time he's punching he's letting little exhales go as he tenses his stomach doing a really good job and we are at time woo round of applause gloves come off we're starting to control our breath go over to the board try to lower that heart rate engage the part of our brain that's really good at chest danny's sitting at 159 levy's at 111 that was intense but my heart rate monitor was broken so i think danny got to about a heart rate of 140 150 mine said it was 8090 that's definitely wrong i i i think knowing myself i got to about 110 120 a six move combination is a lot to remember because you got to remember in a real boxing sparring whatever any of you that have experienced know you're not thinking like one two slip b roll like it it you know this is actually kind of hard and if they were doing strict judging it it it's it's a very very different thing now they made us switch colors which i was not prepared for i thought we would have to play the exact same colors i was ready to play a caroan they said switch colors which i might file a form of protest cuz the previous match played the same colors twice anyway we sit down i'm i'm feeling good like i feel you know like i did a warm-up round i'm not exhausted yet i open up with pawn to d4 and i know that danny plays knight f6 so i play bishop to g5 we've played a lot of openings against each other actually we did a video on the lie detector back in toronto if you haven't seen that video i think it's a good video you should definitely check it out after this video and danny played c5 and so this time i thought thought okay rather than playing d5 and locking up the center i'm going to play knight c3 now to my surprise danny played really fast so he like he was snapping off moves in the opening pawn takes queen takes he went here and then i rotated my queen and one of the most fun lines to play here is when black plays e6 because you castle queens side black goes here and then black tries to attack your bishop you say you can't capture it black castles and then you play knight f3 and i've had this in some blitz games and it's very funny because basically you just get this attack and black can't do anything about it like you're just going to win the game on the next move by playing e5 or rook d3 rook h3 queen h8 and i've had this in in a handful of games unfortunately danny you know either knew or was bluffing really well he played d6 which is the principled approach you're trying to bring the bishop out here you kind of know that i've developed all that so i probably will castle and then he's going to play bishop e6 and queen a5 so i didn't waste any time i castled as well we're both pretty fresh at this point i don't think we're particularly tired he goes here i play king b1 he might have played queen a5 first we transposed and i went e4 now technically e4 is a mistake like very small technical detail he could take this which i didn't even think i mean technically he can't the idea is queen e4 queen g5 the other idea is that he can take on a2 i didn't even like it didn't even dawn on me that he could do that danny played a6 here with a very clear indication that he would like to play b5 and so i had a moment right where i was like i i needed to make a game plan and i'm in a chess boxing match now we're not going to hit each other but i know that i'm going to get tired and knowing that i'm going to get get tired what type of position do i want to go for with lower time on the clock oh by the way one thing that i have not mentioned but i probably will mention because i will re-record and then put it in the intro but we can still you know we can still have this portion in because the magic of video editing the person that loses each boxing round loses 15 seconds on the clock so just in case the position is really complicated it's not a good thing to lose 15 seconds on the clock and i thought okay look i can get in a fight i can keep a lot of pieces on the board let's but let's be solid because if i get into a positional game i think i have better chances right chess is an ego game if i think i'm the better player than my opponent i want to minimize my risk if i want to minimize my risk i want to minimize a tactical position now here danny actually really surprised me because i thought danny was going to play b5 and mix it up but danny went queen h5 i thought oh this is perfect he's kind of falling completely into my trap all right he he's going for a positional game and i can't play queen g3 normally i would play queen g3 but he can take and then my knight can't guard both my rook and my and my my pawn in the center so i took on h5 he took and i thought okay i'm going to go here i'm going to advance my pawns i'm gna you know put my bishop out i'm going to play knight f3 very easy game even first round chess round is over so that was the first chess round now it's time for the second boxing round which like i said one two and then it's the uppercuts and then it's hook hook which i actually like more i like just straight up punching i don't want to dodge i would be a bad fighter but i i i just enjoy that a bit more here is the second boxing round we're starting the boxing in three two one let's go as many punches as we can we are at a 21 differential so far we got a one minute timer we're 10 seconds in we'll just go down to one minute okay boom lots of power coming from danny again 15s all right only about 15 seconds left we're going for a burnout in three two one all punches all punches one twos one twos one twos there we go danny there we go levy levy cool cal collected look at that heart rate nice and low for levy levy and excellent shape 74 ft per minute danny spiking at 130 and time all right awesome job let's get this back in that round was very tough in particular because at the end they made us do 10 to 15 seconds of pure burnout like i told you if you've never boxed before and those of you that know that last 10 15 seconds with the round i mean if you're actually getting in a fight you got to be sharp at the end you can't guess out like my trainer has always told me in the last 10 seconds of any exercise you have to go the hardest because it conditions your brain you can't just be like oh it's over in 10 seconds i'm going to quit no you got to condition your brain to go hard at the end of the round so i'm gassed all right like i'm not going to lie i'm i'm tired but i won both boxing rounds so the first two boxing rounds i won i'm a better technical boxer i'm not insulting danny i'm just saying i have more experience so i think i was landing the combinations better i mean it still look rough but you know for all intents and purposes so i won the boxing round he got docked another 15 seconds so i'm very confident at this point i'm tired but i'm confident and we sit down and i already know my plan right i i i it's just a matter of deciding which of these moves is going to go first but we sit down and i play f4 and my plan here is is very simple i want to advance these pawns without allowing counterplay i'm going to threaten the knight to push the knight back and then i'm going to play knight f3 knight g5 i'm going to play f5 i'm just going to get a great position tiredness level you know again when you're sitting back down and you're kind of breathing you're you're getting less tired but i definitely was a bit tired so he went g6 and the idea for him was to develop his dark sored bishop i played bishop e2 which is like half a threat and half just kind of like i want to take the knight and damage your pawns but i also maybe want to go g4 and and and and shove you backwards danny really surprised me here danny played a move here where i thought i'm going to win this game in the next 10 or 15 moves like i thought the exhaustion was getting to him i had a moment here he went rook g8 which is a crazy move to play the idea of ruk g8 is understandable the idea is if bishop takes pawn takes of course so he's countering my idea but that was never the real idea i mean the real idea was g4 f5 either now or knight f3 knight g5 so by playing rook g8 weakening this pawn preventing any future castling i thought i have a massive advantage right now like i can sense it i can sense my opponent is making slightly dubious decisions whether it's the exhaustion whether it's the chess and this was my moment this was the moment i needed to strike the best plan here for white is g4 forcing the knight back to f6 or to g7 and then f5 but remember what i told you here i told you i kind of made a like a note to myself to keep the position straightforward just in case i burn out i don't want to play a tactical crazy game like i don't want to get into a huge fight because then if i come back to the board and i'm exhausted i'm not going to be able to calculate on to burn a lot of clock time and i remember very clearly sending this message to my brain like just just play the lazy move just play knight f3 just play knight f3 and then play knight g5 and then play g4 and then play f5 and danny played rook c8 and mentally mentally for me the fight changed right here the match the exhibition changed right here i i thought it was just i'm going to melt him like i thought i'm going to go knight g5 he's going to go here i can even take a pawn by the way but i thought you know it's going to be knight knight here he's going to play h6 i'm going to take i'm going to damage his pawns then i'm going to shove his knight backwards then i'm going to play bishop e3 like i just thought i'm going to walk over the black position positionally i played knight g5 and danny counter punch with knight d4 this was a very well-timed move removing my control of the center by walking over here danny now attacks me so he's threatening rook tap ak and here j like just you know he's threatening rook takes or he's threatening knight e2 and then bishop g4 threatening a bunch of stuff night4 and i thought okay easy peasy but suddenly danny's causing me some problems and i couldn't get my wits about me like seeing these two pieces suddenly come alive i couldn't understand where i should put my rook the boxing round is about to begin i'm like what do i do i you know i i i don't really see a difference like rookie one rook f1 like why would i put my rook on f1 i want my rook here on f1 i don't want to play so so i played rook e1 and right here it all changed he took took and played knight f3 and i was like oh no and some mistakes in chess are mildly punishable this one is completely punishable because now he forks me he wins my bishop and he wins my pawn and and i'm i'm just down a pawn with damag structure and isolated pawn in the center i'm much worse much much much worse i would dare even say completely lost it all changed for me when i played a touch too lazy like a little bit too solid and he got for me mentally i'm telling you my brain when all this started happening i of course should play rook f1 so that at least if knight h3 takes takes there's no fork but black is completely fine already but it all changed and so here is the fascinating dynamic about real chess boxing if we were in a real fight i know what i have to do if i know i'm in this position and i'm going into a boxing round and it's the last boxing round what do i have to do i got to go forward and i got to attack i got to empty the gas tank i got to put my opponent away or else my opponent's probably going to beat me in the in the end game cuz he's really good he's an international master but we we're not doing that we're not hitting each other i'm not saying i would have won i'm just saying that's the difference in dynamic so now it's the third round and it is my worst round i am terrible at one minute boxing round like at one minute as hard as possible on the heavy bag if any of you have done a minute straight in a heavy bag you know that stuff is so tiring well here's a little bit of boxing round number three we're going in three two one time man punch punch punch punch punch punch punch punch all right levy starting with about a 40 point advantage in this final round punching as fast as we can very clean straight out straight back for danny our fighters want to be making sure that they're breathing with every punch they're holding their breath while they're exerting this much energy it's a good way to pass out or punch yourself out if you've heard that term in boxing we are 20 seconds in 40 to go this might look like a sprint but to them it feels like a marathon and they have to sprint this marathon if they're going to win this time advantage for the next chest round we're over halfway now fully extending those punches breathing moving moving those feet moving those hands danny has kept about the same consistent range of motion this whole time d's just passed ly score crossing 500 that cardio kick it in that cross cardio baby let's go and 5 seconds four count with me three two one time awesome work awesome work gloves come off danny passing levy in that final round so it's going from bad to worse i make a mistake on the chessboard i'm down a minute i lose the boxing round so i lose boxing round three by such an extent that danny overtakes me in the overall performance but i i think the equipment was broken so now not only am i in a bad position down a minute i lose 15 seconds to start this round yeah rough stuff i was so tired one minute straight on ms is really really really tough danny was crushing it this was danny's best round because we he didn't have to memorize combinations he could focus purely on his endurance and his endurance is great like danny is in incredible shape so he completely overtook me in the board and the box boxing and now i'm down a minute and like 20 seconds and i got to save this game i tried my best i i played h4 not to lose the pawn and i knew that the only way to draw this game would to would be to go to an opposite colored bishop end game like if i can get the opposite colored bishops and a little bit less pieces on the board it's probably going to be holdable so i played knight d5 i traded but this is misery this is a really really tough position probably what i should do here is is is focus on my rooks just kind of keep my rooks on the second rank make sure i don't have any back rank problems prevent his rooks from getting into the game but i was like i got a minute i got to do something i got to i got so i played h5 which was probably wrong but i was really worried that dany himself would play h5 and this is very methodical putting your fixing your opponent's pawns on the same color square as your bishop so i thought danny was is going to play h5 after which you know the rook is coming here in the future and it's just very very bad so i sacrificed my own pawn i thought well i'm damaging his pawns so the effect is not really felt let me safeguard my king let me activate my bishop i have to make him think i'm down a minute i got to make moves that make danny think and to my credit i did i actually did i i got my bishop in here sacrificed this pawn and i thought hey we're we're making some progress you know and if like he didn't do that you know if danny played like you know b6 h3 if if this was the position well yeah but then i'm i'm at least holding my pawn from a distance and and and maybe i'm not totally lost danny took on h2 and and now for me the best thing here would have been to trade rooks which i would have never in a million years done take this pawn and try to advance so the way that white creates counterplay here is to create pass pawns on opposite sides of course his is faster but you know i i i have a pawn and you know he would probably play bishop e5 and i play a4 and and but he's winning instead of that i thought danny hung upon you're his king and now i'm threatening checkmate oh but unfortunately despite the boxing yeah danny just disconnects my rooks here and it's actually a lot worse than that because now i am getting obliterated which i totally missed in my low time and as punishment for my my poor boxing yeah now he just plays rook g2 and it's actually just over i can't guard my pawn and i can't guard the other pawn which means my king is going to get swarmed and i'm totally lost so i could do a bunch of stuff here that prolongs the game for you know 10 moves max but i decided you know what danny earned it let's play it out till checkmate and the opposite colored bishops benefit the attacking side here is a perfect example of why bishop g5 and rook b1 checkmate and danny beat me and you know in this game i i wouldn't say that the boxing exhausted me i i i don't think i made these kind of series of slightly inaccurate decisions due to the boxing although let's just say that it didn't help of course i mean i don't think i would have made such a mistake with 80 heart rate i think it was more like a game planning mistake i think i i i mentally wanted to play a slow and calm game and that way i wouldn't have to you know i wouldn't risk making a mistake in a complex battle like the first carl kh game was pretty straightforward but that was my mistake i actually should have welcomed grabbing the bull by the horns and and trying to play a little bit more aggressively and i didn't i chose the wrong game plan in the middle game danny very quickly and correctly punished me for my inaccuracies and there's some mistakes in chess you do not bounce back from and this is one of them and in normal fight i would have tried to put hands on my opponent but i'm scared of danny he's he's in very very good shape and also if we were putting hands on each other he could have knocked me out in the first round but the dynamic here was kind of sealed already i tried my best but unfortunately i lost so i am officially 0 and one in chess boxing fit which apparently is the style of this type of format i won the baseline game i lost the chess boxing game but i don't think it was because of pure exhaustion i just think i made a mistake but we'll never know maybe i'll do another one of these in the future maybe this is the way andrea botes and i will finally fight because we know how a real fight would go i'd probably have to go to the hospital with her cuz she would be so beaten up anyway this was my first ever chess boxing exhibition match and it was a lot of fun a lot of fun hopefully you enjoyed the video now get out of here
