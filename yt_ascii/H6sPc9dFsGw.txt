two thousand six hundred sixty eight dollars and twenty six cents this just in it turns out expensive cars have expensive repairs now if you're checking out this wheel right here and you're wondering wait a minute wheels are round and it's sitting on a flat surface how come it's not rolling well this wheel isn't round anymore as you can see it's got a nice little flat spot right there from hitting a pothole now i've never liked low profile tires i really don't think they have many objective advantages they do allow for you know larger brakes and they might have slightly better steering response but they come with a lot of disadvantages the reason why it's done really is for aesthetics and if you've ever looked at me you've probably been aesthetically pleased however you might know that i prefer you know function over form and so in this case i really do like the tesla model 3 performance unfortunately it only comes with this size wheel which is part of the performance package which they all come with now so a 20 inch wheel is what comes on the car so i thought you know what how bad can it be riding on a low profile tire with these massive wheels and i found out we hit a pothole and i know what comes next here comes the blame game hey jason have you considered not hitting a pothole that's a great idea but it was unavoidable so first of all if you've ever driven in the midwestern united states i really don't need to say anymore second of all i wasn't driving but i don't blame the person who was driving reason being it was unavoidable there was traffic to our right in a merge lane coming into our lane there was traffic to our left in the passing lane we had nowhere to go there's a big pothole in front of us we hit it no big deal sometimes these things happen so what happened well on the passenger side after hitting the pothole front and rear wheels we got two flat tires and two broken wheels and this wasn't some strange wild back road that we were on this was on a state maintained public highway we'll get more into that later on in the video okay so why did this cost so much so we're just going to take a look here at the invoice the tire itself is 340 i looked on tire rack these are listed for 350 so that's a fair price that they're charging there the wheels they charge 715 dollars for so of course we have two tires two wheels that's about 2 000 once we add that up we also had to get an alignment it was pulling to the right once they put the new tires and wheels on so an alignment was 280 and then we have 380 in labor the service center's hourly rate is 175. so our total amount being 2668.26 for split second hitting a pothole ouch so you're thinking wow that must have been the worst pothole ever and yes it was a bad pothole but was it the worst pothole ever no and how do i know this well we pull aside after getting the two flats and call tesla roadside assistance and it took them an hour and 40 minutes to get a tow truck to us to take us to the nearest service center so while we were waiting on the side of the highway during that hour and 40 minutes not a single other car pulled over from a flat tire so i don't have all the data in the world but i sat there for 100 minutes watching all the cars go by and not a single one got a flat tire while we did going over this pothole and not just one but two so why did so much damage occur to this car while so many other cars just kept driving past and when you start to analyze this vehicle the tires and the wheels you start to kind of get an idea of why that may be and so of course yes part of it has to do with the fact that it has low profile tires the other part is these wheels are actually pretty narrow so there's not a whole lot of you know contact that's hitting the ground anyways they're pretty narrow tires on top of all of this this is a very heavy vehicle 4 100 pounds about so a lot of weight is going on a pretty narrow tire with very low profile on it and so you know you kind of start to add these things together on top of which this suspension doesn't have a whole lot of travel it's the performance version so it has the largest wheels the lowest profile and the least amount of suspension travel they actually reduce the suspension ride height by 10 millimeters for the performance so that means it's going to have to be a little bit stiffer and also a little bit stiffer to accommodate for this weight so when you have a stiff suspension low profile tires that are super skinny you know you add it all up and it turns out when you hit a pretty decent sized pothole which this certainly was now you end up with some damage and you have this cracked wheel like we see right here now am i saying that it's tesla's fault that this happened no we hit the pothole weather created that pothole and illinois department of transportation did not fix that pothole so if anyone is to blame it's those three it's not necessarily tesla they simply put a wheel on a car and i drove it hit a pothole and damaged it i'm not saying this is tesla's fault but i do think it's disappointing that on a car this heavy with all these elements that i discussed there is not an option for a smaller wheel so there used to be when the performance first came out you didn't have to get the performance brakes and you had a smaller wheel option and unless you're taking this thing on a track you really don't need these performance brakes you've got all the regen from the motors that's going to do most of the braking anyways so it's disappointing that you can't get these without this performance package for the discounted price they all come with the performance package that means they all come with 20 inch wheels and that means they all come with low profile tires low profile tires are simply the trend now in the performance world and i think that's disappointing so aside from the fact that running a low profile tire means you're more likely to run into flat tires or damaged wheels what are the other actual disadvantages here so one of them being cost as your wheels get larger your wheels get more expensive as your tires have to fit around a larger wheel size these tires get significantly more expensive so one disadvantage they're being cost another being ride quality so your tires actually act like a second suspension for your car and they're a big part of the ride quality of your car so when you get these really narrow these short little sidewalls here that have to be very stiff your ride quality is very stiff as a result so you reduce the quality of the ride now you do get a little bit better steering response because it turns very quickly you don't have any mushiness really here in the tire but again it takes away from ride quality and then finally when you have these really low profile tires it means you're using these really big wheels and these really big wheels turn out to be very heavy and so you have a large rotational unsprung mass none of which is good so from a performance standpoint really you want smaller wheels as long as you can fit the size break that you need now i'm not here to complain about how much all of this cost i bought an expensive vehicle i have to live with the consequences of if i do face repairs they're probably not going to be cheap so that is entirely on me i'm not going to deny though that i think that it's super lame that hitting a pothole something that takes less than a second means three grand is now gone that's very disappointing because there's a lot of cool things that you can do with three thousand dollars there's a lot of great things that you can do for other people for three thousand dollars so to simply replace two wheels and two tires that were brand new that had 2500 miles on them that's pretty lame i mean they weren't even curved if they had been curbed then i feel like i could have at least validated it and been like well it's okay now my car looks a little bit better but really no change three grand gone so that that part is disappointing but the thing that made me the most upset about this experience is that two people voiced their concern that i probably wasn't going to get these wheels fixed the same day so the first person was when i was getting towed to the service center and he was saying you know it's rare that they have those 20-inch wheels in stock you're probably gonna have to stay here for a bit while they get those shipped in and this was in chicago now i'm 2000 miles from home so this is really my only option i got to get wheels put on and i got to continue along with my road trip so the second person once we got to the service center and tesla roadside had not informed the service center that we were showing up so when i showed up it was like who's this guy why is he here and i'm like hey i need new wheels i just called service and they're like well we haven't communicated with them so that part wasn't great but then once i showed up they were like oh okay what wheels do we need to get on there are those the 19s we should have those no problem and i said no this is the model 3 performance it's got the 20 inch wheels and immediately you could see they're like uh-oh because they were concerned and they were like oh you know it's it's we don't always have those in stock and it's like are you kidding me like why would a place not stock the only wheel for this vehicle at a service center so showed up at the service center and they were shocked that they had them in stock and that i could keep going along on my road trip and also i was pretty lucky in this scenario because i was just 28 miles away from a tesla service center the warranty what it says is that you have to be within 50 miles otherwise you have to pay to tow yourself to the service center but in a lot of the places in the country you're not anywhere near a service center so where i live in idaho i'm 350 miles away from the nearest service center so it's like that's that's a huge inconvenience if you were to get a pothole luckily we have nice roads in idaho not like the midwest where this happened i'm not sure where i'm going with this so all said and done from when we hit the pothole to when we were back on the road it took six and a half hours and that was pretty much best case scenario because we were within 50 miles of a service center and they had wheels in stock so everything that needed to happen happened same day in the time that it should have occurred so six and a half hour ordeal is pretty much best case scenario if you hit a pothole and you damage your wheels now as i mentioned this happened on a state maintained highway so legally you can submit a claim to that state's department of transportation and say hey your road was broken you broke my car you have to pay for what you broke now the challenge here is that the state must be found negligent so i filed a claim for this expense and i included my invoice and all that stuff but when i was talking with the lady on the phone with illinois department of transportation she said the state has to be found negligent and basically what this means is first of all someone has to report that pothole so the state knows that it's there then the state has 30 days to actually do something about the pothole and if it happens to be raining for any of those 30 days well it doesn't really count because you can't fix potholes in the rain and so essentially what she was saying is you know go ahead and file the claim but it's extremely unlikely that you're actually going to get anything out of this so i filed it we will see what happens but it seems like the state here kind of has all the leverage so you're telling the state hey will you pay for this and then the state just gets to decide on their own it's not really like this insane legal process so they just say no we weren't negligent we just have potholes because it's the midwest it's terrible winters and then everything's ruined in the spring and it rains now perhaps the tone of this video has kind of been a bit of a bummer and that's not my intention i'm generally a positive guy and i try to look on the bright side i do think in this scenario you know it would be nice for all tesla service centers first of all to stock these wheels and i think a super great bonus would be if we were you know if there were' inch wheel options for these model 3 performances i think that would be awesome so those are those are my two suggestions for whatever they're worth which is literally nothing but i do really enjoy this vehicle i think you know for the price it is an insane vehicle it's face melting fast when you put your foot down i quite enjoy it i think this whole scenario was a bit of a bummer because three grand hit a pothole is is not thrilling but either way this is advice and tips and whatever and you can take that information and do whatever you may with it but know if you're buying one of these things and considering going on a road trip this is potentially what might happen thank you all so much for watching if any of you have any pothole tire wheel destroying stories i would enjoy reading them in the comments below just so i can be like well it's having other people i don't feel so terrible but thanks again for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
