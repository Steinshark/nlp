so i wanted to quickly you know cover a bit about speaking online and motivate you to give talks online first talk was already a very good introduction into into giving talks and a lot of that is true for giving talks online except that you're basically if you give talks online you have to be comfortable with keeping your own pace and just not necessarily have always the feedback from the audience because you only have one monitor for example me so but i want to point out that speaking online for you as someone who wants to start speaking as a huge opportunity if you want to get started in preparing talks giving talks you know give tutorial talks like for users just stuff which is easy to prepare to give which is interesting for many programmers which you don't want to get used to talked about something and you can present your ideas to an online audience very easy nowadays and and let me quickly point out that music was online this year has an online track again this pre-recorded talks mostly this is a default we would like to pre-record most of the talks when not like all of them and i actually am able to you know i have the tooling for that as we're just you know using here for streaming this also can record talks so we will be doing that in this setting this is a lot easier to organize and at the day when you speak you will not have any internet or tech problems and also of course for me as an organizer this is just a lot better to know that something in the cloud triggers the video feedback and then it plays and it's a lot less stressful for both sides so that's why we went for online content to say if you are able to pre-record we would prefer that it's not always possible sometimes speakers don't have time for that and they then have to give their talk stuff that is also looking so you know from last year also want to point out like if you're already into video recording and making videos and you want to make a fun video for the conference which is your talk presents on some topic that's also an option and i know that unfortunately david thinker we don't have here but david sancho actually did that once was an awesome talk and i know we have some youtubers so if you have a youtube channel or you want to start one that that be your option to to you know have your video as a talk at meeting c plus plus and also listen of course this then that i want to you know reach out with that to all the people which so far couldn't give a talk at media c plus plus because they're not able to come to me because we're in berlin and maybe you have visa issues maybe you have just travel issues that you you don't like to fly especially not long distance or maybe you have a family and you can't just you know fly away for a weekend maybe your current boss doesn't like the idea and wouldn't let you go you don't want to take like your holidays off that's fine many of us has a bit of a different opinion on that when do you just you know tell them that you know there's a start for your employer that can give a lot more support to your talk or so maybe you're able to talk about something what you did at work some companies are not very happy about that idea and other companies are like totally happy to let you share what they did or what you did at your work what your team did and and make that part of your talk content-wise new material is great but old ideas are also worth thinking about you know they can have their merit and maybe you already have slides right you maybe you already you know do presentations that work and you have slides about c plus plus 11 or 14 or 17 or 20 and you just you know have a basis and can that just turn that into a talk add a bit of styles and a bit of material screenshot here some statistics here some poll there and you have a talk the other thing i want to stress is like maybe you already have given the talk right for the online track we're looking for speakers so maybe you could give it again online and maybe that that is you know for you to the way to become a speaker at media c plus this year and i want to point out that of course you know if you don't have that or to talk lying around we're always looking for new speakers you're welcome to join us either if you're able to come to berlin and speak on site and adjust your breathing and stage as phil just mentioned or you're able to pre-record a talk on your own or less media c plus plus also maybe your company has like i know that some speakers have pre-recorded their talks with their company equipment so maybe your company has a studio or something like that can be used for that and in that way also you can add to the knowledge base of c plus i want to point out that you don't need to be an expert necessarily to start speaking if you are an expert or consider yourself an expert that is also a good way to start speaking or continue speaking you don't need to be if you just give an introductory talk into presenting that's how we do game deaf at our company or that's how we use cute boost there's so many frameworks used in c plus plus fully and all the others come to mind introduction talks and how to get started with that how to build it how to you know use it some examples it's really low hanging fruit which usually is not picked up by a lot of speakers if you want to start speaking that's a good way to start i want to point out if you're speaking and submit talks submitting multiple talk ideas is great especially if you like submit to the topics that have competition there's a lot of rangers talks this year two years ago when tina will play which is a short speaking she sent me to the rangers talk and that was a great introduction into rangers and that was a great idea back then this year i already see that we have a lot of talks on ranges and probably more coming because of average because submitting sees this last year core routines was a really popular topic where we had five to six submissions and two or three people speaking on the conference about it and yeah be aware that you know potentially if a committee member or paper authors or just general other speakers are have submitted or maybe submitting on the same topic that is currently popular or is like a top feature of c plus 20 or 23 it's still fine to submit to that but think about having like you know a second horse on the race which maybe it's just an easy to do talk on an overview on how to get started with cute boost or any other library and c plus or maybe it's good some other connected technologies tools these talks are very very valuable for the audience and they are usually not that often submitted so that's kind of an venue and avenue field where new speakers also can fill in the holes which we have currently and the speaking landscape where people submit things and talks to especially like things in gamedev we have very very few submissions in game dev if at all i want to mention embedded i want to mention finance anything work related science scientific computing there's a lot of great topics out there where you can give talks on which are not necessarily always covered in our submissions so if you're the one person to submit the talk for that you're probably having a good horse in that race and a quick word on the top lengths on-site talks should be 60 minutes with 5 to 15 minutes on questions online talks have the same lengths on the schedule it can be a lot less i've seen people give online talks in 30 minutes which probably could have been an hour if they had the pacing under control but also have seen that a lot of people went over time online so if you're speaking online don't be don't be focus on the time don't be worried about that i've seen people go over time i've seen people do it faster and it never mattered to the talk okay one thing if you're like really short if you're if you're pacing is out of control i had that issue once i couldn't control myself because i was on stage speaking and finished my talk 20 25 minutes too early and in that case i pulled a rabbit out of my head i just was like no no we have the questions then i have left a little bit more time for questions so that we can debate about this topic and you know the audience felt engaged with that and we had an audience and happy engaged discussion and question round so that worked out so you know that's a trick maybe to have up your sleeve if you're agree like you know happen to have a talk finished early then you can always engage with the audience and the last thing of course is always to submit your talk um
