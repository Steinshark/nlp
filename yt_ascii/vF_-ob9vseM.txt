i'd like to set you a puzzle. the puzzle is about a cat and a mouse and, as is traditional in cat and mouse situations, one is chasing the other. the mouse is super quick compared to a cat, even though the cat is pretty quick, but in this case to keep it interesting the mouse has, without realising, run into a pond. there's his whiskers and little tail. and it can go anywhere in the pond because the cat - (brady: worst mouse ever!)
- what do you mean? it's like - it's got to be small, hasn't it? like, i could draw it big, and then you'd be like "worst pond ever" compared to the mouse. anyway, to scale then, here is the cat. good enough? no. how's that?
- (brady: it's got to have ears.)
- all right. ears. that's not bad! 
- (brady: that's better.) music] so, for the sake of the puzzle, the cat is gonna sit on the edge but it can cruise around the edge waiting for the mouse to leave the pond. (brady: so it's like stalking the edge?)
- exactly. now, i think it's believable that even though the mouse could run quicker than the cat on land, in water it's going to slow down. but it can swim, we're not gonna - we'll do the modeling situation, you know, assume some things, like the mouse is not going to drown. it can swim. assume the cat doesn't actually go in the water although it probably could and swipe it from the edge. all of that stuff, let's just assume it sensibly for puzzle world. and let's assume the cat can run four times quicker than the mouse can swim. in fact, that's the only numerical detail i'm gonna give. the cat can walk or run four times quicker than the mouse can swim. and that's it. so the simple question now is, can the mouse escape? [music] there we go.
- (brady: it's not a ben sparks video without a computer animation.) well, bit of a geogebra file with some nice brown paper to represent our pond, as ever. we've got a cat who runs around the edge. luckily, he looks in the right direction, i'm very proud of that animation. i'm very glad that everyone else is appreciating that. the mouse can go anywhere he likes. if he goes the other side the cat does check where he's going, but let's assume he starts at the centre. and there's a couple of things to sort out first, is that one tactic the mouse could do is the obvious one of run away. in this case swim away. but you could just say like, why don't you as a mouse just swim away from the cat? and what i mean from that is like if you imagine a line from the cat to the mouse, wherever that is, imagine that line, and the mouse swims in the opposite direction. and i can show you that happening actually. so i'm going to click this button up here, is the away tactic. and the reason i'm showing you is that it doesn't work. you can see the mouse is following this little arrow, which is moving around depending where the cat is, but the cat is so quick that he can always kind of get around to head the mouse off. even though it looks like he was going to make it, the cat comes around real quick. and we get these actually nice patterns are turning up, which are typical of these curves of pursuit. they're usually kind of curvy, they're not always easy to model mathematically. and these ones, that you know, they're almost getting symmetrical but there's a little bit of randomness. can you see the cat wobbles when he gets in line 'cause he's constantly trying to move, but he doesn't need to move because he's already as close as he can get to the mouse. but it's pretty obvious after watching this for a few seconds, this is going to repeat. even if it's not gonna be exactly the same path, the mouse looks like he's doomed. so the runaway tactic, or swim away tactic, doesn't work. which means if you've been thinking about that on your little pause where you were just thinking about it, you should probably stop thinking about it because it's not going to get there. all right, well, i think it's a pretty sensible tactic and it'd be a stupid thing not to try it first. and it's difficult to sort out on paper with mathematics whether it's gonna work. so a nice thing to do quite often for mathematicians, even physicists do this sometimes, is to model it on a computer, and realise very quickly it doesn't work. i'm gonna suggest a hint now though, that i think the mouse can escape. and therefore it's instructive to think "if this isn't working, how else could he possibly do it and get away from the cat?" so, again, if you want to have a think about it, have a think about it. [music] mouse has not gone away yet. the obvious tactic of running away or swimming away doesn't work and one other tactic which a lot of people tell me with this puzzle that might be sensible is instead of running away from the cat, maybe you should run towards the point which is farthest away from the cat. so i think that's obviously in this case the pond edge point opposite the cat. now it sounds like that's the place you want to be if you can arrange it because the cat's not anywhere near to eat you. of course that the opposite point tactic, so i'm going to show you what happens if you try a mouse doing the opposite point tactic. here we go. you see the green arrows? now we're heading towards the point opposite the cat which is chugging away around because the cat is quick! and it keeps chasing the mouse and this angle, he's trying to - he's gonna close the angle, and it just means the mouse goes in circles because he's not moving quick enough. obviously the puzzle would be different if the mouse was quicker, but it wouldn't be as interesting because the mouse could just swim for it. so i just wanted to point out another sensible tactic to try, swim away from the cat towards the opposite edge doesn't work either, and this time he just goes around in circles. [music] there are two more tactics i want to show you, neither of which really help but together they're quite good. so let me introduce some vocab which i've just made up which will help me refer to these tactics. one of them i'm going to call the dash tactic, which is swim away, but not away from the cat or towards the opposite edge, but just towards the nearest edge of the pond. i feel like - sensible tactic, you're in a pond, you wanna get out - you don't swim the long way. so on the screen this looks like this. so i've got a dash tactic and the moment my mouse is closest to that point over there, it's kind of like the radius from the point through the mouse to the edge, and if i click on dash, he just heads towards the edge. now, obviously, that wasn't very successful. but it depends where the mouse is to start with, right? if i put the mouse on the other side, a long way away from the cat, and he's close to the edge, then a dash will get him out. that doesn't solve our problem, but it means there are some places in the pond where if the mouse can get to i know he can get out with a dash tactic. the second tactic then, is not a dash tactic, it's a circling tactic. and this doesn't help you get out, but it does help you get away. so what i mean here is that the mouse can move in a circle and this point here is worse, for the mouse, than this point, despite being the same distance from the edge. so i think this one's better because in terms of an angle, he's further away from the cat, which means measuring this angle, which i've just drawn a line on here. it's a good indication of whether the mouse is far away, like opposite, or close. and actually i think that kind of summaries the cat's technique as well. the cat will try and minimise this angle, and if the mouse has got any sense at all he should try and maximise that angle, but it doesn't always work. so here's a circling tactic. if you are near the edge of the pond, it's a problem because the mouse - the cat is much quicker. for example, the mouse is just circling, but it's clearly moving slower around the angle than the cat. and if the cat was actually doing something sensible instead of just going round, let's actually make him pursue, he will get to the mouse and he will stop. and then the circling tactic, doesn't work anymore because whatever the mouse does the cat can keep up. but if i get further away from the edge, but i put it over here, you can see that the cat catches up, but just not quite as quick. which might give you a clue that if i'm rightly in the middle, it's pretty obvious that even if the cat is really close in the angle, the mouse can get away now. so the circling tactic means sometimes i can get away from the cat in terms of the angle, and sometimes i can't because the cat catches me up. and those two tactics, maybe, maybe it's time for another pause. with those two tactics, i think there's a glimpse of a hope. [music] those two tactics, the dash tactic and the circling tactic which sorts out whether you can get the cat opposite you or not. and let's sort them out one at a time. so the dash tactic, let's assume for the dash tactic we are opposite the cat. so if the cat's here, the mouse is on this line the other side of the centre. but if he is at the centre, i don't think he can make it. and maybe you can think about why. the cat has to go around here. let's assume some things which includes this radius of the pond, which i've never told you, i'm going to assume it's 1 and you can scale up if you want. the distance the cat has to go round is half of a circumference, so around is 2 pi times 1, halved. it's pi metres. let's go with metres for the sake of units. and let's assume there's some speeds going on. let's assume the cat's speed, for the sake of any other argument, is 4 metres per second. that's a quick cat. and the mouse is therefore 1 metre per second. and that's the only number we set this up with. the cat is 4 times quicker than the mouse can swim. and you can see that if the, the mouse from the centre will, let's say it's 1, is going to take precisely 1 second to get out. but how long does the cat take to get round? well, yeah, this is - everyone's like wow, how do you calculate this? i think the speed equals distance over time thing is a really basic equation that we really need to use carefully. how long will it take the cat to get there time is distance over speed. the distance is pi, so it's pi divided by speed which is 4, is pi by 4 seconds.
- (brady: so it's quicker than a second?) yes, because pi is less than 4, this is less than 1 second. the cat is there waiting. first thing with the dash tactic is clearly the mouse can't dash from the centre. so the obvious question is where can he dash from? and it's the same calculation right? he's got pi by 4 seconds, at most, to get out. so - - (brady: because the cat can get to any point on the circle within -)
- yeah, the furthest away point is pi by 4 seconds away. so actually he can only get to the edge when the edge is less than pi by 4 away. because he goes at 1 metres per second, we've set these numbers up to be quite nice, but that circle has distance pi by 4 there which means this distance in here is 1 minus pi by 4. and you begin to realise very quickly that my scale on this drawing is terrible. we need to know roughly where that line is because outside that line if i'm opposite the cat, i'm home and dry - i just dash for it. and act- let's just check. you, you're all estimating us on the video at home, but 1 minus pi by 4... point 2 1 - from centre, dash tactic. 
- (brady: it's like an event horizon ben) yes. that's exactly what it is, like inside that you're doomed with your dash tactics, outside that, if you're opposite the cat, you're okay. so now the question really is, can i get opposite the cat outside that event horizon? so we, actually now you recognise why the circling tactic is important because that's the one that concerns whether we can get opposite the tac. so let's talk about the, did i call it the tac? i  meant the cat. reversing things... let's talk about the circling. this, in some ways, feels harder to sort out at first 'cause like, running in circles feels difficult, but if the cat is running at 4 meters per second and the mouse is at 1. and actually what we care about is how quickly i can get round compared to the cat going round. how big a circle can i keep up with the cat if it's 4 times quicker than me? i think, on a moments thought, it's relatively obvious that if the circle is 4 times smaller i'll be doing the same thing as the cat. so actually this circle i've just drawn here, if that's 4 times smaller than the big one, the scale factor of 4 going on, the distance round it is 4 times shorter than the big one, that's how a scale factors work. and so at that point which is a quarter of the size, in which case that is three quarters, and the distance in there - looking pretty messy thanks to my repeated drawing of mice - but it is a one quarter. on that circle i can keep up with the cat in terms of angles. which means inside that circle i can outpace the cat in terms of angles. so which means, i think, one quarter, otherwise known as 0.25 metres from the centre, my circling will work. at this point these two numbers and their comparison is important. i'm deliberately sort of talking slowly to let the realisations drop in. this is a nice puzzle where the maths they've done is is really lower than gcse level maths and yet it wasn't obvious to me at all when i first started playing with the cat the mouse. but let me show you on the diagram on the screen. so now we've established that the, there are two event horizons, if you like, we can put them on here. so the dash boundary is this line here, in fact, that was the boundary we said was 0.21 away from the centre, and you can see it's about right. and the circling boundary is the outer line there. so inside that i can circle okay, and outside the dash boundary i can dash okay, can you see what i see? that there's a little gap in between, which i'm going to officially call the mouse sweet spot. if it can get in there then not only can it circle to get away from the cat it can also, when it's ready i.e opposite the cat, it can just peg it. and it should make it. which is weird because just swimming away from the cat won't make it and just swimming towards the opposite bank from the cat won't make it but this tactic, according to the maths, should make it. so i set up geogebra, which doesn't know about these boundaries, a tale told the mouse to get in that sweet spot and then when it's opposite the cat or close enough, like about 179 degrees or there abouts, peg it. and i was really quite nervous when i'd done the coding to see if it'd actually make it. because the maths says it should make it and no other tactic on the model had worked. so i'm going to press play, if you're up for it? (brady: i'm up for it man. i was, i was born for this moment) i'm glad brady. that's why you make these videos. so i'm gonna start the mouse in the centre of the pond because i know that if it's anywhere else i could still swim to the centre and solve it from there. and let's see what happens. i'm gonna click on escape tactic. and what i hope the program will tell it to do, it will swim out until it gets into that sweet spot, which is that small little region, and then it will circle until it recognises that it's opposite the cat, you'll see the angle go up to about'0 or within some tolerance, and then it'll peg it. and i've no idea where we'll end up to peg it, but if it gets to the edge the exciting payoff will be a bit of red text saying the mouse has escaped. that's what i'm hoping for. ready?
- (brady: i'm ready) found the sweet spot, very quickly. he's only just inside the sweet spot, you see the angle is increasing, but it's not quickly increasing. come on mouse! (brady: woah!)
- it's made it. i agree that would be a tense moment for the mouse, but if i assume as i did right at the beginning that the mouse is much quicker on land than the cat, then i could just imagine it going [bullet sound] and the cat's like 'ah'. but i think the maths tells me that wherever the mouse starts, whatever the cats doing, if it's four times quicker than the mouse when it's swimming it can escape. (brady: so how fast does the cat need to be for the mouse to never escape?) brady i like your style. you're doing what all mathematicians want to do in their heart of hearts - actually most humans do. you're generalising, right? the 4 is critically chosen so that that 0.21 and the 0.25 are really close together and they're the right way round. if they're the other way around you, you can only dash from a point where you can't a circle, whereas we had a sweet spot. and actually i've got a slider on geogebra so i can change the ratio of the speeds and you can see whether the sweet spot increases or decreases. so since you asked let's, let's move the mouse back to the centre. let me turn these two off. that is the region that i called the sweet spot. the critical region is maybe a more technical name for these sort of things. at the moment the ratio is 4. if i change that to 4.1 can you see the sweet spot's gone really quite small. which means if the cat is 4.2 times quicker, it's all over. somewhere between 4.1 and 4.2 looks like is the end of the story. if i go the other way you can see the sweet spot is really big. this is not a surprise, if the cat's slower the mouse has got a better chance. in fact there gets to a point where if the mouse is not quick enough, even at 3.2, in fact, if i go between 3.1 and 3.2 you can see that something, there's - it's all sweet spot in the middle. and 3.1 and 3.2 do bracket a famous number which i'm sure people have heard of, and i've used it, a fact called pi. and so it's to do with actually the speed compared with pi here. if it's less than pi, it's all sweet for the mouse and in fact it can dash from anywhere and get out. so there's a really tiny area and 4 is this lovely chosen - whoever came up with this puzzle and i haven't managed to track down who originally came up with this puzzle seems to have been around a long time but i hadn't heard it until a couple of years ago when someone told me about this puzzle. we were sitting in a bunkhouse in the lake district around a fire and he said i've got a puzzle for you and just told me about the cat the mouse. and i don't know i was a bit arrogant perhaps i was like, this is gonna be a simple puzzle. completely flummoxed me for a week. i was thinking about it driving back from the lake district and when i solved it, i was really pleased that it wasn't that i didn't know the maths, it's just that it was a nice puzzle. and they've chosen the 4 really well because any other number much bigger than 4 or much smaller than 4, either it's too easy for the mouse to escape or it just always gets caught. so that's the cat and the mouse puzzle. a bit of pi and a bit of pond. so if you like challenging problems like the one we've just shown you, but maybe you want slightly better pictures than ben's mouse here, brilliant might be the place for you. brilliant have sponsored today's episode and they have really cool daily challenges like these - have a look at them. this one about hitting a ball around a corner appeals to my brain. obviously, i'm gonna click on this one. there's pretty interesting stuff here. and look at that, that is quite a shot. but how could it be played? to check all this stuff out go to brilliant.org/numberphile that's not only going to introduce you to the brilliance of brilliant but it also sets you up for 20% off their premium subscription. premium means you get access to not just the free stuff that's on the site but all the archives, all the puzzles, all the courses, all the daily challenges. that address again: brilliant.org/numberphile use the /numberphile so they'll know you came from here and check them out.
