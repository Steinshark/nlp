- being a waitress is one of the hardest jobs in the world. that's why today, we're
gonna be tipping waitresses with gold bars, playstations,
tvs, laptops and more. - what can i get you fellas to drink? - can i have a water?
- i'll take a water as well. - this is a gold bar. it is worth $160,000. i can't afford to tip that just yet. so what we did is we got mini gold bars. chris, is that a mini gold bar? - it is a mini gold bar. this right here is $7,000 in gold. i know it's tiny but gold is expensive. this is seven smackaroonis,
seven bands, seven racketeers. - all right, we got it. how is your water? - it tasted like seven grand. what does that say, chris? - "7k in gold" with a really weird g. - and we put the gold. all right, it was good water. - let's go.
- yeah. - is this true or no? thank y'all so much.
- of course. where are we? - garden olives. - hello.
- hello. - how are you doing today?
- doing good, how you doing? - i'm good.
- can i have a water? - yeah, you sure can. - mm. oh my goodness, chris. - i'll be right back.
- this water. - is it good?
- mm. - would you say it's the
best water you've ever had? - mm hmm. chris is gonna go pee. so this time, we're doing
it a little different. we're gonna tip a
playstation and a laptop. "enjoy your new ps4 and laptop." congratulations.
- thank you so much. y'all subscribe to mrbeast, thank you. - can i have a water?
- sure. - i'll have your finest water, please. it tastes like a tv. - that might be your mustache. - ooh. - ooh.
- i love this bread. - that bread is fire. - all right, the bread was good. bring in the tv.
- no, don't. i don't want to leave the bread. - put it right here. all right, that's the tv, go, go. all right chris, we left the tv as a tip. - "bread was good." - smiley face. - we were never here.
- i'm taking this. - "the bread was good." i love it. - you did a good job with the waters and the bread and honestly-
- thank you. - we can't get that kind
of service anywhere. comment if you've ever
tipped a waitress at tv. - let me know.
- thanks, man. all right, you ready? - the water was spectacular. - all right, let's go, go, go, go, go. - well thank you, i've
never had a playstation. please come back any anytime. - yeah. pop the bad boy open. these are all $1 coins
and there's 300 of 'em. - can i get you guys something to drink? - can i get some water please?
- a water. we have 300 gold coins right here. - all right, let's go. - it's about $300.
- $300 worth. so congratulations.
- appreciate it. - you were an awesome waitress and we enjoyed the water and the bread. - subscribe to mrbeast. - thank you. - y'all still need a minute? - yes ma'am, please.
- yes? okay. - thank you, sirs, you have a great day. here is your tip, here's your pen. so we're gonna be tipping a printer and you can't use a
printer without a laptop. - of course. - and you can't use a laptop
without a playstation. - makes sense to me. - and then we put that there. congratulations. - i wasn't even supposed to work tonight. - all right, well thank you so much for your awesome
service, enjoy it. - thank you.
- yeah. - thank you.
- you're welcome. - what's the item?
- edible arrangements. it was great water and it was
really hard to bring it out, so she should enjoy the
fruits of her labor. - put it on the floor. - whoops. now we have to leave an actual tip. - that was an accident. to make up for spilling water, she's still gonna get her fruit basket but i think now we add $1000 because cleaning up water is worth $1000. - it's literally everywhere. - "can we have a towel?" they're like "here's a little hand rag." "soz about spilling water." - dude, people are gonna think we spilled this water on purpose. - $1000 and then enjoy the fruit. - all right, here, take
this, let's just leave. - okay, and we're done. - they said "take it."
- are you serious? - "enjoy the fruit." - so how do you feel about your tip? - i kinda wanna cry a little. - we feel really bad because
we spilled the water, so we gave you an extra thousand. - thank you.
- of course. - subscribe to mrbeast. - yeah, thank you.
- thanks. - hey, can i have a peanut
butter crunch smoothie? guys, this smoothie is amazing. give them everything we got. enjoy it, thank you guys so much. - subscribe.
- subscribe to mrbeast. - subscribe. - ah, this is a refreshing water. you know it's fancier because
it came in a nice mason jar. - yeah. "7 in gold, your tip." that was loud.
- it was. - unnecessarily loud. - gotta make a statement, boys. - all right. - well, well, well. - that's a nice tip you got there. - that's quite a tip that i have, yeah. we bit it and everything,
i think it's real. - it's real.
- that is so amazing. i just wanted to say
thank you guys so much. - can we have water?
- yes and then i'll tell them to come out.
- all right. i guess we're sharing? - you know what, actually
because they gave us a water to share, that deserves some gold. they knew we love each other. - our love is gold, just like this water. - "sorry, no 10k just seven k in gold." - would you like a sip?
- was it good? - it was pretty good actually. - mm. the aftertaste of your lips. some goldy, a little nuggy. - goldilocks. - a little nuggy goes right there. there you are, nuggy.
- bye, nugget. i love you. - all right.
- let's go. - wait, what? it's not real. i have tables to serve, i can't cry. - how you feeling? - i don't really remember
how to do my job. - what are you getting? - i don't know yet. - thank you, sir. thank you for the playstation,
the laptop and the tv. you know, you want to play
playstation on your tv. - yep.
- so there's the playstation. - all right, i think that covers it. - thanks for the water, guys. - that's for just two things of water? - they really liked the
way you poured the water. - they didn't even see
me pour the water though. - for that, you get a
ps4, a laptop and a tv. - wow, just for some water? thank you guys, subscribe to mrbeast. - yeah, no problem. - hey dude, can you pull up a little bit? can i give you something? hey, this is worth $7,000, here you go. thank you for giving people pizza. - $7,000, seriously.
- don't throw that away. - okay, thank you.
- it's real gold. - okay, thank you.
- yeah. what would you buy if you got seven grand? - probably a better car. - that little thing in your
hand will buy you a car. - thank you. - so that was our last gold bar. - it's okay, pizza boy is happy. we've been tipping waitresses all day but now i think it's time for
me to give my boys the tip. but they have to work for it. so i got the weirdest food i could find and i challenged them to eat it. so fermented soybeans. - it cooks itself by pretty much rotting. - oh, cool. - for awhile.
- is it healthy? am i gonna get sick?
- it's edible. - well, everything's edible but is- - is everything edible? - i'm sitting this one
out, i'm not eating it. - this smells like armpits. - don't eat my beans.
- he looks scared. - oh. - if chris don't like
it, i ain't eating it. - oh, chris is gone, guys.
- there's no chance. - $1,000, chandler, if you eat it. - no.
- that's one grand. that's real bad.
- yeah. - no, you wouldn't. - it tastes like if you opened someone's stomach and ate
what was in your stomach and the smell is even worse. maybe i just had a bad piece, right? - would you eat this for $1000? - give it here.
- two fork fulls? $1000 right here. - oh. - dude, i can smell jake. - there you go.
