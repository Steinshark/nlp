you might know that i don't love the concept of a gaming smartphone charging a premium for is often a small upgrade in performance at the expense of things that i'd consider more important this is different much closer to how i think it should be done we're talking about the red magic mars and probably the most important thing you need to know about it is that it starts at $399 and for some perspective that compares to 899 for the asus rogue phone is it any less powerful not really but i'll come to this at nearly 10 millimetres the mars is somewhat chunky but at the same time structurally sound and i do appreciate having a surface that you don't need to wipe every time you use it if you're into the aesthetic you won't find many smartphones as adventurously designed as this one but at the same time the angular build does mean it's a serious table wobbler so you can't really use it when it's lying flat it has a headphone jack fingerprint scanner and the same configurable light strip that we saw on last year's variant is it useful no not really but is it cool yeah i'll give it that but there are so many gaming features you might be quite surprised at what they've managed to you fit in at this price and it brings up quite an interesting point so let's break it down you've got capacitive shoulder buttons 7.1 virtual surround sound audio a dedicated slider to enter gaming mode and a 4d with vibration engine the phone also implements three forms of cooling a vapor heatsink an air chamber inside for passive airflow and the use of a metal alloy that supposedly dissipates 64 percent more heat than glass and the results do speak for themselves it keeps temperatures quite consistent and as useful if you're gaming for hours at a time it can prevent your chip having to throttle down its performance because it's overheating even the gaming software has been streamlined i wouldn't go as far as to call it beautiful but a stark improvement over last year one flick of this switch also takes you to a redesigned gaming hub which works really well and it makes all the features you might want really simple to access so here's the thing a lot of this gaming stuff you could take it or leave it it'll make a difference if you're a hardcore pub g gamer who has three hour sessions at a time but less so if you're more 20 minutes of brawl stars during a commute kana gamer much of it is not particularly useful or even compatible with many games there's only two right now that actively support the vibration feature but what i like about this as opposed to other gaming phones is that even if you used none of this it is still good value for money it runs android nine out the box has a dual speaker setup with release spacious sound and a pretty respectable 3,800 milliamp hour battery nothing comes for free and in making this so affordable i'd say there are three main compromises the first is that the base model here has the snapdragon 845 with 6 gigs of ram and don't get me wrong that is a good spec it's only 2 gigs of ram off smartphones that were twice the price last year but that's just it it is last year's tech i imagine the 845 is pretty cheap now as it's towards the end of its main production cycle so that might be one of the contributing factors to this phone's surprisingly low price but i don't think this should be a deal-breaker yes on one hand it's ironic that a phone made for gaming is using last year's components but right now there's no application where you'll feel any kind of bottleneck and remember that for similar amounts of money a lot of phones are still using mid-range chips also from last year the second thing is that it's clear that the camera wasn't a priority here with a single 16 megapixel sensor you'll miss out on portrait mode and any kind of optical zoom but it's not bad in well lit conditions photos look refined punchy and dynamic and the saving grace is the phone's rock-bottom price it's not even close to iphone or huawei flagship pricing so it can get away with not being compared to them there are definitely even $400 phones with more flexible camera systems but the red magic mars can at least hold its own against most of them the third gripe here is display this is a 6 inch lcd panel and probably the most noticeable compromise on the phone it lacks the deep colors of an oled display it doesn't sport the super high refresh rates of other gaming phones and it's got a mediocre screen to body ratio of 78.5% it makes sense there had to be a compromise but at the same time we've seen too holofernes with nearly 85% display if it up to me display would be pretty much the top priority well above led strips and capacitive shoulder buttons but this aspect is pretty subjective what would you prioritize so on balance the red magic mars is not without flaws and if you started listing everything that's missing you'd be going for a while but if you take a step back you'll see it offers 80% of what the rogue phone did last year in terms of performance calling gaming features even the camera at just over 40% of the price and that's something i would say though that if the gaming features don't interest you at all but you still want the performance then the poker phone f1 takes the cake in terms of overall bang for your buck thanks a lot for watching guys and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
