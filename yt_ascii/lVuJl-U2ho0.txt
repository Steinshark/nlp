with all the terrible things in 2021 millions of people feel hopeless climate change income inequality the pandemic more than ever people are depressed with the state of the world and are looking for things bigger than themselves but many people feel they are too smart for the ancient religions making meaning increasingly hard to come by after all if you derive meaning from this world and this world sucks well now you suck even science the great new savior seems to have abandoned us in our time of need as we discover that science itself may have gotten us here but what if i told you there was a new way the greatest income opportunity of our era welcome potential new recruits to the new religion of bitcoin i am your humble guide please do not mock our sacred garments the religion of bitcoin first started in 2009 when satoshi oops wrong slide when satoshi came from on high and delivered us our sacred text the white paper the white paper is currently the best-selling religious text of all time and you can pick it up at your local kinkos today i will be giving you a tour of all the things the bitcoin can offer you [music] the first thing you must know is that the bitcoin is money if money wasn't so stupid let me explain something to you right now okay here's a ten dollar bill this is garbage this is garbage you're people in south africa you have your ran it's all going to zero against bitcoin do you know that it's a criminal offense to tear up oh trouble here we have a classic scene of when a no coiner confronts bitcoin's high priest max keiser let's see how he reacts max do you know that it's a criminal offense to tear up do you know that with the bitcoin i have i can buy any freaking senator or congressman i want i make the laws he who has the bitcoin makes the laws rand this is correct he who has the bitcoin makes the laws so it is written i my understanding is that you were visited by the ghost of satoshi yeah satoshi speaking through all of her or his disciples on youtube your laser eyes are pointed right at my brain right now ah yes you might think it is strange to have laser eyes but in bitcoin all things are possible the bitcoin literally makes everything better bitcoin fixes everything your jewelry will be twice as good half as expensive real estate your house will be twice as big half as expensive debt you will be able to buy an annuity that yields eight percent interest with no risk and and if you wish me to make a political statement the political statement would be it fixes governments because as it fixes everything else governments act rationally now i know your brain must be reeling at all the incredible things the bitcoin can do for you but let us not forget the most important part the bitcoin is alive it's very interesting you you seem to allude to or refer to bitcoin as something of a new life form the reason i bring this up is because the way it acts seems like it's alive what are your thoughts on this a crypto is a living creature we've we've released life in cyberspace once you've released the dna of the of the bitcoin you just have to let it fester everywhere in the world and let it be it quite amazing yes i haven't even mentioned the best part the bitcoin is not only alive it is also a life force bitcoin is conservation of energy you can store your life force using this knowledge you can be immortalized as your bitcoin your body may die but your life will live forever on the blockchain i put my my monetary energy my life force into it and then i let it i let it live for the next thousand years and it's okay just to be alive for a thousand years it's okay to be you know what's wrong with being rich forever right i mean now that you know all the great things to expect from joining the bitcoin the question is will you join the bitcoin and become one of the many cyber hornets on your twitter the lead tweet is the mentions of cyber hornets i refer to everybody on everybody on twitter and everybody in the community that's that's educating the world and defending bitcoin but i was also thinking about every bitcoin miner running a bitcoin mining rig everywhere on earth and they're fighting for the network and i was thinking about everybody running a node and i think a note is like an altar to satoshi in your house in conclusion do not view the bitcoin as one of many mere cryptocurrencies that is what the heretics said instead you must answer the call as many have satoshi into my heart
