[music] i finally got to try an ionic 5. so i was gonna do this whole video on the state of evs electric cars and i was doing all this research and looking into it and the more i thought about it the more i realized i really only had one major point to make which is that if the future of cars is electric then we're eventually going to have to get some really good affordable electric cars like there's a lot of really good electric cars out there already and they're really tempting but they're all so expensive at least more expensive than their gas counterparts and i also do remember when i had that conversation with elon musk in the tesla factory a while ago and i asked him about like a potential 25 000 good mass production electric car if that was even possible and he said yes and that answer has like made headlines over and over again every few years since then but the truth is it's never been harder to make cars than right now and it's never been more expensive to make cars in right now obviously supply chain issues and it's hard to make a new electric car for all these companies but the point is yeah we're eventually going to have to get some good cheaper electric cars and this ionic 5 that i've been driving around for about two weeks has convinced me that we are right on the cusp of that so the ionic to me stay with me is kind of like the samsung zflip4 like it's one of the least expensive options in an expensive new category plus a flip phone in 2022 kind of has a little bit of a retro future vibe and so does this car i have started a new channel to talk about all my thoughts on cars i actually have quite a few of them so the first video is on the rivian r1t that i just took delivery of and we're actually already using it to shoot this video because that's what i got it for it beat the cyber truck to market by quite a bit either way you can go subscribe over there if you're interested i'm really excited about that channel i'm probably gonna shoot most of that stuff on whatever phone i'm testing at the time but the autofocus videos no need to fear will still be here on this main channel and i was so excited to test out the ionic 5. see at some point i just started seeing them around more and more like there's a lot of teslas on the road already so they kind of blend in at this point i also feel like i see a mustang mock e every other day but these ionics just started popping up and got my attention and i kept wondering like okay wow lots of people are buying them they must be pretty good right they're picking them over other options and now after driving the thing for like two weeks i get it i fully get it i mean this is a well-rounded all-wheel drive crossover with plenty of space a distinct but not super lame or flashy design an efficient 250 plus miles of range and a sub 40 000 starting price tag and it isn't really bad at anything so on the outside it has this design of like what people from the 80s thought a car of the future would look like now it's obviously a crossover with a lot of storage which is what people are into right now but it's very retro future and angular and i really like it and the coolest part for sure is the dot pixel theme all over the car the tail lights and the blinkers are pixels and the front of the car that's my favorite part the glossy black rectangle is maybe not my favorite but everything else around it especially the dot pattern led lights is so sick it's very unique on the road and looks electric without looking dorky i mean i can't really ask for much more than that and then i have these like four things that i keep in mind whenever i see a new electric car just as far as like pillars of reasonable electric cars which would be solid range fast charging zippy performance and extra storage so range is the easy one how far can it go on a charge right so the ionic 5 was giving me a really impressively accurate range estimate as i drove around which i really like it's more accurate than tesla's and so on a full 100 charge it would give me around 250 miles that's right around my comfortable baseline and it'll charge up to a ridiculous 350 kilowatts which would theoretically take it from 10 percent to 80 charge in 20 minutes now most of these chargers available to this car aren't that fast but that's another story for another day but then the zippy performance is the other easy part this is the dual motor all-wheel drive variant so it's a little more powerful than the single motor 300 mile version but with a little less range and it's easily as quick as any of its gas powered equivalents i think on paper it's like a five second zero to sixty which is already pretty good but it's not even about that it's the zero to thirty or the twenty to forty like just zipping around town or merging onto highways and with all that it's very responsive now the last pillar i say is extra storage because when you get rid of the gas engine obviously there's just a bunch of extra space and all the parts that come with it are gone and so every company has a different way of taking advantage of that extra space so rivien did a pickup truck with a gear tunnel and lots of other cars like tesla and ford have added a front trunk the ioniq does have a front trunk but it's so small that i don't really count it really they just extended the wheelbase and made a crossover suv with a ton of internal storage big big trunk lots of legroom and headroom in there and a ton of space between the seats and there's even this like movable armrest thing between the front seats honestly other than that this is a pretty average if not slightly subpar interior for a 45 000 car but if nothing else it is spacious so i say it checks that ev box so the ionic hits all those fundamentals which you know if we were missing one of those then i would sort of question like maybe i can't recommend this or i'd question why it's missing it but it has all that stuff so that means everything else is just extra you know stuff like software features autopilot type stuff creature comforts little quirks and features so i'll give you a few things that the ionic does that i really like and then some other things that i don't like so much so the ionic has paddle shifters which might sound kind of weird for a one gear electric car but they adjust between levels of regenerative braking so you can adjust on the fly with the paddles between coasting like a regular gas car all the way to one pedal driving where it breaks when you come off the accelerator it's not the first time i've seen that but i like it a lot that is dope it also has an hud up front with this top tier spec it has a really solid traffic aware cruise control that takes over on highway driving and makes stop and go traffic way easier and it supports both android auto and apple carplay which is convenient because aside from these capacitive buttons which really should have either been full on touchscreen or regular buttons i think the worst thing in this car is the maps and it's funny the software and navigating around is actually pretty responsive it's totally fine and the features are nice it shows you how much range you'll get in each driving mode plus how much extra you can get if you don't use the air conditioner but the second i pop into the maps which is theoretically the most important part of an electric car it's brutally slow and clunky and unintuitive so apple carplay and android auto are great you know in-car replacements for the ui but they aren't particularly good at charging stuff so they don't know as of right now if you're driving an electric car or not and so if you're planning a trip they don't know how many miles of battery you have when you arrive at the charger and how long you need to stop before you need to go again it's you kind of need to rely on it so again android auto apple carplay really good but for actually doing a road trip and navigating through chargers and planning that way you kind of need the in-car map to be good i might have to add that to my electric car fundamentals anyway i tweeted a few weeks ago there was this sick hyundai like track concept car and i was like yeah whoever's doing design for hyundai right now keep it up you are absolutely killing it and that's i think the last thing i want to talk about which i think is kind of underrated in this whole electric car revolution which is rolling out your first electric car for all these companies is basically an opportunity to rebrand to start over a little bit and create a fresh reputation like if you think about it hyundai might be the best example like what in the last three three four years what did you think about hyundai you know the tucson the santa fe you know in the u.s they're typically 20 to 30k pretty reasonable affordable cars but now all of a sudden this new car is 40 to 50k and is considered one of the more affordable impressive easy to recommend options in a new category so i guess what i'm trying to say is these these car companies can create a whole new reputation from scratch for this new audience especially of younger people who are going to grow up and eventually buy their first car that may just be an electric car so if your reputation was already good like a ford then maybe don't think too hard about it if you're coming out with an f-150 that's electric just name it the f-150 lightning but if you're looking for a change in reputation that i think that a lot of companies are then this is an opportunity for them just saying anyway i get it now i get the ionic 5 and i'm glad i got to test it from the eevee fundamentals to the distinct design that's not too weird not too quirky but pretty sweet i think it's great it's not cheap but it is one of the most affordable evs at this moment in time so yeah i get it and not only do i get it but this is the exact car i think we're gonna need to see a lot more of to sort of usher in our electric car future anyway go subscribe to the cars channel if you want i'll see you over there it's below the like button thanks for watching this one catch you guys later peace
