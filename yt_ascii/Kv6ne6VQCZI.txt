this is the story of the worst influencer scam i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of them okay i'm practically a connoisseur at this point a specialist in influencer scams if you will so believe me when i tell you that so today i'm going to be giving you the short version and then the full juicy story of the new allegations coming out on quote save the kids token we already know that save the kids was a failed crypto pushed by some of the top influencers on youtube if you haven't already seen my video it's right here you can also watch mudahar's video on this we've covered this in great detail but what no one knows is whether any of these influencers knew it was going to be a scam ahead of time they can and have claimed plausible deniability one of them saying quote i have no ill intent promoting any crypto altcoins it was all a big mistake they are victims just like the other people today i will be showing that this was a complete lie because i've traced some of these influencers crypto wallets and will be revealing what they did with the crypto coins they've promoted to you and are now trying to hide the evidence now that it's all coming out i will also be showing you hard proof that this save the kids token wasn't designed to benefit kids i will show you in the literal code of the coin itself that it was designed from the outset with the intention to extract money from these influencers fans and followers let's get started ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffeezilla the internet detective and wow there's no way to make this a short story so we're going to start this case at the beginning a month ago a friend of mine reached out to me and told me about a failed crypto project called save the kids token that wasn't that surprising i get tips all the time and i just sort of shelved the project while working on my tether investigation but something they had said had stuck with me they had told me that several huge influencers were on board with this one making it different face k face jarvis face tico face nikken rice gum summer rae i mean these are some big names here some of the biggest in the influencer world together they have well over 50 million followers between them so the fact that all these huge names are behind something it made me want to revisit it how could they allow themselves to promote something that fell so flat as soon as it launched it was dead on arrival you know this got me interested and it had me thinking i had recently covered the kim kardashian promotion i'd seen the floyd promote crypto and i was starting to wonder how much money is actually involved in this stuff right how much are people paid to do this i mean i'm sure these influencers love kids as much as the next guy but you're not going to do a commercial like this for free my name's frasier my name is jarvis i'm tico i'm ricegum i'm nikon and i support save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token so i decided to look into it the first thing i did was go to their post mortem on save the kids hack md article they wrote some article basically explaining why it all failed they said in a post the most important thing to state here is that ambassadors of save the kids are not paid by us and are not given any kids tokens ambassadors didn't delete tweets and then dump their tokens as claimed in the telegram as ambassadors were never given any tokens any of our ambassadors are involved in our project because they have bought into and believe in our mission ah yes we'll come back to that later they believe in helping kids remember that so i'm thinking at this point okay they believe in their project you're saying they weren't given any kids tokens didn't delete any tweets so why'd the project fail additionally i read about something called the anti-whale anti-bot mechanism this is essentially a piece of hard code that prevents large holders of a coin from selling out at once and this piece of marketing was repeated over and over again anti-whale measures can't sell more than 0.1 percent or transfer it in 24 hours no larger than 20 of a whale's bodied wallet can be sold within 24 hours yes and the whole idea here is to show people that this project is not going to be a quick rug pull which in crypto is a term for when a project gets pumped and dumped immediately on arrival and is abandoned by large investors and in their post-mortem they say these actual measures did indeed work as expected it was audited by tech rate but if everything worked as expected and these ambassadors were just in it for the kids why did the project immediately crash was it an accident i decided to investigate their telegram to learn more and i quickly realized the actual members were telling a very different story members of the telegram were panicking and insisting that millions were scammed phased team took the profit and left why would faze risk their reputation for this you guys do know faze clan has done multiple pump and dumps right lmao there's a reason all their tweets were removed after they sold out on launch and usually you don't have a whole host of people accusing you of scamming if there was nothing fishy going around so i decided to do some further digging and this whole idea of ambassadors and not being given any coins turns out to maybe be wrong according to the admin they said ambassadors bought in we don't have their wallets don't know who bought or sold interesting because earlier we were told they didn't sell and then we get this news we got confirmation from some of our ambassadors that they would not sell anything and simply bought pre-sale to support the project if you don't know pre-sell is a special access to people before the token becomes publicly available on the market typically you get much better rates to buy at but again this idea that these influencers didn't get anything from this project other than just wanting to help the kids seems to be a little bit disingenuous since it seems like some of them bought in but again we're reassured look they're not they're not gonna sell right so at this point i'm thinking things are really fishy so i reach out to lucas the developer see after the failure of save the kids and everything flopped he was basically the last person still hanging around the project and at first he seemed helpless kind of like a fall guy honestly in a post a moderator explains that lucas is not the founder of this coin even though he developed it he says quote lucas is a dev that was contracted till the 14th of june to write and set the foundation of this coin lucas chose to stay on and to work on this project on his own accord whilst the others left and he's not the owner of the coin fair enough a little bit weird that we don't know who's responsible for this giant coin that's pushed by these huge celebrities but fine when i reached out lucas responded and was pretty eager to help honestly he had said he had been taking a break from telegram i said no worries thanks for reaching back out i asked him who is the true founder of save the kids because he just seems like a developer but it seems like he would know was it faze clan influencer the mob like who's involved in this thing i literally have no idea he told me i wish i could let you know because i really don't we kept talking and he told me that he suspected foul play and that this was bigger than one crypto coin my theory a group of large money names are going around finding dev teams finding promoters and setting up a large hyped launch then dipping initially he also told me the only real contact he had was to a guy named manny and h i asked for their contact information he said no clue blocked i got blocked by all of the team basically all right so at this point i'm pissed right like here's this poor dev who gets made to be the fall guy for token that like wasn't his idea he got seems like he got hired to do it now it's coming on him so i'm like look can you think of any tie to the founders you know it only takes one clue to find everything and he responds that he does have a clue so i got tokenomics gmail.com that sent me the contract who i also emailed back my paypal for the 10k they paid me then all the rest was from h on telegram bingo that's all we need tokenomics gmail.com that's the clue that's going to unravel everything i start searching the internet right i get the computers running 24 7. it was all clocked in but i can't find anything this account is a ghost usually there are a few threads you can pull on nothing so then i contact my buddy barely sociable he starts digging around and pings me back with news i couldn't have ever expected the kid is lying that email doesn't exist on paypal i used forgot password to check according to paypal there is no account associated with that tokenomics gmail.com that's something that i hadn't considered before maybe this developer if he's a real person maybe he's lying to me and he's actually involved in sending me on some wild goose chase i don't want to let him know i'm suspicious yet so i start asking for you know this contract that he seems to have signed all of a sudden he gets testy he asks for a lawyer hmm interesting the next day he makes it even more clear he says hey zilla sorry so my lawyer said don't share anything for now and also i'm not sure i'm willing to help out much more since your video has been up i've gotten a lot of death threats and somehow my family even got one so i'm not looking to further involve myself sorry hope you understand just as a quick caveat i didn't mention lucas in the video at all that he's talking about i respond lucas you need to talk man if you have nothing to hide i can make sure you get fairly represented but parts of your story aren't lining up like this 10 000 from paypal from tokenomics gmail.com i checked that email for paypal it doesn't exist a couple hours later he deleted his account all these logs were saved in advance and at this point i'm pissed because i'm pretty sure that this kid is full of it or not telling me the whole story of what he knows and is sort of trying to back out of this thing because i never mentioned him in my video and he's sort of all of a sudden as soon as i start asking bigger questions he starts clamming up talking about lawyers and i'm still no closer to finding out the truth about what happened with save the kids i mean was it influencers what was it this developer was it this anonymous founder mr h like who's behind it all who's responsible for this in my first video i'd put out i had called the coin a scam but there's not much you can say as far as did they sell didn't they it sure seems like they did but we don't know who or how much they sold so it feels like at every turn i'm stonewalled the dev isn't talking i can't trace the wallets the influencers are staying silent now the thing is at this point we kind of know these influencers got in on the pre-sale we were told as much but here's the thing we know where those pre-sales went that's one cool feature of the blockchain technology it's public to everyone you know where the money was sent what those wallets then did with those save the kids tokens exactly when they sold them if they bought more et cetera it's all out there the problem is we don't know whose wallets are whose there isn't some big name on these long blockchain addresses that says like faze clan or rice gum it's just a bunch of random numbers and letters and without that key information there's no way of really telling which influencers sold what and if they were just dupes you know maybe they got in over their heads and simply were fooled like everyone else maybe they were victims right so we really don't have the full story so for a day or two i was just like stuck thinking about how can we prove whose wallets are whose but then i remember something these influencers have been deleting tweets like a lot some of them deleted their support of save the kids project but that's not all they've even deleted other crypto projects that they've promoted and done giveaways and i started to wonder what if those projects were also scams what if at minimum they were equally sketchy what if this wasn't a one-time thing and what if they left some incriminating evidence in one of their earlier schemes it's worth a shot because like my other leads were drying up quick so i just start no lifeing the archives tweet after deleted tweet i'm hunting through and finally i notice a pattern of giveaways with some of these guys they'll say something like this is the craziest thing i've ever done i will double your safe galaxy wallet this tweet has now been deleted but i pulled it up in the archives and then they pick some winners you won just confirming this is the right address maybe you see where this is going let's go here's my wallet address this is all we need using this wallet we simply cross check it at the time of giveaway see that they got the winnings and then check who sent it we then check if that address has saved the kids tokens and other tokens that these people have promoted in the past if it's actually phase k's wallet it should have both safe galaxy which he's promoting here and save the kids tokens which he also promotes and it does here's the save the kids tokens and here's the safe galaxy tokens which incidentally he got from the safe galaxy deployer meaning he's not just some random person he's clearly someone with influence that's how these tokens do it they give free tokens to the influencers from the deployer wallet that's all there is to it ladies and gentlemen we got them i just repeated that process for each influencer and i found three confirmed wallets phase k phase jarvis and phase nikken the others remain a mystery but you know what this means it means now that we have their wallet address which is public we just didn't know whose public wallet address was theirs now that we have that we can see what they did with their save the kids tokens we can check all their so-called crypto endorsements that they've been doing and find out do they actually endorse these products or do they dump them immediately on you so before i show you what they did just remember these guys these influencers leading up to this token being launched promotional tweets are sent out you know a damn commercial was being made and remember it's all to save the kids right we're doing this not for money but to save the kids this is faze jarvis's wallet he got in the pre-sale and quickly sold out two-thirds of his total holdings within days of the launch this is phase nikken he immediately sold about a third of his total holdings and then seems to have held on to the rest but by far the really bad one was faze k's wallet he dumped all of his kids tokens immediately within 24 hours he went from 6.2 billion tokens to four tokens now that's right he sold all but four tokens but obviously what's interesting here is that not all of these influencers acted quite the same way you know faze nikan sold a third right away held under the rest faze jarvis sold two thirds over a few days but phase k completely abandoned the project altogether why well i think it has to do with their intentions look i looked pretty extensively over faze nikan and jarvis's wallet history they do not in my opinion have a pattern of malicious selling what i mean by that is when they get a coin you know maybe they'll get some coins sell some buy some and you know sell some more hold on to something like a trader would and of course i'm not saying that promoting garbage scam coins to your fans is okay right it's not but everything they're doing it seems like they're not pre-meditating to sell everything phase k on the other hand whose wallet we're looking at now should be called faze rug actually what i mean by that is that he not only sold save the kids instantly he has a history of doing that to every project or nearly every project he gets involved in like take this coin right here which is called gamesafe.io he got these coins immediately sold them out and this is the date okay so 31 days ago and then you could see the sell-off was almost immediate or take another coin safe galaxy which he's actually promoted to his fans he got coins from a deployer wallet once again and immediately sells them off now why did he get these free tokens in the first place well it was probably his promotional tweets he did about them to get safe galaxy follow this guide remember to tweet safe galaxy with your wallets i'm in the telegram group chatting right now ask me your questions there so he's promoting this coin to his followers telling them how great it is meanwhile his actual actions within his wallet that we can see right here again this is the same wallet that we saw him sell the safety the kids often eclipse he's just selling everything as fast as humanly possible moon portal same thing what i'm trying to say is this is a pattern of deceiving his fans pumping something and selling it to his fans so he gets the best price how much money did he make from it we'll try to calculate that later and by the way if it feels like i'm belaboring this point i am phase k has consistently deceived his audience by pushing crypto to them while having a bag of crypto given to him by these coins i guess for promotions and selling it immediately to them and he'll make videos promoting these tokens like moon your moon portal is out right now guys you can swipe up and check it out he'll also tweet about them like this he said wow moon portal dot io making the robin hood of crypto great project and great team behind it i'm with them long term a hundred hmm that's that's interesting really with them long term 100 luckily we can check your wallet to see what you actually did it looks like you received the funds 37 days and' hours ago or on may 22nd and it looks like you sold the coin also on may 22nd so it looks like phase k you may not understand what long term quite means either that or you're lying to your fans which is it do you not know what long-term 100 means or are you blatantly lying to your fans this man has zero portal on him he had 43 billion now he has zero and look why am i showing you this well a few reasons number one while covering this some people put out a theory that save the kids failed because of a tweet from nelk that went out so they're promoting it they're telling people that they're ambassadors or whatever the coin comes out it starts going up in value and then nelk puts out this pose and after that tweet comes out from nelk everybody starts panic selling and the save the kids coin plummets down and everyone loses their money okay so the idea here is that it's all of nelk's fault for calling out these influencers for what they're doing and it caused this big panic cell it sounds interesting but it it's completely false and i want to debunk this because i think this was likely told to keemstar to just make these influencers seem like they're innocent but it's false i know this because we can actually see when the tweet went out 7 55 june 5th and phase k actually started selling before that tweet as you can see here he first started selling june 5th as well but this is utc time and adjusting for that he started selling at 605 which is about two hours before nelk would tweet now this proves that some people involved like face k and others planned to sell from the start and even without the simple proof by the way we know that he would have sold anywhere from the start because phase k always sells from the start that's what he does with almost all the coins he's promoted before this now the second reason i'm showing you all this evidence is because i absolutely refuse to let anyone spin this into a narrative of like phase k being naive with crypto not understanding what he was doing right he he's innocent you know just look at his apology i want you all to know that i had no ill intent promoting any crypto altcoins i honestly and naively thought that we all had a chance to win which just isn't the case he was naive guys this is yet another lie because if you thought everyone had a chance to win you wouldn't be running for the exit like someone just shouted fire in these coins right face k knew he had to be the first one to get out of these coins in order to profit like he's done so many times before he sold out of save the kids token that he was an ambassador of within 24 hours now i wish i could tell you who else sold and what else they did because i'm sure the others aren't completely innocent but for now a lot of these wallets remain a mystery but now that we know how these influencers you know spent these coins when they sold them i wanted to count up how much you can make from a red pool like this right that was one of our big questions so i called up my buddy some ordinary gamers to help me calculate how much someone like phase k stands to make from these crypto promotions we crunch the numbers by counting how many tokens he sold times the price at that time and we got a rough estimate of how much you stand to make so really really rough estimate when you look at the point of sale around the sixth when the actual thing was going on the peak of it i think each calculation ended up being around twenty nine thousand thirty thousand for being a little bit more liberal on that but yeah it's about what we saw for save the kids now of course when you factor in all the other rock pulls some of them went as high as like 40 50 60 000 right depending on the severity of that pole so cumulatively if you look at some wallets some people who are you know alleged to be behind multiple accounts yeah that's a lot of money i mean were you surprised i felt like it wasn't as much as maybe i thought that i thought surely they're not risking their reputation for something that's you know for an influencer as big as they are doesn't seem to be like insane yeah i mean i you got to imagine for people who have entire personalities built around mansions and supercars right you're really risking your peak your your your great career on 30 000 which is a lot of money but it's certainly not enough to warrant putting that much risk on you you know what do you think is going to happen at these guys i mean if the sec wants to investigate they're going to get they're gonna get a fine maybe maybe prison down lower outline i mean the government doesn't screw around when it comes to financial crimes that's that that i think we know there you have it somewhere in the range of tens of thousands of dollars per crypto coin that was rugged sometimes more sometimes less but at this point i have to tell you that phase k completely denies profiting from save the kids token i reached out to him in preparation for this video and he said the following quote overall the value of the token i purchased is down considerably from my purchase price i definitely have not profited from save the kids token he also said he paid for some of the expenses quote i helped pay for the exchange listing or whatever could help it the purpose of the project is charitable giving it's in that spirit and with that intent that i was involved and i put capital into it hmm i don't know if i buy this like okay let's just say you lost money on this token i disagree that selling the coins that you own within 24 hours of a charity coin is in the spirit of charitable giving like you say also there's the small matter of all these other tokens which he failed to comment on but even the fact he was able to sell all his tokens in 24 hours brings up sort of an interesting question whatever happened to the anti-whale mechanism remember wasn't it supposed to prevent people from selling off this quick i mean you were only supposed to sell 20 within 24 hours so what happened how was he able to sell off this fast i started to wonder about this and that's when i got a telegram from someone inside the project who messaged me anonymously hey coffee i remember something lucas the developer told us before the launch that the owners asked him to modify the anti-whale system from 24 hours to a minute so they were a hundred percent planning to dump on everyone if that's true that's the smoking gun right there it turns this project from a charity coin with some bad actors that sold off right away into a pre-meditated fraud it turns it from an accidental rug pool into an intentional one so obviously i immediately started looking through the code because this guy said he heard about it but he didn't know where to find it and so i get to digging back to the lab again boys i can't overstate how much time i wasted looking for this stuff and yes it turns out that lucas the developer had created multiple test coins before launching the main one in particular interest was save the kids test 2 and the real save the kids token i compared their contracts using bsc scan and there was a single change in the code the old code of save the kids test 2 read that you must wait a full 24 hours before you sell again the new code which changed at the last minute changed this anti-whale to one minute you must wait a minute before you sell it again and this is the only change they changed the token just so they could pre-meditate this whole thing and almost remove the anti-whale mechanism completely they turned it from being a code that wouldn't let whales sell off in less than five days into a code that lets you sell off in five minutes again five days they changed it to five minutes right before launch so obviously i start trying to reach out to lucas because this is what he seems to have kept for me right like he acted innocent initially he didn't tell me about any of this but this shows that at least he was a part of this right he was complicit in this finally i managed to get him into a discord call where i confronted him i'm seeing things from you that are deeply troubling in the code and you went awol on me as soon as i talked to you about this tokenomics gmail.com not existing i didn't see you saying that economics and gmail.com does exist no no not on paypal though you said you got paid 10k at paypal and we we forgot passworded it and it doesn't 10k and no i got 10k and b and b like i that's what i was given from the token directly oh you said you said in the discord no the paypal is from red bubble i believe but i don't have that then i asked him about this anti-whale change lucas you hard-coded it so what i mean by you hard-coded in this thing to be a scam is that i know that you change the anti-whale measures last minute to make it easier to dump on people yeah yeah i know i've talked about that in the like in all the amas that's that's a scam lucas that's a scam coffee this is what i was told to do i'm contracted i don't know what to tell you this is exactly what i was told to do i also asked him if he doesn't know the creator of this project how did he even get involved in the first place this random guy named manny reached out to him and he believed him very coincidental that you would just be like picked out of like a rabbit out of a hat and you're so close and you have no association i get that okay so you have no there's no explanation i don't know they're randomly picked out of the hat this was a huge surprise to me wait oh i remember when here i was talking to manny and he said that we're gonna have influencers on this project i think i can find this picture actually and i was like you're gonna have influencers on this project he's like yep and he started naming names and one of them was k and i was saying i don't i'm sorry but like obviously i don't believe you he told me no actually he required proof and this is what it was this was me being proven that this was actually influencers weren't bored on this and i was like oh okay obviously i would work for somebody like that like i don't want to work for a project where there's like people behind that's crazy it's gonna be huge if i had i guess my argument would be if i had direct connections then i wouldn't have to be sent a picture like this that was like to prove to me so i guess that is what i'm trying to show it says lucas and man lucas and manny on this to your mind does this mean that frasier was in on this from the get-go like even on the premeditation of this app because it doesn't seem like he was brought in as an afterthought it seems like he was in this from the beginning i assume all the influencers probably were in this from the beginning because those were already lined up like straight off the bat wow so phase k was in it from the beginning now i confronted phase k on this and asked him how he knew manny and who manny was he denied knowing him he said i believe he is a friend of the dev or a dev i'm not sure exactly who he really is now that's funny because the dev says he doesn't know manny at all manny knew face k and phase k took a picture with the guy's name on it so i find this pretty hard to believe you don't know a guy and then you're writing his name on paper i also asked lucas who is behind the anti-whale change obviously this is one of the most malicious parts of all the code he told me it was sort of talked about in a group of a lot of influencers it was a huge group chat which he was later kicked out of talking about the anti-whale thing do you remember which influencers were telling you that you need to basically speed up the time that they can just basically dump more of their only remember because he's on my screen i know smith was in the group chat i don't know if he was one of the main ones who was like actually messaging it but i know there was a general consensus of them being concerned so they weren't the ones telling me to lower it they were very concerned with and i was just trying to explain this is good for the product like blah blah like 24 hours good why do you think they were concerned about that well i mean obviously now probably because they want to dump right away another interesting moment of the call was he told me that a youtuber named joel morris was also involved now joel morris is the creator of xcademy token he's another one of these guys claiming to be serious and trustworthy with crypto so what did this guy do when he got in the pre-sale phil morris was involved as well do you remember what address he gave you he should have given you an address to like check right yep can i see it i have it let's do a quick check here easy skin all right oh he immediately dumped oh man he looks like he took joel morris took advantage of your little crypto rule here four hours everything right away and then within it looks like yep yep within a very short amount of time he completely dumped his bags he sold immediately to drive the price of a kid's charity token even further into the dirt by the way you'll notice here that joel morris took advantage of the change in the anti-whale code because he was selling literally every minute so clearly these influencers knew that the code has changed now honestly this whole thing is so vomit inducing like this developer's telling me he was misunderstood and is just following orders you have face k saying he didn't make money despite trying his hardest to be the first to sell off you've got basically everyone claiming to be innocent but you couldn't design a bigger token scam and a bigger commercial for it the biggest influencers in the world all saying that it's such a great opportunity now the last person we need to talk about is sam pepper this is an old youtuber who according to reddit posts now works with faze apparently he's their camera guy or comes up with video ideas or something the point is he's close by them he talks to them etc he kept coming up in my investigation even though he wasn't a public part of the project he apparently was one of the people promoting this thing on reddit and creating the mod team i was told as much by the mods themselves the biggest thing that that i know is that typo who was a mod asked me to be a mod before launch i know that him and some of his guys were brought in by pepper to mod this stuff up hmm so pepper was brought in to mod this thing up so what does sam know how is he involved and how much did he really organize a different mod reached out from the group and told me that the group had been talking and realized that maybe sam was the common link they said in a conversation that sam handled the pre-sale as far as i know and that quote sam deleted his telegram why did he do that i had someone actually reach out to sam and he said that he also had no idea who manny was he seemed to be in charge of finding the mod team and says that he's not the mastermind after all phase k apparently brought him on board quote that makes no sense how would i already be on board if i found out from k about the project when i found out about it from k he was already an ambassador wait so phase k got sam pepper in the coin which was later confirmed by phase k himself he said they asked me if i have chat mods but i don't i knew sam had mods so i asked for his not for sam himself now bear in mind sam pepper doesn't have a a great reputation around crypto he's known as scam pepper by some of the cryptocurrency community for all of the the rug pools that he promotes himself but nevertheless it's all leading back to phase k who himself is insisting that oh no i didn't make any money that he's the victim in all of this so where does that leave us fact one we know phase k lied about being some naive crypto investor he's got a history of dumping nearly every crypto project he's ever been involved in and promoting it to his fans fact two we know this thing was designed from the absolute get-go to be a scam you bring people in with this anti-whale mechanism and then at the last minute you remove it number three we know a lot of other youtubers were involved even besides the ambassadors themselves people like joel morris who sold off immediately in fact four we know that the real victims were you the fans of these guys who got in believing that you were somehow supporting kids by getting involved that's the biggest lie of this whole project that kids were gonna be helped by this the only thing we really don't know at this point is who the creator and mastermind of this entire operation was i have my suspicions but no proof whoever they are though they successfully used the greed of influencers and their following to design one of the grossest rug pools of all time that used charity to take money from fans who are less well-off and give it to the people who were shilling the thing i guess and it's not for trying that we don't know who that is i've asked everyone involved lucas i've asked all the influencers i've been in contact with everyone claims to not know who this mastermind is is it this manny guy i also heard of a character named h in the telegram who apparently was ordering everyone around they all say they have no idea who these guys are and that's either yet another lie or these influencers are just really dumb and didn't bother to do due diligence on the project that they were about to promote to their millions of fans all right well that basically concludes my investigation i hope the people involved with this face justice for it and i also hope that two parties learned from this one you the viewers should now be sufficiently disgusted by the actions of these so-called influencers the second group that should learn from this are influencers if you are an influencer let me tell you from the bottom of my heart stop it get some help if you don't the feds are gonna eventually stop you anyways what was done here today with this token could be considered illegal john mcafee literally got charged doing the same things you guys did and the fact that you're throwing away your name and brand for this is disgusting stop posting on social media about crypto period if
