what's going on youtube welcome back to the channel for pretty much my whole video career i've been shooting on sony cameras they're actually pretty standard in the documentary industry sometimes you see canons and and really high-end stuff you might see in alexa but the majority of things that i work on anyways are shot on fs7s i'm actually shooting this video on an fs7 mark ii with all the new announcements out of sony the fx9 fx6 and fx3 not to mention the a7 s3 it's been super hard to keep my gear lust in check i keep asking myself when is the right time to buy a new camera and that's what we're going to talk about in today's video when should you upgrade your camera i think there's two different ways to think about upgrading gear and it really depends on which stage of your career you're in in the first stage you're really just starting out and the best camera for you is whatever one allows you to start creating without breaking your budget entirely a mistake a lot of people make when they're just starting out is that they spend too much money on their first camera they think the reason i'm not getting jobs is because i don't have a red or an alexa and that's just not true if you're working at the level where a red or an alexa or a camera like that is required you're not just starting out i've been making documentary images professionally for over 10 years and i've only touched those kinds of cameras a handful of times in my entire career so rushing out to spend 60 thousand dollars on a camera like that when you don't even have a reel is a huge mistake don't do it if you're in this beginning stage of your career the most important thing in a camera is that you can afford it and that it can shoot good enough video do you even need a 4k camera if no one is asking you for 4k deliverables why not stick with something used that you can buy for half the price if an a7s2 can be bought for 1500 bucks used right now on craigslist why are you spending 4 000 on an a7s3 when no one's paying you for your jobs at this stage in your career your main priority should be shooting as much as possible and putting together a real not owning the best camera i started my photo career with a used nikon d700 that even when i bought it was already kind of out of date it only has a 12 megapixel sensor so it's no one's idea of high resolution but i bought it because it was the best one that i could afford i could have possibly bought a much better camera but then i wouldn't have had any money left over to travel so i decided to get the used camera that i could afford and spent the rest of the year traveling around and building up my first portfolio of documentary images when i bought that camera it was already out of date i told myself that as soon as i could afford it i'd upgrade but actually i ended up keeping it for over three years and well into my professional career i actually published a couple photos including a new york times front page using that camera and if you look through my portfolio i don't think there's anyone out there who could tell me which was taken with the d700 and which were taken with much newer cameras that i got later especially in the beginning of your career no one is going to hire you based on what gear you own so make sure that whatever it is that you buy leave some money left over so that you can actually go out and shoot the point is don't spend all your money on a camera it's not going to get you those jobs but a really good project or real might don't make the mistake of thinking that buying an fx9 is going to help you make your first documentary i promise it won't it's your body of work your real or your portfolio that's going to get you work at this stage not the camera that you own nobody cares what camera you have so make sure that whatever camera you buy there's money left over so that you can actually afford to go and shoot in the second stage of your career you're starting to get more regular jobs and you might even be supporting yourself full-time from documentary work this is when the gear acquisition trap can be the most dangerous i remember running out to buy a super high resolution photo camera as soon as i can afford it and then realizing that it actually clogged up my computer and my whole workflow so badly that it made my job harder and not easier in video production you need a ton of gear relative to still photos but the good news is is that at a certain level people will pay you for owning it at this stage the first question you need to ask yourself is will buying a new camera make me more money or make my job easier if the answer is yes you might want to think about it if the answer is no don't buy a new camera simple as that as a dp on big budget docs renting my gear to productions is one of the main ways that i make money i have one price for myself and another price for the equipment sometimes the production companies have their own gear and they just want your eye and your body to come and use it more usually though they want me to show up with my own stuff that means it's really important to have professional gear stuff that you can count on often when i'm starting to negotiate rates for a new project the production manager will ask me to send through a list of the equipment that i have for rent basically they want to make sure that the stuff you're proposing to charge them for is of professional quality for better for worse there's some real brand name recognition power here even though stuff might work as well if your whole gear list is made up of knock-off third-party products production managers might not want to pay you hundreds of dollars a day to bring it along so it can be in your best interest to buy brand name stuff even if it costs a little bit more money now if all you want to do is make your own documentaries disregard all of that it's not important all that matters in that case is results does it work for you i'm talking about when you are trying to charge people money for gear that you own in that situation you're much better off owning brand-name stuff i'm definitely not saying that you need to go and buy an alexa or a ten thousand dollar case of titan tubes right out of the gate that's not it but make sure your gear is dependable and that you can count on it this is going to be an investment for you and hopefully make you money for years to come so what i like to do is find out where the production company is located get some quotes from nearby rental houses and then charge them 10 or 15 percent less the markup on rental gear is crazy sometimes it's as much as 10 of the original purchase price per day so just by knocking off 10 percent you're still earning a fair bit of money and you're giving them a great deal it's all about making things easy and profitable on both sides if you can save them the time it takes to actually find and rent all this stuff plus save them ten percent they just as happily give their money to you if you charge five percent of the original value of something per day it doesn't take very long before the camera's free that's actually how i got my fs7 i was asked to come on a job that was going to last more than three months i got some quotes from local rental houses and realized really quickly that actually we were going to end up paying more than the camera was worth by renting it if i bought it i could charge them less than the rental company and by the end of the shoot i'd have a fully paid off fs7 that project wrapped and i got to keep the camera now i charge productions for it and it's all profit that's how you can afford things like five thousand dollar tripods and eight thousand dollar cinema lenses if you have the volume of work eventually those things make their money back i got really lucky by being offered a three-month shoot with a guaranteed rental every day but i understand that that's not normal so when do you decide that it's time to upgrade your camera i like to stick to a rule i call the three-time rule that means that i don't buy something until i've been asked for it at least three times i started out with an fs5 that was amazing i used it for years on all sorts of projects but eventually i started to get bigger and bigger jobs and was working for people like netflix and nat geo and they really wanted me to have an fs7 once i'd finished three projects that i'd all asked for that camera i accepted that it was probably the best one for me to buy right now when i look at the fx9 i have crazy gear envy the images look beautiful and it's generally just a better version of the fs7 the problem is that no one has asked me for it that's not to say that people wouldn't be happy if i brought one but so far i haven't had a single job request where people have turned down my fs7 and said we'd hire you if only you had an fx9 it's super tough to keep your gear left in check and i'm struggling hard not to upgrade but until it gets to a point where people will no longer accept the fs7 i'm gonna stick to what i have so to summarize it's all about understanding what the clients that you wanna have expect you to have and then waiting to make sure that you have the volume of work that can justify a big budget purchase recently i was asked to shoot a job with a one day budget of 450 bucks now that's fine but they asked if i could bring an alexa with me which is insane because that's a 45 000 camera at least the only reason they would ask me that is because they know that somewhere out there are people who would say yes that means a young filmmaker has bought a camera that they can afford and are taking jobs that pay way too little in order to try and pay it back the economics will just never work out so wait until you have the volume of work and then get the camera that people have already been asking you for that's the best way to put your gear to work for you as a money making tool before you start thinking that i'm somehow immune to this gear acquisition syndrome or whatever you want to call it let me just tell you a story and put that to rest when i was thinking about starting this youtube channel the very first thing i did was go to b h and fill up a shopping cart i already own an amazing camera and i've got all the accessories you need to make a 4k netflix deliverable high-end dock in the end the whole thing was going to cost me over 5000 us dollars and i hadn't even made a single video now there's tons of excuses i'm filming these videos in a small space and it would be great to have a smaller camera that i could move around more easily there's a ton of reasons why having that camera would have been slightly easier i was literally minutes away from pulling the trigger and charging all of that stuff to my credit card only in the last second did i tell myself to take a step back sleep on it and if i still wanted it in the morning i could buy it then luckily i woke up the next day and i realized that without having made a single video it was stupid to spend thousands of dollars on gear that would only make my life marginally more convenient when i actually already had all the stuff i needed to get started i couldn't make youtube videos with what i had i definitely wasn't going to be any better at making them just because i bought a new camera no camera on earth is going to make you a better shooter people who are really good at what they do will make a great film no matter what tools they have with that said gear can be a really great investment if you're smart about it so to summarize when you're just starting out buy what you can afford buy used or buy last year's model but whatever you do don't spend all of your money on a camera make sure you have some left over so that you can actually shoot something use an iphone if that's all you have eventually when it makes sense upgrade your gear when you have the volume of work that's going to support it not before when people start to hire you figure out what they want and invest in that you can try using my rule of threes if you want waiting until someone has asked you for the same camera three times in a row or make up your own rules it really doesn't matter but make sure that you have the volume of work and that you're buying the right tool not just the newest and shiniest thing because you want it when a new camera comes out ask yourself is this going to make me more money will this meaningfully improve the quality of my work if the answer is no then wait don't buy it gear can be a great investment if you're smart about it it can be a great way to make money and totally worth it just don't start to think that buying stuff will make you a better filmmaker because it won't trust me i've been there and done that and it doesn't work so what cameras are you obsessing over how do you stop yourself from buying stuff what purchases have you made that you deeply regretted later let me know in the comments down below and we can all feel guilty together that's it for this video hope it helps be patient hold on to your money and upgrade when the time is right make your gear work for you and not the other way around
