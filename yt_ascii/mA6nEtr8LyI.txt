to p the wings and bodies of our god for stud so hello everyone i'm here with richard roland and neil degrade as you know we are coming up on the symbolic world summit the very first time we're going to do something with all of us live in person and so i thought it would be a great idea to have two of the speakers two of my precious let's say collaborators for the last few years with me here i have to say i'm excited even just because it's actually the first time that i'll meet richard roland in person you know he he has been on my channel for years now was it like two years almost a little over two years yeah little over two years with and i've never met him i'm getting ready because he's 6'4 and he does jiujitsu so i'm getting ready for that experience like i'm gonna hip toss you as soon as i see right away he'll just right into the ground yeah you're a security plan you're the entire security detail for the conference as well richard so yeah got that going for you well i'm really looking forward to getting to meet both of you in person i in fact earlier today neil i darkhorse has just become my my writing album i listen to it like basically every day now while i'm trying to get my writing in each morning so i'm really looking forward to meeting you and and your wife and obviously jonathan you've been living basically rentree in my house for the last several years so this is going to be awesome awesome it's going to be great so what we're going to do with you is we're going to give you a sense of what's going to happen at the conference everything is set up the schedule is now available and so we can kind of look at how it's going to work for people that are going to come and so i'm going to share my screen and so welcome to the symbolic world summit and so the the way it's going to work is when you come to the summit you will be on different paths and so we have three different paths we have a path with it which is related to art logocentric art that's the one that i'm mostly going to be involved with there is a universal history path which richard is going to be on with father steven d young who will be speaking on his own but will also be part of that path and then we have the hearth and hospitality path which will be about how to kind of integrate integrate symbolism into your everyday life and so for the logocentric art one obviously it's going to be the best one i'm just saying you know because yeah so let me jump in jonathan go for it neil my understanding of how this is going to work with the schedule is that day one we get there day one is it's mostly the evening it's a registration it's getting to meet people that you've known online you know meet people within the s symbolic world who have the same interests as you but on day two is when the paths begin so around i think it's around 10 o'c we break we break apart into these two different paths now so for everybody come to the conference they have to choose a path each day so logo centric art for example is going to have is going to be mainly for myth makers and artisans but also people who want to get better at breaking down the symbolic meaning within stories thems and in literature i think that'll be a really helpful path for them at the same time competing with us head-to-head in the octagon is richard roland and richard sorry i pluralized your name like everyone does to you richard and father stephen are going to be going head-to-head against us so we're we're basically try to get people to sign up for this ahead of time so that we know which group is going to be in which room because one of the rooms is slightly larger than the other i gotta warn you because father steph and i together are a formidable team the tallest i think he's like six seven so no he's he's a i think he's about as tall as i am but he's he's he's he's very big i like to exaggerate i like to give him nephilim type he's at least 6 foot n that's true yeah okay great great so someone asked me on twitter if we could make some of the giants in god's dog look like father steven young i'm just saying that would be amazing great so yeah there's a path you have to choose ahead of time on you'll get an email about this if you've bought a conference ticket and on day three it's just one single breakout for the day and so you'll get to the there'll be a second part of the logo centric art and that'll be with vasper stamper and martin shaw quite another power team and then competing against them going head to-head in the hearth and hospitality is nicholas kotar he's probably going to tell you more about how to survive a russian fairy tale i'm sure baba yaga and some of those people will come into his talk if he gives a similar talk to the one he gave when i was in the keys with him recently it was it was stellar i'm still chewing on it so two months later as you can see that there will be these ps on the first day we will all be together we are we are so fortunate to have john hees those who don't know him you've probably seen him on the why are we speaking about rabbits podcast that i've been on i think all of you have been on right yeah everybody here has on the podcast and so he will be our our m or mater d he'll be how do you say that in english he'll be like the host i guess master of ceremonies master of ceremonies that's the word be the master of ceremonies for the the whole event the first evening will start with me giving the first talk about kind of this apocalyptic vision of the world and how we can understand the cosmos as revelation trying to bring together all the stuff that i've been talking about for years into one talk so i'm looking forward to that we'll have a q&a and then we are going to have a concert which i hope you're practicing neil i hope you're practicing i'm always practicing i'm finishing up the record right now so the practicing begins soon we've got the band together and we are really excited to do this show we're we're working on putting together a light show right now which is kind of fun to go with it i didn't know we we would have that at our disposal but we will hopefully some projection and multimedia experience with dero robins so that's going to be great we're going to play all of our biggest songs the stuff you guys are familiar with and a couple of songs you hadn't heard yet because they will literally be coming out that day also we're giving a free digital download of the record to everyone who comes to the conference there'll be a little qr whatever they call those qr codes is that what they're called it'll be a qr code you can scan at our merch table and for coming to the event you get a free digital 24-bit version of the record all right this is going to be it's going to be amazing you haven't performed in how long i perform we perform all the time with different things we haven't gotten the whole band back together in quite a while so it was yeah last decade before we did it but i mean we sing and play all the time i mean it's kind of unfair to say like we haven't played we haven't played with this particular line up in a while of course of course yeah all right so day two then is father stephen is going to present for the the in the morning and his theme is just absolutely crazy frederck n's guide to the bly resurrection he told me about this sorry he told me a little bit about this when we were at the lord of spirits conference together last year so i'm very excited about this talk all right this is going i'm happy that he's he's preparing something amazing for us i'm looking forward to it and then this is when we break up into the different paths you know neil the grade will be there at the very f presenting the very first one i will be in that path as well go like you said going head toad with richard roland now what's important to understand in this breakdown is that you will ultimately everybody will have access to everything so if you come to the conference you ch you choose a path you get to see get to be part of that conference part but everything will be filmed so that at the end the participants will get a way to access all the all the talks so they could rewatch them and they can also watch the on that they missed and so we wanted to make sure that everybody had access to everything and then on the third day again we have a breakout we have a panel with everybody on the stage when is when is martin shaw doing his first talk mark shaw is on yeah sorry go back to friday afternoon that's right on friday at 3m is when martin shaw is going to present riding the back of a wolf myth making in the time of the spy glass sounds amazing martin i i'm really looking forward to that stuff man everybody's outdoing themselves with their titles here i'm just looking forward to being in the same room with him like that's going to be definitely like it's a big deal i've admired his work for a long time even before he became a christian so this is this is pretty pretty insane no he's got an energy to him there's something he's got like a celebrity energy it's kind of neat like if he's in the room it's like you can people like are like who's that guy even if they don't know him he's got there's he's got a presence yeah definitely i mean and he's such an amazing storyteller i can't i can't wait he's going to tell part of what he's going to do is going to be tell a story he's going to have a speaking part but he's also gonna have an actual story part which is that's great when he tells a story it's really wonderful and then we will finish with a last a last little presentation for me kind of trying to get a sense of what the future is both in terms of what we're doing but also just in terms of how i see what's coming over the hill for for you know for the whole story of western civilization and the story of of of what's coming that's it i mean yes it'll all be super positive we'll end in a very positive note u for sure and so this is going to be i mean it's gna be amazing i i' i'm already seeing a lot of people you know a lot of people are telling me they're going to come you know that are like it's hard because i can't i don't want to say some of the people but people that you've seen on the channel you know different people that have been around are going to be there and then also people that wrote for the blog people that are you know it's just going to be all the people that you meet on the facebook that are really involved and it's all it's going to be a real life thing with real life people oh it's gonna be like that scene in bill and teds too when they go to heaven and like einstein's playing cards with n or something like that it's going to there's going to be a lot of people there that are going to surprise you who are just milling around a couple things worth mentioning that i was just talking so tyler from king 16 is putting this all together for us and they have there's a vip key path and apparently there's a there's 10 new vip tickets available they turned 10 normal tickets into vip tickets so if people were felt like they missed out on the vip you have the chance to make that upgrade so the vip has a bunch of like they have their own room they can hang out with snacks and coffee and then you know the speakers eventually will trickle in just kind of like a you know you're at disney and you're doing a character meet and greet we'll just wander in and take pictures with you so and then there's also a meet and greet at the end and there's some special stuff for the vip so if you want to get some extra time with the speakers i think that's a great a really great path to do that also i didn't see it on the schedule jonathan but on the final day we're in tarpon springs florida and st nicholas cathedral is there it's a orthodox cathedral it's a really wild building and you're doing a tour with the vips at 8 am that morning so they do a church tour with you and that ends at 8:45 so that's saturday morning we'll have a we'll have a church tour with the vips yeah it's just hard to have we can't have everybody in the church the same time because we're looking at 500 people so it's that doesn't seem reasonable to detour so this is the best way we thought would make sense to do a kind of church tour hopefully we can film it too i don't know we'll see if we can film it that'd be nice too the church tour yeah maybe i don't know yeah i got people there with video that are coming with me so sure let's say we're going to film it and then other things that tyler wanted me to bring up one anybody you know there's still there's still a bunch of tickets left regular tickets left only a few vip tickets but if you're someone who wants to buy tickets for someone i mean go for it like if you if you're one of those people like hey money is not an issue buy everyone a ticket we want bring bring people this is going to be an incredible event to be at in person but not just that also consider if you you've gotten an email from the symbolic world you can email us and get a discount code if you want to get tickets for five or more people like you want to put together a group from your church last minute i know a lot of you people like me like anytime i go to a conference i always buy my ticket last minute and you're kind of in that zone right now so now is the time if you want to get them but yeah again there's a 10% discount code for group buys of five or more that people want to consider all right so this is it folks i mean it's coming it's going to come really fast and it's going to be it's g to be so much fun i'm really looking forward to it to meeting you and then there'll be people even i mean heather pollington who did snow white she's coming in from europe you know martin shaw's coming from england andrew g's going to be there just hanging out with us there'll be a bunch of people that are just going to be there hanging out that that you will be surprised to see so looking forward to that oh yeah and everybody's super friendly i think again i can't reiterate enough we've gotten so comfortable with this like engaging this content you know online but i mean we were just all together you know richard didn't come but we went to london and being together was just something else i mean it i'm never around that many people who i have so many things i want to talk about and everything they talk about is interesting to me and you know because normally as i'm drifting through life i start to talk about the things i'm interested in and i just sound like a crazy person to the person at the coffee shop who who decided to strike up a conversation with this guy with this beard i thought they were going to be able to give me their christmas list but instead they're talking about symbolism and i i think it's a wild experience to be to get together with that many people that have so much in common i think it's going to be incredible all right folks so get your tickets if you don't have them if you do have them watch out for an email from the symbolic world so that you can pick your path and we can plan this out so we're all ready to receive you at the end of february and obviously pick my path because it's going to be the best path we're gonna get we're gonna get some weird stories about genesis and i was actually doing this with with father steph's sort of blessing i feel i feel like it's a little you know intimidating to talk about the bible with him in the room but we we already kind of talked about this last year and and i think we're i think i think we're on the same the same wavelength so it's going to be it's going to be the best path choose my path the best path i think i want one of those universal history bingo cards for the people in your room where like every time you guys say like certain things like nephilim tower of babel they check it off and then there can be some kind of gift i think this is going to happen this gon to be a lot of tower of babble stuff in my in my talk i'm just tell people now so for jonathan it's gonna be fractals chairs microphones that's right the usual it'll be a good time it'll be all right folks so this is it we're gonna sign off and yeah we're looking forward to seeing you there in tarban springs byebye
