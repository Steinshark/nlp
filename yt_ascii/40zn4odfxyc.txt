they let everyone else bring their laptop to the coffee shop why not [music] me believe it or not they didn't ask me to leave but they probably should have the mack case b43 is unlike any other laptop that we've looked at before for starters it's got three monitors it weighs nearly 40 lbs fully loaded and it fits fullsize desktop pc parts or it at least it kind of does we ran into some unexpected challenges while building it today so surely with that in mind it must be reasonably price then [music] right that is where you're wrong but hey that's our job right to waste our money on this kind of stuff so you don't have to so you can spend your money with our sponsor dads are amazing but their wallets are [music] not make daddy a baddy again happy father's [music] day just like with our last ma case briefcase pc build this thing is flipping heavy it's actually really front heavy too if you look at how it sits when i'm holding in the handle so putting it on our scale here which i don't even know if it goes as high 12 kilg which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 lb so don't expect to be commuting with this thing that is unless your hobby already happens to be lifting heavy things and putting them back down now it's worth noting though that the additional weight does come with some benefits there is we'll figure that out in a moment we've got the same ruggedized build with these rubber corner protectors on it and there is considerably more room to build in here that is actually a pretty real able amount of space and this time the keyboard folds out away from the tower which is a very welcome change for my poor wrists i mean imagine if it was like the last one where you had to sit and use it like this not to mention my poor hands since the last case had the gpu inside venting directly up at the keyboard causing it to get hot enough to cook on unfortunately the keyboard design hasn't changed and it still sucks and so does the teeny tiny little attached trackpad the good news though is we get a nice monitor upgrade not only are there three displays now but they've been sized up from 16.1 in to 17.3 or'.5 depending on which part of the product page you believe no 17.3 one thing the product page makes no mention of one way or the other is the ergonomics and i got to say at a normal sitting height i sincerely hope that these are ips type displays because otherwise i'm not going to be able to see anything on them also wow these hinges like most laptop displays these use embedded display port or edp which means they need a controller board in order to accept desktop signals so those are in here which makes sense but what doesn't make sense is the manufacturer opting for ancient vga cables as the default to connect to them modern gpus don't support vga natively at all and these boards have hdmi inputs also it would probably just make even more sense to use display port since edp is functionally compatible with it but i guess that would have made things too easy enough about the case for now though let's turn our attention to the pc that we'll be building inside it now normally amds 16 core ryzen 9 7950 x 3d wouldn't be our first choice the 78 100x 3d performs roughly the same in games at a much lower price however the extra course should help us in non-gaming tasks like video editing while still maintaining the same 120 wat tdp besides we already spent a ridiculous amount of money on this case so we might as well do it up which is exactly why we went for the asus crosshair x67 genan it's got two usb 4 40 gb per second ports wi-fi 60 and 2 and2 gig ethernet allowing highspeed access to everything from a portable storage drive to a high-capacity network storage appliance now look realistically any board with a compatible chipset would have been just fine but this motherboard happens to have the cpu socket just a little bit higher up which we hoped would help us fit a better cooler into the system too bad it didn't cooling ended up being quite the journey for this machine cuz original we wanted to go for liquid cooling but any radiator that was big enough to result in an improvement over air cooling stubbornly refused to fit anywhere and while we could have mounted it to the outside does this thing really need to be even sillier so we tried to assassinate our thermal troubles with one of these fine coolers the problem is that our case was just barely too short relatable after a bit of searching we came across the rz 6 20 from pc cooler they sent this and a few other coolers to us for the all china pc but when we assembled it in testing it got in the way of our gpu so after all of that we went with the nhl 12s x77 it's not really designed for a high powerered chip like ours but according to nocta it is better than its predecessor while offering higher clearance for ram so good luck on the subject of ram we're going to be using this kit from king bank of all people it's a sharp blade 32 gb 6400 megat transfer per second kit that king bank explicitly lists the ic's for which can be really helpful when it comes to compatibility and performance on am5 it has no issues fitting under the l12s cooler even with a bottom mounted fan and the white heat spreaders match our ssd even if nothing else in the build is white on that subject we've gone with the crucial t705 with white heat sink okay pci express gen 5 makes no meaningful difference to real world performance but hey under ideal conditions this thing can hit read and write speeds in excess of 10 gab a second and since we're going overkill we might as well include tom's hardware's fastest ssd on the planet to go along with our fastest gpu on the planet i see fastest i get but is there a reason we went for the biggest gpu on the planet it's not the biggest the biggest is the zotac pgf 490d but that one is a china exclusive and we can't get it out very easily ah i see so i have the second biggest 490 but this was about more than just eping see our last m case build thermal throttled pretty spectacularly and we hoped that by having a very large cooler we could avoid the same issue this time of course we need to figure out how the devil to get this card packed in here oh oh good a universal vertical graphics call that explains why we couldn't just use a regular c type downdraft cooler and we needed the small form factor one oh things are about to get tight now lonus i can hear you saying why are you making such a big deal out of this the card fits just fine and that would be true if nvidia in their infinite wisdom hadn't brought us the acclaimed 60 pin 12vt high power connector because at this case height we either need to plug it in and then put on the side panel and mash it down and hope for the best or we need to use a 90degrees adapter either of which could lead to spontaneous combustion making matters even dumber remember how our display cables need to connect internally to those little boards well if we had the gpu here we would need to run three hdmi cables at least two of them on these display port to hdmi adapters through this tiny little hole in the chassis right here that even one adapter doesn't fit through absolutely flipping genius without further ado then let's get our gpu installed on our cooler master vertical graphics card holder kit guess i got a little carried away talking let's go ahead and get this motherboard installed real quick here now this bad boy goes in here and this is going to go in here that is surprisingly tight you're going to have to take that out what i have to take the fan out yeah you really got to take the fan out because what you want to do is get this back a little way so that you can get the cables in there and you don't have to route them the through the outside of the case oh no i don't even get a cooling fan for this thing nope well we we've got some concessions just like this whole thing is a big concession i'll take a hot dog so we need to give this a little slide and then my poor one intake fan needs to come out now we plug in our poror cables that are about to get mashed i need to move this bracket or this brace this is clearly not going to be staying in yeah there's going to be a lot of things you're going to have to remove there but what now do we have air intake coming in no that's where the handle is what's the plan here we have a replacement side panel that we are going to cut a couple holes in and then make look kind of nice i can see from how the side panel doesn't have holes in it yet that we have not tested this no no but that's why we have justin wow this looks awesome now to simplify our cable management a little bit we're going to be using these lee and lee fans that clip together a little something like that and then we're able to power both of them including their rgb with a single lead not going to lie that actually looks kind of sick and check this out guys we are at least kind of pretending that this is for a long-term deployment so we're going with a positive air pressure setup using these filters right here and here and we'll be using them to bring fresh air okay i promise there's a method to this madness directly to our cpu cooler right here and to our gpu right here and the reason that we didn't put them exactly vertically mounted is if you take two fans that spin the same direction and put them one right on top of the other you end up with a ton of turbulence and noise that can kind of end up working against each other but if we take that fan and we put it between these other two so the blades are spinning in the opposite direction the effect shouldn't be as bad in theory not going to lie this actually looks as powerful as it is now but on the subject of power we're not powering any of it yet for that we are going to need a power supply now this case is compatible with full-sized atx power supplies but now that our gpu is here you can see that there would be a bit of an interference issue so we've gone with an sfx power supply from cooler master specifically the v100 one of the most powerful small form factor power supplies on the market i mean i feel like i say this every time i open one of these but really 1,00 watts in the palm of my hand i mean they cheated a little bit this modular interface is not really inside the chassis but now this is interesting with the full-size adapter bracket on here you can see that this sits almost right up against the gpu which hilariously if you note the feeder here is going to allow our power supply to act as a gpu support bracket before we plug that in though probably a good time for us to get these hdmi cables plugged into our little daughter boards here and then oh maybe hide them behind the gpu man now that we got a window it's going to be tough to make this look good now there was some debate about the orientation of our power supply and honestly both ways have merit if we had the fan facing this way right here it would be drawing fresh air in through our speed holes which is obviously good for having lower temperatures in our power supply but i wanted to try it this other way and see if that would be okay because then the fan could help contribute to exhausting some of the hot air that is otherwise going to be i mean what basically just kicked out by this tiny little fan right here and then passively through the holes in the case all right time to wire this thing up now you might have noticed that our gpu power cable doesn't match the rest of our power cables that's kind of the theme of the build isn't it random white components that don't match the rest of the black ones i'm just going to put two screws in for a quick power on test but i got to say man the fit of this acrylic panel is awesome awesome considering all justin did was what 3d scan the case we got life in there oh yeah buddy did i plug the power supply side of that mox cable in i did not okay that my friends is why you never close a side panel before you've actually verified that the system posts any luck yep you got power nice oh hey look at that there we go freaking awesome all right let's lose this wow let's turn on our memory overclocking profile give it the old save and reboot how glorious is it you guys it's pretty glorious when i was doing a test run of it i also set up nvidia [music] surround they're not the brightest monitors but hey this isn't the brightest computer the sag is very noticeable i got frame view launched with the trackpad so we can monitor our frame rates and temperatures but i did notice a small problem this trackpad is even worse than i remember it being so i was like oh i'll just plug in my m u where is the front iio ah how convenient there we go and what's great about this design is that it's not like you could just use the middle display on its own and not have these hanging out nope nope whole thing deploys or nothing no hdr these do not support hdr in fact we haven't really talked about this yet but they are ips type which is nice so the viewing angles are okay but they are 1080p 60 hz only conceivably you could replace the panels with something else but my goodness would that ever be a lot of work tenner quick question for you is that oh is there an on-screen display for the monitors so theoretically there should be one for the actual controller boards that are in there i looked at the spec sheet for the chip that's on there and yeah it seems like there should be a couple of buttons for some sort of osd but we don't have access to it so no there's a button at the front i think that this bezel presses the buttons and tells it that hey the monitor should be off is that a reset button maybe it's just a reset button that a reset button would make a lot of sense let's see what the oh yeah yeah no that computer is definitely restarting oh okay what i want to know is how our temperatures are going to hold [music] up i think the best part of those thermal results is we could totally do better if we managed to squeak a bigger cooler in there maybe a couple more fans not only would our gpu manage to turbo to 2.7 ghz i think we could prevent it from thal throttling on the cpu as well though if we were to actually deploy the system for real there's another major consideration and that's that we would need to work in some kind of bracket to support that gpu we had the system restart not once but twice while just moving it around on the set from being on that pcie riser pretty minor issues overall though good proof of concept now one thing that i missed is we actually screwed in the holes for these little rubber corner reinforcement pieces so we don't even have to give up a ton of ruggedness let's go ahead and pop these on and then i think we're ready for our little trip to starbucks of course you guys already saw that that didn't really go so well so you've got to be wondering what is this thing for well at about $1,500 with shipping and that's just for the chassis the peripherals and the monitors it's obviously a niche device but for the folks who need something kind of portable it ended up just shy 40 lbs fully built and with this kind of performance like an onlocation film crew or a scientific expedition it's actually surprisingly price competitive with pre-built solutions from specialty companies like this one just be aware you're going to have to be ready for some compromises like the ergonomics completely suck unless you tilt it up about this much otherwise you're looking down at the monitors and unless you're willing to get a little bit jank like we did you're almost certainly going going to have to be dealing with overheating unless you go with a more basic spec at which point you've got to be asking yourself why didn't you just buy a laptop so yeah it's kind of bad like this bad segway to our sponsor to sab fathers they rich sent me to find some dad jokes in vancouver we had a dad give me some dad my neighbor gave me a new roof and he said that it was on the house is your that funny where does the dad keep all his dad jokes pocket in his data base what biscuit flies little plain ones so a polar bear walks into a bar yeah says to the bartender i want a rum and coke the bartender says what's with the paws the polar bear says oh i was born with those i've got the dictionary tattooed on my on my stomach adds definition this is a rich new mech safe wallet you can put it on top like this do i have a gift for my dad no i'm not buying my dad anything but i do call him what should catch it's for your father okay yeah i'll give it to my dad do you have a wallet no you don't have a wallet i have a rubber band oh fancy the future is here right now rich has a 40% off for father's day so there you go awesome check out our website and the link below if you guys enjoyed this video maybe check out our video on the 58 by9 resolution signage
