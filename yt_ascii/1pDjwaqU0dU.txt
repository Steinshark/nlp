hello everyone and welcome i recently saw a jalopnik article about an auto car article from the 1970s that was talking about a rolls-royce wankel diesel engine and this was so fascinating that i thought i had to make a video about it so that's what we're going to be talking about here and basically this engine the goal of it was back in the 1970s rolls-royce wanted to make this as a military engine for use in the military and their goal was high power high efficiency in a very compact size wankel engines of course have the benefit of being small and power dense diesel engines have the benefit of being efficient so kind of combining all of that into this one amazing engine well the challenge that they ran into is that wankel engines are hard to design with a high compression ratio and their solution you could supercharge it you could turbo charge it they decided to add a whole nother wankel engine rotary in there basically in order to use that as a supercharger or as a compressor this is just a positive displacement compressor that forces more air into this combustion chamber right here so this one is just for transferring air this one is actually where combustion is occurring and so basically how this works is the ratio of the displacement of this rotary right here versus this one right here is going to give you your increase a multiplier for your compression ratio so this lower stage is 3250cc cubic centimeters versus this upper stage is 1265cc you divide those two and that means your compression ratio is effectively being multiplied by 2.57 now you may be thinking wow this is huge why would they use something so big to compress air for that other stage but actually they looked into just doing a single rotor with a high compression ratio simply by using the geometry of how it's designed and in order to do that it requires a really large footprint so a single rotor with a high compression ratio would be very similar in size to these two rotors using this to increase your effective compression ratio so overall the size is actually pretty compact even though it looks like it's basically enormous now another challenge they ran into is they decided to use direct injection but there wasn't too much research out there on using direct injection in diesel ankle engines so they ended up trying 30 different combinations for combustion chambers they tried six different injector positions basically over a hundred different combinations that they tried out and settled on one that worked best you know much easier in a piston cylinder device to just have that injector directly on top as that piston comes up right in the middle of that circle perfectly distributes the fuel versus you know having that winkle sweep by is much more challenging in order to have that perfect air fuel mixture and then have that ignite when you inject that fuel so how does this thing work well basically you have your air intake down here at the bottom so this bottom rotor rotates about this blue eccentric shaft right here as that rotates it compresses that air into this stage right here so then this rotor then rotates and compresses that air then you inject that fuel you have combustion occur the rotor continues to rotate about that separate its centric shaft right there in blue as it rotates the exhaust is then pushed out you know the that's the power stroke right there is rotating that then the exhaust is then pushed out and actually continues to do useful work rotating that second compressor with that exhaust and then finally dumped out this exhaust right here so that cycle just basically continues and you know both of these are rotating about and you're creating a good power within a pretty good footprint so the rolls engine is the 2-r6 engine and basically it was set up with two banks on two stages so overall this was basically a four rotor engine you know sorry rob dom they were doing this back in the 1970s producing 350 horsepower at 4 500 rpm and only weighing 939 pounds now 939 certainly sounds like a lot but remember this is a diesel engine and this is back in the 70s at the time it was way smaller and way lighter than similar diesel v8s that had similar output so the v8 you know diesels were much bigger similar much more weight a similar output you know but of course that drawback of their size and weight so they did actually achieve their goal of having something that you you know was powerful efficient and in a much more compact size it's unfortunate you know that ultimately the research kind of died out and so we don't have cool ankle engines running around today perhaps you know if more companies invested in it we could have them but hopefully mazda does come up with something in the near future so that would be cool to see you know this engine kind of live on but really neat concept you know it was it was fascinating to hear about this using a separate basically rotary engine just as an air compressor for the main rotor so very cool to see if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching should they keep watching more videos bucket they should probably keep what oh god hey that's all right it's not okay huh okay i'll let you get back to your nap you
