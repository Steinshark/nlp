let me know if this sounds familiar the company holds an event they announce a crazy innovative smartphone you see this thing plus it across the internet for the next few days but then nothing it just disappears off the face of the planet gone you don't see it in stores you didn't see any more long-term reviews that's kind of it so i'm gonna be telling you why these phones keep failing and how i think they can be made to not fail it all boils down to impatience if you look at the companies that are selling well in the smartphone market the common theme is that they build good phones not crazy phones not even necessarily the most exciting ferns but just well-rounded devices now that is easier said than done especially for a new company and even if you're able to do that it could be years before you're in the limelight and you're getting good media coverage so many companies turn to the alternative let's build something crazy it could be a holographic display it could be a fully integrated gaming controller or it could just be sticking an',000 milliamp hour battery inside this kind of experimentation is exciting for consumers to look at and so it makes sense for the media and for youtubers to cover it a company can shoot straight to the top of the news just by being different you might remember that massive energize a smartphone i covered that video is on nearly 5 million views and all it is is a quick look at the device that's almost definitely more exposure than i'd get for covering a samsung flagship or even an iphone it's kind of amazing that that a phone with this much interest when listed on indiegogo achieved a grand total of 15 backers less than 1% of what the company's goal was and so the problem is that whilst people talk about crazy people even share crazy people don't buy crazy you see innovative smart phones must take the asus zenfone 6 as an example there risky to be innovative a phone has got to be doing something that nobody else is and in a lot of cases there's a good reason why they're not innovative smart phones are more likely to go wrong and more likely to just run into completely unforeseen issues than if you just took last year's offering and made it better this is gonna seem like a strange example but bear with me here buying a smart phone is very different to buying let's say a meal when you go out and order food most people aren't afraid to experiment you might end up with a completely new amazing experience and even if it's a mistake you just don't order that food again the difference when it comes to buying a small phone is that most people can't afford to make a mistake they are not only far more expensive than food but an average consumer is gonna buy one phone and it's gotta last them at least two years and in that time it's gonna be a central part of their life so because of this when consumers are buying phones they are risk-averse or in other words unwilling to take a chance i think a lot of new phone companies get a bit carried away with how are we gonna make ourselves stand out and they kind of forget that the bigger questions buyers are worried about things like is this phone gonna get updates is it gonna be easily repaired how can i make sure that it's not going to break over time one of my most asked questions is why do i use the galaxy s 10 5g i could have pitch the asus wrong phone - which is faster i could pitch the huawei p 30 pro whose camera i prefer or i could have gone for the asus zenfone 6 which takes better selfies the answer to that is that the s 10 5g is the most well rounded and more importantly hassle-free phone i've used my phone is so important to me that i'd be willing to have a slightly less exciting experience if it meant that i had peace of mind and this is the general attitude of consumers they're not willing to try something that's better just in case it's not and yoshi works both ways because companies are risk averse - chances are when you see one of these crazy innovative smart phones it'll either be made by a company that is completely new to the smartphone market and so it has less to lose or it'll be produced by one of the big smartphone makers but under a more obscure sub brand all right imagine your samsung your biggest launch of the year is your galaxy s series where you just know you're gonna get high-volume reliable sales long story short you've got no reason to ruin a good thing let's say for one of these phones you decided to try something different and you ended up releasing something that was quite interesting but ended up being a little bit unrefined you risk damaging the galaxy s brand if something went wrong - a sidelined galaxy a series burned or a smartphone that's in a completely new sub brand of its own then the actual core galaxy s brand is still somewhat protected so it makes sense for the innovation and the experimentation to be reserved for the phones that don't matter as much this becomes a vicious cycle if companies are only willing to experiment and try new things on their loki sub brand phones which they don't promote heavily and then consumers are only willing to buy main line highly promoted devices because that's what they trust then right out the gate the most innovators our phones aren't even being given a chance to succeed and so for a quick example of how to enter the smartphone market done right let's take a look at one plus when oneplus came to market they were a nobody two founders they didn't even have trust on their side and they had to grab attention somehow now i think the wrong way of doing this would have been to try and throw all your resources into one killer feature to make something that really stood out that really grabbed headlines but oneplus did the right thing they didn't build a crazy phone the oneplus one was already standard flagship fern buy a lot of metrics but they still managed to get that media coverage through a crazy low price and smart marketing now that the media was paying attention all they have to do is just keep making better versions of this and five years later some people are buying womp losses over iphones as a final note is worth clarifying that i'm not saying that innovation is dead and in fact the way this market works ends up also flushing out a lot of the useless innovation but my point is that those really out there devices you could call them innovative you could call them cutting-edge you could also call them gimmicky these do not succeed and where that being said thanks it off watching and i will catch you in the next one [music] you
