all right so you probably already know that the redneck e20 pro is insane value for money but it does have competition from the likes of the whomper seven as well as the sharmini nine so welcome to the pole camera comparison kicking things off with standard four key video from the rear camera and the first thing you'll notice is they're all pretty similar in terms of both dynamic range and color profile there really isn't much in it they all side with a slightly oversaturated look with an emphasis on red hues but i got to say the result is clean across the board bear in mind that the k2000 can be had for approximately 360 dollars 1 plus 7 at 5:30 and me 9 at about 470 let's say you wanted to zoom in while taking video whilst both the red knee and the show-me have 2 x telephoto lenses neither actually uses them in video so when you zoom in 2 times the quality isn't all that different if you zoom in 5 times you can really see that it's comparable the one plus is footage looks a little clearer but it's more the case that it's hdr is more aggressive than the fact that is actually capturing more detail thankfully while they don't use their telephoto lenses in video both the red me and the charr me can use their ultra white cameras and the difference it makes is massive and it'll become even clearer when we get to photos so here's the catch the k20 pro in the me 9 don't have oh is on any of their three cameras and so even though the 1 plus 7 only has one main camera and a second just for depth the fact that this main camera does have inbuilt stabilization makes a massive difference when you're walking even at 1080p here the electronic stabilization on the two phones on either side is good but it can't completely compensate for the lack of oh is if you look at the k 20 foot egde you'll notice how every now and again when i take a step it jerks a bow a little bit all three phones can record slow-motion video at 240 frames per second and well the oneplus footage looks a lot better it's partly sharpening oneplus has aggressive sharpening on slow-mo footage which to be fair the other two phones could really benefit from but it's also just capturing more detail take a look at the plant pots hanging above my head the two phones on either side can level this up to short bursts of 960 frames per second footage the oneplus can shoot continuously but only at 480 in low-light video falls apart on all three phones but you might be able to tell that the me 9 is the furthest behind edges have lost a lot more sharpness than on the other two and you'll see that this trend continues into photos all three phones have a dedicated night mode and as we start to go through these shots you'll notice a very clear hierarchy forming at the top is the 1 + 7 followed by the k 20 pro followed by the me 9 the xiaomi phone uses very aggressive noise reduction which does mean less grain than on the k 20 but had the cost of super soft looking images compare the texture on the bench behind me in this shot a massive difference both the redmi and the xiaomi let you use the telephoto lenses in night mode but with oneplus you just have to crop into the photo afterwards which means if you did want to zoom in it's going to lose quite a lot of fidelity and then you've got ultra low light the me 9 is a bit of a mess but the oneplus makes the image look far too warm and this is not an issue that's restricted to just the 1 plus 7 on a similar note with no external lighting using only the flash oneplus does a better job at keeping an image with the most true to life color front cameras also carry forward the same trend as the rear cameras except in this case instead of the me 9 being at the bottom of the pile it's the k 20 pro each shot just has the bit more grain than its xiaomi counterpart with video from the front camera you'll probably notice two things number one is that oneplus crops into the sensor so the footage looks much closer to you and the second thing is that while slit is the greenest oneplus has captured more detail than the other two on those phones there is no hope of being able to distinguish the mister who's the boss logo on my shirt before we take a look at photos from the rear cameras let's take a look at selfies if you look at the text to the right to my head you can see that oneplus creates the most bokeh but in some lighting can make me look a little bit red all three can do portrait mode and while the results are pretty contrasting i'd say all three have great edge detection even in difficult scenarios the k 20 does have a trick up its sleeve though it lets you take panorama shots on the front camera and this makes a huge difference to your field of view but you've got to do it slowly otherwise you can get some weird blurring in it i mentioned already that the oneplus evan crops into the sense of her video and this becomes especially apparent when you're trying to record yourself the end result is really well balanced color wise it almost reminds me of iphone 10s footage but the crop means that this is not a phone for vloggers okay so for most people in this hierarchy of which aspects of your phone's camera matter the most right at the top is probably how does it take photos in the daytime and this is where the k20 pro is greatest strength lies it's a phone that is so much cheaper than the oneplus and when you're in good lighting there is no way you can tell and in fact in some ways it even pulls ahead take this shot right here looks pretty equivalent on all phones but the ultra wide camera is on the red me and the xiaomi makey game-changing difference you might be able to tell that whilst the me night is capturing a ton more than the oneplus the ke 20 pro is capturing even more than the xiaomi there are different degrees of ultra wide and so whilst the me 9 can capture everything in a 117 degree field of view the k20 pro can do so at closer to 1 to 5 which makes these kinds of shots even more dramatic 1 plus also feels the pain when you start zooming in because it also lacks a telephoto camera if you wanted to take let's say a 10 times zoom shot it is a long way behind the other two and between them i'd say the me 9 takes it marginally the k 20 pros shots are just slightly over sharpened things get really interesting when we dive into portrait mode and the key takeaway here is that because the two phones on either end use their telephoto cameras for this the end result has much less face distortion than on oneplus on that phone you have to go right up to someone's face to take a shot like this and that ends up making their face look a little too rounded and the other benefit is that with these two phones you can take portrait mode shots closer to subjects the one plus just won't work as soon as you get within a certain distance one saving grace is that the 1 + 7 does have the closest focusing distance and combined with its wide f 1.7 aperture means more background blur in normal non portrait shots the other important question is detail so with all three phones on there 12 megapixel setting if we crop in 20 times this is the result to be honest there isn't much in it they also all have a 48 megapixel mode but to be honest i'm not huge fan of how ends up looking in all but the best conditions 12 megapixel shots look better if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated and if you haven't already seen the unboxing and review of the k 20 pro then do check that out i'll leave it as a link from this video my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
