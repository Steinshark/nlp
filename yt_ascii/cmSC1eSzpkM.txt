hello everyone particularly my fellow canadians as many of you know we lost one of our greatest citizens very recently mr rex murphy who who everyone knew i would say perhaps is canada's most outstanding journalist i had the great privilege of traveling to new finland with rex and we we filmed a documentary about that great province and its history and we're very pleased to be able to bring you that documentary as a tribute to rex in the aftermath of his passing so i hope you enjoy watching it as much as i did making it although i can't see how that's possible because i really enjoyed making it i'm really going to miss him and he was a he was a great man the past is still truly alive the past becomes increasingly valuable to come somewhere here and see see these deep roots and this deep particularity there's a relief in it that's akin to the relief of looking at a great landscape vista it's literally and metaphorically revivifying [music] [applause] [music] and action hello everyone i have the great privilege and honor to be here in new finland with mr rex murphy rex was a of mine i would say and of many canadians he's one of canada's great journalists will have to close or something breaks one of the most recognized and loveed figures in all the country when newlanders were crawling out of the shock and misery of the cod collapse fort mcmurray was like a rescue center so we're here in newland in this great old part of canada with a unique culture born of isolation in many ways and rex has kindly agreed to spend a week showing us around talking to us about the culture new finlanders think of new finland as a personality newand has a distinct personal relationship with newand is it goes deep well one of the things that's really striking about meeting people from new finland is they're often extremely tough and extremely funny and when i reflected on that even prior to knowing you i thought well this was a very very isolated place and that meant that people made their own music and they made own and then all thear of and that's part of what we want to shine light on while being here we're invting you along on the trip we're making this up in the most professional manner we can as we go along and making it up you just heard it being made up in front of your ears go on with your man all right onward and upward through new [music] finland this is st john's harbor and incidentally it's st john's harbor on a sunny day which is one of three since 1497 this is one of the most spectacular views that we've ever had here new finland is not number one in the priority consciousness of the rest of the world and to explain its singularity you have to explain the communities new finland is a province of outports and outport is a key semantic term in the understanding of new finland the outports were where the culture started the outports were where the fishery was we're also standing on signal hill and signal hill happened to be the site of the first wireless communication between the continent of europe and the continent of north america and when the airplane industry finally got really going in the 30s gander was also a communications point all the airlines of the world had to stop somewhere before if they left europe or asia gander was the spot so in many ways new finland is at the kind of transaction point either between modernity even though we're probably the oldest and in a sense most conservative society in north america nonetheless had pioneer moments that were in contrast but and associated deeply with communication and that's interestingly associated too with the fact that new finlanders as a culture are masters of word and wit i remember being down on a warf in new finland and it was it by the way was a day like this i looked this is a beautiful beautiful day and three or four fishermen were next to oh yeah we're going to pay for this they're not going to accept good fortune is there's always going to be attacks of pain or humiliation that follows all right and where are we off to next i think we'll go down to the southern shore all right we may never return all right thank you very much sir [music] okaying here [music] i'm here in the newland town of bay bulls speaking with captain joe o'brian and i was just out for two hours on captain joe's boat so why don't we start with story about how this enterprise came to be i would say so myself and my brother were fishingman with our father we saw the fishing wasn't looking so good and we were spending more money on bait and hooks and fuel than we were in having value for our fish for our catch we started helping the university do a little bit of research on seabirds and they said you should start taking people to see seabirds and we took some people out and we charged them some money and then it just snowballed from that huh the people that you hire and work with they seem pretty damn happy to be working for you so what are you doing right do you think handling people is a very serious business today and accountability and human resources is a very difficult thing so if you're an owner and you're sitting there and you're nitpicking and people are telling you this and that and they're getting on with silly talk you become bogged down right right so so if you give people autonomy you have freedom you have freedom to do what you do well and that's to take care of people great to meet you man thanks again that was a great day
