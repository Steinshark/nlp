[music] today's video is going to be a combination of a few things i'm going to show you how to make looping gifs in blender or looping animations and to demonstrate it i'm going to show off the scene i made for the robot render challenge in discord last month let's go oh it's the wrong monitor we're back so this is the final result of my render for the render challenge and if i show this in discord you can see that it actually loops for some reason it's tiny can i zoom in yes it's quite low quality because of the compression of the gif but there you go so it started off like this i just did a single frame and then i thought this would be quite a cool thing to turn into a gif and then i thought why not make it loop and that's kind of how i ended up in this situation as you can probably see at the end of the live stream it looked like this so it came quite a long way i've basically changed the texturing on the whole thing because i thought this wasn't particularly good i always struggle a bit when i'm live to actually like troubleshoot and think of things on the spot because i can feel that there's lots of people watching me which is always a bit strange so i knew i wasn't super happy with this while i was doing it but i also couldn't really think of what to do to make it better so once i ended the live stream i kind of went away and improved it a lot which is kind of how it ends up here let me open the scene so this is the final render scene as you can see i used a load of the assets that i made in my video about making environments so a load of industrial assets like this air compressor and this is an air conditioning unit i got these like metal boxes on the wall this sign i made a lot of lamps and stuff and metal girders this is really good because i could just chuck it into the scene really quickly and build something with quite a lot of detail without having to model all of this stuff and i started using the asset manager on this project for the first time which i haven't really done before so if i go oh it's not set up oh no that's embarrassing it's kind of using a new version of blender file pass oh it is set up and why is it not working okay i guess the asset manager is broken in this version of blender experimental interface cool well that's really helpful what well i guess that's that then fantastic extended browser just to turn that on oh there we go okay jesus christ the settings change so often when you download the daily builds okay so yeah like i was saying before i was rudely interrupted by the blended development oh now my wacom's not work god's sake this is probably the worst video i've ever recorded god knows what this is gonna be like to edit come on wacom okay it's working right we're back since i made that video i've made even more assets like shipping containers and stuff and all of this stuff is gonna be on my patreon by the time this goes up so if anyone wants to grab it you can grab it from there but the beauty of making all this stuff as assets is that i can literally just go okay i want this in the shot and i can drag and drop it in probably not put a cliff in a robot scene but you know what i mean so there's just all these machinery parts and i can go in and say i think this would look cool on the desk and then i can put it in there and drag it in it's really quick way to work so at the end of the live livestream i had the robot and once i done the re-texturing i just opened up my asset browser and dragged a load of stuff in that i thought would work and then literally in about 10 minutes i had a pretty much full-on scene so it was really really easy to build this very quickly this is what it all looks like with the materials once it finishes loading the shaders so yeah this is what it all looks like so i've got some nice sort of grungy metal materials on here got the metal wall and then these are lights that i set up and this is what it looks like in rendered mode i've got optics on which is really good for viewing stuff in real time which really helps with the new addition of the 3090. it's super fast so the static render was something like this frame here where it's just using the blowtorch on whatever he's holding and i thought it'd be kind of cool to have him like use the blowtorch on it have some sparks shooting out which would be quite visually interesting and have the light playing off of him from the blowtorch and then basically he throws it away reaches down to the desk and then it starts again so the looping point is basically he picks up the thing throws it away and then here it starts again the next frame basically becomes the first frame and the trick behind this is in the rigging and the animation and it's a really simple trick so basically all you have to do is make sure that the first frame of the animation is also pretty much the last frame so when it gets to the end it's also kind of back in the starting position the way i did it for this is i took all of the keyframes on the robot i selected all the keyframes on the first frame i pressed shift d and i duplicated them and moved them over here to the end and what you actually want to do is have it one frame after the last frame of your animation to make the loop seamless the reason you don't want to do it on the last frame of the animation is because otherwise you'll have two frames that are the same when it starts again so the last frame is literally before it gets to its reset pose which is here and then when it starts again it goes to the next frame which is here but it's also here because these two frames have the same keyframes hopefully that makes sense a bit of a long-winded way of explaining it so then basically when you play it on the run it goes all the way through the animation gets to the second last frame and then just starts again and then from there the trick is really just making it exciting so i made the blowtorch out of a cylinder that i just scaled down at the ends to make it kind of that blow torchy shape i keyframed it to scale down into the blowtorch gun so that it starts off off and then it starts here this mesh is an emission material so it's really really bright and so without this this is basically what's doing all of the lighting in the scene apart from the edge lights so if i unhide this you can see it lights him up completely from the front which looks really cool and it keyframes to turn off and stuff here and then it turns off again at the end of the shot box are very simple particle stimulation it's just made from this icosphere here the icosphere is parented to the hand here so it moves wherever the hand moves and then i just have a particle system on this that has some velocity in the z-axis so i set it to five which means it will basically shoot out this way mostly and i use the spark shader that i've talked about in a few different videos now it's just this it's a particle info node and then you use the age and the lifetime into a math node and set it to divide basically this means as they get older they will get darker and then you can use a color amp to pick and choose the colors you want the sparks to be so it starts off white and then as they get a bit older they go to an orange and then slightly darker red color eventually this is running into an emission shader which makes them cast light on the scene i set the lifetime of the particles to be 26 frames which just means over the course of about a second they go from being really bright to pretty much disappearing off-screen and getting darker and between the sparks and the blowtorch that's pretty much all of the interactive lighting going on in the scene then like i said i set up the emission planes here just to add some edge lighting onto the robot so this is with the lighting i set up if i hide them it looks like this so these lights up here aren't actually doing anything but i wanted their lighting to feel like it was motivated and actually doing something on the robot so i just created these emission planes here and they're set to not render in the camera but they're casting light on the scene and so that edge light makes it feel like it's coming from these lights up here which works quite nicely this whole project file with the animation and all the assets and stuff is available on patreon if anyone's interested and then once that's done i basically went into nuke and just added some glows and flares and stuff onto it to make it a bit more exciting and that looks something like this so to start off with i just have the render straight out of blender if i use a layer contact sheet you can see all of the channels i rendered i specifically made the emission path so that i can do some stuff with the glows from the blowtorch and the sparks and the eyes and the lights up here and i also rendered a utility pass which has the cryptomats in it so i could use the krypto maps to isolate a few things in the shot like the eyes and the sign in the back and the mask on the face so starts off with the raw render then i graded down the eyes a little bit it looked really subtle here but a bit later down when i had the glow they were going a bit nuts so i just made them a bit darker then i graded down the sign in the background just so i didn't draw too much attention to itself that's pretty subtle i also graded down the mask slightly and took out the saturation just because it was a bit of an intense blue in the render then i separated out the emission pass and i isolated the different parts of the emission so here we have the blow torch then we have the eyes and the lights in the background and down here i think is the sparks and i put some different levels of glow on all of these then we have the bloom from the lights up here this is really subtle but it just makes them bloom outwards a little bit which looks quite nice and then i also blurred this quite a bit and then plus that back on top as well so as well as this kind of glow i made a much softer one and that looks like this so before and after just kind of makes it feel like there's a bit of atmosphere in the space which is quite nice and then there's a glow on the sparks this is quite subtle as well doesn't really do much especially as they get darker so that's what that looks like then i did something kind of fun with volume raising nuke so i took the pass of the eyes and then i did a bit of color correction to it and then this is a bit of a hacky way of doing this but i brought in a cube that's parented to the head of the robot from blender that's animated i ran this through a scanline render in nuke so that i have an alpha for it and then all i did is add a 2d tracker onto the alpha and i tracked its location so basically i now have a tracker for kind of up here above the robot's head and i use this as a position to fire volumetric rays through like this so basically i have this point up here which is the tracker it's firing through the eyes and creating this cool effect that moves with the eyes then this goes on top as well this is really subtle and in fact in the end comp you can hardly see it probably more obvious on a frame like this it just adds some kind of like subtle beams coming out of the eyes which looks quite nice and then the last thing i did is add a kind of streaky horizontal flare coming from the blowtorch i talked about this setup in a video before as well it's basically taking the highlights i eroded them down slightly to make the flare a bit thinner and then it just blurs them at loads of different increments like this and then pluses them together which gives you this kind of look and then i just made it a bit blue and put that on top of the footage and it looks like this so there we go that's how i made that robot scene i think it turned out really cool and i was really happy with it and i think a lot of people in discord thought it was cool as well like i said the model of the robot and the animation scene and all the assets that i made in this are available on my patreon if you're interested and hopefully that answers the question for the people that were asking how to make it into a looping animation in discord as well if you made it this far into the video you're probably someone that watches quite regularly and i have a bit of an announcement i'm going to be away for a few weeks or away from the youtube channel i've got a freelance project going on in my spare time that's going to be quite busy so i think until the end of september i'm going to have my hands full so there might be a bit of a gap in videos not sure what's going to happen i might get some stuff up but i'm not going to pressure myself into uploading so i'm going to be very busy so if you don't see me for a few weeks that's probably where i'm going to be but i'll be back in october and things will go back to normal something to look forward to though i've rendered all the shots for the treasure planet video now so once i get a few days to sit down a weekend after this freelance project finishes i will composite all of them and it will look amazing thank you for watching take care everyone and i'll see you very live like soon no more trouble comes when the bar made pours another four mana should have found the door when i get going you can hear me roar and the lord can't live like this
