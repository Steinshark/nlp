hi lopez the king of you know the thing knowledge the man with all the lambos fun to drive up here in the hollywood hills well now he's out of those hollywood hills and into crypto he just launched a coin and i dug into his project early and oh boy it's rough i would stay away from this thing with a six foot pole like you're trying to social distance from the new transformers movie but not because i think tai lopez is a marketing grifter who will do anything for money no no the real reason is that his idea is a derivative clone that reheats other people's innovations to benefit no one but himself which makes it a little bit like his self-help it all starts with this this is what we're talking about first today radio shack radio shack is bringing cryptocurrency to the mainstream with defy now if you haven't heard of radio shack in seven years that's because they've almost completely collapsed after failing to adjust to the rise of the internet and that was sad for many people because they were nostalgic memory from the 90s it's even sadder because they were bought out by these two tai lopez and his buddy alex mayer and given that most people associate tai lopez with get rich quick advertisements seen at 3am on a youtube rabbit hall many people struggled to see the connection between an actual business and thai but that struggle is now over since they launched their new coin and here's their pitch radio shack is a 100 year old brand embedded in the global consciousness and we're going to lead the way for blockchain tech to reach mainstream adoption by other large brands now this is quite interesting the brand that is going to lead us into the future is the one that died because it failed to grasp it the first time now how are they going to do that well they say this how will we make this bridge radio shack d5 will start with a swap we believe that this is the lowest hanging fruit that is full of opportunities our symbiosis with atlas usv will allow us to offer the most efficient and competitive swap on the market now i know what you're thinking what the hell is atlas usb and we'll get to that in a moment but it's important to recognize all the powerful connections that radio shack has to offer to make radio shack crypto a big success according to them they're partnered with rev pier one dress barn and steinmart which if you haven't paid attention recently all are basically failing businesses that have nothing to do with crypto but what they all have in common is actually that they're all owned and bought by tai and alex they bought them at low prices hoping to revitalize them so in essence these guys are starting a crypto company partnered with themselves and a bunch of businesses that failed to adjust to the modern age irony ladies and gentlemen is officially dead unless you can explain to me how dress barn is going to make you succeed with crypto i'm not exactly seeing how these connect here but now let's move on to this atlas usv thing the symbiosis they talked about usv is an acronym for universal store of value and it's another crypto token that is created by drumroll please ty lopez and his buddy alex mayer which basically means that tai lopez is teaming up with tai lopez backed by tai lopez and i'm sure funded by tai lopez now it calls itself a community driven project despite basically being launched by just two guys but even though that makes about as much sense as saying radio shack is going to bring us into the future i think at least they're still being consistent with about as accurate as these claims are but you know it really gets amazing when you start looking at their white paper this could have been an anonymous project and i would have instantly known that it had knowledge inside of it why well because of the quotes bear in mind you have to understand most white papers or technical documents describe what they do what these tokens do like in math terms right it's mostly just numbers and economics this has very little of that very little math and it makes up for that in famous people quotes from books tai has read now there's no way to convey this to you without actually just telling you about all the stuff he jam-packed into this white paper so i'm just gonna go through all of them with you first he quoted renowned evolutionary psychologist dr david buss he then quoted mathematician john forbes nash then they talked about the aristotelian mean they then quoted charlie mungers saying beware of perverse incentives they then go through robert trevor's evolutionary theory on reciprocal altruism they then talk about charles darwin saying the sight of the peacock gives me nightmares which i can certainly see how that's relevant to crypto then they say as freud wrote suffering comes from three quarters they then say like the aesop fables all find themselves to be both the lion and the mouse by the way we're still talking about a crypto coin here then they talk about adam smith they then quote the bible only to follow it up with richard dawkins they quote warren buffett and then they quote charles mckay to top it all off now look it's awesome that you know who these guys are it's great it's great that you've read books but unfortunately reading a bunch of books and knowing a bunch of quotes is kind of irrelevant to a technical paper about a token to just fill it with so many quotes about charles darwin and the peacock i mean quite frankly i failed to see the connection but am i saying that they just filled this thing with a lot of quotes to avoid having to do actual math no of course not don't be so cynical what i am saying though is that i agree with token sniffer which is an automated audit and they said that this thing gets about a 20 out of 100 on their what they call a smell test and according to them there is a high risk of this type of token being a scam now or in the future but i also think it's pretty funny that after all this talk about their theories nash equilibriums and charles darwinian ideas about what makes the ideal token the contract for this token is actually completely similar to a bunch of other projects take for instance this coin right here which was done 21 days before their coin the difference between these two contracts is literally three lines of code most of which are just changing the name on the contract that's right guys this idea isn't new at all it's been done by tons of projects before and repackaged with a lot of fancy language to make it look like it's just tai lopez's idea and maybe he can get the money this time in fact it's so similar to so many other coins that i'm starting to think that the real quote tai lopez has learned from is actually from pablo picasso good artist
