- we are doing a lamborghini race. and whichever one of you
wins, keeps the lamborghini. - wow! - they must drive to a challenge. and after they complete that,
they'll get an envelope, which will tell them where
the next challenge is. start your cars. this is gonna sound amazing. (car engines rev) ooh, this is envelope number one, which will lead them to
their first challenge. throw an ax at a target
until you get a bullseye. - i have terrible hand-eye
coordination, dang it! - three, two, one, go! what? that sounds so cool. - on the road. - oh, crap! - if they speed just one
mile over the speed limit, they're disqualified, don't speed, kids. - like a caged animal, can't
let loose in this lambo. - i literally have not stopped smiling. the hardest part of this
video is gonna be not speeding because i am in a supercar. - chandler's going 35 in a
45, safety first. (laughs) - this guy's like, what? i'm gonna go say hi to chris. hey chris, how's it going? - i hate red lights.
- it's a red light. - it's about to turn
green, i'll see you later. all right, we gonna park here. go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go. - chandler's here, and
chris is running inside. - [chandler] let's go, open
the door, ah, my lapel. - [jimmy] the first challenge
is you have to hit a bullseye. no, behind the line.
- oh. - we're doing great! that board's bad vibes. what, got it!
- oh, chris got it! just to confirm, it hit it. chris hit the bullseye. and now he's gonna open
his second envelope and go to the second challenge. - "go to sup dogs, catch a
chicken tender in your mouth." let's go! - that's technically it.
- yeah, that's it. if you look right there, it is in. - that's in, that's in, that's in! - i'm taking it, envelope in the car! - "go to sup dogs and catch a
chicken tender in your mouth." i love eating, this is great news. - bye chandler. all three of them have
completed the first challenge. onto the next one. - chandler is really good at catching food in his mouth, though. that's the only thing that worries me. i almost threw up, 'cause i
really want this lamborghini. come on, man. go, i got somewhere to be, bro, come on! - i love chicken tenders. i'll put my life on the line
for this chicken tender. - my heart's beating so fast,
this got serious real quick! - there's no way from this height. ah! (gentle music) - okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. move, boys! - all right, wait, wait, wait. gentleman's agreement,
we all go one at a time. - oh, oh!
(mary lisa screams) all right, mary lisa is now in the lead. - oh, it hit me in my mouth. - i got it!
- go, go, go! - [jimmy] you're now in
last, oh, there we go. - "go to ec rec center
and climb the rock wall." - mary lisa is right there, heading out. chandler's over there,
he's currently leaving. chris is here reading his next challenge. we're gonna go to the next place. - last night, i literally could not sleep because i was so excited, i
just want this car so bad. - [cameraman] what kind
of car do you have now? - a jeep. - [cameraman] so if you win, the lamborghini's gonna
be better than your jeep? - duh, what? we're in the lead, i don't know. all right, go! - is this a good spot? - [karl] it's fine for now. - we gotta go. everywhere's a parking spot
when you're driving a lambo! - [karl] oh my god, they're right there. - oh, is this it? ready. let's go, i'm ready. yeah, he's not ready,
don't worry about him. - [cameraman] chandler. - follow the instructions, would help me. heavens knows this is
a self-serve community. - mary lisa still isn't here yet? chris is gonna win. climb, chris. - [chris] where do i put my feet? - all right, chris.
- ding-a-ling! (chandler groans) - [man] he's thick, boy! (bell dings) - thank you. - okay, how far are they? i'm coming! wait, wait, i'm gonna
figure this out real quick. ah! (bell dings) next one, next one, next one. come on, let's go. - "make a basketball shot with a basket." (buzzer buzzes) hey! hey, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! - are you kidding me? - chris is currently
slightly ahead of chandler- oh chandler, go. mary lisa, the baskets are back there. - there you go.
- there you go. good job, good job. - dude, i left the lambo unlocked. "last but not least, here's a swimsuit. "do five laps in the pool." where's the swimsuit? - "here's a swimsuit. "do five laps in the pool down and back." we getting it done.
- also- - "do five laps in the
pool down and back." this is my training for my triathlon. - my butt cheeks are showing. - [jimmy] oh, hi mary. - [chandler] come on, come on. - these are a lot more physical than i thought they would be. - [cameraman] they're
back in the lead now, man. we gotta go, we gotta go. - [jimmy] you just survived
another wave of challenges. how do you feel?
- tired. - i didn't know i was signing
up for the 2020 olympics. - "score a soccer goal." where's that? - that's mary lisa, she's
in first, second or third. i'm not quite sure anymore. this is one of those competitions that you don't know who
wins until it's over. anyone at any point
could take over the lead. no one trains to make
a basket into a basket. you know what i'm saying? - i'm not gonna lie. the swimming challenge
for me was really hard. i just don't have good lung capacity. - dude, my heart's beating
a thousand miles an hour. - we're in lamborghinis, racing
and revving across the city. who's doing it like this? - hello, oh, you fancy, huh? - what's up? - [cameraman] ours sounds better. - oh, does it? i can't hear it, what? (car engine revs) - i'm gonna do some valet parking so i can skirt-skirt on outta here. - mary's the first, i don't
even see the other guys. - one! - wait.
- is it just one? - yeah, it's just one.
- yeah. - oh, really? - yeah, that's for chandler and chris, you know, the other people competing? - oh wait, what are their names again? - chris is gonna be the
one to try to show off. he's gonna try to kick
it from very far away. and he's gonna miss. (buzzer buzzes) - [karl] go, go, go! - does that count? there you go! - "here's a script. "read every word shrek
said in the "shrek" movie." - every word? - are you kidding me? - what are you doing in
my swamp? (indistinct) - this is the part where you run away. - donkey, okay, look, i'm
sorry, all right, i'm sorry. - holds up mug of beer, can we just settle over this? - oh yes, that'll do it, no,
that's donkey, that'll do it. - i'm only supposed to read shrek? they all say shrek. - fiona, are you all right? all right, that's it. - you know, grab your- - should probably go check on chandler. - "make a cornhole with corn." - chandler, you're already done? chris, read faster! - last page, ah! stubborn donkey! - am i not supposed to be doing this? how's everybody done? i don't get it. - "make a cornhole shot with corn." - [jimmy] more corn. (buzzer buzzes) - yeah, get in there, let's go! i'm in the lead, baby!
- let's go. - aim's right, dang it. - oh, i got a cramp! - but you are beautiful. all right. "make a cornhole shot with corn." make a cornhole shot with corn. huh? go, go, go, go! there's no way he read that script. there's literally zero away. - i know you're having a very
intense moment right now. but i just wanna remind you that a lamborghini's on the line. - okay.
there we are. how's it going? chandler's in the lead, you're
in second, mary's in third. we're gonna investigate
his "shrek" footage. we just wrapped up the
challenges at the soccer field. and now we're going to the mall. but when chandler was
reading the shrek script, he read it oddly fast. he was done way before
mary lisa and chris. it didn't even make sense. - chandler's a good guy. and i don't wanna say
he cheated or anything, but an entire movie script in two minutes? there's just no way. - can you ask chandler when he was fighting with
mary lisa for the script, did they rip it in half or something? he read that "shrek" script way too quick. that thing was like 50 pages. - [chandler] i only had four. - i knew it, okay, that's what happened. chandler, since technically you cheated, it wasn't on purpose, you're gonna have to
wait for five minutes. wherever you are, stand
there for five minutes. - "find waldo, and we'll
have your next envelope." - [jimmy] chandler's
script was way shorter. so we got a five minute
punishment, just so you know. - really? i knew it!
- yeah. so you're about to pass him. - when the timer's done, you
better be ready to run, okay? - am i allowed to ask people for help? is there a waldo in there? do y'all see a waldo? a person dressed as waldo, no? clue, clue, clue, clue, dang it. - [jimmy] chandler only had four pages on his "shrek"
script, so he has a punishment. he has to sit still for five minutes. - dang! - [jimmy] so you're
actually gonna pass him now. - where is it?
- i don't know. - i don't know. you've seen anybody that looks like waldo? - dude, it's not a store.
- okay. - it's a person.
- oh, it's a person? if you see anybody with a camera, stop 'em and take pictures,
everyone, not me, though. - [jimmy] chandler, how
much longer do you have? - five seconds.
- go. - [jimmy] did you find him? - anybody seen waldo? - [jimmy] is he just asking
random people if they've seen- - [chandler] seen waldo? - guy in the green shirt's famous. everybody take pictures with him. - if he can't go in stores,
i've been everywhere. - did y'all find him? ah, waldo, oh my god! - here, a present for you. a present for you, yes.
- give me present. - find someone in the parking lot, and do a photo shoot with
them in front of your lambo. - here you go. - number three. - would y'all wanna take
a photo shoot with me, in front of a lamborghini? okay, y'all are amazing, never change. - [chris] here, you get in, get in the seat, get in the seat. - yeah, this way is small. - all right, we're good.
- here we go. thank you for helping me. - thank you.
- you have a great day. and what's the next one? - you wanna take a
couple pictures, please, in front of the lamborghini? - [cameraman] one, two, three. - "buy flowers, give them to a stranger." let's go buy some flowers. - next, all three of them
have to go buy flowers and give 'em to a stranger. then after that, they have
to do my grocery shopping. - all right, we're doing great so far. we're headed to harris
teeter to buy some flowers. - [mary lisa] hey, i bought these for you. - really?
- yeah! - thank you!
- you're welcome. - give these to the wife. - oh, thank you.
- thank you. - would you like these flowers? - sure. - here go, have a good day.
- thanks. - let's go. "buy jimmy groceries." i gotta go back in there? - "buy jimmy groceries" okay. - all right, we're going back in. i just need a really good fresh
steak, can i just take one? - yeah.
- all right. appreciate it, man. got jimmy a steak. - thank you.
- go, go, go. - we got steak, where are cheese balls? oh, what the heck? - do they even have
those at harris teeter? where are they at? harris teeter doesn't carry
utz cheese balls, you liar. - then go somewhere and get 'em, man. we need cheese balls. - [chris] do you know where
to get utz cheese balls? - check walgreens.
- all right. - go to walmart.
- yep. - all right.
- thank you. - thank you. - now we to go all the way to walmart, which is 15 minutes away,
time is of the essence. - some random guy in
the parking lot told me this walgreens has 'em. these aren't utz, but they're smile. - do these count?
- yes. - all right, we got 'em. - i'm just gonna park
up front, park, get out. cheese balls, cheese balls. cheese balls. cheese balls. - yes, boys! - go to the production studio and complete a mini lambo obstacle course. let's go. (upbeat music) i will be upset if i
don't win the lamborghini, but it was the most fun i've ever had. so thank you for that experience,
jimmy, really awesome. go, is anybody else here? all right, where do i put the groceries? - cheese balls.
- wait. - steak.
- ow. - toothpaste. - you got your groceries.
- i got 'em. - what's my obstacle course? - [participant] you got bananas, you got cones, don't hit that. and we're gonna throw dodge balls at you. - [chris] not hard, please, not hard. - [jimmy] three laps, chris. - ow, my kidney! please, i need them. i've had like eight kidney stones. they're barely holding on,
is this my second or third? - yeah, this is the last one. - [chris] skirt, oh, god! - your groceries, here you go. and i got you some
cheez-its, i don't know. - your next one's through this
lamborghini track, do that. - lamborghini track. fast and furious. oh god, this is mario kart, ah! - three laps.
- the finish line! - do i get out?
- three laps, three laps. - three laps! - oh, i walked right by
them, you kidding me? "buy jimmy teeth whitening toothpaste." i literally just bought something. - with a fence outside, which way outside? - "there's a fence outside
with a bunch of locks on it. "find the lock that fits your key." - oh gosh! all right, so it's a brinks, find a... oh crap. oh, this is a big boy. oh yes, yes, yes. - oh my god, this is a joke. i gotta try all these diligently, because if i don't and i miss it, that would be absolutely terrible. got it! - is this teeth whitening? - [cameraman] it's hard to tell, but you think we're in the lead? - it depends if chris got those cheese balls from walgreens or not. - "make chris sad, break a two
by four with a baby's head." no way. yes way. - i have to break it with a baby's head? (explosion booms) - oh, that was a lot easier than... "you're almost done,
putt-putt a hole-in-one." - putt-putt, putt-putt, putt-putt! all right, let's go, let's go, let's go. - jimmy's calling me, hello? - what happened?
- what do you mean? - both of them have
already left the studio? - what? - where are you? - i'm literally pulling up
to the studio right now. the disappointment on my face right now. the cheese puffs, man. - [jimmy] they already
did all seven challenges. - seven?
- yeah. and they left for putt-putt
like seven minutes ago. - dude, my heart is broken. if you ever ask me for cheese puffs again. - it's over.
- i'm sorry. it's supposed to be yours. - supposed to be mine,
it should have been mine. it is mine, i already named it! - [chris] what's the trick
here, what's the trick here? oh! - i just don't want chris to win, but i do find satisfaction
that i'm in front of chandler. let's go, let's go, let's go. - is that the one? yes, let's go, let's go, let's go! "this is it, your last challenge "kick a field goal, once you
make it, the lambo's yours." oh my god, i have to kick a field goal? - oh! come on baby, come on, come on. yes! "kick a field goal, once you
make it, the lambo is yours." easy peasy lemon squeezy. (upbeat music) - [jimmy] there was
plenty of time for that. you have to kick a field goal and you win. (intense music) - [chris] ow! ow. - yeah, boy! - i don't know how to kick a football! no, gimme another, gimme, gimme, gimme! - ah! all right. - oh!
- oh! - yes!
- no! - he got it!

- i did not win the lambo. thanks for reminding me. - i know i feel like i could
cry, but i'm not going to, 'cause everybody's gonna make fun of me. this is my dream come
true, like, i'm so excited. - [chris' mom] you won that car, buddy? - yeah, i won a $90,000 lamborghini. - chris, don't look now,
but the lambo just got here. - oh, my lambo's here, i
gotta go, i love you guys. - don't look, don't look, don't look. - if you turn around, chris, you will see the car
