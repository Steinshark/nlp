[music] the amish simple people work in the land a way of life that eshoes the vain luxuries of modern technology or does it we tend to think of the amish and mennonites as if they haven't changed at all in the past centuries but the reality is a lot more complicated the amish don't advocate the refusal of all technology more so amish culture generally supports a mindful approach of gradual adoption based on principles of simplicity and practicality this means that a huge loophole exists for technologies that are primarily work related each community votes on its own rules which can vary a lot from group to group but in some cases they're allowed to use computers and even cell phones so long as they are kept outside the home and are never flaunted a small number of amish began adopting computers soon after they first became available to the mass consumer market in the mid 1970s a particular favorite was the word processor then a type of hardware rather than software these were essentially electric typewriters and are hard to view as decadent or frivolous but as personal computers became more powerful do it all machines and began to incorporate elements for personal entertainment like music and games standalone office devices like the word processor plummeted in popularity by the late 1990s most computer companies no longer manufacture them leaving the amish without options enter alan hoover an old order horse and buggy mennonite who worked with computer scientists and amish leaders to build a computer that suited the needs of amish farms and businesses but what does an amish computer even look like before we get into that we turn to our high tech sponsor brilliant brilliant is a hands-on and interactive way to learn stem topics they offer thousands of courses with new topics to learn every month like their everyday math course their services can be used as supplement to college education or just increase your depth of knowledge the first 200 people who head to brilliant.org techwiki will get 20 off an annual premium subscription the first computer made specifically for the plane people by the plain people was the 2005 classic word processor an ad for which promised no modem no phone port or internet connection no outside programs no sound no pictures no games no gimmicks not even solitaire that's sinister's succubus of workday distraction a big focus is on what features the classic didn't have but it did have a built-in keyboard and fold down 8-inch full color screen as well as usb ports for file sharing and optional peripherals like a printer or a mouse the amish typically avoid connecting to the power grid instead relying on pneumatic tools or locally generated power via diesel generators water wheels or solar panels so the classic uses a battery rather than a wall plug in order to remove as many connective features as possible hoover pre-loaded the computer with open source programs and then locked it from any further installation among its features the classic proudly counts its complete incompatibility with all microsoft computer programs that's right the amish have computers and they're using linux all this for the low low cost of 798 dollars a fairly standard price for a low end computer of the era albeit one that functions roughly like a pc from five years prior according to hoover turns out that some customers are willing to pay a premium for a computer that doesn't come packed with a bunch of nonsense features they don't want and the sinful touch of bill gates further these devices were incredibly durable and secure you might not be able to run doom on it but you won't have to replace it in four years either an ad for an updated version of the classic lists a 12-inch display dual core three gigahertz processor 4 gigabytes of ram and a 500 gigabyte hard drive in 2014. by then the classic had several competitors including the guardian the pioneer the pleasant and the plain book a laptop with no video sound internet or games but it does have a typing tutor quickbooks microsoft office full fax functionality a pdf reader and a bible reader and search program these plane computer aren't competing primarily based on power performance they're competing based on functionality reliability and compliance with the guidance of amish bishops the key word here is trustworthiness a modern version of the classic currently advertised by the plain communities business exchange is the classic steward word processor which comes with a linux based operating system eight gigabytes of ram 120 gigabytes solid-state drive a 4.1 gigahertz processor and a copy of libra office from 2017. perfect for inventorying your chickens as most businesses have become increasingly online amish business owners have had to follow suit adopting the internet in small measured ways some use a pc free email service that allows them to receive emails in the form of a printout on their fax machine and when they want to answer an email they just faxed right back a similar service even allows amish to send faxes to request a basic internet search one sec i gotta send out a fax for hot singles in my area incidentally you can't buy the classic or most other playing computers on the internet you have to call a dealer sorry amazon so thanks for watching guys if you
