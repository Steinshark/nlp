so hello everybody i am back here with richard rowland everybody has been really excited about our last discussion on ethiopia yeah i've been surprised to see how fast it's been growing on the channel it seems like it's such a it's kind of an obscure subject but it actually seems to be touching on a lot of aspects of this re-enchantment and mystery you know and and a different way of seeing peoples of the world which i find very exciting and so i'm really looking forward to seeing what richard has in store for us and i have a few things in my up my sleeve as well i just have to say i've got more i mean i don't do nearly as much stuff on the internet as you do but i've gotten more positive feedback on that ethiopia video than i've ever gotten on i think anything i've ever done i've gotten emails from people who are like oh let me put you in touch with this person you guys should have a conversation but i've also gotten like you know just like a bunch of shout outs from like random rasta guys and and yeah so it's been it's been you know a lot of a lot of love from some of my my my ethiopian and eritrean friends over the video so i'm really really pleased about that like i said i i told you this a minute ago but like i was pretty sure this is the video that was going to get me canceled so i've been been really encouraged to see so much support for it so yeah but i think i think it was transparent for a lot of people to see just the enthusiasm we have about ethiopian culture and you know also this kind of surprise that we have that nobody knows about it and this desire to help people see the the kind of pearl that's hidden there in northern africa for most of us you know we don't we don't right a lot of people don't know about it but it definitely is a pearl well so this this actually i mean this will be a good segue into kind of everything we're talking about today okay because i i've watched a couple of response videos you probably have as well to the universal history series that people have made on youtube and one of the really interesting criticisms about about it was let's say twofold first of all that oh well this idea of like a medieval european universal history it doesn't have room for the chinese it doesn't have room for africans it doesn't have room for you know this whatever group that you want to pick that that you sort of like see as being sort of outside the traditional european christian story so one of the things that that hopefully this ethiopia video helps helps people sort of get is that the the story of christ and and really here you know i'm talking specifically traditional christianity really is all-encompassing it does have room to integrate all of these things but it's also it's a it's a story that hasn't ended right and so this is the other i somebody somebody made the remark you know i think this is when we were talking in the our second video that we did together about christ and antichrist you know talking about liturgy and you know this idea that the liturgy is sort of like interrupted and constantinople and that one days can be finished and things like this and somebody said well you know if if if liturgy was going to save us it would have already worked like it would have already saved us and i was just i kind of squinted a little bit at my computer screen and i was like you know that's like saying well if jesus was going to save us he already would have like why are there bad things in the world no why do bad things happen like this is it's kind of a silly it's kind of a silly argument but but here's the here's the thing that i want to i'm going to kind of point to and sort of show today is that the story's not over right and this is i think this would be true for both of us is that we really we still see ourselves as part of this story it's a story that's that's ongoing and that in some way you know they're one one of the the key parts of post-modernism which i think was actually really useful was this ability to conceive of oneself as being part of a narrative yeah there's the even that even tolkien is engaging with us when he says in you know the lord of the rings there's that moment at the at the the stare of kirit ongold when when sam is looking up at the sky and he sees the star arendo which is connected to the light and the silmarils and the the the file of light that that frodo's carrying with him right now and he starts to realize hey all these things are actually connected there's a larger pattern here that we're actually manifesting and he says you know we're in the same story after all right and so i think maybe one of the more helpful things that postmoderate is post-modernism has done is it's given us a way to kind of recapture the ability to conceive of ourselves as being part of this larger narrative which which is exactly what universal history is this is the way that in the middle ages they saw themselves as being part of this larger narrative and it's important it's really important to point out to people that when we say universal history we don't mean it at all in a kind of enlightenment scientific vision of kind of pulling yourselves out of the world and now looking at all of history as one big thing no it's a it's universe it's it's a universal history but it's a universal history that's embodied and lived in the particular histories and so it's normal that you will also see let's say fractally you'll see those histories that are further away from you as being further away from you and so there's a letter there's less room in the universal history for the chinese although there is and we will get to it at some point especially when we talk about mongols and stuff and we get to that kind of stuff we'll talk about that but there is less room in the sense that it's just further away and so this is also it's important to understand that that's how it works it works as this idea of these centers that have their perspective but these perspectives also fit together in a in a kind of puzzle but it's not a it's not a it's not a god's eye view puzzle but it's an embodied puzzle that you encounter from the piece that you are in that puzzle let's say it that way right every society when it encounters christianity for the first time is on the margin just sort of by default right but then but then of course you know as as it expands right these things sort of change and they shift a little bit and it takes a you know it's a this is not a it's not a rigorously you know i a lot of times when we're especially let's say dudes of a certain age who are like you know trying to trying to grapple with their world what they really want is this this hyper rigorous internal system where everything has a one-to-one mapping and things like that and it's it's a little more of an art than that yeah and this this actually kind of ties into this is not a question i want to answer today though i think there is an answer but the question that i've been asked the most since we started doing the series and this is it's the most american question to possibly ask is well where does america fit into this story you know that's what this is what we're really concerned about is like okay but but where do i fit in and that's this is nothing i mean in a certain sense there's nothing wrong with that but we are of course you know we are a little self-involved a little self-interested here in in america but and so this is actually something i've been pondering a lot in the oca we had the we this last sunday was the sunday of all saints of north america and it was just a really good which actually is wonderful serendipity landed on july 4th which is independence day in the united states i don't know if you've heard of this but we we just blow stuff up for about three days straight it's it's a good time but so so i've had a but it just gave me a lot of occasion to kind of ponder you know where does america fit into this symbolic story and so i think that if people pay attention to this video these next few videos they're gonna start they'll they're they're gonna be clues and by the time we actually get to talking about america i think that it'll help make sense i really want to once we kind of finish going down this particular trail that we're on i kind of want to like shift gears a little bit and look at look at celtic christianity look at ireland and wales which are also you know out there on the edge of the world we touched on that a little bit with the arthur stuff but i think there's there's a lot more there that's gonna help us understand the symbolism of the edge actually in another way and so anyway it's just a teaser i'm really bad about these teasers but yes there's a lot to talk about there's someone to talk about what what i thought we'd do for this video is now that we've we've constantly teased it like we keep we keep referring back to this apocalypse of pseudomethodius which is in this wonderful volume by dumbarton oaks because it's and it's not the only work like this there's actually a really rich byzantine apocalyptic tradition that kind of is is in and around this builds off of it predates it etc but i like the apocalypse of pseudomythoides for a few reasons one is this just there's a really handy easily accessible english translation of the work it's easy to find people can pull it up and and read it and it's not on like a sketchy website like you know some of this old stuff is you know like i don't i don't know how like legit this is like you know i need a little more textual certainty or something like that you know but basically all of the things that we're talking about we see we find in the apocalypse of pseudo methodius in a byzantine kind of a focus so it's not a particular let's say western focus in the sense that although really the notion that greek civilization is not western is i just constantly find that ludicrous but but it's but it's not a particularly let's say a latin or western or you know like a protestant colonialist you know et cetera et cetera all these things that are that are so easily problematized right this list is kind of like cut through some of that noise and look at how does this pattern work how does this this idea of universal history work out the other thing though is that the apocalypse of pseudomothodius is aimed specifically at answering one of the main criticisms which which we've received and i've heard this from two or three different people which is well okay but constantinople fell so there your argument's invalid like obviously if if if christianity was legit if orthodoxy is legit if universal history is legit then like why did why did constantinople fall right and so so one of the things that the apocalypse of pseudomethodius is actually set to grapple with is the is the rise of islam and the arab conquest and that's actually i mean it's not a it's not an illegitimate question if you're pretty sure you're on god's side and then that doesn't end up looking like you know military might then you know it's a it's a pretty normal thing to ask as many people have over history it's a pretty normal thing to ask well why are we losing yeah and is is this thing that i'm a part of and i really actually like dr mario uh in his his video that that he did with you earlier in the series you know he talks about the fact that one of the things that byzantium is doing that constantinople is doing is it's really it's really giving its life to the church right it really gives up you know this high level of cultural development all of these things and puts them into the deep treasury of the orthodox church so that even when constantinople falls the orthodox church has continued oftentimes under like truly crushing opposition and that's not just here to you know like chill for orthodoxy obviously i'm orthodox i love it i would like everyone to be you know but the point of this is that one of the questions that has to be answered is this idea well can my faith outlast my government right that the you know like if what is it what would it mean to have a christian country that then falls to conquest from a non-christian group right and that's actually one of the questions that the studio the the the apocalypse of pseudomethodius that is it's attributed to this early church father he's like a third or fourth century church father named methodius scholars because they hate fun will say that this is probably written more like the sixth or the seventh centuries actually maybe around the same time as the iconoclast controversy in the in the east so okay all that to say from the very beginning the apocalypse sets up this tension between between the center and the edge but also it's it's a work that is deeply concerned with giants and in fact i didn't look like you paused when you said giants i didn't i didn't wanna i didn't tell you that i was gonna talk about this but one of the things that i'm really con interested in is the idea so this is what it says about the birth of seth it says in the 230th year of the first millennium that is also the first age seth was born a gigantic man in the likeness of adam in the 500th year in the same first millennium the sons of cain abused the wives of their own brothers in excessive fornications so this is this is a it's an interesting work because basically this work takes both the approach that there are fallen angels involved but also that that is sort of like line of cane line of seth like it's it's a is kind of a hybrid of those two different hypotheses but one of the really interesting things here is that seth is is seth is put out as a giant and as we keep reading we we find that there are there are actually kind of like two groups of giants two groups of you know and i think we can understand this as being like these are large these are powerful like a giant is a very the way dante uses giants in the divine comedy is to basically be like they're too fleshy they're too they've got too much body right so they're they're large they're powerful they they're in other words like they're this massive amount of potential and and what ends up happening is that seth and his children go up and living and raising the line of seth raising their family on thus the slopes of the mountain of paradise right and that kane and his people are are down in the valley and that this is this this is in the the pseudo-methodius yeah yeah this is all this is all in the apocalypse yeah yeah it's basically it's like a snapshot of this kind of cosmology i think yeah kind of said ephraim's the the the cosmology we find in cenephram's paradise yes and so what what happens then what what ends up happening is is that the these devils these fallen angels they come to the line of cain and they specifically pollute and corrupt the line of canaan by teaching them the composition of every kind of music is what it says your brother matthew in his book has some really great things to say about music and his relationship to ornamentation to variability even to things like menstruation and so so you can sort of see you've got the mountain of paradise right here you've got seth and his people living on the slopes of the mountain they're not quite in paradise but they're kind of as close as they can get and then out here on the margin that's where the light of cain is and there's there's basically ideas that what's happening in the the people of cain is that there's all kinds of mixture so there's every kind of music and this is i mean this is a real problem the ancient world is figuring out how to i mean this is one of the plato's main things that he's concerned with in in many of his writings is the idea that there's there are there's certain music that would be appropriate for a certain time and for a certain place and that there are actually some kinds of music let's say some tones some modes that plato actually believed it would be wrong to even let common people hear like you shouldn't even play those in public and of course this is one of the things that in the orthodox church especially in the byzantine tradition it gets resolved and i mean this happened in the west to up to a certain point but this gets to revolve result in the tonal system right the eight tone system in the in the east but also like in gregorian chant things like this in the west where it was basically saying okay there really does there really is like a hierarchy of music and as strange as this might sound to lots of people living in america there really is music that's okay to listen to it your house that you shouldn't play in church of course right yeah and you can understand it very simply as a hierarchy of patterns and that right and that different there are different types of patterns and those patterns have a place in the world and and that like you said like they just have their place and some of them maybe don't have their place like in in public life let's say because they can bring about no i mean you can understand it's like the music that plays in a club like a is music that plays in a club and there's a reason why the things that happen in a club happen in a club and the type of relationships and the type of kind of decadence that you see which is related to consumption to to fornication to all that there is that the music itself is is it's not just the music but the music is part of the pattern that is bringing about these kinds of things and and so if you listen to like a folk dance you can't do the same things that you would do in a club while you're listening to a folk dance there's a it just it just doesn't allow it in its pattern right right yeah so it's really what's really interesting is that it's called the camp of cane right so at this point at this point a city in this particular narrative there isn't really a sense of like a an a city so much as it is the camp and the idea is actually sort of the idea of a club floor you know it's like there's there's all kinds of music there's there's a vast amount of mixture happening out here around the in the valley you know at the sort of the foot of paradise at the mountain of paradise so we're told if you've seen the movie the second matrix movie that whole rave scene at the in the cave that's what's happening there you go yeah or the rave sort of slash well well the last last video i talked about the ten commandments yeah the wave at the bottom of the mountain right at the bottom of the mountain is actually is actually really really well done and if you just as a little side note because i love this movie a lot if you if you kind of look into like some of the making of the movie it took them two or three weeks i believe to shoot that scene and it was just incredibly grueling up on the people who who had to shoot it but anyway because there's so many people in such mayhem so many people and yeah just like very physically exhausting to shoot so we're told that they're around the base of the mountain of paradise that the in the campbell cane they're more of even more inflamed in their abominable fortification they become worse than the previous generation they mount each other in the metal manner of animals and you know there's some explicit stuff in here but it's you know it's it's you know all kinds of debauchery all kinds of fornication anything you can imagine right that's that's all happening here and and this is this is so then it says in the 700th year of the life of jared that is in the second millennium the spiteful and troublesome devil applied to himself to bring applied himself to bring the war of fornication to the sons of seth so that they should desire the daughters of cain and he pushed them on there appeared giants in the earth the sons of seth who fell into the pit of sin and became altogether dreadful so there's actually there's like this devil so you have fallen angels plus kane plus seth so it's like again it's like a hybrid it's like a kind of a hybrid approach to that whole question so they actually have the idea that fallen angels had relationships with women but then also the tradition of seth having a relationship right with with with kane yes yes and i always always thought that those two were just the same at different levels of reality i've always said that yeah i well and that's the thing like a lot of people are like oh well this church father says it was this way so you know like lord of spirits podcast is wrong or something like this but you have to realize that most people in the in the middle ages especially in the east did not see these things as mutually exclusive yeah and a way to actually understand this is like once you start you know the things that they talked about you know especially in their the land of giants episode on the lord a lord of spirits about the nephilim ritual and things like this you can understand how you could have two humans from from differing who who in this story are actually at different like ontological levels right because you have the you know the light of seth is kind of up here and then kane is down here so you can actually have two humans coupling but also there's a demon involved in that somehow right yes and then two levels at a different level like let's say a priest and a prostitute let's say pretty simple like it's it it can just happen it can it happens fractally at the material level but it's representing a higher a higher reality which is also happening simultaneously right so all of this happens of course then you have the you have i promise we're getting to ethiopia so all of this happens this is actually all set up for the ethiopia thing there's like i think seven or eight chapters that are basically it's like it's just an expanded narrative of the genesis history right and it explains explains we have the we have the you know all the things that we've talked about a lot and that you've talked about a lot on this channel you know the the the center and the margin that you know that the the mixture resulting in the creation of something monstrous all these different things those patterns just recapitulate themselves over and over again and what it eventually results in is in the line of ham which is which is you know this is going to be relevant to relevant to when we're talking about ethiopia we're told we're told that uh well first of all we're told that noah has an extra son and the the the idea of the extra son of noah this guy's name is junitos this is a this is a pretty popular medieval tradition that there was like this one extra sun and he actually goes to the land of the rising sun is what we're told the country of the sun where the rising of the sun takes place and he lives there and it says that unitas received from god the gift of wisdom not only this alone but he also became the inventor of every division of astronomy and so that nimrod actually came down and learned from him and received from him the council by which he might begin his rule so so you have nimrod all these things but so you have this you have this fourth son of noah who goes to the very eastern edge of the world now remember that ethiopians in the greek conception sort of come from one of two places they either come from the extreme west which is weird to think of ethiopia being in the extreme west but if you live in ancient greece it's less weird right yeah because africa is in the west so you have you have ethiopians in the extreme west where the sun comes down and then you also have them in the extreme east where the sun comes up so this is actually setting up this whole way of sort of thinking about thinking about and of course people in in you know byzantium at this time or this might have actually been written in syria but people people in in this that part of the world this time they they definitely knew there were these huge civilizations to the east right which had achieved a very high level of learning you know sometimes people point this out i was listening to something last night where somebody is pointing out that oh well you know medieval christians didn't know that you know china and and india and all these you know they had these high levels of civilization and they just thought they were the best thing on earth and all the stuff and it's it's not it's not true it's not they had a mythical way of representing right but they right the legend of the naked philosophers was there all through all through the time yeah so this is this is the basically the explanation for that where did those guys come from they actually they they are descended from like a fourth son of noah who goes to the land of the rising sun and is actually taught by god all of this lore all of this wisdom which is then sort of there preserved there on the edge of the world after the flood okay so this is all this is all kind of related to how ethiopia comes into the story um and there's there's a war between i don't want to get into too much of this but people people go read this because there's a really interesting thing that happens there's a war between the descendants of japheth would be like what we would call europeans today and between the descendants of shem this fourth son of noah actually tries to intervene in this and the reason he says that you need to enter he tries to intervene in this is to say that there are some descendants of ham this is going to be arabia who's actually going to rise up and and take you both out if you don't sort of like band together right so here so here's the idea it's like you have these european people and you have these semitic people and they're set up a very real tension that existed even in the ancient world between those people groups but then also there's this intuition that there's something vital about the the preservation of christianity has to come from a union between those two people and that this union the the source of this union is gonna come from outside and so the narrative continues on and it gets us all the way to the time of alexander and what we're told is that philip the father of alexander said this is now in chapter eight of the apocalypse that philip the father of alexander he's a macedonian king and that he marries now i know that in a lot of myths and legends especially medieval missing legends he marries an egyptian princess right but in the apocalypse she's ethiopian her name is chuseth and she's the daughter of king full of ethiopia and all of their like all of their lineage has been very carefully laid out from beforehand so you see how she's from you know the ethiopians are descended from from kush who's from the light of ham and all the stuff and and so so you have so you have philip he marries joseph this ethiopian queen and from her is born alexander and we get the story of alexander and all of his all of his his conquest and everything else and this culminates in his encountering the descendants of so he goes he goes east to the country towards the country of the sun right and there was going east towards india and that's when he encounters these in these descendants of the son of japheth who are you know europeans but who have who have gone the way of cain right and so they've they're they're out sort of here on the edge of things and and they've participated in the this mixture they've become cannibals they all eat in the semblance of the beetle it says and so they're like bugs bugs in the earth yeah i mean this is like so in other words you know like a beetle just like rummages around in in filth and dying things to decay things and things that are that are broken down and and mixed beyond the level of coherence and so it says they eat every polluted and filthy things dogs mice snakes carrion abortions miscarriages yeah there you go those which in the womb you know like i mean this is a i'm not even going to read that whole bit because it gets really intense but basically basically it's like it's it's awful right so they're they're and they shouldn't laugh but it's like yeah here's like the the kind of gog and magog imagery here right so so that so they're called they're not initially called gog and magog but that phrase is used later on and so this and so what he does is of course he drives them north because because what he's trying to do is prevent them from getting to the holy land right so he drives them north you know to this place in the caucuses and there's still it's i mean it's a real place right alexander's it's still called alexander's gates it's also called the pabst of the north which is a great band name for somebody out there if you wanna it's not go it's not do that don't do that okay sorry never mind and he builds these gates and he builds the gates out of this out of this special metal which which basically can't be it's it's they're made out of something that can't be touched by demons specifically so the idea is that these these it says these filthy and misshapen or vile nations employed in unclean fashion all of the evils of magical arts right and so the so he has to make gates that are going to that are going to sort of stand against magic gates magic gates they're made magic gates the magic gates and so what we're told then getting into this getting into this this prophecy so in our last video i read some stuff from the prophecy of ezekiel which talks about all these nations and the idea that ethiopia and the land of the the rivers beyond the rivers of ethiopia beyond the rivers of cush is being sort of like one extreme end of the world right and i think we should say at this point that when we talk about the symbolism of the edge although somewhere like ireland and somewhere like ethiopia are both kind of on the edge and so they share certain similarities they're also different because the direction that you're going in also has a lot of importance in in this sort of symbol yeah which edge of the world which edge which edge are we talking about right so this particular which is like the northern edge it's different from it's different from beyond the land of ethiopia right these are the people's which you know which are later identified with with groups like the goths group like you know these basically the whole barbarian invasion period of european history so it says in the end times of course but also the huns too like right also the huns yeah but so the huns are the huns are really interesting in this because they're they're precisely one of these groups that is like sort of like maybe they're asian but maybe they're like european yeah that's not totally clear even even even the mongolians like they're they're weird legends of of genghis khan with green eyes and stuff so even the mongols like that it's not clear they weren't it's not clear that the image of mongols we have now is what people encountered at that time so so attila the hun's name right isn't it's not a it's not an asian name his name is is it's atlee which is gothic it's a which is a european language it's a scandinavian language his name is or germanic anyway his his name is is octley and oct basically means something like little daddy so it's like an affectionate name that his soldiers have probably wasn't his real name yeah you know he probably has some other name but occlude is what everyone called him you know this is i mean this is a really interesting they're actually a couple of real members who have like a really similar nickname because they used to follow the troops around like as you know like as a boy they went with their dad on campaigns and like you know stumped around the camp in their dad's boots or whatever and and so the impression seems to be something similar happened with attila so even even the huns are not they're not they're exactly this they're exactly this kind of a group that there's there's there's an idea that some kind of mixture has taken place here we're not really sure what it is right but that's that's exactly what this legend is trying to deal with so it says in the end times according to what the prophecy of ezekiel says in the last day of the consummation of the world will come into the land of israel gog and magog and that these are the nations and the kings that alexander hid in the ends of the north so gog and magog and it just goes on it lists all these nations among these nations by the way it mentions the aggro martians and the onophagians anaphagians probably mean something like buttlicker in in latin if you can think about the way that dogs greet each other yeah yeah yeah yeah and the reason is because the anaphasians are also called the cyanocephalians in other words they're dog-headed men right so yeah yeah so it's all in there and a lot can help you understand what the dog in and men also another way of understanding what it meant right right so when you come into like the legends of saying christopher and things like this that's that's what's going on right yeah and so it says these are the 22 kings that are shut up within the gates that alexander fixed so so there's this is like one chapter in the apocalypse and the point of this chapter is basically just to refer to this story that everyone knows right because this is a universal history so it's to refer to the story everyone else everyone knows alexander did this right this is just part of what everyone sort of believed in the at this particular time in history and so it's also it's a way of explaining it's a way of explaining actually a future disaster a future apocalypse like this this hasn't you know from the perspective of when this is being written this hasn't happened yet right so with that kind of out of the way and it's not it's not unimportant for the rest of the story but like with that kind of said it returns to this question of alexander's lineage so alexander is half macedonian but he's he's he's half in this story he's half ethiopian right so you can think that's actually a really interesting image of something that comes from the edge and actually comes as a result of mixture from the edge is then the source of purity right that's what drives these monstrous things kind of away in the opposite direction too right not south but north it's what drives the launchers things away so at this point it returns to it returns to the story of alexander and basically what happened is after alexander's death his empire is split among his four servants as pretty much i think everyone knows and when this happens his mother joseph returns to ethiopia okay all right so now now we're getting into the stuff that i kind of teased in the last video bezos who's the founder of byzantium he sends to sends the chief of his army over the sea to the king of ethiopia he wants to make a marriage alliance with ethiopia and he writes to him concerning joseph the mother of alexander because he wants to take her as wife himself and make her his queen okay so bisas founder of byzantium right and it's a he's a he's a let's say from a modern perspective he's a semi-historical person right byzantium was named byzantium because it was named after somebody who founded it right yeah obviously later on constantine will come level the place and rebuild it right but it was already it wasn't a large place at that time but it was already it was it was in kind of an important place it's it's founded by like like most things that's founded by like a refugee from troy and all this different stuff so sends off up to ethiopia and he asks for the ethiopian princess who's the mother of alexander to wife and so this all goes well the the king of ethiopia sends his daughter back and she marries visas and the place where the marriage is affected is at the city of chalcedon yeah yeah so this is where this is where we have to sort of like turn to ecclesiastical history for a moment right obviously we alluded to this in the last video there is currently you know you and i are in the eastern orthodox church there's currently a schism that's been going on for like 1500 years now between the the calcidonian orthodox church and the the group that is sometimes called oriental orthodox and that's actually kind of a kind of a newer name that's been given to them mainly by like anglican scholars and it really cracks me up because orient is the same word as east so like yeah you know but but let's see just just you know to avoid the whole monopoly me if it's right probably right yeah it's like do we yes it's self-named or is it the name that we use to talk about them you know yeah and here i have to say you know with all love to my my ethiopian my eritrean friends i you know i i'm not one of these people who believes like it was all just a linguistic misunderstanding and the reason i don't believe that is because my main policy for operating in life is to not assume that that our ancestors were idiots right like to say oh it was just a big linguistic misunderstanding but now you know effect you know 1500 years removed from when these languages were spoken as living languages we can see through it and they couldn't i'm i'm i'm skeptical let's say i'm a little dubious about that so so there is this chasm between us it's a realism and that doesn't mean there's not a lot of love going both ways because there is you know but there is there is a there is a realism between us and the person who is writing this you know apocalypse is probably writing it he's he's probably in syria we think which is which is strongly affected by that schism right so he's probably syrian and he's living probably only let's say maybe a hundred years after it happened okay so this is a this is a very real reality to him the fact that this happened at calcidon is a very strong you know present reality to him so in his story the marriage alliance between byzantium and ethiopia right which are on two sides of this question is affected at the same place the schism happens yeah it's affected at calcidon king bezos bezos marries joseph and they have a daughter named byzantia and they marry byzantia off to a guy who's referred to in the text as romulus the king of rome so you have this this marriage alliance between byzantium and ethiopia and then that results in something that joins byzantium ethiopia and rome yeah right and of course rome in the west played a huge role in that particular schism right it's the it's the it's the tome of leo right red at the fourth council that really cinched it it said pinched it right and causes this rift so what the author is doing here is he's very carefully building this idea that from this marriage alliance that there's something in this in the history of the ancient world that goes all the way back to alexander right what is alexander's role alexander's role is to push the barbarians away to seal the gate against you know the you know the barbarians are literally at the gate when we're talking about alexander right so his goal his his role is really to play this role of of unity and and purity right but it's not a it's not a monolithic purity alexander is himself have ethiopian in the story right but it's a way of it's a way of this goes back to this this very strange idea that i haven't actually encountered anywhere else earlier in the apocalypse that seth was a giant right so there's some kind of idea here maybe you could speak to this a little bit because i've talked a lot yeah well there's a there's a there's a difference between there's a how can i say this there is a moment or there's a possibility for something like hybridity to become synthetic to become an actual new being so so were you mentioning this was this in one of your last videos or was this in the q a it's in a q a that i talked about that so so this this was really important so maybe you could say a little bit about this again because i think this is this is probably the best part about whole q a yeah well there is there especially right now it's really important to see that because they're the one of the biggest problems we have right now is we are struggling to tell the difference between confusion and unity right that is the unity of multiplicity into a new identity and the the union of multiplicity which is actually not a union which is just a confusion of different identities that can't sort themselves out and it's hard for people it's hard because it's a really existential experience it's hard to it's hard to define the difference between you know something when you look at it you know it like you look at something and you say well that's like that's like two things it's not one thing you can't tell that it's one thing it doesn't come together into one and so you can see that for example the example i gave is is exactly britain for example there's a moment in which britain was just a bunch of different groups fighting amongst each other and you could say britain but it wasn't it was just this mixture of people and then something happened you know something sacred something high up on the scale of being which was able to join them together so that now they recognize each other as having a true unity and it doesn't it doesn't deny their multiplicity it doesn't annul it but it makes a multiplicity participate in a unity and so this is really the difference so right now we talk about things like like the whole idea of intersectionality right intersectionality is really is this worship of diversity for itself and it's like the opposite of unity it's like right like the one who can accumulate the most idiosyncrasy wins rather than seeing how those idiosyncrasies can be joined together with our different idiosyncrasies to to to actually express unity and so it's sometimes it can confuse us because it almost looks like each other but it's it is like it is like a mere reflection one of the other so this is this this is maybe just exactly let me give you let me give an example like i've actually one example i've given recently in in the q a is the difference between christ and bafflement it's a very it's like it's a pretty clear example because in kind of this kind of occult tradition they have this sense of the union of heaven and earth they talk about you know as above so below but the image that they come up with in the 19th century is a hybrid creature is a hybrid hermaphroditic creature with like the head of a goat and the breasts of a of a woman and still seeming to be a man you know and so it's like they confuse synthesis and and and hermaphroditis hermaphroditism like the idea of having two sexes at the same time that's not the that's that's not unity and so you could say it's like the difference between the someone that is an angel that is beyond sex and a confused being that is a mixture of all these different of these different identities and so that's the difference so christ is both man and god complete not no mixture it's really important for the definition of christ that there's no mixture between the two natures but completely united in one person so that so that they also can't be separated let's say and so that is the image of synthesis whereas something like baphomet it really is the image of confusion yeah there has to be i mean so so you just you just mentioned the hypostatic union which is you know like the technical term for that idea that christ says and this is actually what that that schism is over that we were just talking about between the calcidone and non-calcitinian churches is over this question right and so the the church is teaching on this is that christ has two natures divine and human perfectly joined in his hypothesis his person right his his you know the the second person of the trinity that these two natures are joined but not mingled not confused and i'll give a i'll give a weird example because people keep asking about symbolism of america and i'm just gonna i'll just tease this i'll just tease this okay so you might have heard we had a civil war a couple hundred years ago here in the united states it's kind of a thing so in our name right there's a plurality in the name the united states right what is a state a state is not a province a state is a you know like the traditional definition of the state is that a state is like it's it's like a standalone self-governing principality of some kind right so so we're the united states and so the idea is that you had all of these standalone principalities who would come together to cooperate on certain levels right and that was the let's say that was one vision of what america might be right and it's not what came out of the civil war and and the reason it didn't come out of the civil war is because there was no there was no higher principality right there was no sacred direction toward which each of those those individual things could orient themselves right and so what ended up what ends up happening is of course you have some band together against others that band together and you have a war so the the way that this i'm going to just say on a symbolic level the way that the unity of the united states manifests in the post civil war area is actually in the person of abraham lincoln and the reason that i believe this is the case is because if we go to washington dc we have a temple to abraham lincoln in washington dc and it really is it really is a temple like it says it's a temple on the temple right there's there's there's an engraving behind this so it's a it's modeled on a on an ancient temple of zeus i forget which one but it's modeled on an ancient temple of zeus and then sitting in the center in the throne instead of zeus it's abraham lincoln and there's an inscription behind him that's culture man it's got a lot of that double that double nature to it because they actually in the sculpture itself they have one side of abraham lincoln which is kind of ordered and the other side of abraham lincoln which is kind of disoriented it's a little like like what's going on that pantone the icon of the yeah it's really interesting and so behind his head in an inscription that says in this temple as in the hearts of those for whom he saved the union abraham lincoln will be forever enshrined something like that and like listen to the language there the ideas that abraham lincoln has come into your heart and he has saved you i mean that's deliberately like that's in the language of the lincoln memorial yeah but at the roo the roof of the lincoln memorial and i think it's very interesting that it's the roof and not say the floor but at the roof of the lincoln memorial you have the engraved names of all all the states that were in the union at the time the memorial was built right and so so there's this idea then that it's almost like a like an idea of like the council of the gods right but it's it's the idea that we're able to sort of like we have a sacred place we have a sacred building toward which towards which the the states are able to orient themselves right and so like they're sort of joined in the person of lincoln and one of the interesting things that's happened is that as we start to fracture again as a society you have people originally was the right who who like maybe 10 or 15 years ago got really down on lincoln because they felt like he'd obliterated the whole idea of like states rights or whatever but now it's the left and they're down like lincoln is sort of getting canceled right so it's like lincoln was like the one thing everyone could agree on it that was the principality if you will that was sort of holding this idea of the american vision the american dream together and as we began to fragment we're losing our trust in that particular principality yeah so i apologize we you we didn't mean to talk about this but was the fourth of july not very yeah it was the fourth of july you're allowed been on my mind a lot right so let's get back to this yeah yeah so this marriage right so the idea is that the way that you the way that you join opposites right the way that you join two opposite things which which again i can't stress enough this is what the whole schism is about right and what the writer of this is saying is that the way that you join two opposite things byzantium and ethiopia east and west north and south the way that you learn two opposite things is in a person right so you join them in the person of you know this this princess that he sends off to rome she has three children one of whom is named claudius and claudius rules in alexandria and then eventually like the line of the the romans comes comes from him but at the end of all of this it says this therefore the seed of joseph the daughter of full the king of ethiopia gained mastery over the macedonians and the romans so remember that the ethiopian is the you know the image of like the queen of sheba or moses's first wife right it's this idea that the ethiopian is the one who is captured and then in her turn captures right so she she somehow gains mastery of the romans because over the sorry over the macedonians because her son is alexander who conquers everything right she gains mastery over the people of the romans by you know by this idea that east and west the rulers the principalities on both side are now coming from her from her womb right and so and i think this is a kind of image this is a way of understanding this is this is a way of understanding mastery that i don't think is possible in a pre-christian world right because pre-christian it's not biology but but like pre-christian biology is concerned with the seed of the man the idea is the woman is basically just like a container she's basically just like you know potential but she doesn't contribute anything to that process and then christianity comes along and we get the virgin mary right and the virgin mary right you know because christ is without is without a biological father this opens up a space to sort of think about women as actually participating in the birthing process but not just that that the idea that embodiment is part of the story right yes the power of embodiment is there in the story of christ but then in the story of the church and the whole way in which let's say the light manifests itself into the world one of the revelations that appears in the christian story is the manner in which the feminine principle plays a role in in revealing the body as it kind of comes down the cosmic mountain you'd say it's like filling up the mountain with the sea but there's a sense in which there there's a participation there's a there's this call back and call back and forth between the masculine and the feminine in the in the kind of song of songs manner in which so in which the world reveals itself and this is this is how we can both talk about the virgin mary as as being sort of like the secret interior place you know like the holy place right but then also our champion leader right this this is how we're able to talk about her in a concrete way right yeah so so it says that the seed of chuseth and again women don't have seed so it's the seed of the woman you know which is which is a phrase that goes all the way back to genesis right the seed of chuseth the daughter of full the king of ethiopia gained mastery of the macedonians and the ethiopians from the seed of the ethiopians this one and it quotes quotes that prophecy from the psalms this one shall stretch out her hands unto god at the last day according to the word of the prophet the blessed david looked ahead with the eyes of the spirit and foreknew that joseph the daughter of foal the king of ethiopia would begin to rouse the kingdom of the romans and he prophesied saying ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto god and so and then it goes on to say since in fact the great and venerable and honored wood of the life-giving cross has been set up by the kingdom established from the seed of the ethiopian lady this is talking about rome now which wood is fixed in the midst of the earth which is jerusalem which is why perhaps as is fitting the ancient father david himself made the statement thus saying ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto gods the idea of stretching out your hands is compared to the shape of the cross right for there is no nation or kingdom under heaven which is able to prevail and overcome the kingdom of the christians for as we have already said above because the life given cross has been fixed and made firm in the midst of the earth and it just goes on to talk about you know the result of this is that the ends of the earth are then described according to be fixed according to breadth and length and height and depth so the idea is that the cross becomes the measure of the world right yes this is this is why it's ethiopia too because it's as if it's the filling up it's the idea that there's a there's a notion in which there's a joining between the center and the periphery and that this this joining is what christianity is and it's actually the cross is already what that is and so the idea of of opening or putting your hands to the ends of the world like spanning the spanning the horizontal right spanning the entire breadth of reality you can imagine that as being like the width of the mountain itself is this the breadth of the of the cross is the width is the width of the mountain and so this is the idea of how the relationship between the ma let's say the emperor you know the the king and the ethiopian queen how this is an image of christianity itself because it it spans everything and already solomon and the queen of shiva is already that image that his his wisdom kind of covers everything and so this is where i think that in the story of ethiopia as it's played out here in the byzantine apocalypse tradition you see the symbolism of ethiopia sort of the rectification of the story of kane right that's why that's why i'm sure there are people who are going to watch this video and be like okay he's just talking about like kane and you know giants and like what where's this going what does this have to do with ethiopia you know but but there's a reason that every time someone tells a story in the ancient world every single time they start with genesis and they start with abel they start with seth and kane in the table of nations and nobody tells the story of ethiopia without starting there right because because it's something to do i mean you were talking about like let's say multi different different kinds of multiplicity and like confusion versus synthesis right which is really like babel versus pentecost yeah exactly and pentecost is really is this image of the rectification of going down the mountain that is it's like you can imagine cane you know and the curse in general going down the mountain and that the surprise of that phenomena is pentecost because it's like you don't expect it but then something happens where the the the christ going down into death manifest itself cosmically as the ends of the earth being filled with the spirit of god right the land of ethiopia is stretching out its hand all flesh being covered by the spirit you see these images and we were hearing these images at pentecost as well another one at pentecost that that we read is you know this passage from isaiah says the knowledge of god will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea which is a really symbolically interesting phrase because of course like the sea has all these resonances of chaos and death and division and multiplicity and all these different things and then so the idea is that that you know the c is sort of the thing that's without bounds right you know and whenever god wants to assert him you know like assert his power he says i'm the one that set the line that said to the sea you will not cross right so then for the knowledge of god to to cover the earth in that way it's like it's like the knowledge of god now is the thing without bounds the knowledge of god is now the thing that's like all-encompassing right yeah there's an image that i love to bring about which i think is one of the most beautiful images that saint ephrem in his hymns on paradise comes about is he talks about how the saints he talks about the rivers of paradise going down into the world he talks about them becoming mitigated as they get further and further right from the center right they become more confused more mitigated more polluted you could say whatever word you want to use then he says the saints the saints go down the mountain and then they come to the oh to the to the sea and they walk on the waters and so it's like that that's not a problem it's actually if you're looking in the right direction all of that actually becomes glory even the bitterness of the waters in the end will will vanish and it'll become something like glory right so it's like there's no seed but there's a crystal seed right exactly that's that kind of thing yeah so what follows at from this point in the apocalypse is this long description actually he immediately goes into a pretty long chapter after this talking about now i just said that the kingdom of the christians will never be overcome but obviously the jews were the people of god and they got conquered like every other day in the bible you know so like what's going on there like what do i mean when i say that and so he's he you get this really kind of a long explanation for you know why does god allow suffering why does god allow kingdoms that are ostensibly christian kingdoms to be conquered and overcome and things like this and it's a it's a i mean it's a good explanation there's nothing in it that i think that that would really surprise anyone but his point is to sort of say you know my kingdom is not of this world but also sometimes it's of this world right and there's like this i mean that that's one of the big tensions right is the is that christianity is otherworldly but also it has this very unique ability to enculturate itself in all these different cultures and kingdoms not in a way that makes them essential like byzantium can fall rome can fall and christianity not lose what it is right and in fact you know there's there's some interesting some interesting ways that that changed you know things like some some of the prayers that we used to direct towards the emperor we direct towards our bishop now but some of them we also direct towards the people you know that that line in the liturgy where we say oh god save the pious and hear us right that's that's directed to the faithful now but originally that that line was was said to the emperor and that that was the point when the emperor came into the church and we agreed oh god save the pious and hear him right and so so there's there's there's some really interesting things that that kind of happen there so it's like you know on the one hand we can be we can be comfortable with the process of acculturation and we can also be comfortable with where we came from right on the other hand we don't have to fear right because because this kingdom or that kingdom falls right so so he's so he's working through all that stuff and then he gets to the end and this is kind of his view of the eschaton and his view of the eschaton is that there's going to be this this invasion in the seventh millennium of the world there's going to be this invasion of the sons of ishmael that are good it's going to wipe out the roman empire and that this is gonna bring in this is then gonna open up a space for the invasion of these unclean nations that alexander imprisoned long ago they're gonna flood across the world and they're actually going to overrun the servants of ishmael the sons of ishmael right and then at the end of all of this the last king of the romans will manifest himself and this is where ethiopia comes back into the story so there's this idea that the seed of the roman people you know the seed of the last king of the romans has been somehow preserved during all of this stuff this constant overrunning over and over again and that the last king of the romans is going to manifest himself and he will drive out these unclean peoples that alexander imprisoned so he's like coming from ethiopia just like alexander did to kind of do the same thing that alexander did he's hidden in ethiopia like the seed yeah in ethiopia it's it's the the ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto god is the is the that's the prophecy that they keep coming back to over and over again like so so things are said really bad it says honor is going to be taken away from the priests and the ministry of god will be ended every sacrifice will cease from the cease from the churches so we'll stop offering the liturgy we'll stop off in the eucharist right which is which is actually tell a lot of the mystics in our tradition have said that's when the world ends that's when yeah when there's no longer someone to serve the liturgy right you know maybe liturgy is saving you you just don't know it i don't know but you know but it's just talking about how bad things are and it says a man will offer for sale all this necessary equipment and his iron tools and even his burial sheets which is a symbolic image i'd like to return to at some point in the future and that in the middle of all of this this is when the last king of the romans will manifest and it says trying to find the exact quote here so this this man will march out and proceed against them from the sea of ethiopia which is coming from the direction of ethiopia and send his sword and desolation into yathrib which is their homeland and will take capture of their wives and their sons the sons of the land king will descend upon those living in the promised land the sword and cut them off from the land this is the the unclean peoples who have it says from the sea of ethiopia from the sea of ethiopia yeah yeah yeah it's it's almost like you know you haven't been making this stuff up all along yeah exactly i mean this is this is so yeah it says all of a sudden trouble and affliction will come upon them that is that is the the people that alexander imprisoned and the king of the greeks that is of the romans will spring upon them in great anger and will be aroused like a man from a drunken sleep and this is that image that that language that we find in the psalms of like the lord rousing himself from sleep rousing himself like a drunk man right which is a weird way to talk about god but it's in the bible so i don't know what to say you know and and this this idea that you know that you know he's like suddenly awakened to fierce wrath right well that language here is applied to the last king of the romans and who men reckoned him at to be dead and good for nothing and this man will march out and proceed against them from the sea of ethiopia so it's like the last of the romans has somehow been hid down in ethiopia while all the stuff has been going on and everyone accounts him as dead as good for nothing is lost that the roman empire is gone the greeks are gone the empire's destroyed all the stuff and then in the last day there's gonna be this awakening from sleep and he's gonna proceed he's gonna march out from the sea of ethiopia and he's going to drive out the enemies and he's going to yoke them says with a yoke sevenfold of what their yoke was on the earth great distress will come upon them etc etc and all of this happens and there's a brief respite there's this brief period of rest that comes to the earth there's a piece right before the eschaton and when the eschaton comes this is when the antichrist is unleashed upon the earth right and so there's this brief repose basically the idea is the last king of the romans he'll revive things one last time and then the antichrist will be revealed and when the antichrist is revealed he gets these guys that alexander imprisoned and he leads them on like one final slaughter across the earth and when this happens it says when the son of perdition shows himself the king of the romans will go up to golgotha right which is where at this particular time this is where the true cross was right and we still have you know we have churches there and what not he'll go up to golgotha where the lord of the holy cross was fixed at the place in which the lord underwent death for our sakes and he will take the crown from his head and he will place it on the cross and then he will spread out his hands to heaven and deliver the kingdom of the christians to god even the father and at this point the cross will be taken up into heaven along with the king's crown because the cross in which the lord our jesus christ our lord jesus christ was hanged for the sake of the common salvation of all the cross itself will commence to appear before him and his coming as a refutation of the treachery of the unbelievers and the prophecy of david will be fulfilled in which he says in the last days ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto god because from the seed of the sons of joseph the daughter of the fall the king of ethiopia these last in other words the last roman emperor emperor will stretch out their hands unto god so that the the cross is taken up into heaven the last king of the romans who is also the last king of the ethiopians surrenders his spirit he dies the antichrist takes over and then jesus comes back like that's that's the that's the way the apocalypse ends okay there's so much in this there's so much in this one thing i want to point out is again scholars think this might have been originally written in syria there's a syrian tradition i think you find this in ethiopia as well this idea that at the moment of the crucifixion when christ's sight is pierced that's the moment that the veil opens sean ephraim talks about this but when the veil opens the holy place is shown to be empty and there's a syrian tradition that says at that moment the shekinah if it was it was present in the temple which other churches would say wasn't even present but there's a tradition a syrian tradition that says that that moment the shekinah glory the presence of god in the temple left the temple it left the holy place and it took up residence in the cross not just in the cross but in every cross so then there's this idea of like the cross being taken up into heaven at this last moment as a as an act of judgment it's like god withdrawing his presence from rightful yeah so that just before the end let's say yeah yeah so this is i mean this is heavy stuff and there's a lot of really yeah definitely and also the idea of the of the crown being taken up like let's say there it's almost there's almost a sense of something like the ascent of enoch and the ascent of elijah i've talked about this before where there seems to be a pattern even the ascent of moses there seems to be a pattern that before a massive change you know before the end of a world there seems to be this the best is taken up but it kind of makes sense in this in that that's also what kind of causes the end of the world well that's the story of melchizedek right is that you know this is in one of the enochian books i think a second enoch that's the story of melchizedek it's right melchizedek is sort of like the last priest of yahweh and he's taken up into paradise so that he'll be preserved from the flood exactly right but it's also it's almost like to be preserved from the flood but it's also like the cause of the flood at the same time because you're taking the seed out of the world you're taking the meaning you're taking the thing that joins things that joins things together and therefore then the world breaks down because you've removed it's it's common principle or the you know the thing that makes it less yeah and so the holy people like when when we when we hear this idea that like saints hold up the world through prayer you know it's something like that it's like if the saints are actually functioning as fulcrums to to to preserve reality and so and if the saints are taken up then then the world just falls apart actually so it seems like that's what's going on in the sort of enoch and the story the story of elijah but it also seems to be something like that that's happening here like you said it's the shekinah leaving the temple but if the shakina leaves the temple that's actually the presence of god but now it's not just the presence of god but it's actually let's say the fractally the human authority itself or the good human authority that which is an image of the the of the reign of god and the world is also kind of all taken up into heaven and the phrase here the phrase here it's over the phrase here that the the last king of the romans gives up his spirit it's the same phrase that's used of christ on the cross yeah so the spirit ascends and then darkness appears right you know the spirit of spirit of crisis ends and then darkness appears in the world the same and the shekinah goes up like you said that tradition of the idea that when christ dies and gives up his spirit the shekinah leaves the temple you know it's a it's a it's a beautiful image to help us understand what is going on and what that means for reality in general and how to make in the story of the the apocalypse of pseudomethodist it makes sense that as the the presence of god and human kingship in that presence leaves the world then gog and magog and the antichrist take over because there's nothing left to hold it together this is even in the this is even in i mean this is in the scriptures in the wisdom of solomon there's this long passage about why do good people die young sometimes right and we actually i think we read this in the church on like the eve a vigil on the eve of feasts of like certain certain martyrs and monastic saints and and things like this but the the the explanation that's given there in the scriptures is this idea that one of the reasons that that sometimes good people die young is that it's a mercy toward them and it's a judgment to the world right because the saints do uphold the world it's the only i mean as far as i'm concerned the only reason that the world continues to exist and be upheld right now is because there are people on athos and there they're people elsewhere in the world holy people people we don't know about right and that they're the they're the real hidden cause they're the real hidden life of the world and that if that stops yeah and you can understand it bottom up and top down at the same time it's almost like right if the if the saint is taken up then the world is destroyed but the reason why the saint is being taken up is because the world doesn't hold together anymore it's like those two things are kind of like happening at the same time this is people don't realize this but this is what's going on in that dialogue between god and and abraham over whether or not sodom is going to be yeah yeah exactly that's not just like abraham is like you know trying to trying to bargain god down right things like this like they're having a conversation in which god is actually showing the way that cities nations the entire cosmos is actually upheld right and it's by the righteous it's by the prayers of the saints so even ten righteous right even the praise of ten people who are really holy really seeking after god would be enough to preserve the most wicked city that has ever existed from judgment and you almost have a sense in which the the bet the bet that moses the bet that abraham seems to be making in that story is that his intercession will be enough to hold it together like his asking of god to hold the world together will be enough for it to hold together and it seems that it wasn't in that case right yeah it was at least enough to remove the remove his family from the from but even then like you have the best being taken out so that judgment can can come and fall upon the city and it's you know it's it's maybe from our standpoint like pretty sorry that lot is the best but i mean but i mean look at your own life not not you specifically john us in general like like look at our own lives and all the things that are in our hearts right you know so yeah i think this is this is just a really powerful story and i think that i think that once you kind of go here then there are a lot of things about even the modern history of ethiopia that make you start to wonder a little bit right certainly if nothing else you could kind of take away from this this this text in all probability is written at a time when this christian the the author of this text has seen the the fracturing of the church in the roman empire and the breaking off of the non-calcedonian churches followed almost immediately by the rise of the islam and the arab conquests yeah so you're seeing these things happen and he's trying to make sense of them and what i think that he's managed to do is actually to intuit and to understand a very important symbolic pattern about how the world works yeah and what the symbolism of these different peoples and countries is to the point that i think he's able to intuit some role that i do believe it seems ethiopia might have to play but it's not just intuit there is a there's a relationship between intuition and causality in the sense that right the the writer of this text would probably also have known that after chalcedon that's when the nine saints went to ethiopia from syria probably or from egypt you know from egypt or syria from one of those places would i think it was for from egypt but they they they go to ethiopia and they see ethiopia as the place to now build monasteries and to kind of create this bastion to hold the christian civilization at least in their perception right so you can understand that as the as the let's say with the advent of islam that that memory or that understanding all of that would have would be part of the story like he also knew that that these nine saints went there and probably brought a lot of the texts that were preserved like there was probably a lot of that was going on you know with with the this kind of renewal of ethiopian monastic tradition and so it all it there's a relationship between intuition and causality all of this is all kind of happening at the same time so what i really want to do if people will let us i mean like if if you'll let me get away with and if i mean i've been pretty all over the place today but if people will let us get away with another ethiopia video which i which i think they will i i'd like to actually look at those nine saints specifically look at their lives yeah but it'd be good to also look at how ethiopian christianity functions the relationship because the ark is fractally present in all the churches i i've had a lot of people in the last two weeks so there was a there was a there was a consecration at our cathedral we have so we have a new bishop which is great but but i got to see a lot of people that normally i only know on the internet and i've had so many people come up to me in the last like two weeks with like so did you know that they actually have like a little model of the ark and every ethiopian church you know like yes yes i know we there's a limit of things we can talk about yeah so i think that i think that now that we've kind of like i feel like all our previous videos were just laying the groundwork to where we could talk about this text and now that we've done that i think maybe looking at ethiopian christianity a little deeper for our next video would be yeah i think it's a great idea and and to talk a little bit about the different traditions and and also the the these kind of underground cities this underground city has this microcosm of of jerusalem and you know this whole idea of a kind of a microcosm and a crossing of of places because if you go to these churches some of the things you see are astounding like their crusader crosses carved into these buildings and there's there's this you can see that so much has happened in these places that they really was seen as a all through the middle ages this memory was was preserved and was participated in the in the grand story and so definitely that i think that would be a great thing to look at in our next discussion sounds good all right everybody so so yeah i know that but i know you can't get enough of ethiopia so we will definitely be talking about that in our lat next discussion and so i'll also be interviewing dean arnold who has written a book on ethiopia dean is an orthodox christian that i met if that i met i think a few times and he's written a book about ethiopia especially modern ethiopia and how it connects to this universal story but really focusing on the modern history and how he sees ethiopia's role let's say as the ark itself in the way that we've talked about and so because i know very little about kind of modern ethiopian history it'll be interesting to also dive into that with him so so there'll be more on ethiopia coming your way so so richard thanks again for your time i really love these discussions so we can just keep going because they're they're a lot of fun i'm i'm down let's do it all right so thanks everybody and don't forget to check out all of what richard is doing in terms of amateur you know and the the books that he's participated in we'll put all the links again in the description if you want to kind of follow his thread because he's also been on a lot of podcasts so maybe we can put a few of those links below that you can follow you were on on on why are we talking about rabbits recently as well really great conversation actually i think i think just
