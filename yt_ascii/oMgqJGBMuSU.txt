hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be answering the question how big of a hill do you need to recharge a tesla and this was actually inspired by a tweet someone tweeted me and they said hey how big of a hill do you need to recharge a tesla and i thought that was a pretty fascinating question and there's a pretty simple logical way to go about answering that question so that's what we're going to go through so we have our tesla model s we're just going to go with the base 60 and assume it's the 60 kilowatt hour battery in the tesla you could of course change this math however you'd like to however many kilowatt hours the battery pack your specific vehicle has convert that to joules that's 2.16 times 10 to the eighth joules we want this for our energy equation and the tesla model s weighs 4006 pounds i find that oddly specific that that's the number that they list on their website the 0.3 especially makes me a little suspicious but that's what they say so anyways 2108 kilograms is how much it weighs when you do the conversion so potential energy we've got something at the top of the hill and when something is at the top of the hill it has potential energy as it starts rolling it's turning that potential energy into kinetic energy as it rolls down the hill and eventually gets to the bottom of the hill and when it's all stopped and done and it's at sea level let's say there's no more potential energy left it's all been used up and you know it's turned into kinetic energy so hopefully the vehicle is moving or it's crashed into something or whatever so anyways how tall is the hill well a simple equation potential energy is equal to mass times gravity times height that's all we need so the mass of the vehicle 2108 kilogram times gravity 9.81 meters per second squared and times our height we do not know we know how much potential energy we have 2.16 times 10 to the eighth that's how much we need rather we are going to find out how much height we need in order to get that much energy so we do the math and our height comes out to 10 445.14 meters or 10.44 kilometers okay so now this is how much total height we would need if the tesla was able to convert all of that energy back into the battery now they're of course not going to be 100 efficient so you've got your wheel that's sending energy to your gear reduction that's sending energy to the motor that's sending energy to the controller or the inverter and that's sending that energy back into the battery so you know throughout this entire process you're losing energy at each step because you have efficiency losses associated with each step so i looked online at several different options of you know how much energy can you really realistically recover in these scenarios and it seems to be something like sixty percent is something that you could assume you could recover in this sort of scenario so we're going to take our 10.445 kilometers divide that by point 0.60 and that's going to give us a total height needed of 17.409 kilometers okay so this is the height assuming only 60 of that energy goes into the battery pack that will need a a hill of 17.4 kilometers in height so that's a pretty tall hill how tall is mount everest this is a question we of course have to talk about in this video mount everest is 8.85 kilometers or 5.5 miles 29 000 feet tall so if we take 8.85 multiply that by 2 that gives us 17.7 kilometers 17.7 is higher than 17.4 so basically we need a mountain twice as tall as mount everest in order to recharge this tesla model s that's unfortunate news for tesla owners out there but if you are a nissan leaf owner they have 24 hour or they have 24 kilowatt and 30 kilowatt hour battery packs i believe so half of this so that means if you are nissan leaf owner you can take your nissan leaf to the top of mount everest drive it down to the ocean and it'll be fully charged you should go out and test that if you have a nissan leaf it'll be good fun and so okay how far is the total distance that this vehicle has to travel so we're going to assume we have a 10 slope that we're going down on and we're going to calculate what is the total distance that our vehicle traveled so we know what our height is this is 17.4 kilometers and we know what our slope is 0.1 slope equals rise over run y over x so 17.4 divided by x we multiply that over here divide 17.4 by 0.1 that of course gives us 174 kilometers okay so now we have x and we want to find out d using the pythagorean theorem we can take 174 squared plus 17.4 squared take the square root of that that will give us d and that is 170 oh my 174.9 kilometers so that's the total distance that we would need to drive on a 10 grade in order to fully recharge a tesla model s with a 60 kilowatt hour battery this is about 109 miles let's go ahead and write that in there 109 miles so quite a journey to recharge your battery pack and you know you're going to be going down quite a distance now this does not account for rolling resistance nor does it account for drag now aerodynamic drag you could just travel at a lower speed so you wouldn't really have to worry about that you do always of course have to worry about rolling resistance so if you are super curious and you want to do all the math behind this i've got our final equation here so the amount of energy you're going to recover this is that a number that we're going to need here is going to be equal to the potential energy that's what we calculated right here minus our energy lost multiplied all of that multiplied by our efficiency of recovery in this case we're using sixty percent now energy is equal to force times distance so we can continue along with this equation here potential energy minus the force of drag times the distance we've traveled minus the force of rolling resistance times the distance we traveled and all of this once again multiplied by efficiency so then here's our final equation here for those who are still watching and still curious for some odd reason you're going to have the total amount of energy that you're going to recover is going to be equal to mgh that's potential energy minus this right here which is your rolling or your drag your aerodynamic drag so your p right there rho is going to be air density v is speed cd is your coefficient of drag and then a is your frontal area of your vehicle later on we're going to multiply that by distance plus we're adding in the rolling resistance coefficient times mass times gravity this is the force of rolling resistance this is the force of drag multiply those by distance and sum all that up multiply that by our efficiency and then you can figure out you know the actual amount of energy recovered the actual height you would need based on this equation here which you do have your h right there which will be your unknown so hopefully you guys have learned something from this it's a fascinating question you never know what one of your tweets to me might turn into it could turn into a video so thanks for watching questions or comments feel free to leave them below
