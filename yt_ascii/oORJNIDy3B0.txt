this is the insta360 flow and i'm going to be completely honest with you when nc360 told me that they're releasing a smartphone gimbal and they asked if i wanted to do a sponsored video on it i said no probably not i've used a lot of smartphone gimbals in my time and they're useful but just not interesting enough to make a full dedicated video all about but then i actually use the product they'd made and i realized i've never seen a gimbal like this so here are the top 10 coolest most surprising things about it rapid deploy which i realize makes it sound like a military weapon but just means that with one single motion the gimbal powers itself up auto stabilizes and then gives you a pop-up notification to jump straight into the app to shoot and the other perk of this is that with one fold it turns itself off the phone just pulls away because it's secured by magnets and the remaining gimbal has probably the smallest footprint i've ever seen but then i realized that's only the start of how this flow has completely maximized on every bit of space it does take up because this is just a handle right well no the bass has a hidden tripod inside of it you're about to see why that's so important later it's got the industry standard tripod mount which means you can screw it into any professional camera gear and in the end also doubles as a selfie stick it adds an extra 22 centimeters of reach which combined with the extra reach already present with the gimbal takes the wider selfie you can capture from this when the phone's just in your hand to this with the full setup so what about the stabilization itself well here's the thing with smartphone video providing in the daytime your phone will use both optical image stabilization where the lens physically moves up and down to counteract the wobbliness and electronic image stabilization to further smooth out the rougher edges and in this case the flow is basically acting like an extra layer of physical image stabilization not just in the two dimensions your phone can stabilize in but in every dimension which massively cushions it such that by the time you then apply both your phone's optical image stabilization and electronic on top makes it literally like your device is floating but then the minute that the light starts to dip at all electronic image stabilization would work by trying to match each subsequent frame with the last one has less information to work with and therefore falls apart and this is where the benefit of doubling up on the physical stabilization is really felt but every smartphone gimbal stabilizes that's not really why i decided to make this video it's all the things this has aside from that like the smart wheel when you look at this thing's control system you probably think oh okay nice simple basic gimbal but this thing is crazy it's just extremely good at simplifying the controls for this crazy stuff so this wheel is actually a capacitive touch panel so you can change stabilization modes by just sliding around it and actually either direction proper ipod style if you've ever used one of those it's got all the standard functions like being able to remotely trigger recording and using the analog stick to manually move your phone around but more interestingly the outer edge is its own independent wheel that allows you to zoom in and out you can tap here to play back the last video you shot without touching your phone screen rewind and scrub through it with a touch pad and double tapping the switch button takes you between landscape and portrait form videos absolute game changer by the way i'm actually using this to film one of our upcoming youtube shorts simply because this portrait orientation that you need it keeps it locked in that and then my favorite control one tap of this rear trigger activates deep track and this we need to talk about so by default if you just tap that button the software automatically selects what it thinks is the subject of the shot uses ai to lock onto that object in real time and then uses the gimbal to make sure the phone follows it so for example right now i'm moving my head back and forth i'm dipping in and out of the frame but with one type of the deep track button the phone recognizes my face and basically will not leave it ever again you can even zoom in and the tracking system automatically adjusts the way that it's tracking in real time to make sure that it does not lose sight of your face which first time i've ever seen a gimbal do that you can draw on screen if you you want to select something in particular and your phone will pick that up and this means you just don't have to think when you're capturing those stupid experiments that you only do once in slow motion the thing even remembers the object it was tracking so if something else gets in the way for a minute it'll just pick up where it left off and the best part of this is that it means when you use your front camera it'll by default just lock onto your face one of the most surreal moments i've had with the flow is actually when i combined this deep track on the front camera with the fact that there's also a selfie stick here it was this very unique uber wide ultra stabilized worry-free camera experience and also the single best vlogging setup that i own right now but then i did think what if you're on your own how are you going to activate deep track mode if you want to be on the other side of the camera well use gestures all you've got to do is hold your palm up and the phone will lock onto you and start tracking oh yeah and you can also talk to it you can talk to your gimbal which my fiance will be very excited to hear you can tell it the kinds of environments you're in or the kinds of shots that you'd like to output and it'll use ai to show you how i haven't really used this all that much i prefer messing around my way but it really does make you realize the amount of effort into 360 has gone to flesh this product out it's definitely not just rushed out the gate put it that way so if you've been following this insta360 company for a while you'll have noticed that these guys love cameras that can take 360 degree footage it's in their name i don't know why i thought that was such a fun fact but yeah they love it so much that even for this seemingly unrelated product we found a way to add 360 back in you just find a scene you like the look of take out the built-in tripod and take a 360. it'll move your phone around automatically capture the view from every single direction and stitch them together into a 60 80 by 30 40 resolution shot and there are actually a ton of creative effects like this like for one if you enable first person view mode the zoom wheel changes function so that it can instead be used to make your phone do a barrel roll which is about as disorienting as you would expect or dolly zoom which is a pretty famous very dramatic hollywood effect but here you just tap the subject you want to do it with and then move your camera towards or away from it oh myler nearly smile for once or widescreen mode which shoots in a cinematic aspect ratio when applied to color grade to your footage for those of you who used to watch me a long time ago you'll know that i used to shoot all my videos in this aspect ratio because i just think it looks better it's just not ideal for watching on phone screens so i had to give it up i got so carried away with this that i almost forgot that there's also the entire insta360 app you have access to which let's just say multiplies the creative possibilities like one thing i think is so cool is electric surge you feed in a video you've taken it scans and tracks the human targets in them and embellishes them with tracked special effects that manually would have taken hours to add in yourself plus it's quite cool because the gimbal also knows when you've exited the app so it'll automatically swivel upright so that you can use your phone normally okay so what is the number one thing here you know i was impressed that this company's managed to fit both the tripod and the selfie stick in here while it also being a compact 3-axis stabilizing gimbal well what completely takes it over the edge for me is that they've somehow done this while also giving it market leading battery life at 12 hours so much so that you know this cable we've had attached the entire time that's actually not required for the function of device at all that's there because this also doubles as a power bank and throughout this entire video alongside all the other stuff i've been using this to charge my phone up from scratch to full which basically means this is not just a stabilizer this is every smartphone gadget in one with some kind of insane ai tracking check out the insta360 flow in the description
