this feels like i'm definitely gonna break it why would anyone do this to a two thousand dollar monitor well maybe because they waited 10 years for this technology to go from hiding away behind a glass barrier at a trade show to being a product that you can actually buy and take home and also because gosh darn it it's really cool it's also practical though depending on what you're doing the optimal curvature of a display can change dramatically so from an ergonomic standpoint any conventional monitor will at times be too curved or maybe too flat and stuck in the paper but the xenia on flex from corsair fixes all that i'll be the first to admit that it feels like kind of a bougie gimmick right now but if you give this a generation or two to come down in price i think this could be the on desk equivalent of seed adjustments on your chair it really does make a huge difference but not in the way you might expect but you probably expected though was this message from our sponsor

with over 500 at smartdeploy.com ltt [applause] [music] most gamers only have one gaming display the square one beside it for discord doesn't count and i think it's fair to say that they expect it to last a very long time that means that a cool party trick is not enough to justify giving the zeni on flex that coveted place of honor front and center on the empty cannon bottle shelf that you call your desk it also has to be a great monitor fortunately i took it home for a week and it really is i think i might have fallen in love with ultra white again i mean it's not that it has the best specs it runs at a resolution of 3440 by 1440 while top displays are pushing 4k or more it hits 240 hertz while the best esports displays are flirting with the 500 hertz barrier and it only hit about 700 nits brightness in our testing when we've had displays that can do double that for years but what it is is a complete package from taking it out of the box to firing up your favorite game is an absolute treat do we have a stool by any chance just use this one linus 440. no no no oh my god no i won't tried to stop him jake he said no man does all that ever look good boys and the low resolution is actually kind of an advantage in a way because if you're gonna push 240 hertz like you can't be running at 8k or whatever couple things worth noting it's got a matte covering on the display but because it's oled blacks still look outstanding man the motion is just so good this paired with a high-end gaming rig there's just nothing like it i don't know that this would necessarily be the best you can do for retro games just because it doesn't include any kind of backlight strobing or a black frame insertion but for anything else what the the cops took you out i don't know why wow it took me out really fast you must be some kind of criminal did i mention by the way it's g-sync compatible and freesync premium pro certified with an advertised range of 40 to 240 hertz but it seems to work all the way down to 10 hertz and starts duplicating frames at 50 hertz talk about the driving experience oh yeah right somewhere else and then drive through right right right right right right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll immersed are you you're so immersed that you stopped making the video yeah well that's that's a that's a fair point actually using this thing is just there's no other way to describe it other than it's one of the best gaming experiences that i've had in a long while when i first unpacked it at home i fired up the halo infinite campaign just for testing since i'm supposed to wait to play a co-op with luke and i ended up sitting there in the dark in my garage bench station below zero with like not even gloves on or anything for almost an hour just sitting and experiencing it first thing that stood out about it after the size was absolutely the flexible panel it's not that you're gonna want to switch between completely flat and completely curved multiple times a day or every time you launch a different game it's more about being able to adjust it exactly the way you like it kind of like the seat in your car i mean occasional tweaks from one day to the next might make sense maybe you're in the zone and you'd prefer a more upright posture right now kind of like rgb i see the real value in being able to tailor your setup to your preferences forget about it and completely focus on your game or on your work it's about choice that's what makes it a safer bet than i think any kind of fixed curve display they it flat or curved the thing is most people are buying monitors online these days having never actually sat in front of them and that is a scary proposition when you're spending high-end monitor money i could probably make the decision but i've had the benefit of trying a lot of different displays of different sizes with different curves for most people they might not have any idea if they like just a little curve maybe around 1400 r or if they like a cranked curve you know all the way to 800r it is so dependent on how far away you like your display and how you like to sit i mean if you're lounged back with a controller playing pixel cup soccer you're probably going to want it you know a little more like that right the second thing that stands out pun intended is the unique approach that corsair took to the stand have you ever seen front i o like this on a monitor it does have some drawbacks more on those later but we get not only two usb a ports for mouse and keyboard dongles or thumb drives but a headphone jack and all of our menu navigation in plain sight with easy to read labels some might find this approach kind of ugly especially with the chin bar handle here but it was so refreshing not to have to get intimate with my monitor just to make an osd adjustment or plug in a cable then on the back we get this long strip of ports two hdmi 2.1s displayport 1.4 a usb c dp alt mode input and two more usbas with a type c upstream port to connect the other ports to your pc finally a dc barrel plug it's kind of cluttered i especially would have hoped for an internal power supply with such a large footprint on this thing already but it is so functional that for all of its flaws i just don't see how i could ever want to go back to fumbling with the lock on an upward plugged display port ever again though i might not have a choice there's one important detail that we need to discuss before we move on the waffle shirt from lttstore.com not only looks great but it is super comfortable too oh and also you cannot vase amount this display you see just because the oled panel is flexible doesn't mean that a circuit board is flexible so most of the electronics are actually housed in the stand rather than up in here it's a big part of how they got away with putting all the i o and physical buttons up front the way that they did i personally didn't find the default height of it to be a problem i actually didn't even realize that height adjustment was missing until ploof brought it up in our review of this script you know it's got a little bit of tilt i never thought to change it but someone out there will be sorely again pun intended disappointed and it could be a deal breaker for them another possible deal breaker is the pixel density don't get me wrong any content from movies to gameplay looks amazing on this display and and the lower resolution is actually a key part of how your gpu might actually have any hope of driving this thing at 240 hertz however 83 pixels per inch is a little low by today's standards especially for a monitor that might tempt you in close with such an aggressive curve i mean with a little bit of super sampling you're not going to notice it in a fast-paced game like doom but on the desktop text clarity is not great unless you sit quite a bit farther back requiring a much deeper desk you could get a similar 4k variant of this idea with the lg 42 lx3 qpua but it's 16x9 rather than ultra wide it's smaller it's only 120 hertz and it costs a thousand dollars more than this at regular price and that assumes you can even find one i genuinely don't think they actually made many and you might want to stay away anyway since two out of the five reviews across best buy and amazon mention a defective curve adjustment motor knowing that this is your only choice then for a bendable monitor how good is it we asked our labs team and here's what they sent back it's using an lg wo-led panel so you can expect a beautiful image with inky blacks and 10-bit color depth we've got a delta e average of less than one in srgb mode after adjusting the color temperature we weren't happy about having to adjust the color temperature but we were very happy about being able to do it since many monitors don't allow it and it manages an impressive color gamut reaching 98 of the dc ip3 color space and 75 percent of rec 2020. all of that is great and it seems like the days of having to choose between gaming and content creation are well behind us at this point with that said though it is absolutely a gamer's monitor at 240hz refresh rate it is almost double the speed of nearly every other oled display on the market and thanks to its oled pixels the response times are so fast that you can pretty much kiss any concerns you might have had about motion clarity bye-bye look at this sea of green that we got with the osr tt v2 but we did find some downsides this is the pq eotf in hdr mode that is the display's ability to convert a video signal into the correct brightness value and you can see that it's a little off and what this does is it throws off in-game hdr calibration and hdr color accuracy it's still going to impress everyone but your professional colorist friend but at this price point we can't ignore any flaws and there's an even bigger one as much as i love gaming on this thing and didn't personally find the brightness to be an issue corsair claims that thanks to their use of the latest lg panel technology they should be able to hit 1000 nits in a three percent window in hdr and we just could not get anywhere close to that both of our units we had two of them fell short of 700 nits let alone a thousand nits which along with analysis of the subpixel arrangement seems to suggest test that rather than using lg's top of the line ex panel technology like you might find in their 2022 tvs corsair is actually using something more similar to lg's 2021 models a later firmware update did improve our results netting roughly 200 extra nits of peak brightness but it still fell short it's weird because their testing results are seeing a thousand nits so it could be a calibration issue on their end or our end or it could be down to the panel lottery it's not a huge problem for performance i mean nothing really would prevent corsair from pushing the xenia on flex to that rated thousand nits even if it doesn't have an ex panel but if it's using the older panel type which is less efficient that could affect the longevity of the pixels which as you know is a major concern for any oled type display corsair has taken steps to address this through the inclusion of pixel shift and pixel cleaner routines and they're backing the xenia on flex with a three year warranty but if my personal experience is anything to go by i would definitely recommend a plain black desktop wallpaper with hidden icons and an auto hide taskbar with that said if you see anything like this don't freak out we noticed uniformity anomalies at between 10 and 30 gray on both of our units but we found that it wasn't distracting in real day-to-day use and it could be easily remedied by burning in the display for a while i've got high hopes that some of our other concerns will go away in time as well one of corsair's biggest advantages compared to even some other high-end displays is that they've designed the xeni on flex with user upgradable firmware i mean i guess you might need that for the iq rgb software integration that they're planning for next year sounds cool they won't be able to fix everything with firmware though the 24 gigabit per second hdmi 2.1 ports mean that you'll probably always be stuck with lower color depth on the ps5 and you're going to get some fringing on high contrast text borders until microsoft fixes clear type with support for this subpixel arrangement but if your primary concern is pc gaming i doubt that these or any of the xenon flex's other flaws are going to stand in your way it's far more likely to be your so when they see how much it costs at least you can give them comfort when they know that it doesn't cost as much as our sponsor paid for this segway too thanks to
