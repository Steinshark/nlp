i've invented a card trick i've made up a card trick of my own it's a work in progress so we'll see how it goes i've made a prediction and my prediction is going to be guarded by the jack of hearts look who it is yes the james of hearts so this card trick involves the ace two three four five six seven eight nine ten of spades brady you're my volunteer for this i would ask you to shuffle this up so it's all fair but yeah you happy to shuffle yeah i'll do one of these ones vegas vegas style are you happy that that pack was shuffled brady yes excellent i'm gonna try and make it even more happy that you've got completely free choice i'm just going to give you some choices as we go along right we're going to deal this out so we have five cards each so i'm just going to give you some choice do you want the left or the right right i have the right i'll have the left do you want the left or the right right you're having the right again yeah i'll have the left i mean i can even it doesn't matter i can show you do you want the five or the seven five you're having the five i'll have the seven do you want the six or the eight six you're having the six i'll have the eight i mean there's an ace there do you want it yes okay right and i'll take whatever's left okay ten let's see what we've got so we've got five cards each and also i want to arrange them in order so i'm going to ask you to arrange them smallest to largest smallest on the left to the largest on the right i'm doing the same so we've got two sets of five i've got three seven eight nine ten you've got ace two four five and six happy with that great we've made five pairs you're happy with that as well and i'm going to mark the difference with some red cards so let's look at the first pair six and a three well what's the difference between six and a three i'm going to mark it as a three the next pair is a five and a seven well the difference is a two difference between four and eight i'll mark it with a red card as a four and difference between two and nine i'll mark it with a seven and an eight and a ten i'll mark that with a nine and so i've got five red cards now what do they add up to 16 20 25 25. so we have a look at our prediction over here being guarded 25. now did you feel that you had a free choice do you feel that they could have gone in any order did you feel that that could have been any total i felt like when you started turning them over and giving me one to choose and stuff that maybe you were starting to play funny interesting so that was all misdirection actually on my part it actually doesn't matter which way i deal these out to you i'm going to have five cards you have five cards and the answer is always going to be 25. that's going to be fixed that's always going to be true so it's a mathematical effect called prose veloc identity it is a mathematical effect a lot of magic tricks are maths effects dressed up i'm going to make an appeal to any magicians watching this video can you find a way of using this effect that's perhaps better than what i was trying here i'm interested in a more interesting way to dress this up to present this i am going to talk about the effect itself but i would be really interested in finding a lovely way to dress it up as a magic trick but let's look at the effect itself so we had the eight to ten and we were shuffling up it doesn't matter what order they're in and then we were dealing them out five and five and again it really doesn't matter so here's five for you here's five for me and then we were ordering it so we're doing smallest to largest by the way total number of ways we could have arranged these cards then in this magic trick 126. so there's 126 different ways we could have arranged these a set of five instead of five but now we're going to arrange them in order so i'm rearranging my cards and you were doing the same weren't you they were going from smallest to largest left to right from my point of view i've got my cards going smallest to largest and your cards are going largest to smallest in my side they're in ascending order your side they're in descending order and then we were marking the difference nice thing about this trick is we're looking at the differences now you're never going to get three values the same three values or more you can get two values the same so the red cards should be enough to mark out the differences that's that worked out kind of nicely impossible to get three four five the same let's do it again for this trick let's see if we get the same total so i've got five this time i've got a one i've got a four and a seven so that's a difference of three two and a nine a difference of seven and an ace and a ten difference of nine and if we add up these values i've got to be 25 again so why does this work some people watching this might want to go away and try and prove for themselves that this is always 25 that this always works and you're welcome to do that if you want a pointer just to get you going this is the important thing to notice we have these five pairs that we've made each pair contains a big card and a low card what do i mean i mean a big card is greater than five and a low card would be less than or equal to five look this pair is an eight and a three which is a big and a small this pair was a five and a six so this was the big and the small was over here big and a small big small big small and even if one of us had all the big cards it still worked out that way it was still worked out so the first thing we need to show is that's always true let's just ignore the values that i've got here and then let's just imagine this pair they're both less than or equal to five they're both small cards and this argument is going to work for any pair that i pick if those are two small cards automatically i know that's a small card because it's on the left and it was smaller automatically i know those are small cards because it's on the left of this one which are automatically smaller now let's have a look i've got six small cards six small cards which are meant to be less than or equal to five that's impossible that argument will work with any pair and that argument will work with cards that are greater than five if you had a pair that were both big you would have the same problem so that's it that's your proof there every pair will have a big card and a small card great now let's have a look at the next step i mean i don't know what order these pairs are going to be in but let's call them big and small so i've got big card one it's always the big value minus the small value we're always having the positive value being the difference so it's always going to be the big value minus the small value for the five pairs that we made i don't know what they are exactly but it is the effect is adding all the big values together and subtracting all the small values so we're not that far away from the answer then we just rearrange it we know that we add all the big values the big values are six plus seven plus eight plus nine plus ten subtracting those small values minus one minus two minus three minus four minus five and that is twenty-five and so it will always be twenty-five couple of ways to extend this we don't have to use the values one to ten what happens if i use values one to twelve or one to fourteen one to a hundred well it turns out your answer will be fixed as well again it doesn't matter how you arrange the cards how you split it all up we do that process we get the same value what's that value going to be you might want to have a look for yourself but i'm going to tell you what it is do the general example we're going to go one two three these are our cards right and they're going to go up to well there's going to be a card let's call it n and then it's going to go n plus 1 m plus 2 right and we're going to go all the way up to 2n right these are our cards then the whole argument works just the same so this final step here when i add all the big values and subtract all the small values it's going to be exactly the same these are the big values here m plus 1 plus n plus 2 and this will carry on 2n and then we're going to subtract all the small values minus one minus two minus three minus minus n well what's that you can think of it this way m plus one minus one n plus two minus two m plus three minus three each pair would then have a value of n plus n plus n plus n lots of n it's n squared the value will always be n squared in my example n which kind of midpoint was 5 so the answer was 25 5 squared and now the other little twist to this the numbers don't have to be consecutive so my example is one to ten they don't have to be consecutive they could be prime numbers or square numbers or any selection of random integers if you want and the value i don't know what the value is going to be but the value will always be fixed this episode has been brought to you by
