hello everyone and welcome what happens when you run over a large piece of metal in your tesla well that's what we're going to be discussing in this video as well as some of the other service issues and items i've had with this car over the nearly four years that i've owned it now a portion of this video is sponsored by click up there's a link and discount code in the video description we'll get into that later on in the video so what happened well i was driving on the highway i'm in the leftmost lane and i'm passing a semi truck which is on my right to my left is a barricade for the highway divide so in front of me is a car in a metal bucket spits out from under it and i've basically got two options at this point slam on the brakes which didn't seem like a great idea to do on the highway unless you absolutely have to or straddle this metal bucket and hope for the best so that's what i did so the metal bucket passed underneath the car made some loud noises as it worked its way to the back where there was kind of a crack and then it spit out and became a problem for the car behind me so as you can see there's some tears in the front belly pan didn't seem like a huge deal and then there's some long streaks coming down the battery pack so we'll get into that in a second then as it spits out back here that bucket hit this rear suspension and it cracked this rear suspension cover so this is an aerodynamic piece as part of the rear suspension assembly so here is the part that needed to be replaced and so i looked in the tesla parts catalog found the part number and then i found this part brand new on ebay for 60 bucks so one bolt 60 bucks seemed super easy to replace myself however i'm a curious individual and i was really curious you know if someone didn't take the time to do this themselves and jack the car up and replace it and they went to a tesla service center how much would they be charged for this so i reached out to my local service center initially they denied doing anything with it they said that i needed to take it to a collision center and i was like well it seems like it's just one part can you not just replace one part at the service center and so they agreed to take it in and here is my invoice from the service visit and the part cost three dollars and 30 cents and the labor was eight dollars and 25 cents so it was less than twelve dollars to get this thing replaced which was significantly cheaper than i could have even done it on my own which was a bit baffling to me i even asked the service manager about this i was like y'all aren't making any money doing this like why are you doing it and they were like well tesla sets the pricing we just plug in what the service job is and it tells us how much to charge and so that's what it ended up being 11.55 so that was pretty wild to me that it was cheaper to go to a service center than just do it on my own now the other reason i wanted to take this into a service center was to have them look at the battery and just verify that everything was fine you've heard horror stories about batteries and i just wanted to make sure that kind of thing didn't happen to me so you know these things have thick metal protection underneath i don't really think there's a huge reason to be concerned but if something were to happen down the line i wanted to be able to say hey i took it into a service center i had this looked at and y'all said it was all good so they said they found markings underneath the vehicle from the object that caused damage no major damage or anything else noted that require repairing or attention that gives me peace of mind that i don't have to worry about any battery damage alright so the famous words among car enthusiasts while we're in there so tesla looked at a few other things while it was at in the service shop the first one being these upper ball joints on the front control arms they reseal these with urethane apparently some noise can come from these so this is covered under warranty though i had not noticed any noise from mine another item they looked at on both sides of the car behind the rear suspension there's a wire harness connection and if the electrical insulation on those wires gets damaged it can cause a shorten it can actually prevent the car from starting so you can remove several of these little pins that are holding in this fender cover and as you pull this forward you can get access to the wire harness and so if you look behind this cover here you can see the wire connection at the rear and these are the wire insulation that you want to inspect and just make sure none of these were damaged so they did that on both sides and everything looked good all right next we get to the spoiler and this has just been a reoccurring problem for me so i've decided to just take it off and not deal with it so tesla says if i want this thing to stick really well i need to peel back the paint protective film that is on my car and then have it adhere directly to the paint the issue was i was delivered the car without a spoiler even though it was supposed to come with one so when i took delivery of the car i immediately had paint protective film put on it which is the best time to do it and then later they came and installed the carbon fiber spoiler which didn't stick the first time and then came off once they reinstalled it a second time so the thing is with this i mean this spoiler if it doesn't fit exactly perfectly these corners here they're rigid right and so you have to kind of push them in in order to get it to stick with this double-sided tape and then eventually because it's carbon fiber and it's very rigid it just kind of wants to pull itself back and so these corners end up lifting off so i'm going to keep this part it still has the tape on it and if i ever do end up selling this car whoever has it next they can decide whether or not they want to put it on so of the first five service items that tesla looked at on my car the only thing they were charging me for was this part and installing it this thing being comically cheap at three dollars and 30 cents now i mentioned click up at

conditioning smelled terrible so tesla replaced the two cabin air filters and they clean the evaporator and it costs 125 dollars and what i like about this is that they simply charged fifty dollars in parts and it's pretty much gonna cost you fifty dollars in parts whether you do it yourself or you take it into the service center and then it's whether or not you want to spend the 75 bucks to have someone replace it for you and i wouldn't say you know it's necessarily the most difficult task but considering that this is a service item you know that you need to regularly replace i had mine replaced at three years you know it is going to be a bit more difficult than you might assume just for replacing a cabin air filter so it's kind of buried away up in here and there's a screw that's kind of difficult to access but it can be done it's just whether or not you want to spend that 75 dollars again what i like about it is that they're not over charging you on the filters here and so i've gone into car dealerships for different cars that i've had and they've been like hey do you want to replace this dirty cabin air filter we've got right here we can do it for you know sixty dollars for this this part and it's like i can walk over to the parts department and buy that filter from you for fifteen dollars right now so why would i pay you four times that at the same location like that's kind of crazy right so i like that they're not playing games here you know pretty much you're gonna spend 17 on one of these filters whether you're buying it on the internet or whether you're buying it directly from tesla all right so the final thing my steering column was the one real rattle that i had in my car and i was always trying to figure out how can i get rid of this rattle i saw that tesla service centers could actually take care of this so i had them try that out and they put some felt tape on this top trim piece and they charged 82.50 in labor in order to do so now it didn't really fix anything i still had rattles coming from it so what i did is i just put this elastic strap around it which cost three dollars on amazon and i have not had rattles since so unfortunately you know it's not quite slightly but i can't actually see it from my driving position and it's a three dollar fix and i don't have to listen to rattles so i'm happy with it it is a little disappointing that the tesla fix didn't actually work so you know 82.50 not worth spending in my opinion so if i add up everything i have spent on service for the nearly four years that i've owned this tesla model 3 performance it's actually a pretty high number but the majority of that is from hitting a pothole and destroying two wheels so if i take out things that i was the ultimate cause of or service items which were optional really the only thing that had to be done was those cabin air filters being replaced which again was 125 dollars so for 125 dollars to be the total amount necessary to spend on service for this car for four years i think that's pretty dang good now again as i've owned this thing for about four years now i thought it'd be useful to go through some of the best and worst attributes of this vehicle the biggest plus is that this is a genuine sports sedan and it's a good one it's hard to point to a direct competitor from a pricing standpoint it's still in a bit of a league of its own might you have more fun in a well-equipped porsche tycon yeah you probably will but you'll also spend three times as much people say these cars are heavy and they are but people also assume this means these things can't handle a corner and that's simply not true this thing is genuinely a great handling vehicle and that is coming from someone who has owned and enjoyed s2000s and miatas i really like lightweight sports cars and i'm not saying that that's how they feel this thing does not feel like a miata arrest 2000 but it can handle well and it's genuinely fun to drive people also say the acceleration gets old that it's a one-trick car and to me like this is such a silly statement because first of all it's like always useful to have acceleration if you want it slash needed it's like if it's there it's good to have access to it and second of all it's like it doesn't get old to me having good acceleration it's like if i didn't want a car that was silly and fun why would i buy a car that's silly and fun like we buy sports cars because we like doing dumb things like flooring it and so it's like yeah it's still fun if you think that kind of thing is fun i also don't think people fully appreciate just how insanely quick this thing is a more meaningful test rather than 0 to 60 time is a 5 to 60 time with a 5 to 60 you're not using launch control so it's more realistic of like everyday driving a 5 to 60 represents punching the throttle and seeing what happens in combustion cars this means waiting for transmissions to downshift and turbochargers to spool up these sorts of things take time okay take for example the bugatti she runs super sports nearly 1600 horsepower versus this which is at about 500 horsepower they have nearly identical 5 to 60 times in the real world these cars are basically equally quick at legal speeds the tesla's even just slightly quicker than a ferrari 488 or a lamborghini huracan from 5 to 60. these cars shouldn't be in the same conversation but from an acceleration standpoint they are the tesla punches weigh way above its price tag in acceleration that's undeniable it also has plenty of convenient and useful features the navigation is great the voice control works really well sentry mode camp mode the dash cam the phone app the charging experience there's a lot to like truthfully i never planned on owning this car so long i was planning to change it out for a different ev and just try different evs out there but of the current evs around this price tag there's nothing that's convinced me to switch now that's certainly not to say it's perfect there's plenty to be frustrated with i still don't get why so much of the screen has to be wasted by an animation of the car that i'm driving i'd much prefer to be able to full screen the map like you can do in the model s and x the rain sensing wipers are frustrating so all the controls are done through the screen right so that alone is frustrating but if the automatic wipers actually worked well that wouldn't be a huge deal well they don't they don't work great at night they don't work great in really light rain they don't work great in really heavy rain it's honestly hard to think of scenarios where the rain sensing wipers actually work well and when you put the car in reverse and it's raining the wipers go crazy and it's like what are you doing i'm not even looking that direction and i know this isn't an impossible task because i've driven plenty of cars that nail automatic rain sensing wipers other issues with this infotainment screen and system their version of the spotify app is a bit frustrating it doesn't give you all of the options that exist on desktop or mobile the cameras remain a bit glitchy sometimes you just get a black screen when you're backing up i really like that you can have the camera show you your blind spot when changing lanes but they don't always load another frustrating point is that tesla just seems to consistently over promise and under deliver when it comes to range this thing is claimed to have you know 310 miles of range and even when it was brand new that was not the case now i have not noticed much degradation in the battery it still has consistent range as when i bought it you know more than 30 000 miles ago but the range was never anywhere close to 310 i mean realistically you can probably consistently get about 70 percent of that now i don't have full self-driving however i do feel for the people who have spent twelve thousand dollars for full self driving a feature which is arguably deceptively marketed and every year they say it's going to be ready and then every year it's not ready and another year goes by and they say it'll be ready and it's not ready and this cycle just continues and you've spent money for something then you end up switching cars and you can't even transfer that over so it's like all of this money is spent on something that you've been promised and you don't actually get again the best advice is don't pay for something until you're happy with it exactly how it is in that moment now personally i didn't buy this car for it to drive me around i still don't even have basic autopilot it's a fantastic daily driver and probably the most surprising thing to me is that even though this thing is four years old it's still very relevant even stranger that it has so few actual competitive products in the market there's a healthy number of crossovers entering the market from the competition but sports sedans are still rare overall yeah it's just a really good daily driver thank you all so much for watching again there is a link to click up in the video description and you can use the discount code engineering if you have any questions or
