ladies and gentlemen if you are a chess fan then generally most accomplishments in the chess world are by several individuals magnus carlson hikaru nakamura stockfish and cheaters but in today's video i'm going to show you one of the most unbelievable things that i have ever seen in the world of chess it happened a couple of days ago it was a tournament known as the bullet brawl where for several hours in a row for some unknown reason very good chess players play one minute chess on chess.com for hours at that event a grandmaster by the name of nehal sarin an indian young superstar who is very good at speed chess went undefeated in 56 games this dude won 50 games in a row against everybody from'00 to 3300 and 3200 this dude literally won 50 games in a row and at some point he i think it was even 53 wins in three draws that was his streak this is unfathomable along the way he defeated hikaru daniel never did ski and several other absolutely ridiculous players who are rated in the top three top five on shells.com and that is what i'm going to share with you in this video i've never seen something like this this how do you win 50 chess games in a row what how is that even possible i feel like cheaters don't even win 50 chess games in a row this is sensational nihal sarin is ridiculous and if you don't know his name you really should get to know his name because he's he's he's unreal and we're going to start with the big one we're gonna start with the big 3303 do you know how many you would live to really poop your pants if you were ever paired against the 3300 i would put mine for fun like i would i wouldn't even okay anyway my friends i'm going to show you some of these games this is this is the the death lineup i think this is the highest ever rating group of people that i've ever featured in a recap this dude beats some monsters nihal is also from india his flag says tajikistan i don't know why hikaru started with pawn to e4 nehal played g6 he likes to go for the modern and just various fee and keto setups when he plays bullet hikaru does the same knight f3 normal stuff bishop c4 hikaru really really likes the system where he develops like this and applies pressure knight c6 pawn to c3 from hikaru and the development and both sides castle remember this is bullet chess but when these guys play bullet it's not the same as you and me you you and me playing bullet is like you ever played air hockey at the arcade the thing like that that that is that is chaos bishop g4 from nihal that bishop is being put there in order to perish and what he's going to do now is he's going to lock the center very quickly by playing e5 hikaru takes the center with d5 pushes this knight back and slides the bishop out of the way so he can play pawn to c4 and take some space nihal plays h5 h5 is a very interesting move it's not a good move according to stockfish but he's trying to gain space for the future of attack he'd also like to reroute his knight this way and prepare f5 and bishop h6 in his own right hikaru plays c4 knight d7 bishop c2 a5 can i draw your attention to something black has played 13 moves he's played 13 moves in six seconds like this dude has a solid structure against hikaru and he's it's unbelievable how fast he plays every move that move he didn't even lose a second do you understand how fast you have to be to make a move in less than 10 milliseconds so he improves the position of his bishop he trades it and then he moves up the king to cover the dark squares and prepare f5 in the future the thing is you can't rush with f5 if you rush with f5 immediately hikaru will punish you your knight will be removed from defensive e6 and you're going to lose so that's obviously not what nihal does he plays a4 controlling the b-pawn the knight c5 b6 anchoring in his knight nihal has played 20 moves in eight seconds and he's got an equal position against hikaru he's 10 seconds up against hikaru this is ridiculous that pawn on a4 is controlling the queen side so now it can play things like queen b8 he can also play knight c8 knight b6 he can also try to route his knight over here and put his queen over here and hikaru's got a bishop stuck behind pawns thus far the speed at which that nihal is coming out against hikaru is forcing hikaru to make a lot of split-second decisions which are inaccurate which is crazy because hikaru is probably the best bullet player in the world especially in oneplus zero in one plus one like in the speeches championship it's a slightly different story but hikaru is probably the best 1-0 player in the world he did recently win the bullet championship so ponto f4 from hikaru we have captures and now kikaru goes for it it with e5 the longest think that nihal has taken the entire game pawn to g5 that move looks like a blunder because it first of all it just loses this pawn queen h7 is mate queen g5 is almost made nihal stops queen h7 and this in 0.2 seconds 0.2 seconds he spent on that move i know that because it says it on chess.com that's disconnected the queen guards this and he gets a little wedge hikaru marches forward with e6 trying to remove the defense of this and nihal one second response queen f6 safeguards everything hikaru has absolutely no attack these pawns are under fire now and these pawns can't move and this wedge is very far advanced so it can actually be very useful in the end game now hikaru sends the game into an end game nihal has played 27 moves in 15 seconds he's up 11 seconds on the clock still to put this type of pace on hikaru who is probably the fastest player in the world at 1-0 is unbelievable it's just unbelievable rook b8 he brings the king forward he puts the rook on b3 he's still up eight seconds he's completely paralyzed hikaru's position hikara can't move a single pawn can't move any pawn he can move g4 i i suppose you can't really take this but that's just gonna create a weakness so now kikaru and remember hikaru is down a lot of time so he has to play very fast they all plays g4 instantly chops this down continues to suffocate now probably with best play this as a draw by white but with only one person playing for a win here it's the guy playing with the black pieces rook g7 now it's remember it's bullet so at this point you want to maintain that eight to ten second advantage because at some point white's gonna run out of time rookie 8 rook d1 rook d4 hitting the pawns rook d2 there he goes he won a pawn he's still up nine seconds rook b1 rook b3 back rook f3 rook b2 dancing rook g7 king e5 hikaru can't take the pawn on f4 because if he does the king sneaks in and now you're going to lose this pawn you're going to lose c4 and d5 and a2 nehal wins both pawns nihal still has a seven six to seven second time advantage hikaru resigns this man just beat 3 300 rated hikaru and he made it look effortless i really like it's and yes of course the head the head score is in hikaru's favorite probably by a lot but this is ridiculous i mean to do this to the best bullet player in the world yes i understand but this man won 50 games in a row like think about that number 50 games no draws that is so stupid like how is that even possible and it just he beat it he beat this guy too daniel noradinski in 1-0 is easily a top three player in the world magnus daniel hikaru like it's it's those three guys i mean nihal might be tied for third nehal plays b3 all right we have a reverse london from dania we have a very non-committal approach by white he's gonna start pushing these pawns forward at some point pawn c4 there it is a3 now playing this type of weird setup where white plays in a very obscure way but he's able to make a lot of moves very quickly but here's the thing dania makes moves even faster so nihal makes all of these moves and dania is still up on time i mean dania they both have played 15 moves of chess in six and seven seconds respectively it's it doesn't make any sense now the queen comes out of the center of the board dania plays knight d7 nihal immediately starts advancing forward he's got pressure on this diagonal he's got b5 on the way knight b3 rook c1 is going to be pressure on the bnc files queen e7 nihal here sneaks in a capture that doesn't look like what white wanted white obviously wanted b5 no the second he goes here sneaks in because if you play rook a5 i get b7 if the base of your pawn chain falls it's like the base of a of a house the whole thing will collapse window breaks at the top of a house you can fix the window because you threw your chest pieces out of it because you got so mad daniel plays knight c5 defending himself immediately gets defended by nihal pinning the knight dania goes for an end game and his logic is look these pawns are very tough to protect i'm gonna play knight c5 and i'm gonna play rook a5 now immediately takes the open file with his rogdania brings the knight nihal plays rook before rook a5 dania has proven his point he's clearly safeguarded the position now it's just a matter of candy hall apply enough pressure throughout this game to win d4 knight a4 solid e3 santa is rock solid both guys making moves instantly rook a1 we bring the rook back to try to put it over here in the future rookie eight he's also bringing his rook back nehal plays h4 now it's bullet so that's just a hanging pawn nihal already mentally pre-programmed the move h4 here because he just did not expect naridisky to blunder this h4 was played in less than one second rookie eight still giving up b7 by the way still giving up b7 knight b3 now decides i don't want to take on b7 i think you just blundered that though again like it's just it's just a blind spot brook c1 we gotta take the hardest road take take and now we play knight c5 that pawn's gonna fall we're giving up that pawn knight c4 the base of the pawn chain falls and how does it the hardest way possible take take take rook a3 who is also one of the fastest players in the world in 98. poking at that look how strategic and methodical this is the only reason that white has any winning chances in this position is because black's pawns black's pawns if this pawn was here it's a dead draw but because of black structure the pawns are more exploitable and now a very nice idea to completely pry apart the defenses in this position is knight takes c6 taking the pawn anyway because after rook c6 bishop d5 is just easy but it's bullet these guys have to make moves in a second e4 prying apart the defenses bishop takes d5 rook d6 looks nice looks like you succeeded it's a fork look at that he doesn't have to guard the bishop because if you take the bishop here and rookie rook takes d5 96. for a second i thought knight f7 king h7 rook rookie changes the idea which would be very nice that that is the idea if this is here with the bishop if you take the bishop obviously that doesn't work anymore so instead you would go knight e6 king h7 knight f8 it would be discovered attack and so on unfortunately succumbs to the pressure where his king is just in a mating net and now nihal sneaks in continues to apply pressure bleeding the clock of naroditski these pieces are caught in no man's land the night the knight is gonna have to sneak away somewhere check if here wait this dude just beat two guys whose average rating is 3280. that's how we're starting this video he'd be two guys average rating 3280. here's another guy 31.56 i told you this is the biggest star-studded lineup i have ever seen in my life how do you even do this b3 again another game where his opponent plays a reverse london and nihal was getting it done in many many ways by the way look at the setup the exact same setup i'm gonna start playing this setup this setup is ridiculous like how is it so potent you just put your queen on a1 and then you put like you just play on the queen side you try to expand over here you put a knight on e5 whenever you want and somehow you're just in completely normal shape and yes the position is equal my friends look at it's 57 seconds on the clock for white 57 seconds do you know how many moves have been made 13. how do you play 13 chess moves in three seconds can anybody tell me you can't because you're in the comments and i'm over here you're just watching me maybe now you'll comment something but take take take take and just like the last game against nariditski this is what we're gonna do this is what we're gonna do we're just gonna go forward go here b4 take take nihal has made' moves in five seconds how is that even human like who who is this man now feeling the pressure feeling all of this coming boarding plays b5 he tries to stop white from trying to go any more forward the best thing for white to do here would be to play c5 because what that move does is it completely seals off the knight from re-entering the game and if you play knight to c7 trying to get the rook active i'm just gonna go here you have to play defense my second knight will arrive on a5 or d4 the position is virtually like not defendable for black instead of that nihal takes on d5 and he plays knight t4 he goes for the same idea just like in the game against never this key he's gonna try to target these pawns night before knight c6 take take and the rest of the game is going to be spent trying to win this pawn trying to sneak to the back rank and to try to win the five on four cluster end game and nihal still has not dipped below 50 seconds he still has not dip below 50 seconds he made 25 moves in 10 seconds i understand that i'm continuing to talk about this like the amount of moves that he makes every second or every minute it it it just doesn't he puts this pressure on you when this game is moving at this pace and i understand the evaluation is equal it's because his opponent is of an equal caliber player but the pressure is non-stop this was nehal's whole idea get the pawn on b4 knight d5 ponte e4 kicks the night out and there it goes he's just won the pawn but how is he gonna win this end game the pawns are on the same side like if white had a pawn over there and it was a passer and it would you know then i would get it but how are you gonna win this all right h3 you know he's gonna win it dude is up 20 seconds in a 60 second chess game his speed and precision is unlike anything i have ever seen except from guys like hikaru the knight goes to c6 because it's looking to get over here the pawns completely remove these pieces from the game the knight centralizes defending targeting the pawns the rook goes to a5 and he just plays f4 and these pieces just cannot participate in the game the second the knight comes to the party the rook seals off the back rank and now it's just a matter of time nehal plays knight d7 looking for that same checking sequence against nariditski rook a3 king f2 bishop b2 and there it is he is now up 23 seconds on the clock how has he made 40 moves this fast take take it's a deep end game and he's just gonna go f5 there is nothing black can do or e5 and there is nothing black can do pawn takes knight f8 check king h6 to defend this is literally checkmate so instead of that we have take bortnick sacrificing his bishop nihal takes it which apparently is not the best move apparently he had to go here first setting up all of those attacks instead of that you know like a normal human being he takes the bishop this is why the creative defensive play by black also allows him to survive for a little bit longer but he's down 25 seconds he is down nearly half of the a lot of time that you get for the entire game knight f6 knight h5 and whether nehal wins by checkmate or not he's just going to win this game because it's 30 seconds versus seven the speed at which he played was unmatched and you'll notice here rook aid is one of these moves you kind of play rook a8 to hope that your opponent is pre-moving but it's 29 seconds versus six nihal played 55 moves in 30 seconds he played the entire opening to get to his type of setup methodically slowly transformed the game into this pawn structure centralized his knight took like that immediately picked up this pawn corralled this pawn totally restrained these pieces from getting into the game and as black spent his time trying to untangle he marched this pawn forward threatening a fatal blow by the time black could react he had milliseconds on the clock like there was nothing he could do i mean it's just unbelievable and again i remind you he played 56 chess games and he didn't lose a single one he made a few draws against grand masters in 2900s he played speed of light is this person's account public andrew hong okay terrific i did not know that maybe may or may not have known who this is you know just from the rumor mill or whatever but this is andrew hong who's a very strong grandmaster and 29.40 what's his blitz doesn't show me he's like 3 000 blitz knight f3 g6 g3 and nehal did not have to win every game with a slow grind sometimes he just went at him bishop d7 queen's it's gonna happen in a moment he's trying to play queen c8 bishop d7 and go to the h3 square so very nice and we're going to end this video with a game that he played against another 3200 rated player take take queen c8 and he's going to be putting that bishop on h3 and the idea is very simple he wants to play h5 h4 and get his rook into the game i like this sometimes not as well as nihal he definitely plays better than me but this is actually one of the recommendations in my g6 modern course it's this setup where white if white castles in the fianchetto you try to trade off the light squared bishop as fast as possible and you can do this in a variety of different ways so bishop h3 h5 and h4 he doesn't care that he's losing the pawn he's caring more about opening the the file for the rook so if white just goes like this then you know the rook is going to get in and you're not gonna actually lose any pawn and to give up the pawn is a big deal now we have f6 and this game becomes an absolute tactical slugfest bishop takes g2 andrew takes the rook now queen h3 so white is winning however white's got a hanging knight white's got a hanging bishop and white has to play perfectly so nihal is threading at any moment to move and mate if any of this becomes available and angeles bishop h4 nehal takes the knight of course the queen comes to give a check king to d7 and now you actually cannot take this why can you not take this because i just told you that's me the king is just simply abandoned so white can't actually take which means right now he has to stop the bishop from sliding out and he does just that now nihal is in a worse position of course because he sacrificed material and like i said he was looking for a quick knockout punch in some of these games he wasn't just going for a slow positional grind now plays f5 f5 throws a wrench into the position what is it trying to do well the point is you can take my bishop but then i'm gonna go here now my bishop is defending my pawn and i'm re-threatening bishop f3 for example queen h5 can be played then i'm bringing my rook bishop f3 if you go here it's bishop f3 take take and it's still made and my king is safe so the ridiculous move pawn to f5 played in two seconds massively complicates the position because that's now suddenly the idea you could trade queens if you're playing white but after take take my bishop gets out and i got news for you i got a knight and a bishop for the rook you're not winning so the best and only move in the positions to find the stockfish idea g4 and after queen takes queen takes pawn takes you do get the bishop and you do have a winning advantage andrew doesn't see that he does this and now black comes alive bishop takes d5 is winning in one move but nehal does this like a human the rook moves and rather than taking and activating his rook now nihal realizes he missed this chance and that's mate white now has to play f3 nehal just brings his rook to defend his king look at how powerful the black position is it is crisscross applesauce all over the position this bishop just slides back now andrew's like let's trade queen so i don't get mated and nihal doesn't even have to do anything he doesn't have to take the rook he threatens the pawn and now he is threatening to bring the knight around you cannot take because of this and the rook is pinned to the king the knight is going to e5 he takes the knight is on e5 this pawn cluster looks really good but it can't move forward you know what else looks really good that black has a 16 second time advantage the speed and accuracy at which nihal is beating these otherworldly level speed demons is just it's ridiculous and now he's just going to slowly survive the game bleed out the clock fork his opponent his opponent is going to march a bunch of pawns forward but only one guy is going to win the race because after take take you seal off the bishop from the defense of the rook and nihal comfortably wins this game by checkmate while also being up 24 seconds on the clock and allowing his opponent to make a queen for no reason wow and that is not all he also won a game against jasper and not only did he beat jose martinez jose eduardo martinez alcantara i think is his full name there we go jasper is an incredible blitzen bullet player as well and this was a crazy game and not only that nehal beat this man four times he beat a 3200 rated player four times out of those 50 games in a row that he won nihal went for a modern defense very similar that he did against hikaru he traded and then he went for e5 very very standard this is one of the best ways to play this opening and then he likes to trade off this dark squared bishop he does this and then he likes to put his king on g7 like this now jaspam very clear indication that he doesn't respect nehal setup and he's trying to mate him how does nehal handle when a guy tries to checkmate him queen g3 pawn c6 and he's gonna start building up his own attack you know who's also got a big attack jasper f4 look at that every single piece but if you buy the by the way if you have the patience to make it this far in the video you're gonna witness one of the goofiest games of chess you are ever going to see pawn takes knight e5 joss boom's attack looking mighty tasty the knight is about to arrive on e6 there it is jaspin picks up a rook and he does have a winning advantage but black's position is very resilient and notice for the first time potentially in this entire game uh white is playing as fast as black they both have 47 seconds on the clock cb jasmine blunders you can't take because of this but queen e4 trying to hit this and this but suddenly nehal comes back so joss from blunders keeps attacking and we have the following position okay rook h1 nihal continues his attack that stops mate queen c4 you want a queen trade no queen trade nihal takes the pawn here comes the attack new hall takes this pawn rook h8 queen a7 the king goes for a run the rook is lost but black has two knights and three past pawns if the queens are traded and the black king is not going to get mated black is winning black's winning because you can't stop three pass pawns and these knights are a great shield from both sides queenie for check and the black king runs out to f5 to g5 gets covered by the knights here come the pawns the king runs to f4 now for the first time ever in this video nihal is down on time but his knights and his pawns and his queen are creating a massive shield as the king is getting snuck through pawn to d4 pawn to d3 i told you those pawns are getting closer and closer suddenly knight c2 check he has to sacrifice he goes to pick up the pawn but now knight e3 and f4 this is ridiculous the pawn is now stopping away from making it any king f5 king g5 king g4 and the f pawn is coming down the board as well so absurd queenie to check here comes the king it's gonna make it all the way to g3 white has almost no moves but he takes this g5 nihal has six seconds versus nine how is he possibly going to survive this position rook c3 pawn to g4 he loses his queen but the players get into a scramble here and jaspam doesn't quite realize how to stop black black has too many quick pawns check check he's panicking is it gonna be a draw oh my goodness king g1 was saving it and suddenly the king escapes with the pawns with three seconds each on the clock nehal was down six seconds versus nine the king makes it across the board and it's game over because f1 take and the pawn makes it and not only does the pawn make it the pawn becomes a queen and nihal wins this game on time the position all the way back here was just so absurd it was the king running out but this is sometimes the way you have to win and bullet and he did it he survived he was winning positional games tactical games this man won 50 games in a row like some of you haven't even won 50 games he did it in an hour in a row 56 game undefeated streak i don't i don't have nothing else to say just go get out of here
