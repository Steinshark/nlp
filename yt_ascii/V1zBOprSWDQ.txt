in this video i will tell you the four ways that you can make $10,000 a month with coding and i'm not just talking about landing and joba google or something all these four ways actually work for literally anyone no matter your background no matter where you live and they can even work within 6 months of your starting if you do some things right which we'll talk about and i say this from experience because using a combination of these four methods i have personally made multiple tens of thousands of dollars a month in this video i will also give you my recommended step by-step road map it's very simple and that gets you making money fastest but also maximizes your income throughout your career so now let's go through these four parts in increasing order of earnings potential starting with the obvious one the traditional job at a tech company now how lucrative this path is for you depends on one key variable your location so in case you can get a job aka you have a legal work permit in either usa or switzerland this path can get you to 10k a month relatively quickly but even then there's one big problem about this income which we'll talk about later but if not it can take a very long time like i can tell this from experience my first job as a software engineer was in the uk and my starting salary was l335,000 but i wanted to get the 10k month and in the uk unless i go into one of the fan companies it would have literally taken me like 10 years to get there now the upside with getting a job is that it's fast it's usually the best way to get started but the downside is that your earnings are inherently capped but this is absolutely something that can pay you very very very handsomely this is some things you really really need to understand about it which we'll talk about in this next segment so as we know the salaries for tech workers are very high at $158,000 a year in average but to reach these salaries you need to understand the new emerging trends to know what is in demand for example the tech landscape is shifting and traditional tech hubs like the bay area may no longer even offer the best deal so if you want to consistently grow your salary as a software engineer you simply cannot ignore market trend friends like these and to learn about them in more detail i highly recommend all of you download the 2023 state of tech salaries report by today's sponsor hired the rapport gives you all the market insight from the tech industry that derived from real interviews and job offers so they reflect actual hiring demand today some of the more interesting insight i personally gain from the report include that for example in 2023 the top skills that most in demand seem to be python java aws sql and go and importantly going forward as expected people with ai skills in their resume are most competitive when applying for jobs as a remote developer myself i was also really interested to find out about trends around remote work for example how the number of remote positions has evolved over time they also have full breakdowns of which are the highest paid locations today for software engineers when adjusting for cost of living and the results definitely surprised me so i learned a ton from this report myself and i think you should be required reading for any software engineer so i will leave a link down below for you to download it thank you for hired for sponsoring this video and making this report for us so we can all stay ahead of the curve now let's move on but like i said even if you get these higher salaries there's one big problem that you need to be aware of but before we talk about that let's talk about the next path because it also relates to that one and that is freelancing now first of all when i say freelancing i'm not talking about going to upw work or something what i'm talking about is rather than working for a company as an employee you can work for a company as what's called an independent contractor now first of all there's actually a significant downside to this as a contractor you do not have the same security as an employee it's easier for the company to fire you and also your expectations will be slightly higher because as a freelancer you're hired to do a specific job if freelancing has these downsides what do you get in return and why do i recommend it over getting a job well it's two big things first you get much higher pay and especially in europe which is where i'm from i'm talking much higher pay secondly it's easier for you to get location independence and work remotely if even from abroad and that second part is especially important again if you're not based in the us for example but you would like to access us level compensation you can do that much more easily with freelancing because there's less legal restriction for the companies to give you that so as you can see freelancing is sort of like an upgraded version of being an employee you get more pay and more freedom but it is also somewhat harder to get started with so it could be possible that you get started as an employee you work there for 2 years you get some experience and then you trans i into freelancing this is often what i recommend to people both of these first two paths have one massive problem with them and that is that all your income is tied to your time and if your company decides to fire you now suddenly all your income is gone so that is why while these first two parts are the best way to get started earning money i actually recommend every developer to also start developing multiple income sources via pass three and four which we'll talk about now so this next path is something you might not have expected but it's the thing i'm doing right now is content creation while as a software engineer for a company you are using your software engineering your coding skills to create software and create whatever value you can create as a software developer but when you are a content creator like myself and you teach others to become programmers from your experience you are essentially like spawning many developers around the world so if through your content you're teaching more than one person becomes a software engineer you have automatically already created more value than you would have working for a company yourself as a software developer now you can make any kind of content in the tech industry you can make entertainment content you can make tutorials vlogs and then once you have built an audience you have an amazing community of people like i do and when you have this community that trust and like you you can then create products tailored to that audience you can solve the exact problems that your audience has through your paid services as well and once you do this getting to 10k a month is not that hard at all but it just takes that upfront work of developing the skills of creating quality content as well as your coding skills but that is also the downside on top of your coding skills there is an entirely different skill you need to learn which you might not be interested in learning and if not then that is absolutely fine but i think combining coding with content about the coding either as a part-time thing to supplement your income or as a full-time thing is one of the best ways for developers to increase their income massively but there is an even more more powerful way for you to leverage the power of the internet to make even more money as a software engineer and this is the pa that is by far the hardest one to execute but it's still something that i recommend every developer starts doing at least at some point and that is to become an independent software engineer okay so what the hell do i mean by independent software engineer now when most people think about becoming a software engineer or a software developer they only think about being a software developer for a company but the people who realize that that is not the case are often the one making the most money and living the best life let me explain now why do you think that tech companies pay so much money to their employees well it's because the companies themselves make a lot of money so it makes sense they can afford it but the thing with being an employee or even a freelancer is that the company makes a lot more money from you than what they pay you and like there's nothing wrong with this this is just how business works but what this means is that the real money is not in putting all of your hard hours and your knowledge into one company to someone else's company it is in actually owning the software that you build and this is a massive superpower that you have access to as a programmer for example this's this app called magnet that some developer guy somewhere has built up that basically just allows you to tile your windows on your desktop he built it once and now it has hundreds of thousands of users and that guy is almost passively making like millions of dollars from me now sure obviously it's probably more complicated than that there probably stuff that he's doing for it like customer service like but the point is that you have a lot of work up front but you get to profit from that until the end of time basically and it is why right now while i could be earning like 10 15k a month working for a company as a software engineer i'm deciding to put all my coding hours into coding our own stup boxio which by the way is an app that you can use to like manage your tabs files and tools via sidebar to switch your projects with one click download it down below for free if you're interested now if this app fails and no one uses it now technically all this time has been wasted even though i obviously learned a bunch so it's not really wasted but you get the point but if it does work then it opens up the possibility for infinite money with an amazing lifestyle as well because it might not require that much coding hours from me like a few years down the line for example and right now you might feel overwhelmed you might feel like oh how do i know which one to pick and so here is just the exact simplest step-by-step plan for you to not only start making money fast but also maximize your earnings through throughout your career now the first step go get a job now i know i can sometimes talk bad about having a job but in the beginning you should just be focusing on learning and it's the fastest way for you to start making some money while learning i would say once you've worked your job for like a year or two then you can transition into freelancing unless you can get like a really really well-paying job and on the side i would recommend starting to do either content creation or creating your own apps and then once your income from these self employed path which is like the path three and four exceeds or matches your income from either your job or your freelance project then you can go fulltime on the self-employment stuff and now you have so much more freedom to scale your income that is the way i would do it but now regardless of what you do i think every developer should be building their own apps at some point even if they don't make you money you will still win because you will get a portfolio project to help you land a job or a freelance project or you get to make content about the experience of building in that a lot of people are going to value but since you'll be building stuff anyway it makes sense to do a bit of work to learn the difference between building fun side projects and projects that can actually make you money in the future so to learn that difference and how to build projects to actually get really rich from your coding skills i actually made this video right here where i teach you all of this by interviewing my own startup coach and all you really need is to watch this video which i highly recommend you also watch next before you do anything
