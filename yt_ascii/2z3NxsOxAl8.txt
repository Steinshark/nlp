processors have come a really long way over the past few decades but one thing that's remained constant is the fact that they're based on silicon wafers but it turns out we don't have to use silicon substrates in fact if we print transistors on another type of material we could get processors that are not only cheaper but bendable that's right while everyone is talking about foldable phone screens scientists have been working on a flexible arm-based processor printed on plastic but how the heck do you put transistors on plastic and why would we want a flexible cpu anyway so it turns out that we've actually been putting transistors onto materials other than silicon for a long time now specifically i'm talking about oxide thin film transistors better known as tfts these have been used for quite a while in run-of-the-mill lcd screens the idea is that instead of silicon the transistors are printed onto some kind of non-conducting substrate such as glass but even though we've been using this tech for displays for a long time full-fledged cpus are a much more complicated ball game kind of like when you get a double reverse triple outer boundary in the eighth inning and the bendable cpu we're talking about today is notable because not only is it well a full-fledged cpu but it uses an existing architecture that's already been put into tons of devices the arm cortex m0 the new chip is essentially an m0 core plus a small amount of memory on a plastic substrate printed using photo lithography meaning the printing process is similar to how conventional cpus are made which you can learn lots more about up in this video the transistors themselves can be made from indium gallium zinc oxide better known as exo again commonly used in tft displays at a low cost of course since we're talking about cheap production methods you might think that the plastic arm as it's called isn't very computationally powerful and well you'd be right it runs at only 29 kilohertz and is built on an 800 nanometer process which is the same process the original pentiums from 1993 used great year and the thing isn't even very power efficient despite the fact it uses 21 milliwatts of power which seems low it turns out that 99 of that is lost to waste heat so yeah it's slow and inefficient so what's the point we'll tell you right after we thank drop for sponsoring this video their pre-onic keyboard mx kit in collaboration with olk b provides excellent build quality compact form factor and an intuitive layout for those looking for a compact typing experience it features a cnc aluminum case with your choice of five colors a new arm processor for more power output and kaijua hot swap sockets for easy switch swapping buy yours today at the link below so remember how we said the cortex m0 is in a huge number of embedded devices already putting the m0 on flexible plastic means a chip that's complex enough to handle more advanced functions could go into many more products especially in cases where silicon is too expensive or too brittle even though the plastic arms implementation of the m0 is quite slow as we said it should still be around 12 times as powerful as previous integrated circuits based on plastic plastic arm would have enough computational muscle to be connected to environmental sensors and alert users to real-time conditions think about a plastic arm chip inside food packaging that could tell if the food inside was spoiling instead of going by an expiration date or how about a bandage that could keep an eye on how well your cuts are healing is like a little tiny doctor on your finger although we do already have microchips that can accomplish some tasks that plastic arms envisioned for plastic arm could enable them to be deployed in many more environments for much less money but i wouldn't expect to see it in the immediate future as the plastic arm prototype that was just developed can only execute a few hard-coded programs and scientists still need to make the chip more power efficient however as time goes on arm believes we could see chips like these in more than a trillion objects over the course of 10 years hopefully some of them will end up in lottery tickets so i can be disappointed as soon as the drawing happens hey thanks for watching guys like the video dislike the video whether you're a spinach or a human check out our other videos and comment below with video suggestions but don't forget to subscribe and follow
