if you'd seen game and watch was not so popular and that atari had this crash was there any point where you felt you might be wasting your time i do myself yes yes yes any hints for us what's the best strategy i forgot 1971 that's the time when he can get into nintendo what was it like to be in nintendo at that time there's a lot of freedom at the company in the worst case scenario that there's nothing i could do when i got into the nintendo there's a lot of anticipation that i could do something really interesting by being that part of the company what was the size of nintendo when you joined and how did it grow when i joined nintendo there's virtually no one who are specialized in electrical engineering i had one colleague who studied at the university levels for electrical engineering and that's about it i haven't played it recently so during the testing period i would play it like all the time was there a separation between hardware and software okay i know basically we're on the same team so initially the hardware designer also works on like sound design graphic design and even game design yourself and develop games so there's a lot of people who are specializing in electrical engineering but also as a hobby they play guitars or the pianos and all these stuff so those people are available some also into old painting as a hobby okay so during that time even though they're designing hardware but simultaneously some worked on music others work some graphic and then and all together they created game design but then after the business start you know grow everybody needs to focus on specialized functions by expanding business by implementing what is called divisional labor so we could have more product in shorter times so we then eventually hire somebody who specializes in music compositions at the university i will be recruited and also those guys who are specializing art are recruited to our companies back then these days somebody will start with a design program to make something did you literally just start writing on paper how did it start in in back then in japan and in a lot of cases we studied video game developed in america it's got such templates it's the same situation not only nintendo but also like a title sega so they would import atari products from america and while they're doing their business on the side they also study and what they've done the atari has done as a product so one of the most breakthrough back then was a spacing better i developed a title developed by mr nishikado he ended up developing spacing better but before then he studied quite a bit about all these games developed in america and we also studied what the title has done on space invader so after space invader became a huge hit and there was a toy that used electrical calculator to make it as a game and that's how it started so some of them decided or that they started developing space invader type game using electrical calculator having lsi small monitors so that's how nintendo came up with the new gaming watch that uses like a mechanism from electric calculator and then putting lcd monitors do you know so nintendo their first work for the home use game like device is game and watch we also were studying about arcade game because we had an operation that focused on arcade game service and stuff so we knew that is something that we should focus on but then you know we thought it was not possible to create toys that focus on that function because it's just not possible so that's why we first started out with game and watch how does it feel to have that controller in your hand again i remember testing it all the time your list of credits and things that you're involved in is is very impressive how did it feel to be involved in all these things well i'm really so surprised as i look back now that i did a lot of amazing stuff i'm surprised it's good but while i was developing this project i was not completely satisfied because in one time it was too expensive the other time i wanted to do something more but with technical limitation we couldn't do that much so there's a lot of complaint that i had for that project but i now realize it now that if we try to do something interesting with technical limitation then we'll be able to come up with interesting stuff that would attract it's not possible to recreate this kind of jumping action really difficult to recreate towards the end it was really not possible for a while because so so what we did for our perspective was that when atari 2600 came out we imported that device and then played the games with that but then after the analysis after studying the atari 2600 their conclusion was that it was not convincing for kids in japan enough to be able to make it as a marketable product because same time we had another information that the donkey kong that they developed in japan became more popular in america than those in japan at the time the game watch was really popular in japan so there as a corporate their decision was that they don't need to create like a donkey kong stuff because game watch was already popular but then during the time for the video game shakeout took place in america with athali started collapse in 1983 also the game watch was no longer popular during that time by that time we had a prototype which they're working on for the family computer and then with that the fact that the game watch is not selling well as it used to be then there was a command from the top corporate to to sell the family computer as a product but at that time there's no company that could supply lsi which could be used for a family computer it's because a majority of semiconductor company in japan was focusing on developing computer chips for home computer use but then there's one company called rico which are usually creating chips for the office copying machines were able to create the chips that is suitable for the famicom because even though rico had a capability to creating semiconductors lsi the company didn't allow them to put the device into like a copy machine so the team are designing lsi was a bit frustrated at the time so that was time that nintendo couldn't find the company that could create the lsi riko who could come accrete lsi so they're met together and get together we have donkey kong behind you and you've been working on bringing this into the home trying to understand how you go about that so destiny at first the lsi that the semiconductor company that creating ssi was saying it's not possible because it costs a lot of money to do that i know at that time in order to to faithfully recreate what you could do with arcade game version of donkey kong you need like a full lsi to do that right but then the order from the president was to make sure to sell this in the product at the retail price of 15 000 yen at maximum it got screen aside that means we could only use two chips not four so it's just a collaboration deal between a nintendo and an lsi developer that make sure to put maximum amount of graphical and sound capability with donkey kong simultaneously put them into two chips and that was quite challenging for rico as well [music] so it was a challenge for both of us but we just did our best i see your name is down as producer for donkey kong is this because of the famicom version of it maybe yes that's for the family computer version because a look and the graphic design wise it's very similar but then from program perspective the family conversion and arc devices are completely different what tricks did you use to make it work so did the advances in science help with that was it the chips were getting more capable i know so we were able to rectify the graphic chips during that time so that's why even though cpu itself the 606503 we have to put all this maximum graphic capability into this processing model we had a source code for the arcade version of donkey kong so for the arcade version you use a g80 instead of 6502 it's famicoms different cpu so we have to program it from scratch but we have the arcade game right outside so during the porting process we played it as much as possible to be able to faithfully recreate how it is on a family competition it was really hard challenged in such a short time with such a different type of technical capability of the cpus today maybe the game is written in a high level language and then you can port from one to another to another and that was not how this was not at all you have to work on with hardware no operation there's no operation system available then over my shoulder we have a famicom here how does this feel to hold this again it's a toy it's a good toy well i guess i look back i guess it was in fact a very amazing piece of toy the important portion of this device is this place right here the ejection directions this one allows the kids to eject the cartridge pops out if you push it from device perspective that eject button is not necessary but he put it on purpose because it's a toy another thing was that we initially thought that we would just only put one controller because this is a device which allows kids to be in front of tv and then play alone that was the new things about the toy but then around that time there's arcade games which allowed two players to play simultaneously thus we decided to put two controllers one so i think a lot of people are shocked at how faithfully ported this arcade device to the pharmacy especially looking at this jumping sequence of the games you know jump is actions that are done by kids those are this kind of the jumping is action it's not that smooth and kids will realize that but then donkey kong was faithfully able to recreate that jumping action so that's one thing great about this game they know what they're doing right he takes this over one and produces that same a1 so that he can decrypt the message and read it right so alice maybe wants to send another one so she's going to tick this kdf function again she's going to produce a new key and a2 right she's going to send that to bob he's going to tick this receiving function a2 now bob wants to send a message
