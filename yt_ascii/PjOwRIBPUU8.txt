the thing the whole evolution narrative is the most it's just so hilarious because the evolution narrative has to be ends up being teleological they can't avoid it every time they try to make it non-teleological they fail so and so it always ends up having to be teleological and so then it then it becomes non-scientific or immediately it just becomes a kind of a mythological pattern it's like well if it's it's mythological story my mythological story is much better like the creation narrative in genesis accounts way in a better manner for the ontological hierarchy of of your experience of the world than the way that that that evolution talks about reality and it's and you can see like i mean you know when i talked about weinstein it's always the same issue and you you see the same with all the evolutionary theories they're basically saying what evolutionary want evolution really wants you to do is to basically kill and compete and take and and and just get your seed out there get your genes to the next generation but of course we shouldn't do that right it's like okay well where do you get that we shouldn't do that from yeah that's actually what interests me because that's that's a lot closer to what i care about and then maybe you can find that in the genesis story but the other you can't find it anywhere else in your little pattern like in your little world view this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so i have a couple of special guests with me today on grill country i have michael martin who's kind of a regular and a friend of the channel dr michael martin you can find on his own podcast these days regeneration podcasts where he has very interesting guests and a guest who will need no introduction for most of my audience jonathan pajot of the symbolic world that's great it's great to finally meet both of you in person i've had contacts with michael for a long time really at least 10 years i bet exactly i sent in a piece of art for his magazine ones and we met through a common common friend and so it's great to see you in person yeah it was nice well that's great i feel like it for a long time you know yeah that's what it feels like too but we've never actually spoken so yeah that's actually that's very interesting because like when i first started reading michael's books it's like that's immediately it's like oh i need i need to have him talk to pedro at some point somehow this got to happen it's like they've got to talk so here we are so i might do more listening than talking today because i'm excited to hear the two of you talk so i just kind of dive in like one thing that we can like kind of the thing we're going to talk about today is kind of like christian esotericism mysticism that kind of thing and i and we've been doing this series on tonberg's meditation of the tarot on the tarot on grill country michael has has taught the book and read it several times and he's been a guest on some of her episodes and you've started reading it recently too so i thought we could just like maybe dive into that and tell us about what your impressions have been of the book so far i really i think it's wonderful there are obviously a few caveats i was really surprised about the reincarnation bit i was like really that's a little surprising and i know where he gets it i mean obviously he's a capitalist so he gets it from the whole cycle of souls things that's probably where why he's he's he because he a lot of his stuff seems to to refer to to a cap to kabbalah so but besides that i think his cosmic vision is very much aligned with mine and the way that he understands what he calls vertical causality he's also adding some vocabulary for me that i'll be able to use i think in the future because it's definitely connected directly to you know and i think the richness of the book is also that i mean this is what we'll get into later probably in our discussion even with you michael is that i think one of the reasons why i've defecated from kind of christian esotericism and kind of stepped back from it is that i felt like the way that it was presenting itself to me especially in the recent let's say in the last i mean i guess more like at least 100 years has been almost as a challenge to christianity and has been presented almost as something which was which was subversive to christianity and i think that when reading tomber's book i think that he's really trying to reconcile you know the the esoteric traditions in the west with you know real real christianity and and and so i was really appreciative of that yeah in a lot of ways it seems like what he's doing is almost it's almost a plea with esotericists to cooperate with the church it's kind of the tone of like a lot of the book definitely i mean i haven't i've read about maybe a third of the books i i'm not i'm not right we're near from done but for sure everything i'm seeing like i said except for the weird ring connection reincarnation thing everything else i feel is he's really i think that someone would read if someone read that book and then watch my videos they would immediately understand what i'm talking about and probably vice versa like if people watch my videos and then read that book they would they would immediately understand so that's great yeah i think what what tom berg's what i think he's doing it resonates with a lot of people is there's a kind of traditionalism to him it's a kind of not only appreciation but devotion to traditional sacramental forms of christianity and he's right he's a russian writing in french about about western esotericism and it's and it's very different you know i don't know maybe i don't know enough about it but from what i know especially the east and especially in russia the esoteric traditions if you want to call them that there were actually borrowed from the west yeah from yacob burma and even the philadelphian society and people like that and then it then if can we so start with the protestants moved to the russians came back at least part of it came back to the west but but in the west i mean you know part of what i think tom berg's doing par a lot of what he draws on is not what i would even call like kind of a traditional i i can i hesitate to use the word well christian hermeticism the word he uses yeah he he because his christian hermeticism is is grounded more in the 19th century and he went when he quotes all these authors like lfs levy and papa yeah most of his sources seem to be like late yeah like 19th and early 20th century and yeah which are all i mean they're all interesting and pella down in particular it's kind of fascinating to me but tomber i mean i mean so so my doctorate is in 16th and 17th century english or english literature or religious literature where when hermeticism was hermeticism so it's a very different it's very different you know that that strain of hermeticism so when people talk about rosicrucianism or hermeticism and they think it's like being a freemason and like well no no that's how these those those kind of people control you guys though those well the thing is what happened is after the 17th century when there was a kind of a revi revival of that stuff and it was connected to masonry in the'th century 19th century they kind of just borrowed the vernacular and appropriated it and it really doesn't have a lot to do with with this kind of because if you look at like traditional figures from the hermetic period in 17th century england like robert flood and thomas and henry vaughan and jacob they were if you would have we would have talked to them in right now they would have described themselves as kind of traditional christians yeah what they were rejecting was the scientific revolution and its base materialism and which if you can do science without the realm of the spirit they thought that was that was crazy right and so they were they were kind of traditionalists they were kind of you're right there's a way in which it seems like the freemasons they seem to have just they basically just want to aggregate all the esotericism they seemed at least at some moment maybe not so much now but at least in the in the late in the 19th century they seemed to want to just kind of pull everything into their sphere and so started using all this imagery from the different the different esoteric traditions and so that's why i think today people also conflate it all together and because of also the the strangeness of the the so you know the the luciferian hoax of that happened with the mason that all got weirdly kind of brought into modern occultism and then taken up by the satanist basically using the the tech seals host hoax as a as a template for their satanism it's just it's just so all of it just so weird that yeah it's also one of the reasons why i kind of tend to stay away yeah no kidding i would too yeah because it just like it just it's also hard for people to be able to differentiate and i also i often feel like i don't have to like i don't need it you know i i think i feel like i have insane gregory vanessa and insane maximus and in you know a good cosmic understanding of the liturgy it's like i have everything i need and and if i'm going to pull from other sources i can do it once in a while but i tend not to do it too much because if i if i would if i do then people get confused that's my feeling at least i understand it now you ever you ever read the book foucault's pendulum yeah that's a that's a hilarious book yeah it's hilarious i really enjoyed it i thought i read the whole thing as a giant like kind of joke honestly it is it is it's it's set up it's like it's like a 400-page setup to a joke you know because what he does because all the the the so-called occultists you know they they get talked into thinking they're members of a of an occult group they didn't know existed but they're sure they're initiates into it yeah he basically invents an esoteric society society and then he it's basically saying like because it's the idea of the seat because the idea of the secret is what rules a lot of these players then if we create another secret it's it's almost like creating a body to be it's like a little vacuum for which people to kind of step into i mean you have people today like all these people saying they're rules of christians like you've got these rosy crucian churches in africa there was a lot of them oh yeah so called roji christian churches and you have all these and all these people who think they're templars they're the same with the freemasons who think they're templars and stuff a lot of it i feel is is so fantastical that i tend to yeah but go ahead sorry no no you're right i mean they're just appropriating ideas like i don't think there's any substance there yeah but see you know like renegado had i don't know how serious it was but with papua they had the idea of creating a kind of christian esoteric thing using freemasonry the martinism i think it still exists today they're still married today and they're arthur edward wait was another one okay and there's some of those people in the occult revival of the late 19th and early 20th century i mean some of them not everybody but some of them tried to christianize it or or try to yeah wait was a member of the golden dawn at the same time as charles williams yeah and but they both bailed on it right and and so but i but i think you know it's actually because i was puzzling over of this whole phenomenon in anticipation of our talk and thinking about you know now i'm technically an eastern right catholic and jonathan is orthodox so it's pretty much the same thing but there's no tradition like that as far as i know in in those romans and i mean they certainly picked the the russians for instance would pick up on freemasonry and all that stuff after the fact but there's no kind of there's no homegrown version right but i think it i think that the reason why we don't see a homegrown version is that we don't see what we could call the we don't see the split because one of the problems is that there's a there's a problem there's a problem with high theory in the world of esotericism which is that i think that when people start to create explicit systems and try to create things that are very very they're almost like these these that are that are very explicit systems of of causality and higher beings and all this stuff i think that that's one of the issues that happens in western estudiarism there's almost like a split between popular religion that is that becomes more sentimental and more morality based and then you have this thing that splits out and becomes very high-minded and and intellectual and esoteric intellectual yeah but i can find i can find everything in the icon of the last judgment that you could find in any esoteric system that that you could develop you know in the in the say that the layout of a church and the way that it's all set up all it's all there but it's not necessarily it's not necessarily theorized is what the way that i would say it and i don't that makes sense no i it does but the where i was heading pardon me is so i'm preparing for i have to get this lecture in september on pavel florinsky yeah the russian sociologist and priest and murder and so i was reading some of his earlier articles he was only in his early 20s and a phrase that comes up at least twice maybe more in those articles is the salt has lost its savior and he was concerned and he's i think he was already ordained at this point he was concerned that that the the the experience of christianity in russia at the time that for a lot of people the the salt had lost its savor there was no flavor to it and i think what i in the looking around now and i can imagine what drew tomberg for instance community because he grew up in russia or drew people like arthur edward wade or whoever it happens to be toward that stuff is i think lavender is something to say well blavatsky she's kind of yeah she's russian too but she's yeah yeah what's with mention yeah but but my point is is that and in fact if you read the the notes of bulgarkov and florensky and florensky's book the pillar and the what's it called the the big one you know the pillar yeah the girl yeah is that pillar and ground of truth or something yes the pillar and ground of truth is that they were reading a lot of people like rudolph steiner and lead beater they i don't know if they were quote lavonski but they do those other people and or and john portage and jacob burma so they were in they were definitely aware of that stuff and i think the reason being and let's hear what you guys think about this is that like we see right now with a lot of kids who grow up or people even adults who grew up in a christian tradition and somehow the salt loses its savor for them and they and then they whether they're they're drawn to buddhism or something else very exotic or i see a lot of kids being drawn toward neo-paganism for instance and i'm i'm wondering if this is the same kind of thing that florensky was seeing in 1903 and that maybe was was impacting those people in the occult revival of 19th century that's that's a good that's a good theory i think it's an interesting theory and i think it also it's a you could say something like it connects to my own experience which is that for me my my i never stopped being a christian i always really stayed a christian but let's say there was a detour and then a return where it's like i was reading more exotic things and stranger things and then i was able to then look back at you know traditional christianity and and find in it you know the fullness that i that i've been missing but when i did though i also left to the side a lot of the weird stuff that that i might have been interested because i felt like there was something about it which was like i said there's something about it that was deincarnation like that was like too high and so it tended to suck it tended to suck the world towards a a kind of it's a head trip yeah yeah and it and it's not i think it's also because a lot of people i met they would they would tend to use esoteric ideas to relativize existence constantly to constantly relativize forms and so they're constantly criticizing any form and everything as if you know it's all about this high high and it's like einstoff as if it's like as if it's like einstoff will destroy the world it's not supposed to be in the world and so you have to be careful with even with non-dualists you see it all the time when non-dualists are out of control they tend to want it they have this like weird potion inside them to destroy the world and to kind of relativize everything to the point that it that that it actually and so i think that that's why i tend to come back and i think incarnational thinking and that's why like through certain descent hermeticism has something i think possibly to offer and interestingly enough if according to the information that i have like whatever remaining hermeticists that seem to still exist i mean they just do the jesus prayer now like that's the i think that maybe they think that that's all that's really left of what hermeticism and so they get together and they do the jesus prayer and they don't they're not initiating anybody else it's like the doors oh yeah there's no one else coming in they're just gonna die with the with whatever it is that they have let me initiate you i will be your master yeah yeah i have no i had no p i was my my trajectory is kind of very similar to yours and i got to the point i was like no i'm not how about i just bloom where i was planted i'll try that right which i mean it's good and you know sometimes it's good sometimes it's not so good but that's what i what i what i and and this is what had drew me towards sociology you know because i saw in sociology you know this very very much an ecumenical thing right because there's a there there were russians who were who were doing it attracted to it it's a vladimir slovey of bulgakov lorensky virgil but there were also protestants who kind of started it off in modern times jaka burma the philadelphian society thomas and henry vaughn for sure and then a little bit later it hit the west in in the catholic west with louis boye and thomas merton and and people like this right so so to me it seemed what i would the appeal with that was not that it was fit material for some kind of esoteric construct but that it was just very simple in in having the idea that if if if we're in a right relationship with god and creation we're we're in a right relationship that's and that's in sociology is that that's enough for me i don't need i don't need all these elaborate systems and explanations and wheels within wheels to figure it out sorry sorry i'm just going to say it was interesting you mentioned the ecumenical piece because bulgakov was particularly committed to those kind of ecumenical efforts when he was when he was in england he tried to bring his anglican community that he was associated with in communion with the orthodox church so he was deeply committed to that kind of vision so i think to me that the whole you could say that let's say that the the hyper ecumenical part and i it comes from i do see how it is related sociology and that's one of the reasons why maybe i'm i am careful about so i tend to if you listen to my talks you'll notice i talk about the idea of the secret feminine for example like i will use i'm afraid of the explicitation right of the mystery let's say of the feminine into the christian the christian story i'm very scared of that and i feel like those that have gone too far in that they tend to fall into a strange relativization again of of forms and so and they get flaky right and they get they're flaky in this but they move like it's like i'll give you an example very practical example my own my own brother went to a trappist monastery to search for his own vocation spent a month there and met with all these thomas merton like monks and he said every single day he would speak to the his his the supervisor there he would come to talk to him spiritual advisor and all that guy would do was talk about buddhism really that's all he would talk about he said he it's like my own brother was like well what about jesus he's like yeah of course he'd talk about jesus for about two minutes and then he go right back to buddhism and it's like it's that but there's something about that when i notice like i've seen with a lot of the non-dualist and and i'm seeing that with like someone that like i admire david bentley heart very much so but i'm seeing some of that in his even in sometimes i see him almost have a disdain for christianity and disdain for orthodoxy sometimes when he's speaking it's like it's trite you know let's talk about shankara and let's talk about all these other non-dual systems and i'm like i don't know how helpful this is especially in the public in the public discussion and that's what actually that's what bothers me about perennialism and you know and those kinds of traditionalisms which he said well if everybody's right what am i doing this for why am i looking you know because i don't buy it right because that you know i figured for me he's like well the incarnation the crucifixion and the resurrection that's better that's what i need right there and i get it right and that's i'm sticking with that guy right i'm going that's the god i'm going to stick with and you know what i mean no i of course totally agree with you yeah you know and objectively it's the story of christ is unsurmounted like there's nothing that beats that that beats that story so it's like it's well i would say that even the possibility of perennialism being a view that people hold is only because of christ like that's like i don't think that there's no way in a pre-christian era you could have that as a thing that anyone would think yeah well i think paganism a lot of paganism is actually pretty relativistic in that sense you know so the ancient pagans usually would would they had like in the back of their minds a map a cosmic map and then they would map on to the different cultures that they would encounter and so you can read in ancient greek and roman texts like you know oh they worshipped this god those yeah they were right it would map on their gods to the other gods not the romans the gods onto the german gods right and so on yeah and you see the same like i think indian systems like advaita they tend to be quite they tend to be quite relativistic in terms of understanding that this kind of manifests itself everywhere like all the pattern that they believe in is basically in every culture yeah on the other hand i think it is i mean not for everybody i mean it's not everybody's thing but but the study of comparative religion and what's beautiful in other religions is really a worthwhile activity right which is what i don't know about you but that's basically what i was doing after from the age of' till about 28 or so you know so i was just checking it out i mean i like you i never didn't feel like i was a christian you know never not ever you know yeah i tend i tend to really see now like my approach to comparative religion is really a like well i guess i like like what what nate was saying it's really is christ center that is i tend to see everything through the lens of the incarnation and then then i'm able to look at at other traditions without feeling either overwhelmed or threatened or whatever i just see it as glimmers and and manifestations of the the incarnational principle and so so in that sense i don't i never feel like i'm in danger of being overwhelmed by all these other traditions and i also so i feel like i would never participate in like in other religious rituals you know i only participate in christian christian tradition but i can read a sufi poem and i find it beautiful and insightful and extremely connected to to something which i see in the church fathers as well right and it's interesting that you know in in toperg two things he says on this this topic he says you know while who came before me were beggars and thieves right meaning all the religions that came before were beggars and thieves and the other thing is behold i make all things new so how how those different systems we could say and this is what i think tomber is trying to do in his book are and this is what actually hans von balthazar said about solovia is that he that sloviev took all these you know gnostic systems and other things and he ran them through christ as in appear as through a purifying stream right and i think that's part of what tomberg's project is in that book is to to clean it up you know yeah right christianity did that with plato did it with the highness you know and so i think and he's giving people of that esoteric event a way back in i remember when i read the book i said wow in my father's house there are many mansions because what my problem was before that is i thought i had a very limited perception and understanding of what christianity is and i read that book i said wow maybe i didn't give this thing enough credit at the catholic church maybe it didn't give it enough credit maybe i didn't i could i was too busy seeing the version i got in the suburbs of detroit in a in a second-rate catholic school and not what's really there yeah but that's actually one of my arguments for christianity really has been its integrative possibility because one of the things that i see also in that's what i called i don't know what to call it like the esoteric split that happened you know at the renaissance or after a bit after the renaissance is that they're you can see how things how these these elaborate and very intellectual systems kind of move up and then you can notice religion becoming more and more sentimental and moralistic and and less and less understood you could say and so but i think that what christianity ultimately offers is a way all it should be a way all the way through so it's like when you stand in a church and you have this painted system of images right it's connected to a simple person could go in there and be completely touched and and impressed but then you know a metaphysician will walk in and see the map of the universe in the church so i think that that's one of the reasons why i that's one of the reasons why i tend to to to stay within let's say the more traditional the to talk about the church fathers as much as saying i mean truth the church fathers right it's like it's it's it's always the same sign from saying gregory said maximus so you know and they they seem to have had all those intuitions that that that are in the best of the esoteric systems let's say well and that that's and that's what i think you know another we were talking earlier about why people feel sometimes the salt is lost in savor and this is my own experience growing up you know i was kind of just naturally interested in mysticism as i mean i went to catholic school and you know i wanted to know this person talked to jesus or the virgin mary what'd they say what was it like how did that how does that happen and nobody wanted to tell me you know because and i think so what i got instead was you know the catechism or kind of a dry intellectual delivery we had the baltimore catechism it was i think that's turned more people off chris of the catholic church than the sex scandal but but and and so it was for me certainly i mean for a lot of people it was an unincarnated experience of christianity which is which is ironic right because and how how do you return to that and i actually most of my life has been trying to find a way back into the to that incarnated experience of christianity yeah and i mean i see all your just your daily practices of being a farmer and doing that i can see when i when i kind of follow you and see what you're doing i can notice that you're really trying to find that that lived let's say incarnational principle yeah and i don't want to read about it you know what i mean well yeah you know because i think what happened after that split you talked about in the renaissance of the reformation is at least in the west not only did religion become more and more sentimental but on the other half of it it became aridly intellectual yeah you know parts of it may not be active right and and so and it was in fact it was reading in florensky it was he was talking about the russian tradition which is what i love about it is it's both intellectual and anti-rational at the same time you know it's very intuitive or mystical while it's being intellectual which is you know you see that probably in slovey of more than anybody you know who's who who is the model for both yvonne and elijah in the brothers karamazov oh really i didn't know that that's interesting yeah that's it actually it's it's in a book written by his nephew that he meant that yeah because because dostoevsky was good friends with sloviev okay yeah and he based to hit those two brothers on his two sides that's hilarious his intellectual side it is in his deeply intuitive and warm side yeah that's really fascinating so what do you think about like let's say the basic perception that i have which is so let me give you let me give a very practical example about what i'm talking about and so you know especially this is this is interesting because the georgia guidestones were destroyed right just a few weeks ago or whatever last week and so you know according to the the the legend the person who had it built was named christian r.c and so you could say so like in a way it doesn't matter like whether or not this is related to any group that is actually considering themselves rosicrucian it's there is something about the the branding there's something about the fact that normal christians wouldn't refer to the rosy cruciates but right now something like weird anti-human esoteric like kind of occultist type thinking will attribute themselves to the rosy cruciations we can say like it's it's too bad or whatever but there's something about that which i think is is important to understand in terms of this split that i talk about where and and the let's say the accumulation of this esoteric tendency into let's say freemasonry groups or whatever like trying to capture and blavatsky was also was also kind of trying to pull whatever she could from all that stuff and so this is i think so it's like although i could i can for example in rob someone like robert flood i can see let's say the power and the the good intentions that are there and this desire to to keep something magical and and and and wonderful about christianity it's like by the time you get to crowley it's like yeah and all these people are seeing themselves in line with that same that same type of thinking i'm like something's off like something really went off absolutely and i need to i need to not be too associated with whatever that is no you're right and and so my doctorate i did my dissertation one of the chapters is on it's kind in fact the title is the rosicrucian mysticism of thomas and henry vaughan because they were part of that initial 17th century movement but if you and the the original documents of the rose of christians were written by a lutheran pastor and if you read them they're as straightforward christianity as you can get you know it's they were they were just interested in the the rebuilding of society and some people tried to say that they wanted to rebuild society in the scientific way which is not true at all now what's your name francis yates wrote a book the rosicrucian enlightenment i think she she totally misunderstood what was going on it was actually like i said earlier a kind of a traditionalist movement that didn't want to lose that traditional western christian understanding of the relationship the microcosm to the macrocosm about god's presence in the world about the presence of not angels and demons in the world right yeah as is contributing to even weather patterns right which was all thrown out the window with renee descartes and and they were in fact they they they would rip on the cart in their books they didn't like him at all letter trying to be initiated into the room yes he did yes he did they turned him down good choice yeah i would have turned him down too i'm not answering that call but but it's funny because you read that and so when i think of rosicrucianism i automatically think of that stuff yeah which is i mean when you read it you can't see how anybody could interpret it otherwise but then you look at the crowley stuff and the the golden dawn and that came much later and as we said earlier this these appropriations of the term in fact even the idea that the rose cross there and i think it's a good argument that that the rose cross comes from the coat of arms of martin luther which had a cross and a rose on it yeah you know so who could be some people think the rc means roman catholic you know there was a lot of discussion in the 17th century about whether this is actually the jesuits trying to get protestants to come back into the fold yeah jesus you know the jesuits right they were smarter than everybody but but i still i mean yeah so how does it get from there to to what it became in the 19th century it's just or even the'th century it's so strange but i think it's i think we have to we really have to understand it as as is the incarnation it's like we often think of something which becomes decadent as always going too low but it it actually always starts with going too high it's like there's pride pride is the first sin and so there's something about trying and you can see it like in the very rituals of the early occultists and you know the the early magicians and the demonologists there's something very powerful pride in that the very idea of let's say weaponizing or capturing the spiritual entities and inquiring from them or using them for to to manifest their will it's like that is some that is definitely something which i think represents that pride which we then though maybe it you all do it for the good reasons at the beginning right it's like you know we're going to do this to help the world we're going to we're going to capture these demons in order to in order to understand them and then exercise them from society it's like that leads very quickly in my opinion absolutely i agree i totally agree and i and that's what i think well like like in fact in my dissertation the first chapter is on john d who was pr who was doing that precisely and who got played like a game of yahtzee by the by the speaker yeah by these yeah they worked him man and he and he that thing is he was he was a good man i think yeah you know he was like he's a guy who loved his family loved his country was you know doing all the right stuff but as you said his problem was his pride you know i am the one who will bring this to the world and he thought that he was going to recover the language of adam and that would heal all the divisions in christendom you know wrong yeah exactly and of course the spirits talk him and and his assistant to swapping their wives right yeah yeah which is mean you don't get any more mortal soon than that right it doesn't it doesn't get better after that let's just do them all yeah let's just get on it doesn't get better after that it's like but but i think but on the other hand you look at henry vaughn and his and his brother and there's a i mean especially in henry there's such a beautiful practical spirituality in his poetry that's both connected to nature and to god and to scripture i mean it's i remember when i when i so doing a dissertation you have to read everything the person wrote so i was reading oh all this guy wrote and i'm done oh yeah this is basically what i am this is what i am this is my spirituality right here which is very simple it's not complicated and it's not a cult in the least it's very but it's very mystical i would say in in a in a practical mystical way yeah you know just not you know not a pr hopefully not a prideful one but you know what's important god his creation and community right the church would call the community of the church and that i think from you know if you focus on what's important then then you know then you protect yourself hopefully from a little bit of evil yeah well definitely i think i mean i think that that's also so i don't know if you've noticed like there's an interesting moment right now it's it's just interesting because it seems like something got broken i guess in the past 10 years i don't know how to say it something broke and and all of a sudden secular atheists and secular people are now able to perceive principalities and they're able to understand at least what it is that we're even talking about when we use the word angel so it's an interesting moment but it's also in some ways a very dangerous moment and that's something that i sometimes don't emphasize enough especially with the psychedelics a lot of people taking psychedelics and they indiscriminately encounter beings and then they're all excited about whatever it is that they encounter and so i don't know if you've noticed that it seems like there's that we're at a at a like a a moment where magic seems to be seeping back into the world but it's not all positive like it's which is weird because it that's seeping in while at the same time well where everything's becoming disenchanted through the internet right yeah there's this weird polarity going on right but it seems to be like it's almost as if it's almost as if a natural movement of moving so far into darkness that all of a sudden like you know these small lights start to be visible and people start to to see and also this also because because we're noticing i think one of the things that's doing it is actually the internet because the internet is based on attention and it's actually bringing to the fore the function of attention in the way the world lays itself out and so it's like there's not much more there's not like that's what magic is like magic is about that and so if you understand that and so and now people have that experience where they're noticing how there's everything is vying for their attention and that attention is actually creating bodies of of interest and and is actually kind of transforming reality so i think that there's a strange and because it's accelerated online right it's usually these cycles of interest are long and they they don't they don't last like two days or one week or sometimes one day you know this idea of something trending you know and so i think that there's something about that which is making people notice something like the vertical causality that tomburg talks about that is that there's a relationship between yeah that there's raising between like common attention and then things manifesting themselves let's say yeah right agrigore yeah well yeah that's what a lot of us are trying to like yeah talk about and try to help people differentiate the different the different but i'm even even as i'm doing that i'm worried because like i meet people that are like all excited they're like like you talk about these angels i want to meet them like what no no that's not but that's not why we're doing this like we're doing this so that people can see through let's say at least understand this this hierarchy of principality so they can see incarnationally but it's not about like having it try to have encounters with angels it's usually not the good angels they don't they don't want to talk to you that way that's right i used to like tell people very back in the day my students would say i'm gonna mr martin i'm gonna use the ouija board like no no no no no why because because it's like dialing seven numbers and saying can i talk to jesus yeah and the demon says he thinks it's jesus yeah jesus speaking you know what i mean you're asking for trouble because they're smarter than you and they're and they'll like with john d they'll they'll play you like a game of yahtzee they'll just mess you know what i mean they'll just ridicule you and that's one of tom burke actually talks about that how they just they lead people along yeah you're you're special come on and we'll give you all this information which is all just ends up being gobbledygook yeah and you see it like you if you've known like i usually see it a lot of the people that are around me that are interested in kind of new age stuff and get sucked into that then they all have their weird guardian angels and their weird guides and stuff and it's usually never ends well like it just never it doesn't go well never ever oh man so nate so what is it that you want us to talk about besides the thing we talked about already you guys seem to have no problem there are things that you're curious about because i because because because i also wanted this to be there's there's one there's a couple one one thing you said early on i just it's interesting the way thomberg actually approaches the subject of reincarnation because he just says either you've experienced it or you haven't and he doesn't argue he doesn't he doesn't argue for the fact he argues he can't argue right exactly and he doesn't any and he doesn't make any argument for it being a meaningful part of a spiritual system of any kind it's just kind of like and then he and he drops it after that so the way he presents it is weird so i'm wondering what you thought of that and then in letters i don't i don't know if you got into letter six yet but this idea of of of evolution being like on the horizontal plane [music] under the guise of the serpents that was very interesting to me because i can remember when i was raised pentecostal and i can remember when i was going through my catechism when i was converting to catholicism i still like had some misgivings about evolution and i thought and and i made it to my priest about how you really can't if evolution is absolutely true without any qualification there's no resolution to the problem of evil possible because you can't really there's no way of dealing with the physical evil yeah so i thought the way that tom burke talks about evolution as being this groping trial of the serpent offers a way to do that i tend to i like the way that i i presented before and the way i present it now is that i think natural selection is a pattern in the world it's a true pattern and it's a pattern that can help you understand things but i think the narrative evolution is just useless and not interesting and and it doesn't help you do anything like it it's a it's a it's a it's it's it has to be it always ends up having to be represented mythologically despite the scientists pretending that it's not and it's what though because he says he says it's a fact right so it's a fact on the horizontal plane it's a fact but it's a fact only it's a fact only on the horizontal plane and that its guide and that because it's on the horizontal plane it's its origin is the serpent but you know i think part you know thomberg was a man of his time and that was the language that was the language of evolution was which was appropriated by blavatsky and the early steiner also picked up on it and they were speaking in these kinds of terms now it's spiritual evolution right now my friend guido preparato he's kind of he's a blunt and funny guy and he thinks darwin's whole project was was just a project to prove british imperialism you know it was social dark you know what we call a social downwards darwinism now yeah that's what it is see there's survival of the fittest the british are the fittest end of story right so i don't buy i mean personally the i don't know what to think of the evolution narrative i mean i'm sure things do i'm a farmer i know how things work but of course we we have we have a society that believes in evolution but doesn't believe in gender it's a fig i can't figure it out you know what's wrong it's also the the thing the whole evolution narrative is the most it's just so hilarious because the evolution narrative has to be ends up being teleological they can't avoid it every time they try to make it non-teleological they fail so and so it always ends up having to be teleological and so it then it then it becomes non-scientific immediately it just becomes a kind of a mythological pattern it's like well if it's it's mythological story my mythological story is much better like the creation narrative in genesis accounts way in a better manner for the ontological hierarchy of your experience of the world than the way that that that evolution talks about reality and it's and you can see like i mean you know when i talked about weinstein it's always the same issue and you you see the same with all the evolutionary theories they're basically saying what evolutionary want evolution really wants you to do is to basically kill and compete and take and and and just get your seat out there get your jeans to the next generation but of course we shouldn't do that right it's like okay well where do you get that we shouldn't do that from yeah that's actually what interests me because that's that's a lot closer to what i care about and then maybe you can find that in the genesis story but the other you can't find it anywhere else in your little pattern like in your little world view well you know who believes in the evolution story the world economic forum yeah and guess who's at the top of that food chain but you know it's interesting because you think about you mentioned genesis genesis is the opposite of the evolution it's the fall yeah right it goes in the opposite direction yeah i mean it been and you're right but you can you can understand you can you can understand it's it's so much closer to even to the way that evolutionists think of of their their teleological project because there is a hierarchy of being if you read saint ephraim it's it's beautiful like san fran says that he says things like the animals did not come into the garden right and so the animals were would come to the foot of the garden then adam would come down the mountain and he would like encounter them and that's when you name them and everything so there's this sense in which like the the type of ontological hierarchy that they tried to create in their evolutionary system it's it's it's there in the more traditional narrative and it's more it's actually accounts for morality and responsibility and all this stuff that we actually think even now even all these weird environmentalists like super environmentalists they're they they believe in what genesis says like they believe that we're the gardeners and we should take care of creation and that we shouldn't abuse and it's like if you're really like just an evolutionist i don't know if you could really believe any of those things that's what that's what happened with and i think that's explains tom berg's attraction for taylor de chedan right yeah because that's that's evolution taken into catholic theology yeah i haven't gotten there and so maybe i'll definitely have my my beef with him when he gets to the other side there i don't know yet well like i don't know if you read taylor i mean he's a beautiful writer he really is a he writes like a poet yeah and it's beautiful writing and he has a lot of brilliant insights i think the the complete project i don't have to believe agree with with people about everything that they'd say of course you're right i don't like them i'm just i'm just i'm cool with the parts i like you know i don't have to i don't have to be all in yeah no i totally agree with that i actually agree with that that's how i approach pretty much everything i don't it's like i don't have to defend everything that this person that i yeah you know slightly associated with says i don't agree with everything my wife says you know so well what about some guy never met right you're gonna tag me with everything he ever thought or believed yeah definitely definitely don't tell her that she says don't tell them i'm sure she knows i'm just you know she says yes and so i mean like for me i think that the ultimately for me the the solution that i've been trying to to propose has really been the the taking the traditional forms that are there taking the liturgical life that is that has all the potential like i said like even if it's lost it's like if it's lost it's salt it's like it's there it just has to be it has to be kind of re recaptured and relived and so to me that seems like the only really realistic solution and and in it well one of the things that florensky mentioned in there which which kind of added savor to it was those kinds of folk traditions yeah you know that you know are they chris really christian are they kind of christian but yeah let's keep those in there because those those those make christianity a way of life and not something you do on sunday right and try to think you know i say a couple prayers during the day but how do you incorporate that into a lived life right yeah definitely because we people tend to think modern people tend to think more monastically it's like they think that you know living a more kind of embodied christian life would mean to just have you know do the hours or whatever do more more services but i think you're right that there's a there's a more there's an even more embodied way which is if you think of the middle ages and they had all these associations and clubs and people would you know be in the association of this saint and they would have their costumes and they would have all the stuff and they would have you know like all these banners and processions and stuff it's hard for us to even imagine it but i know it's still with my friend andrew gould i remember he said he went to this little village in spain and and he said it was just astounding they had these four hour five hour processions of their statue of the mother of god you know all dressed up and and everybody had these like particular costumes and they would just kind of walk around and and every and he said he was so solemn and it lasted forever but everybody was just completely enthralled by these processions and so yeah it's just hard because we don't in north america it always feels like we're immediate but it always feels like we lost like so much of it that to bring it back is almost idiosyncratic you know yeah i mean and i say that for the orthodox very much it's like it's like people become orthodox and they think they'll immediately become russian or it's like that's not going to happen right you have to find some kind of discussion about how to embody folk folk traditions right so let's say on for us on on theophany like we'll still do like for a traditional french epiphany celebration right we have a cake and we like baking in it yeah we do it and we have like the king of the day and stuff and so like this is not orthodox but it's it's like these are the traditions that we have it's french canadian yeah yeah it's definitely french canadian that's right yeah yeah we do we need to like find ways to connect all this in a way that is that it's going to be messy and organic but it was so already in the focus kind of already the norm orthodoxy though it's a kind of like morph itself somewhat to the culture that that it's expressed in it should hopefully well the greeks have a lot of you know the other thing that like like the the bean cake and you know all that stuff i also think that's a way to to have children this is a way to raise children in a lived experience of christianity you know because they they can they're not gonna you know we all remember being in church is those little kids listening to a sermon i mean not listening to a certain and wondering how long is this gonna take right but that those those festivals of conviviality make it for for children and for growing people too a lived experience and then when people have children they want they want they you can people hunger for that yeah they want an experience of of the world that is that is not only spiritually nourishing but that's nourishes their their souls and their relationship with other people because you can do it by yourself right there's something different when you do in a community yeah which is what a church is supposed to be and i think so i think that's why i mean i've noticed a lot of these orthodox churches take it seriously is to realize how the coffee hour in terms of in terms of a modern church is absolutely essential that you actually you really need to have one or two hours after liturgy or after a service for people to be together because we're not in a village anymore you don't just walk out and then go back your house and then it's your neighbor that was there in church with you so we have to create these spaces where we we can have you know a more informal communion or else it's just gonna it's not going to it's not gonna it's not going to go otherwise it's like punching a clock yeah trick okay yeah going to the g go communion go back home okay bad coffee is important check but we really noticed like we've noticed that at least in my parish it's been it's been one of the because we are seeing our parents grow quite a bit in the last year i think a lot of a lot of parishes are growing because of postcovid people looking for meaning and stuff yeah and we've noticed that that's been one of the keys has been to have like a a place and a time afterwards for people to to sit down and to connect and so then it encourages them to to call each other during the week and to to connect in in in other informal ways so yeah so you're right so we need these more embodied is more embodied practices yeah because liturgy is wonderful but it's it's not it has to kind of seep into all of reality you can't just yeah it's gotta be everywhere yeah nice yeah so i mean how does that play in too i know i know michael you've expressed some disappointment with the way that the church handled kovid i have and how and i mean it seems to me that what you guys are talking about right now and the way the churches kind of handle kobud they're not i think i honestly think like seriously think that covid was a litmus test for a lot of churches and i think that a lot of the churches that that didn't that weren't attentive to what was happening and didn't take into account the the the primacy of communion i think there a lot of them won't get over this i really believe that they just won't survive and i think the opposite is also true the churches that that that you know were a lot of them were cautious at the outset like where you know obviously but then slowly started to realize that okay wait a minute there's something else going on and then started to to emphasize communion over being strict on the rules and everything i think those will thrive and they have thrived well yeah one and i just it was so for me it was so profoundly discouraging to see so many especially in the catholic church when the pope required all employees of the vatican to have the vaccination like okay and then no they backed up they never apologize when they back off it's like oh yeah well we were you know it just it's it becomes they're slaves to policy and and and if you probably saw too there were many churches across north america and australia places who would have signs saying fully vaccinated parishioners may come to confession or to communion right imagine that i mean we had like we because you i don't know if you know what happened here in quebec like it was crazy because oh yeah yeah so we we had the church were close which is the longest time right and then finally they were open with limited people whatever blah blah blah and all this stuff right but then came the moment when they were gonna they were gonna impose the covet vaccine passport on the churches that was to me that was i think with the test and those churches that tried to find solutions to that and not not impose it because the you would have to have a parishioner standing at the door with their phone scanning people as they walked into the church can you imagine no how crazy that is and so it's like i think that and the doors the doors right that's what that was for right when they see the doors of doors it was to keep the you know the spies out look at this yeah so they'll come in here and kill us after we say the creed yeah exactly and so so i think that i've seen like the church some churches did crazy stuff like they had it was minus 30 right it was like right in the we was like in december in january so some churches just had services outside you know people found ways to to get around it or whatever but i think the churches that applied it that is not a lot of hope for those guys i'm sorry to say maybe they'll survive like but i don't think i think it's going to be a serious they're going to have to do it with a lot of like repentance and and return to and and deliberate desire to to to re-enter communion because yeah well and i think we'll also see a kind of church of the catacombs yeah for sure you know under kind of a guerrilla church or underground church or something you know yeah and people love to learn to do like we we we started to learn to do this the the reader services you know because it's like if if we if we depend on the clergy completely then we're we're we're going to be in trouble that was i was up i don't know well you brought a solo viov several times michael and i can't help but think of tale of the antichrist it's not the it's the majority of the church goes along yeah with the antichrist in that story it's just like the three figures that he has representing the you know the protestant the cat the the catholic and the orthodox tradition they're the ones with the courage to stand up but those major the vast majority of the clergy in in all three go yep along join the antichrist well it's not hard to it's not hard to see it now like it's there's there's something wonderful about the moment right now which is that there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of let's say apocalyptic thinking that i didn't totally understand let's say 20 years ago and i'm not saying that this is it like this is the end of the world or whatever but i think that there's a lot of there's a lot of structure that i can now see and not only do i understand but i can see them burgeoning you can kind of see them popping up in the world and it's like okay i understand what is talking about it's a revelation yeah apocalypse in that sense it's it's taking it's tearing the veil open yeah so you can see it what's also like the idea of antichrist itself like the idea of something which is a parasite on christian morality but manifests itself so it's like right the idea for example that we saw like the weaponizing of compassion that we saw during the the colgate like that was like a weird parasite on christianity so you can kind of see like okay i can kind of i mean i'm not saying this is antichrist but i can kind of see the pattern of antichrist how it can manifest itself and how it can also delude people okay how can how it can trick people into believing this is true christianity and tricking is the right word right yeah and you can see like it's you can see like with even with like the you can who would have thought that so for example like it's like in the abortion debate i'm sorry to become politically but like who would have thought that there would be a common moment when someone would be able to say out loud publicly a christian should be pro-abortion it is the christian position to yeah this is the compassionate christian position to have super abortion it's like and you see it now people take that position all the time it's like really it's like who would have thought but then you can see it it's a weaponizing of compassion and and and the weaponizing of the idea that we're in the image of god like all of these christian ideas are being twisted and and contorted to to bring about these strange positions yeah that's all yeah okay guys i'm depressed now that's right i'm sorry okay but i think like i did like i i'm i'm a 50 50 all the time like this is why i think i how i survived got 50 50 all the time because on the one hand i can kind of see i can i like all of a sudden i see these patterns of that are straight up from the book of revelation kind of come come towards me and at the same time i'm also seeing the the the candle like being lit i can see like the next i don't know what to say like i can get a glimmer of the resurrection it's maybe there's another way to say it i can see it like i can actually see it and i can notice you know i had this talk with someone like ian mcgill chris that i think i put up today i had to talk with don hoffman all these like cognitive science type people that are total seculars or even my discussion with john vicki like and then we're using the word angel and demon as if this was a totally normal technical word to use to talk about transparent beings and i was like i can't believe that we're that we've reached this point where a scientist would use that word and not flinch or not feel embarrassed at all about using it so i think so i think we're we're going to be surprised like there's going to be some wonderful surprises and some dark surprises at the same time well i think so too and that's you know and i kind of saw it coming and wrote about it you know because i think you know like you're saying we have the rise of the technocracy or the archons if you want to call them that yeah but you know there is also you know the real possibility to to live the kingdom you know that the kingdom of heaven is within you you know so there's there's a there's a capacity to realize that and i think and if you go back to the early christians there were there were those there were parallel societies there too parallel opposes right there was there was the power structure and there was the kingdom and i don't think we've we've had an enough awareness of the kingdom for the past couple of few generations you know and and i think part of what i think happened if you read world war ii or post world war ii literature when all the intellectuals were like what the heck just what happened you know what i mean they're they're soul-searching and i think that really destroyed a lot of people as far as as religion goes not just christianity you know that the holocaust could happen and you could have that much evil and god didn't intervene right and i think we we have it at a different different manifestation of that kind of evil right now but maybe in a way this is our opportunity to not despair has happened to those people in the 1940s and 50s right are they despaired and it's and it's really easy to despair yeah right well no from listen from listening to my wife i would say that like the the jewish experience in that post holocaust is almost like the opposite though like there was a lot of like a lot of jews who weren't really even religious like they returned to judaism not even out of any real religious commitment just out of the idea that there should be more jews in the world because like both their parents like were basically atheists but they made sure that their children were were raised the knowledge of their faith and and practiced anyway so yeah i mean i think for sure like the the rise of of the the the hasidim is based like in part in like the world war ii and and like the the the return of kind of orthodox judaism or the strength of orthodox judaism does it does seem to be but i think it it's not like i think what it's it's it's the two extremes you could say because also i mean the the the secular jew is is extremely powerful in the world right now as well like you have a lot of that a lot of that very strong so i think i think we're probably going to see something similar in the christian church we're going to see a kind of remnant which will which will consolidate and become you know deliberate and authentic and at the same time we're going to see the world in general become more and more anti-anti-christian and and secular so i think so i mean especially as the church is like here in quebec like the churches are at some point they're going to start to demolish the churches like they have to because they're trying to pas they're trying to to send these things out they're trying to sell them but it's like all these old buildings no one wants to keep up and so at some point we're going to start to see bulldozers like go into these things it's going to be inevitable we see it in europe happening now all the time and so and so i think that that'll have that'll be important like i think it's it's probably good that that happens because it's going to help people see what's going on in ways that might both increase the secularism but also shock some people into saying okay so what what is it then it's like is it more shopping malls is that what we really need or you know is it howler cell towers is that is that going to be like our is that going to be our our holy place is it going to be really really tall cell towers but right yeah let's see sorry michael i feel like i'm really not oh no no no you're not bumming me out no no i agree you know i'm just just you know in fact you know my gosh my whole project is pretty it's a pretty hopeful project right but but knowing you're up against this kind of darkness yeah and which is what what surprised me over the last couple years is how effective the mass formation and propaganda project of the bad guys has been i mean you got to tip your hat it was well orchestrated yep that you could but but and it's a but it's it's it's amazing like here in canada it's amazing it's amazing i mean justin justin you know it's just obviously like a empty like puppet yeah but it doesn't matter like it just doesn't matter it all it all works like at all the whole world is like that right now the whole west well it's amazing how many sophisticated people show for it i mean just fall for it though i mean it's it's it's really it's mind-boggling yeah i mean it's kind of like it kind of proves a little idea that elites are more prone to propaganda oh yeah well no the propaganda's never aimed at you know people with a high school education may always aim propaganda at the middle managers the teachers professors and doctors and people like that who think they're smart you're smart because you believe yes i'm smart and i'm doing this to help others so you're saying it's designed specifically for dumb smart people yeah the midwifes they're the problem they're always a problem yeah gosh wow well it was really great getting to listen to you guys talk i'm glad i'm glad i brought you to have this conversation yeah so you got me to be quiet for the most part which is
