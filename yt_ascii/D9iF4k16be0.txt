well time to eat crow boys i was wrong and you were right the youtube comment section for once in your life give yourselves a big round of applause everybody who's been skeptical of bill gates this whole time i bet you're giving yourself just take a victory lap okay you you get this one these new allegations coming out on bill gates are so crazy and it made me realize that i've been giving this guy a pass for too long based on his philanthropy work which has laundered his reputation and ingratiated himself to a lot of people including myself who kind of saw him as just this lovable grandpa yeah that turned out to be kind of a bunch of a bunch of nonsense as we'll find out in a second here but here's me i said bill gates is cancelled and basically it's a piece defending bill gates and say you guys got him all wrong he's a lovable philanthropist how far how much i have changed in the last six months boys how much i have soured on bill gates let me tell you it's all because of the epstein stuff watching this epstein case come out and watching bill gates repeatedly lie over and over again it made me realize there's not a good piece documenting these lies just lie after lie after lie after lie after lie and because it was what convinced me to take a second look on all billy boy i thought i'd share it with you because you might not be aware of how much bill gates has lied and tried to basically underplay his relationship with epstein arguably the worst person of the 21st century the worst billionaire [laughter] now i'm not making this video saying all the comments saying that he's microchipping people i'm not saying y'all are right but what i am saying is that bill gates he's not a lovable grandpa no actually he was friends with for as long as he possibly could be until the pr just looked too bad for him and then it seems like he he tried to distance himself very poorly and now it's cost him his marriage and it may cost him his entire public reputation and we're going to talk about it right now we know traditionally you hang out with these kinds of people chances are you got sticky fingers somewhere so let's go through the evidence we'll stick to the epstein story because that's what's interesting to me in the latest fallout connected to jeffrey epstein mit is opening an investigation into its ties to the financier and convicted sex offender journal citing several people reporting that one source of concern for melinda a global advocate for women and girls was bill's dealings with convicted sex offender jeffrey epstein he also has one of the largest most established foundations on his own why would they ever set up a charitable trust benefiting jeffrey epstein so let's start this web of lies with the first time it was announced that bill gates may have had something to do with jeffrey epstein what did he say new york times sheds light on the connection between microsoft founder bill gates and the late jeffrey epstein after gates name came up in connection with epstein and mit media lab gates gave a statement to the wall street journal where he insisted he did not have any business relationship or friendship with epstein all right so no no business relationship or friendship you hear that nothing this man's never seen the man never met him but oops it looks like the new york times found an email from bill gates talking about epstein the first time they met which is weird because apparently they had never met before but he apparently praised epstein saying his lifestyle is very different that's one way to put it and kind of intriguing that's really weird although it would not work for me mr gates emailed colleagues in 2011 after their first get together with mr epstein now bear in mind of course it's important to note it was known at this time epstein's misdoings he had already been charged with solicitation of a minor so that's really important this is after the fact gates meets with them so okay what do they do now at this point a spokesperson from bill gates told the times that bill gates regrets ever meeting epstein noting that was an error in judgment to do so and at odds with gates personal values so now we're led to believe that maybe he only met him one time so okay here they make it sound like it was just a one-off meeting a chance meeting a mistake he never did it again right oops once again according to the new york times gates actually met at least three times in the guys manhattan townhouse once staying late into the night does this sound like somebody who's not your friend you know you're hanging out with them all night does this this sound like a just a casual meeting of the meeting of the minds only three times guys only three times well okay so bill gates they go okay maybe we did that maybe we maybe we met with them more than once but hey i never went to florida with him see according to a report from the wall street journal this time we hear from bill gates he says i never look i may have seen him a few times but according to him i met him i didn't have any business relationship or friendship with him i didn't go to new mexico or florida or palm beach or any of that guys but okay he says he's never been to florida right oops in a piece that is actually defending bill gates we find that bill gates has lied once again see according to flight logs gates flew on an aircraft of epstein's once but this was to florida this is the place that he said he's never been ever been to florida actually yes it turns out maybe we did go to florida hey maybe one time florida yes florida yes but what's the new lie oh mr gates apparently who owns his own 40 million dollar jet hadn't been aware that it was mr epstein's plane this man serial serial liar here and he continues to deny and minimize and i don't i don't know this guy never never met him what who this is the stuff that pisses me off and has made me totally rethink this man but that was where the story pretty much lied until this bill and melinda gates marriage kerfuffle as you guys probably know they got divorced very sad we don't celebrate divorce here so that's very sad to see but what has come out of it has been very interesting in the gates epstein relationship because several reports if you've been following about bill gates have come out a lot of them with anonymous sources which a lot of people are uncomfortable with and i'll give you guys my take on that now before we go any further let me just kind of lay where we are with you with relation to the like what's been happening because all this bad pr has been coming out right after the divorce and people are confused why why why now where are these sources coming from well many people including myself suspect the melinda gates pr team of releasing this data or releasing these sources sort of silently there's a lot of kind of good reasons for that i mean usually you s in an acrimonious divorce like this you may see them like both playing pr games like if you go onto twitter right now you'll find hundreds of people talking about melinda gates has the pr team royals think they have what are the odds melinda gates pr team drops new pictures of bill gates and epstein before the end of the month most people are speculating that it's that that divorce team and that's actually why we're seeing these reports come out here's sauger from the rising i think they usually have good takes they also kind of have this theory now this is likely leaked from melinda gates divorce team so take it with a grain of salt yeah it's probably is and i do think that's worth saying that you probably do need to take it with a grain of salt but why do we think this well it's because these news outlets like the wall street journal the daily beast the new york times all of them are running massive bombshell stories with anonymous sources and you wouldn't run stories this big against somebody as powerful as bill gates unless the sources were really good as someone who sort of had to deal with the problem of anonymous sources before i've kind of had to grapple with like how do you vet an anonymous source for your audience and what you find out is you actually sort of have to be more careful with anonymous sources not less careful because if it turns out wrong and it turns out that the anonymous source is lying then it makes you look really bad it makes you look horrible so before doing this reporting my guess is is that these these papers did their due diligence and they found out okay they're from the inside scoop i mean they have the inside story a lot of them are citing it as like people familiar with the matter okay who's familiar with bill and melinda gates marriage who's more familiar than melinda gates or someone a spokeswoman from melinda gates and they're never gonna come out and say it out loud obviously for obvious reasons it's a bad look so instead it's sort of leaked to the presses etc but with that context of where the these sources are coming from and also you should take it with a grain of salt as well as realize that it probably is coming from a source who probably does know what they're talking about let's talk about what they figured out the biggest report comes from the daily beast saying jeffrey epstein gave bill gates advice on how to end toxic marriage sources say there's that sources say again i think it probably should be read melinda says it's just my my opinion purely my speculation there but what's really important about this is once again we find out that we've been lied to again because what after years of saying that they were not friends yes they may have met three times yes they may have you know stayed late we now find out that the billionaire met epstein dozens of times which is many times more than previously reported previously we had like three to five times we were thinking maybe several times now we're hearing that it's dozens these people were friends they were close they hung out i mean this is such a bad look going from no relationship at all now who is he what epstein to to like their buds they go hang out when bill's having a hard time with melinda listen i don't know about that part what we do know is that they probably were really close everything we're seeing come out is saying that they're much closer than admitted and everything we're saying hearing from the bill gates side is just the constant denial but they've been denying everything from the get-go so i don't put much stock in what they're saying and one of the massive bombshells to come out of this is this part right here where gates apparently far from being unaware of epstein's whole problem with the law actually wanted to help him rehabilitate his image in the media following his 2008 guilty plea sounds like a real friend there and discussed epstein becoming involved with the bill and melinda gates foundation to rehab his minor for charge like are you joking me that is such a scumbag move and by the way plays into a lot of explanations for what we've been wondering for a very long time because everyone is naturally wondering when they talk about you know epstein and the gates connection because we were always told well they were just meeting for philanthropy the question was why what is gates you know this billionaire magnate with the most powerful people in the world that he knows what does he need epstein for but now we might think that epstein might have needed gates and gates might have wanted to pay epstein a favor by getting him involved in his philanthropy to rehabilitate his image going back to one of the earliest reports that we saw at the very beginning we kind of can close a loose end here which was why why were they ever involved as an investigative reporter why would gates say oh i had no relationship with him when of course he knows what you the facts are so that's that always sets off red flags for me that's a great question why did bill come repeatedly deny his involvement relationship underplay it because if it had all been truly innocent if he'd only met one time maybe even two times with jeffrey epstein that would be easy to admit to and move on but if there's something more sinister here then all of his denials and repeated you know kind of down playing of their true relationship would make sense now beyond this honestly it just gets into conspiracy land and i don't want to go there i'm interested in giving you the facts where they lie right now and telling you that we've been repeatedly lied to by bill gates and that this grandpa lovable philanthropist image may not be all it was said to be and i wanted to get that to you i can't go any further than that but you can be sure you could be damn sure after being made look like a fool by bill gates because i defended him beforehand and now i'm having to come out and report on this stuff you can be sure that i'd be happy to report on news stories as they come out i will tell you i'll keep you in the loop so if you're interested in this stuff the life of the rich and powerful subscribe smash like hit the bell because when we learn more i'll be the first to tell you about it thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed my maya culpa on bill gates i was wrong the youtube comment section was right and i can hardly believe it thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next [music] one
