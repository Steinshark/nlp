- i spent $50,000 on scratch off tickets. most of the tickets are $30
and some of them are $20. so we ended up with over
2,000 high dollar tickets. the top prize for these
green tickets is $10 million. there's a chance one
of these green tickets could have $10 million on 'em. the top prize for these
orange tickets is $4 million. last time we spent 30 grand
and we only won $20,300. - boo. - so last time we lost almost 10 grand. this time mark my word,
we'll lose 20 grand. just kidding i have a really
good feeling about this. i think honestly, if i'm being realistic, we're gonna win $5 million. - i got the first winner, 40 bucks.
- no prize. - no prize.
- no prize. wait, wait, wait. how many have we done so far? - 10.
- wow. - so we've spent $300 and
so far we've only won 40. - that's a good-
- that is great. great, great odds, yep. - starting out good guys. - good conversion. - hey, $50!
- 50! - i won 50 too! - rub our 50s together, and now it's 100. - no prize.
- 30! - 30.
- why am i not winning? 'cause i'm better than you. big winner.
- wait a minute. i just realized what if we actually, like we spent 50 grand on these tickets, but if we only win like 20? - that would not be very good. - i know. i swear to god if i don't
break even this video, 50,000's so much more than 30,000. - that's how math works.
- yes. higher numbers are more. - who woulda thunk it. - i'm kinda scared now. i went from being super
happy to super scared. - 50!
- oh, dude, read that. whoa! - no way! - so if it's a winner, that
means it's $1,000 or more and we have to manually scratch it. - that happened last time. - yeah, but last time- - it's $1,000.
- oh, so it's not much. - so it was the absolute minimum. - it was only $1,000, but hopefully this one's more than 1,000. guys this could be $10
million, it literally could. 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 500. so $1,000. - yeah we won $1,000, woo! - i wanted 10 million! so far we scratched off $720
worth, and we've won 1,380. so we're like 700 profit. - before we go any further i need to tell you guys about

or 1 million dollars? - thousand! - we've won $1,000. hey, do you guys mind, i'm
trying to be a celebrity. - ethan, please leave that in. - so far we've won $1,000
three separate times. and for clarification,
when this video goes public these will all be cashed
in, so don't try to rob us. so far we've won $10,000
off of scratch off tickets. but remember guys, we
spent five times that. - doesn't the yerm noise kinda make you imagine a little worm? - yerm!
- yerm! - for me, it's like a pokemon. - yerm! - someone figure out what
pokemon the yerm goes well with and tweet me a video of it. - charizard? - yerm. go charizard! - yerm! - yerm. - guys, i'm gonna be really
sad if i lose $20,000. you know how depressing that is? that means i'm gonna lose 30 grand between this video and the last video. chris, what could you buy with 30 grand if we follow suit and lose 20 this video? - i could pay off my car and then have some
money for another fence. - we currently have scratched $17,670 and we have a total
currently of $13,130 made. [music] let it go [music] [music] let it go [music] [music] i am one with the wind and sky [music] - this just in man who wears anime shirts is in fact weird, who would've thought? more shocking stories at
11, the air is breathable. - did you say there's
actually such thing as a now? - 100. - time is just a construct. - jimmy just got 100 and you're not even celebrating. - woo! - all right, update him with your totals. - $15,130, jake, how many do we have? - 769. - didn't sound super confident, but okay. bless you, bless you. - i'm dying. - yerm! yerm! yerm! yerm! - i expect lots of memes with this sound. all right this is the original, yermer. - here, come in the frame. - just pop your head in and yerm for 'em. - hello.
- yerm! - got the viewers, watch this. - can you go like this? yerm!
- this? what was that? [music] somebody once [music] [music] told me the world was gonna roll me [music] - 30. [music] i ain't the sharpest tool in the shed [music] - so far, we've scratched
off $35,000 worth of tickets. this is a stack of 10 grand and we're gonna go get five grand more, and we've earned $24,055. maybe if we torture some
of the losing tickets, these tickets will be afraid to lose. - all right, let's do it.
- let's go. we've been losing a lot, so before we go back to scanning, we wanna scare the rest of
the tickets into winning. and the only way to scare
tickets into winning is by beating up all the losers. power swing. - that's right! to all the scratch off
tickets of the world, you better not be a loser. now we're gonna do this. teach 'em a lesson. this is what happens when you're a negative scratch off ticket. oh. just throw it, throw it. who knew lottery tickets
were so flammable. i mean, look at this. almost, i don't know, it's burning my skin though. let that be a lesson, if you're a scratch off
ticket, you better be a winner, or that's your fate. all right, back to business. jake, what could you buy with $10,000? - a new tv, 75 inch tv. - 75 inch tv.
- mhm. - what else? that's not 10 grand. - ah, you'd be surprised.
- you would? chris, what would you
spend the 10 grand on? - if i had 10 grand, i
would make an entire like entertainment center with like
a nice projector, couches. - yeah?
- all kinds of stuff. - well guess what boys?
- we don't have it. - we lost that 10 grand. your hopes and dreams went down the toilet with these tickets. - we are at 27,065. - yeah boy. - after your next loser, i'mma yeah boy until you win. - so chris, how was your lunch? - i had kale, it was pretty good. never had kale before. - what are you plankton? - you feel any different? - no, just tired from my boat ride. - yeah, it's been a long day, man. how was your lunch? i know i asked her like
three times already. - i had kale, never had kale before. - 1, 2, 3. - all right.
- all right, oh wow. i feel a little different. hey, all right then, all right. this is the last ticket. will this be the $10,000,000 one? - probably yes. - no prize. all right, we are done scanning tickets. $50,000 spent, and these
were all the winners. right here were all the
winners of the $50,000 spent. in total, we made $32,300 off the tickets. which means we have a loss of 17,700. i'm so-
- i'm covered in glitter now. but yeah, that's a pretty big loss. - all right guys, it's
time we play a little game. jake what could you buy with $17,700? that's what we lost today. - i could pay off my car. - you could buy a car. garrett what could you do? - i'd get a new beamer. - you could get two beamers. man, he could be a beamer boy. what could you do? don't do something with
cars like these guys. - yeah, i'm not gonna
do something with cars. i would buy every single cheeseburger i could buy with that amount of money. - that's like 20,000 cheeseburgers. you wanna know what i would buy? - what?
- more scratch off tickets. so there you go guys, we lost $17,700. if this video does well
and you guys liked it, comment down below because
i'll do $100,000 next. and if we do a... my mom's laughing. if we do $100,000, statistically that means
we could lose $35,000. oh, that just heard saying it. - who cares? it's just money, right? - yeah, who cares about money? - we print that every day. - first video was 30
grand spent, 9,000 lost. second video was $50,000
spent, almost $18,000 lost. so if we do $100,000 spent, it means we'll lose like
a lot of money, 36,000. - it seems like there's
like a pattern here. - yeah it does. - and that was a big voice crack. - that was, replay! - there's like a pattern here. - for real though, we'll
probably do one in the future with $100,000, and i bet my left toe, we'll probably win a million
dollars in that video. so if you see that video in your sub box, make sure you click on it, because we've had so much losses that we're guaranteed to win next time. - i'll bet my right toe. - i raise you with my second right toe. - i need my other toe, i
can't live without it, sorry. - all right everyone put your hands here. and on three, we're gonna
say subscribe, right? 'cause this will trick
them into subscribing. - yep.
- okay. - 1, 2, 3. - coconut!
- pizza! - oh.
- something. - yeah.
- yeah. very good, very good. [music] mr beast [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mr beast [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mr beast [music] [music] oh [music]
