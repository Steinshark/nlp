garage with our lamborghini. - you know how we got this lamborghini? - knowledge. - and blinds. lots of blinds. whoa. weird flex, but okay. keep your hands on the car. whoa.
- whoa. - watch, your hands.
- it can do tricks. - no, no. you scared me. no! - you take your hand off. you took your hands off. - no! - yay. you me. - are you kidding me?

- dude, so we were bringing the
car out of the garage and they're putting
the top up and he goes, "move your hand." and i just jerked. - you fell for that? - i got scared. no, he actually put the
top up and i got scared. i thought it was gonna crush my hand and- - oh my god, you could get another hand. - your dad- - he's so mad, he hung up. - we live in a town where they got really
good hospitals, right? - yeah, it was instinct. i'm sorry. - well, you don't have a car anymore 'cause i'm taking yours, man. - oh, really? i'll just walk to work.
- now you're outta luck. you can drive brother bobby's scooter. you're still a good boy. - all right, man. - good luck you two guys. - yep. he said good luck, chris. - bye, chandler's dad. - thanks man. bye.
- see you, brother. - man, not only did 10 million people just watch him move his hand off, but then he just got-
- roasted. - by his dad. - ah, i really can't believe i did that. - all right, it's down to jake and chris. - me and the viking. - come on, man. we're watching gumball. - told you i wasn't gonna be first out. - and it's just you and jake now competing for lambo, what do you have to say? - i'm an instagram girl, hold on. ah. - okay, miss instagram girl. - my daddy bought it for me. - your wife still needs a car, correct? she didn't get one in the last four hours. - she has not got a car
in the last four hours, so she needs one. - so you're not gonna
take that hand off then. - no, this hand is glued to it. - all right.
- i'm butter and that's glue and it's gonna stick to it and stick to you. - the dilemma here is jake also wants a new car and jake's hand still there. your wife needs a car. your self needs a car. don't let yourself down. don't let your wife down. here you go, chris. here's your meal. jake, here are your rations. these will hold you over
to the morning. enjoy. - and we're just sitting
there eating and talking and a fly comes up to his face and he just goes, whoosh, and that camera caught it. - dude, i go to eat food for
five minutes and jake loses. - i'm very upset with
myself at this moment. - jake. - i looked at him and i was like, "jake, you just swatted a fly." - i was eating like this. and like i saw a fly, i was just like, and then i was like. - jake, a lamborghini because of a fly. you lost it. all right, jake paulers, as you can see, no one else is touching the car but chris, which means chris is the winner. chris-
- i'm the winner. - you did not win this lamborghini. you won a lamborghini. - and i'm excited about
that just the same. - all right, take your hand off the car. - my hand is actually really
tight and really dirty. - all right, so we're on the computer looking for used lamborghinis. to be straightforward, we were gonna give chris
a lamborghini from 1999. it was about $23,000. but chris said he wasn't
interested in the car and he wanted to do
something else instead. so what did you wanna do? - so instead of getting the lamborghini, i wanted to take the 20 grand and split it between the
other guys in the video who lost, cause, you know, it's kind of unfair how they lost and we're a family here. we look after you each other. - you could get a 1999
lamborghini worth 20 grand, but instead you just want the 20 grand and you wanna split it with them. - yes. - so you could have 20 grand. - i could.
- but you only want five and you want
the rest of them to get five. - that is correct. there will be no exposed video from me. - ah! well, thank you. - yeah, man.
- now i don't have to pay my employees. everyone comment what you would do if chris randomly gave you five grand. jake, you took a fat l.
- l. - chris has something
he wants to say to you. the winner of the challenge. - we are gonna be splitting it four ways. the other guys don't know yet so. - are you serious? - yeah. it's only fair, man. - is this a joke?
- nah. - it was his decision. i'm not making him.
- really? - yeah dude, it's only fair, bro. you gotta look out for the homies, bro. ah, pick me up. i wanna be picked up. you're so much larger. yay. - but for real, like, this is for real. - yeah. this is for real. - ah, yes. - chris, you're stupid. - i know.
- i'm not a loser. - yeah, you're still a loser, but you're just a slightly richer loser. - you're a loser, but
you're not a poor loser. - you're so sweet.
- yay. - yay.
- all right, let's get the other people, one at a time. - all right, garrett, you know why we called you here? - no. - chris has something
and wants to tell you. you know how you took a fat
l on the lamborghini video? - yeah. - instead of like me getting the lump sum, i'm just gonna split it four ways. me, you, jake, and chandler were all gonna just split it four ways. - oh, that's pretty nice. so how much am i getting? - like 4,500.
- we talking what? 4,500?
- yeah. - are you serious?
- yeah. - can you like jump over this table and gimme a hug? oh!
- it's not- - thank you.
- hey, this is my child. - yeah, it's the night after halloween. he got little. tell 'em, garrett, what are you gonna buy with
the $4,500 you just won? i'm gonna buy a four-wheeler. - a four wheeler.
- no way, that's a good purchase. - chandler, you get lamborghini video. you know how you didn't win? - yeah. - so instead of taking lump sum, big sum of money, we're just gonna split it all four ways. each gonna get like 4,500. - no way. - yeah.
- really? - yeah. - you're so nice. - nah, i'm not. - chance, what you buying with 4,500. - some food right now. - okay. after that food, what are you buying with the $4,490. - my car is really about to blow up. - sounds like chris just hooked you up. - yes, indeed. - ha, i just made you guys hug. - yep, this is great.
