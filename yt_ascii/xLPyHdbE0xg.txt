let's get started with today's presentation so today it's about popular questions about the online job fair which last week i hosted on linkedin an event about this with the presentation and i thought that i do again come back because i had some companies ask me questions and i guess they're not alone with that and so i you know kind of make those answers not available to them quickly want to start with why meeting c plus plus is for you the right way to hire right i have a lot of reach into the community and this is an untapped possibility for you as a company to kind of you know use and i'm happy to work with many companies to bring you more into the reach of the community have you more visible for those folks which are looking for c plus jobs and that's the whole concept that i want to bring those who are looking together with those who have open positions and that's why i organize this online fair what the whole concept is about to you know give interest to both sides and then bring them together and give them a chance to find their jobs and the other side can fill their positions right go anyways i do want to start with a quick word for the candidates because i see it always when i do that there's a lot of candidates go to the page and submit the form right now there is no employers listed on the form which are actually part of the drop fair okay because no one has currently went through the process to to sign up for this and so it is best to wait before shortly before the event and then submit your cv if you can do that and generally submitting during or after the event is best if you go to the event you can just you know submit your cv or resume over the form on the day before the event and have the companies know at your profiles you know and so i'm trying to explain now a lot of things which i have been asked and a lot of that is probably also very very common for me because i'm an organizer so i kind of try to point other things which are too obvious to me to actually mention so i do this much like the first questions like how often do i organize this i do this every quarter that's the plan sometimes it happens that companies can't make a date like a tablet may some companies couldn't make that date but have an interest to organize or you know to be at another event in that quarter and so that's why we had in june another job fair which was the attended then by two companies and so we have now five drop bears and the third quarter of course we didn't have one because we i moved that to the next two weeks and so actually today would have been the job fair right but i moved that to first and first october foreign lounge which has tables as interfaces present the first day is in the afternoon and the second days in the evening for europe i kind of think berlin time zone right or amsterdam and so we're in the central european time zone for those times but candidates are usually you know bothered by that we on both times have often people coming from india to north america so this is kind of to to have and also be better distributed in time zones that we have an evening event where people from north america and south america which we both have by the way have it easier to come to the conference not to the conference but through the event and then the afternoon event and i don't want to host it on the site on the same day because talking three hours to candidates can be very tiring then of course those table concept is new to many people and so i want to explain it the table is where you sit on during the event it's a virtual table and if you if you sit there alone nothing happens you just think why i'm sitting here but if a second person is joining or a third person first person then with the second person you get into table mode and you get to have a video conference with them which lasts an hour and people actually can and will join that ongoing video conferences so if there's a video conference on a table ongoing you still can join it it's not like you know locked by the beginning and as you see those tables were full in the last drop fair and they had eight seats they also exist in a four-seat configuration and a two-seat configuration those seats include the folks you send to the con to to the event right which is like one of the questions i got how many recruiters can resend i do not limit you on that part okay that is up to you i want to point that out that that is your decision the table size is kind of your limit at the same time because if you send eight recruiters to a table of eight no one is going to join your table right or so if you have four recruiters on a table of eight people might not be able to see that those are all recruiters waiting for a candidate and might think that already candidates have joined the table and might prefer to use their time to talk to a different company which only has two recruiters sitting and is waiting and so it's difficult to answer what i've seen the successful companies do is send a recruiter and a technical engineer which this is very important by the way that you should have someone who knows the open position and knows the hiring side but also somebody that knows something about your code base because people which we attract are well known in c plus they know that their c plus plus and they probably have technical questions about your code base they want to know like what do you write what standard do you use what libraries do you use and i can understand that recruiters usually aren't not totally able to understand or answer those questions so have someone technical with you that is a good concept then on the other hand i have team leads and i do see some companies if you have a bigger hiring team and a bigger technical team which you can allocate for the event then do this in shifts so that one person sits for one or two hours and some people might need to leave for a meeting and that's also why i don't want to limit you artificially and need to you know have you register and a certain amount or a certain way for the event that's not the case which you know i want to point out the cost quickly because i also got the questions about that if you if you attend only one day as a company that costs 499. so that's the price if you attend for two days that's 699 and if you cannot make it with recruiters and your folk to the conference and just want to be listed that's also 499 for companies okay for for candidates that's free i want to point that out is that you don't have to pay as a candidate and also prices are exclusive but which i want to point out and to to reach this and in germany i i have to add much to this price so you would have have to add 90 on your head for that if you're from germany if you're from eu reverse charge applies and if neither that applies then just that is what the price is right but that's just a standard thing from invoice english probably the person which fills up the phone is used to and then i have the question like if there's any additional cost coming towards you there's any footnotes anything which is hidden in small print and i want to say no to that i'm honest and i'm important because to me because i'm looking for companies to work with in the long run and so there is no way that i charge you for additional recruiters coming to the event or you know i need to switch someone i don't do that the same thing as receiving you resumes i'm mating them to the address you gave me in the form and this is included and from then up it's practically up to you what you do right i hope you contact the candidates it'd be nice but i also understand that understand that some companies receiving like 30 or 40 candidates is a bit too much for them and so they only prefer to contact the candidates which they're interested in and i can't really influence you on that point so again that's up to you of course i want to also kind of tell you where to book there's the link to find on the website this is a booking form it's a two-page form first form asks you after the the name not every company has their company name on the table maybe you're from a different part of your company which has a different name than the part which is paying you know so here you can select what type of table you want what relocation you support for your company and what remote job availability is for your company this will be visible to candidates and then on the second page you give me the link the contact email the email where i sent the receipt the series to there is an optional link to your job or candidate portal that's what some companies have and then there's the option to disable the email notification that i don't send you the series per email all right be very careful with that don't do that because you're probably wondering why you don't get any candidates or why candidates don't show up to your job portal i can't literally like you know make them magically go to your portal i will display the link and that's what i can do for you and then there is a title for your employer description and the employer description itself and i want to point out a few coming back to the event i already do have your logo right and it's already upload on the platform so it will show as it shows there if you're coming for the first time then just have to share your logo with me there and that's also how i get your law and can use your load for promotion for the event i want to point out again then this booking then lists you on the website which is a job fair of course but also the log page and lists you on the cv sharing form and for the last two the listing is for six months from the start of your booking so from the take you book for six months you're on the blog page and the cv sharing form listed which includes like events which happen during this time which this year for example couldn't be the conference for this top fair and also you'd be listed for the job fair which will be in november on the cv sharing form not on the job fair page because that you would have to book again and then you again would be for half a year on on there okay this is the candidate view for the sharing form where they shared their results they have to select from the continent they are on or where they are currently based their availability and relocation and remote work the various skills they have on c plus which are interesting to you as an employer which they think you should know and then they also give an indication in which fields they have worked and which fields they have experience with which you know creates a light profile together with the years of experience to give you an overview on the candidate on the first glance and on the same on the next page they get to upload their cv and then they choose or so they can be the companies are chosen by the candidate right that's what the next thing what they do so and then they add a letter maybe not every candidate does that but maybe they had a letter to you and then they sent the form and the next thing then is that i you know check this manually and hit the link to forward the resumes per email to you another popular question has been like how many candidates do you get and i was like ah it depends so for last year and this is like the the four like you know the the 70 and the 80 the the 70 event is last year's september event no that's the first event this is all events which we had since 2020 october so from from left to right it's october 2020 no right well the last one is an no wait that's that's true october 2020 is not on this form but the first two on this form are 2021 and then we get into september 2021 which is the one where we had 80 and then the november event then the first event and this year and then the two events which were in the same quarter in this year so when we have two events in the same quarter which are back to back and only have a few companies attend we don't have as many candidates coming but this again attending companies have a huge influence of which part of the audience shows up yes i can you know advertise this and i can only advertise it if you sign up early enough because when the doctor happens like this you know that's when people come so it's also like another important point i want to make a sign up early so i can advertise that your company is coming to the event and then there are sponsor tables which include everything you know any responsible sponsor table that's what i talked about mostly now these are listed on the website and the cv sharing form and the job section they give you access to the recruiting tooling which i have and enabled me to advertise the event advertise with your logo and tell people that you are as an employee access for the community and also kind of you know the communication with you then will drive and guide my tooling for the job fair if you have a free table you're listed below the sponsors always you're getting a few for the format that's why this event exists i limit this to two events so if you've been twice on the event with a free table you probably want to become a sponsor anyways and if you don't i'm just gonna say thanks for your attention but i don't want to really you know allow companies to have this freebie forever and the table has half the seats of what the sponsor gets so if we you know have a lot of sponsors and we go down to four seats for sponsors to use the space efficiently free tables are limited to two spots them so you'll be able to talk to one candidate as a free table and that's already all the questions i've seen all the things i wanted to explain about the event this time feel free to reach out to me via email and also the link is language leads to the dot fair page on my page right now if you also can reach over the main page as it's linked in the upper bar and this link also goes to the job fair during the event and it's communicated over social media then so thank you for attention and so if you have any questions in chat as long as i'm live let me the time to ask if you have any questions regarding you know from candidates or recruiters if you want to post something to the chat that'll be the time now there's actually a question let me look are you going to recruit canada actually let me kind of put that oh yes so so are you going to recruit candidates on the same day or is it going is it an ongoing process i i am not a recruiter i you know organizers for companies so these companies share this and then they are able to recruit people so it's not like that there are interviews at the event some companies might do that and ask you to join their interview platform on the same day but generally i advise companies not to do that because that limits your resources to a few candidates and there's a lot more candidates coming to the event some companies are talking for three hours straight to candidates and only bigger companies probably would have some resources to have like also interviewers ready on on site but i think that generally it is on the job fair when you visit the job fair and you said manchester city you will be contacted by the companies if they're interested and they will make up a date where you get the first interview the first test and then the recruiting process starts i also want to point out that meeting c plus plus is then not involved anymore i'm not a recruiting shop and i don't bind like candidates that come through meeting c plus plus to a technical thing which is like you know that's our candidate as long as you don't hire them okay that's not the case it's like i'm just the middleman which you know gives gives the context and then the rest is up to the companies don't want to bother with you know trucking candidates and saying well but if you hire that person you owe me money now or something like that but i don't do that that's just ridiculous i'm not a recruiter and i don't plan on becoming one
