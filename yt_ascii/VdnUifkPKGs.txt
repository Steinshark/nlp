ladies and gentlemen i've got an absolutely shocking piece of news that i'm going to be sharing with you in today's video now some of you who clicked on this might be fans of chess some of you who clicked on this might be fans of elon musk some of you might be fans of both and some of you might be fans of none of those things i well i i don't know why you're here but welcome all the same so elon musk among all the other things that he does i believe is an executive if not a founder or a co-founder of a company called neuralink and neuralink is a brain implant that at the moment is supposed to help people who have some sort of physical or trauma to the brain and in january of 2024 i saw the following headline the headline said neuralink implanted a device in a patient's brain now brain implants or brain kind of supplemental technology has been around we've seen people play pong and other games but this is right now supposed to help people that can't walk can't see these types of things in the future i think neuralink wants to basically boost human capability like it wants to be an enhancer for humanity but i saw this in january and i was like okay that's great i mean that we'll you know we'll we'll we'll see what people can can come up with but march 2024 i saw a video that i think a lot of you have seen of a 29-year-old man by the name of nolan ara from arizona clearly who can now play chess telepathically and so what i'm going to do in this video is i'm going to take you through some of that story and then i found the game i actually found the game and then they post to the game i thought i was like a really cool detective but i'm going to show you the game i'm going to show you a game that this man played telepathically this is insane like this is this is a revelation for the chess world in particular but it's also obviously a revelation for humanity because if we can get people to a place where neurons will start firing again where people might be able to slowly regain capability and functionality in hands in feet in legs like this type of thing in sight i mean who knows what the future holds so i'm i'm i'm cautiously optimistic i think i'm generally an optimistic person you know and and i people have a lot to say about about this type of technology and and so on and so forth but obviously it is absolutely incredible so first things first noland is is like i said 29 years old and in 2016 while i think working at a at a camp i was reading he was involved in a in a freak diving accident and he lost sensation in his body from the neck down and and this has happened to people i mean like this this is a this sometimes these these tragic accidents do happen and brain implants could be the future of regaining people's ability to to live their lives and enjoy some of the things that they did before these things happen and neuralink put out this video and this was this was unbelievable and i want to show it to you this was uploaded a couple of days ago let me just flip the camera on so you can see what nolan's been doing yeah let me come over here do you want to explain a little bit what's going on here yeah so i love playing chess and so this is one of the things that yall have enabled me to do something that i wasn't able to re now watch the cursor as it moves really do much the last few years especially not like this i had to use like a mouth stick and stuff but now it's all it's all being done with my brain if y'all can see the cursor moving around the screen that's that's all me y'all it's pretty cool huh actually can you pause the song just for the audio coming through and that was also done with your brain this man turned the music on and off with his brain he is making chest moves with his brain this is absolutely unbelievable stuff and i you know i i had some other stuff here like you know stroke you know stroke survivors can move their arms with zaps to the spine and so on and my one of my favorite things is that when i make these videos like things are trending in the sidebar and this this is not completely new like there was a streamer that was able to use eeg to translate brain activity into beating bosses and elden ring this is a story that came out you know kevin dickinson march 15 2024 this was a week ago this is incredible stuff and the reason why this is so incredible for chess in particular is because i saw theories that were like if the brain can send signals is there a world in which the outside can come into the brain and that blew my that blew my mind no pun intended yeah just completely wild stuff and like i said when i saw that clip i managed to find the game with the help of of a couple of detectives who shall go nameless to protect people's anonymity but i found the game and then they posted the game then neuralink went on twitter posted the game and said you know is magnus carlson next this is the game this is the game that nolan played telepathically and i'm going to analyze it it was actually a very interesting game nolan's clearly a very strong player 1300 rapid and like i said i mean i'm going to remain cautiously optimistic with some of this stuff and this is not the first type of technology that allows people to play games obviously but yeah we'll see i mean i i envision and i am hopeful for a future where where this type of stuff can help people regain some of the functionality and and and and try to live their lives here we go by the way noland is a principled man i mean you can't escape it neuralink no neuralink you're still going to play a london which is awesome i mean i just love the fact that nolan is like the patented intermediate chess player who is who's playing in london he plays knight f3 his opponent plays e6 benjamin from germany by the way and this is like this is like a vintage london system for those of you that are watching this and you know you don't know hopefully this video made it to the youtube algorithm you know and there's people here that that don't know anything about chess watch the video called how to play chess this is a london opening it's one of the most common ways to play and now black frequently will develop this knight to c6 although in this game benjamin wins c4 and c4 is not the best move because even though it stops white from natural development white can very quickly trade the pawn in general you really don't want to overextend into your opponent's territory if there is a pawn right here but again remember nolan was on camera he was getting interviewed he was a little distracted so he wasn't going to play in the most confrontational manner but b3 is the best move because it clears out some path you know for white's pieces and opens up this wh this and if black plays b5 then white plays a4 and has a sizable advantage because you can't keep defending yourself cuz i will take and then you can't take because i'll take your rook so knight bd2 was the move chosen in the game and then here nolan blundered he he lost the pawn it's not a fatal mistake by any means but i saw this position and i was like no lind sorry that was a terrible pun e4 not a good move obviously because black controls the score twice but it's not it's not terrible you're just going to lose a pawn and the truth is you have a very good chance of winning that pawn back like let's say with the queen or with the bishop black one bishop b7 and here nolan was a man dedicated to the cause he was like i'm not going to push my pawn that would have been the best move right we get the pawn out of the way we shove the knight backwards he plays bishop e2 now black takes basically like what could have happened on the last move black could have taken so we have this in 95 and right around here i think is is when you go to the video you see the two of them playing and and and you see the knight kind of in the center of the board etc so so the knight is on e5 white is a pawn down but the game is still very much you know in full force white is going to try to target these pawns maybe with the queen and then these pawns can be targeted with with the pawns you can play a4 you can play b3 and because you're not you're your pieces are kind of staring at all of these pawns it's going to be a little bit difficult for black to defend fully the best move for black is to play knight d5 the reason for that is that you attack the bishop but more importantly than attacking the bishop you now can get this pawn out of danger right so the pawn is in danger so you could get the pawn out of danger also you can play f5 in some positions so you can move the knight clear out the f pawn and now defend your center but black goes bishop d6 not a bad move nolan cels excellent move and now black plays a move move which is not a good move this is what i always tell a lot of beginners and intermediate players i tell them you really don't want to trade a bishop for a knight unless you can explain why you're doing it you really don't want to do that right now you notice how white gets all of the advantage back right now black is at about a minus point4 half a pawn advantage despite being a full pawn up so black is up one point but only up minus point4 meaning it's point4 in their direction just because well white's position is quite active but now now there's no advantage in fact it would have been even stronger to go pawn takes cu you would have kicked the knight out again and now this pawn controls a lot of space these pawns are kind of just sitting ducks but bishop takes e5 and now black plays knight fd7 and that's not a good move because white can just go here so now black gave up a dark squared bishop leaving white with the only dark squared bishop on the board and now the dark squared bishop is being invited into the position one more thing in this position this trade is not something that you want to do not just because i just explained it to you but if you're trading your dark squ bishop you need to have a good replacement of dark square pawns one two three four five six out of eight pawns are on light squares that means your light squared bishop is your bad bishop it means this bishop is your good bishop and now you don't have a good bishop you have a bunch of pawns you have a bad bishop and no other bishop so bishop takes g7 rook g8 and nolan comes back to e5 a mistake he thought that the only safe space was was e5 because it was protected actually bishop h6 is safer because then the bishop will run back to safety so he should have taken two steps instead he goes here now he's in trouble because now there's here and here which is very very very dangerous very dangerous stuff and if black plays knight e5 here and begins opening things up it could get very bad now e3 looks like it wins on the spot e3 is a discovered attack and it attacks the so this is your knight is hanging this is hanging what do you do do you resign no you actually have a move that stops the more dangerous threat and creates a counterattack bishop f3 it stops the threat on your king it your knight is hanging but the bishop is hanging as well so you stop two threats by creating a threat it's very very instructive if bishop takes you can take with the queen or the knight but the queen is stronger because it attacks the rook and you leave your knight to die but the rook on eight is going to perish anyway thanks stu excuse me dang stuff queen g5 this is what we call a battery a queen and a rook teaming up on a straightaway and there's a thread of checkmate there is also a threat on the bishop look at nolan right here backwards bishop move one thing i want to say that i found unbelievable with the neuralink how fast the input is like that blows my mind first of all i mean just as a layman like who doesn't know anything about science in this type of capacity at least like i know you know i learned the science that i learned in school but it blows my mind you can even stare at something it fires neurons in your brain that control movement and then it moves like that's unbelievable i mean that's it's sci-fi just doesn't even it doesn't even begin to make sense but there's also just the thought of like how is it so fast how is it so fast i mean that that's that that's what really blow how can he just look at boop five seconds even one second like he can make moves in one second how is that possible like what if you reconsider halfway through you're like actually no and then how do you how do you drop the piece on the square like how does the cursor know the difference between this and then actually letting go i it's insane e5 black is trying to attack right black is trying to go here black is trying to go here black is trying to open up the position and the attack is very very very strong the best move for white is actually to strike back that's why it's plus two it's a tough move to play probably unfindable at 1300 you have to allow it on pant you can get captured you got to take with a rook instead of that nolan plays this which is a you know the human move and now f5 right f5 is defending this black is trying to play f4 i mean benjamin is just going for it i mean he is trying to use this battery use this bishop as a battering ram and he's he's very very close to landing a knockout punch now again the best move is f4 if white plays that move black's position kind of falls apart because he runs directly into a right hand and he just gets clipped and that's that nolan here unfortunately panics a little bit and is like wait a minute i'm under a huge attack he's going to trap my bishop i got to save my bishop plays h3 now now black is back to equal if not slightly better the only reason black is not completely winning is because the move f4 is actually a mistake it is a mistake because you have knight takes e4 counterattack on the queen and after bishop takes queen takes you can't save your rook it looks like you're about to get mated but there is no mate pawn takes f2 your queen guards this and also so does your rook and now you're here and now you're there and there and you're getting to the king and you're going to bring your other rook so this whole attack is actually smoking mirrors if you just poke holes in the attack all right if you just poke holes in the attack but moves are only going one way but it wasn't i mean it was really a fascinating question that i had like can this ever be used in for malicious intent and that that absolutely blows my mind like if if can there be a future where chess players like how do you even scan for that you got to use a metal detector on so i wild stuff wild stuff but yeah like i said here nolan panic and he goes here and the incredible thing is in the video later if you watch the neuralink stream he says oh i just blundered checkmate he says oh i'm about to get checkmated now i don't know if he said that when this attack was coming he kind of had a bad sense but he went here and totally blanked on this and now it's made black's attack worked out he played really aggressively and then black went here he went here he played the wrong move because black is 1270 black played literally an entire middle game where he gave up the pawn doubled up with the queen and the rook bulldozed and then didn't play the mate and nolan noticed that and he right away he was like uhoh i gotta you know he's got to stop the mate he can't take this he can't he's got to stop the m you could either go g3 g4 bishop g2 those are the only moves bishop g3 bishop f3 also works but then you get take so he goes here he's like you know what i'm going to sacrifice my really really bad bishop for a moment i'm going to lose a full bishop so black is now winning he was completely winning now he's just much better he gets the bishop he is still crushing and nolan goes here and he can bree the sigh of relief temporarily all right temporarily now again nolan has an excuse black does not nolan of course was getting interviewed while this was going on absolutely you know he is he he i i i allow the mistakes to happen black does not stop i mean tripled pawns very rare sight in chess e3 opens the door for the bishop the queen could now try to get in or this way and it's it's really really bad news i mean white is on the verge of getting just totally just checkmated absolutely nothing you can do here nolan makes another he plays knight f3 gives up the knight plays knight to f3 the bishop can just take i mean if the bishop comes down it it is two pieces and the attack is roaring it's still not over because somehow white has a cocoon around his king but nolan is creating chaos black plays pawn takes f2 check who wouldn't right pawn takes pawn stripping the king of his of his all his clothes now nolan takes the g now now now black does in fact take the knight and nolan courageously walks the king out onto f3 this is crazy this is this is a wild game and keep in mind that black has not really activated his pieces right like black is kind of on the attack here but if he doesn't hit the pause button at some point and go you know what i got to reset for a moment he might lose and the thing is that 1300 as long as you don't lose lose like as long as you just keep the game going people are 1200 for a reason okay and for my viewers that are below a thousand the same applies for you creating chaos in your games when you are losing this is a chaotic position okay king is here imbalance everywhere tripled pawns if you create chaos in your games when you are losing you have a much higher higher chance of saving or winning the game okay cuz black can decide do i take do i push do i go here do i give a check do i give a check and hang my queen right like what do i do black goes e4 check e4 is a horrendous move and chess is the only sport the only activity where one mistake from a much dominant position much more dominant position can throw everything away and nolan it takes him 20 moves but he's back in the game e4 was designed to get the king to take king and queen on the same line dink and that's not even the best move rook f8 is even more fatal but he he blunders e4 not only is e4 a move that does not have to be taken with the king it can be taken with the queen and now you are punished and now in one move black goes from completely winning to struggling to stay to to stay equal the king has to move queen a8 nolan goes from three points down to three points up he just got six points like that a free pawn and a free rook the only downside to this is the queen is out over there so if there's a way to you know like for example for example this is a way you can get your queen trapped queen's trapped it can't escape and it's being threatened and that's protected right like that is a way that you would lose so in response to queen a8 and realizing that they blundered benjamin plays queen d2 this is insanity both kings are on the verge of knockouts the queen over here is giving at shag the rook is coming down to f8 this is insane the only reason black's not winning is cuz the knight can't make it over here if the knight could make it to e5 it would be over so what is nolan going to do well cool calm collected uses the brain power both to move the piece and also to find the best move and plays king to g2 sid stepping all of these checks smart move he could have played rook takes e2 but that would have been a completely losing move why because even though he is attacking the queen and defended by the king what's worth more than a queen you you're worth more than a queen and also the white king on f3 rook f8 check king moves queen takes so he didn't do that he plays king g2 now white's king is safe and he's going to go g4 as well black plays look look at black by the way benjamin sharp he was ready with the rook going to f8 now what's white going to do well if white continues to be greedy and eat pawns look what happens to the advantage the queen needs to control the diagonal if the queen steps off the diagonal black will very quickly activate and get an advantage so queen d5 very smart move pressuring the king and disallowing movement right controlling the light squares centralizing his queen now benjamin still creating counterplay but there is nowhere he can move he plays this he threatens this and now the most gangster move of the game by nolan this one an absolute cold shower for the black pieces black was trying to get in on f2 he can't get in on the light squares so nolan plays bishop g1 now black can't give a check on f2 black can't give a check on f3 black can't give a check on e4 black's queen has to leave and when the queen leaves we will begin the feast we will start eating all the pawns black plays queen to e2 noland queen takes b5 one pawn down four pawn advantage for white queen is going to take this then we're going to take this then we're going to roar down that e file and deliver a checkmating attack onto black for messing with us queen d3 that's a great move protecting both things now we need to not panic here maybe we bring our rook there's no way so what do we do how do we get over here if i'm playing with white here what i'm going to do is i'm going to come back reset and then figure out a way to go over here nolan plays the top engine move 3 minutes on the clock for the remainder of the game he gives a check this is not an empty check my my advice to beginners is don't just give checks for no reason a lot of people don't know what to do so they just give a check he gives a check because a check in chess is the most forcing move black now must respond to nolan's thread all telepathically by the way but he's doing that to redirect the queen back to e3 the golden rule of chess is if you are up material which he is four points trade off the pieces starting with your opponent's most powerful if you trade the black queen black has nothing which is why he gave him a check to bring the queen quickly back and now there are no more checks now black plays a great move i love knight e4 that's a very tricky move and now if nolan takes the queen that was the whole plan he wanted a queen trade but now if he takes the queen black joins pawns look how much advantage is gone you do not want to allow connected together pawns in your position like this because you will run out of oxygen very fast so nolan plays the best move keeps his nerves rook takes e2 that is the best move now that pawn is gone the thorn in the position is gone and these two attack the knight right lot of pressure and black has nothing black can't get in it's an impenetrable fortress he plays knight takes g3 that is a desperate move suddenly there is an m in the evaluation the last last time there was an m in the evaluation nolan was on the ropes that's a nolan nolan was on the ropes but not this time knight takes g3 is the final trick if you take the knight you lose your rook however you can take the queen but then your rook is hanging twice so the best move in the position is to ignore this and ignore this the gateways have opened up your queen and your rook now have a chance to go all all the way across the rook is hanging two different ways but because it is a check which is the most forcing move black has to play king c8 and noan takes the rook with check it is another forcing move this rook can be taken right now by two different pieces but it can because black is in check nolan sees that with just 2 and a half minutes remaining on the clock king to b7 now he's up nine points of material he brings the rook to e7 check king to a8 and now he just has to make sure he doesn't make any crazy mistake he's completely fine me personally what i would play here is i would play queen f3 check that is exactly what he plays because it is a force queen trade leaving black with just two horses it's not enough but black doesn't even take black goes here and resigns black resigns because it's not about a queen trade yes you can trade the queens and take with the knight but it's not it it's the fact that after knight c6 you take the knight and in this position you have a million checkmates in two and by a million i mean three one two and three check well now it's checkm in one i should say it was checkm in two taking the night nolan won this game without touching him out he he did this all telepathically that's incredible and the whole concept of a brain implant that allows people to add some functionality back into their lives is is really really wild like there's the whole chess side of things what if chess players start getting implants that's that is a wild thing to think about but there's the whole humanity side of things as well and then of course there's you know there's people that are much more sophisticated on this subject and i welcome them to discuss in the comment section if i said something incorrectly please please correct me i i am not a scientist i am a chess youtuber but i was absolutely fascinated by this i had to analyze this game because it was a very interesting game and nolan was a beast the last 10 or 15 moves fighting back from a worst position so hopefully the chess was fun and hopefully the story is interesting yeah so on that note get out of here
