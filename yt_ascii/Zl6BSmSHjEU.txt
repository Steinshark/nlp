right in here is a custom one-of-a-kind smartphone and quite a bit more so we're gonna get this bag open and inside we have got a ton of stuff so festa we're gonna start with the little package and we've got a that looks like a moon which is gonna seem really random right now but it'll make a lot of sense in a minute and a power cable as well as a couple of wooden pieces for a stunt all right how old do you actually doesn't come with any instructions yeah okay so little moon set up and as well as the custom smart phone which i'm gonna come to there are two more smartphones that we've got and these are devices you may well have seen before but i've been really wanting to get them in and test them in detail myself first up the galaxy a 70 labeled by many is samsung's best mid-range smartphone but that said if we open the box up right on top you've got the smartphone itself you get a fast 25 watt charger the same as a galaxy note 10 pc cable and some kind of mid tier earphones so at around $400 this is actually not one of samsung's more expensive phones and with that in mind there are three things that stand out there's got a massive six point seven inch super amoled display and equally hefty 4,500 million power battery but possibly the most surprising is that it has this whilst not feeling particularly bulky and the camera is also pretty impressive for the price it's got very familiar samsung feel the other device here is the galaxy a 95 g more recent and a little harder to classify it falls into unusual territory it's priced almost twice as high at six hundred and sixty nine pounds or around $800 and for that inside the box to get the same 25 watt fast charger pretty much the same box contents overall and the smartphone itself is kind of similar that said there are three things that i think make it stand out it's not a cheap firm but it is one of the most affordable 5g smartphones out there and that 5g is only possible thanks to the qualcomm snapdragon 855 chip which is quite a significant upgrade to the mid-range processor found in the a 70 it's got the same large display and 4,500 million power battery but the camera has been upgraded to 48 megapixels and takes noticeably better images plus we've also got a new finish and it's kind of unusual the glass on the back is split into four sections but in a non symmetrical way with only the bottom half giving off this rainbow hue in the light i actually don't hate it now two packages to go and in order for this smartphone to make sense we've got to take a look at what's inside here so space selfie long story short this year is when samsung celebrate the 10th anniversary of its galaxy s series and that coincides with the 50th anniversary of the moon landing and so this entire unboxing experience is kind of a celebration of that and the idea is that something is sent a galaxy s 25 g into space and they want people to submit selfies of themselves so that they can put it on the screen of the samsung and get another camera to take a photo with the stars in real time as the backdrop and this is clearly an important campaign for them otherwise they wouldn't have done all this this says welcome to mission hashtag space selfie humanity's ultimate act of selfie expression or any question for you is how will you take yours and they literally have a display even with a whole bunch up there to show that it looks like the galaxy s2 m5g just to read the message that's kind of cool i never seen that before there's also this i tell us you know what this is so this is just like an invitation it's just telling me when it's happening where it's happening and that i could rsvp if i wanted to attend it and now for the device itself and this is kind of exciting because i'm strongly considering switching to this phone you'll see why in a minute well okay so custom packaging this time it says space selfie on the front and it's just got these samsung logo below that and if you take off this sleeve this is a standard galaxy s2 m5g box but as far as i'm told it is something special if it's not i apologize in advance well okay so right on top is the phone and i haven't seen this before but i'll come to that in a second we've got the standard 25 watt fast charger we've got a usb 80 usbc adapter which lets you transfer stuff from your old phone the usbc cable for data transfer as well as something i really like that's packaged with these phones akg events alrighty so the smartphone itself and take off the sleeve you will see that we've got a custom engraved space selfie s10 5g and actually says mister he's the boss on it it's in the crown silver color which i haven't actually seen before and it's actually kind of matte which i like the s10 5g i've been using is glossy a little bit more prone to fingerprints and just generally isn't as grippy right so two things firstly i'm gonna actually send off a space selfie just to see what happens and secondly this is actually a really good opportunity to tell you why no phone in the last six months has actually made me switch away from the s10 5g so i went to the site that they set up for this campaign i fell to my details and thought ok we're doing a samsung thing we might as well use a photo taken on a samsung phone and done they said i'll get the final result on the 31st of october and so if it's any good i'll put it on instagram i don't really know what to expect but if you're curious then do follow along and i'll keep you updated know this phone i've been using an s10 5g as my main phone for over six months now and i realize six months is not a long time to have used a phone but for me because this is my job and because i get to test so many phones it's actually rare that in this much time i didn't find a single phone that i would rather use it boils down to this the s10 5g has very little missing in fact i'd go as far to say it's still one of the most complete devices out there i was ready to switch to the oneplus 70 pro but when it came out it turns out it was super similar to the 7 pro and battery life was a bit of a worry it's a similar story for the pixel 4 but if you see my hands on video or camera comparison then you might know i wasn't hugely impressed by that thing and having an ultra wide camera has kind of become a deal breaker for me the galaxy note 10.1 and i was expecting to jump ship when that thing came out but for a number of reasons i've made a separate video about this after using the note i changed my mind and actually the closest i came this year was to the iphone 11 pro max i think the camera and the battery on that phone were a surprise to a lot of people it's super reliable and to me that's the most important thing my only real reservation was ios i loved the software but i'm the kind of person who wants to sit there and tweak and modify and customize my phone and ios is just not the best place for that so this wasn't sponsored but it was only possible thanks to samsung for this space selfie campaign qualcomm for the a 95 g and coffin warehouse for the a 70 so massive thanks and if you enjoyed this video i'm gonna leave a link for the pixel camera comparison as well as a bunch of other smartphone news which i think you'll find interesting so thanks all for watching and i will catch you in the next one [music]
