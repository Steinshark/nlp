i was heading to the gym one day and along the way i saw this random kiddie pool it was set up outside one of the new taipei tech university buildings i'm compelled to check every body of water i pass by for fish and this was no exception so i peeked inside and i saw a fish a super cute robot fish happily swimming across the pool i emailed the research team for an interview twice and never heard back if you can get in touch with them for me i would love to talk to with them there are plenty of fish in the sea and hopefully learning and mimicking them can give us better performing unmanned underwater vehicles today's video is about the robots that swim like fish today's unmanned underwater robots are mostly equipped with propellers these rotary propellers are loud and not very efficient if we're to measure this inefficiency using the ratio of useful power which is thrust multiplied by ford velocity divided by the power used then a propeller ranges from 40 to 70 percent a fishtail on the other hand can clear over 86 percent especially when optimizing their swimming methodologies that might mean smaller batteries or no tethered power and if these underwater vehicles have to navigate tight spaces then they need to have these thruster propellers all over their supple metal bodies with all the obvious drawbacks of such a thing but there are types of fish out there capable of navigating really small spaces stably moving backwards or front without fins all over their bodies why can't we have that over half a billion years various fishes have evolved their own unique swimming styles the first formal study of these swimming styles was in 1926 cm bredder an associate researcher at the new york aquarium published an article called the locomotion of fishes he proposed two general style categories body and caudal thin locomotion or bcf the caudal fin is the proper name for the fish's tail fin the fish bends its body and rear tail back and forth creating a backwards propulsive wave of water most people will recognize this type of swimming tuna sharks and so on are bcf swimmers it is more suitable for long term and high speed swimming the other major type is the median and paired fin locomotion or mpf these fissures use fins near their head or belly to move around one example is the puffer fish which swims around using a pair of pectoral fins located behind its gills these swimming styles are more suited for maneuverability redder's categorizations have largely held up over the years though we have many subcategories now within each grouping a decade later a british zoologist named james gray studied the swimming dynamics of a dolphin i know i know dolphins aren't fish but did you know that the chinese word for dolphin is high twin which literally means sea pig that makes me laugh anyway what gray found confused him after estimating the sea pig's muscle power he calculated that the animal needed seven times the strength it seemed to have in order to travel as fast as it did in the water about 20 miles an hour in the water his findings caused a stir upon the publication in 1936 and eventually came to be called as gray's paradox today the general scientific consensus is that gray made a few mistaking assumptions in his calculations particularly related to the sea pig's musculature the drag forces on its body and its use of drafting to reach high speeds but nevertheless gray's paradox triggered a torrent of research into the swimming styles of aquatic animals unfortunately many of these studies failed to replicate the efficiencies of the real deal a variety of theories were developed throughout the 1960s and 1970s to improve our understanding of animals and water in 1960 the british mathematician michael j light hill published the first equation describing the movement of a fish it breaks down the fish's movement into two actions first the body's undulation second the tail fin's pitching motion using the equation we can calculate out the movement and positioning of these two parts this theory only described smaller movements involving a slight bending of the fish's body small amplitude movements so light hill revisited his theories over the decades in 1971 he presented the quote large amplitude elongated body theory end quote which focused on larger more heavily bent body movements in the water then he combined the two theories to create a generalized elongated body theory this theory is called a reactive theory because it relies on newton's third law of motion for every action there is an equal reaction when a swimmer swims their body is accelerating into the water the water then reacts equally creating a reaction force that moves the swimmer in some way elongated body is probably the most well-known and widely used theoretical description of swimming but it is still a simplification with critical assumptions new theories in the following decades like j.y chang's wave plate theory have attempted to shed new light on the motions and movements of the swimming fish in the late 1980s brothers george and michael triumphalu god i hope i pronounced that right attempted to build a robot that swam as efficiently as a fish they focused on the water vortices left behind by a fish's tail fin and intimately intertwined story of flaps a fish wants to accelerate how do they do it they start by making a hard first flap with their tail fin this creates a large vortex in the water a second flap then creates a different water vortex in the opposite direction while the first vortex is still spinning the two vortices meet and combine to create a strong forward thrust and whoosh there the fish goes the ability to create and use these large vortices was seen as key to efficient efficiency trouts and salmons going upstream a river are known to exploit the whirling vortices created by rocks in the river flapping in such a way to create counter vortices to help them save energy with this knowledge the brothers were able to create robo tuna robo tuna's body is made up of pulleys links and aluminum hinges its skin is made from lycra fabric spandex essentially pressure sensors on robotuna skin help it measure the flow of water running over its body robotuna speed and energy efficiency were promising but unfortunately the robot is nowhere near as good as the real thing in single short bursts real tunas can accelerate up to 40 miles an hour the reasons for this performance gap remain unclear debuted in 1995 robo tuna is universally acknowledged as the first fish robot i would like to qualify that by mentioning that i did read about a mechanical carp built in 1976 by a japanese team but i haven't been able to locate any further info on that anyway after robotuna the mit associated draper lab in 1998 produced an evolved version of the original robo tuna the less amusingly named vcuv which stands for vorticity control unmanned underwater vehicle vcuv incorporates improvements from the first robo tuna it is a self-contained system capable of swimming and turning autonomously in field trials the robot can swim up to 2.8 miles an hour in 2000 the mit team followed up robo tuna and vcuv with the robo pike an experiment in replicating a fish's maneuverability without needing thrusters all over the machine about 32 inches long and weighing just 8 pounds the robot is modeled on a sleek looking fresh water fish somewhat confusingly called the chain pickerel robo pike can swim reasonably well but it's sleek sensual highly optimized body makes it hard to add sensors and batteries there were also initial issues with keeping the electronics dry and underrated challenge since then we've seen a proliferation of robotic fishes taking inspiration from various members of the fishy families we have the bcf fish robots which you can break down into a variety of subclasses i'm going to quickly run through a few of them first the anguilliform fish robots which swim like sea snakes their bodies sort of sachet generating thrust enviro robot is a robo eel developed by the swiss public research university epfl it is about four feet long and travels using six active modules and a flexible tail enviro robot is meant to quietly monitor animals in nature since its swimming style is discreet second the subcarenger form and karenger form robotic fish these robots don't swim with full body swaying their body movement happens in the final thirds of the body the i splash 2 yes that is its real name and i bet a consultant got paid a whole lot to come up with it this little robotic fish was developed by a team at the university of essex and is the fastest tail beating fish robot in the world about 8.3 miles an hour does not sound like much but to compare the olympic medalist michael phelps can go about six miles an hour the downside of this little fishy is that it cannot turn i feel like they should probably put that into the fine print thunderform swimmers keep their whole body stable swimming only with their large narrow and crescent-shaped cuddle tail these are tunas and sharks so robotuna and its descendants go in here the final big bcf category is ostroform same as the tuniforms these fish keep their body rigid and move their tail fins the difference is in how they move those tail fins uniform swimmers oscillate their tail fins to get efficient for motion swimming astroform swimmers on the other hand constantly flap their tail fins to be frank this is one of the least efficient bcf swimming styles but the style is very stable and the machines using these styles need few moving parts so it is easier to seal them from water damage keeping their essentials dry one example is the dory bot built by a team in the polytechnic university of marsh italy if you recall from earlier in this video mpf swimmers are those that swim using fins near the center of their bodies think rays and that is indeed where we will start roger formed swimmers have two big fins on their sides and they flap one of these robots comes out of italy and is inspired by the cow knows ray the robot is designed to slowly swim around the seatbed for a long time the fins are made from flexible silicone and are operated with a motor the tail serves as a rudder they put it in a lake and found that it can cover about 0.4 meters per second or less than a mile an hour but that is what you can expect with this type of swimming more stability and turning power but less speed amiform and gymnotiform swimmers keep their body rigid and swim by waving a long fin that goes along their tops or bottoms kind of like a knife fish or an electric eel this gives them really good maneuverability in 3d space going backwards or forwards without needing to change direction unfortunately there are not a lot of robots here trying to mimic these fish there's one conceptual prototype built by a team in changsha china but that is about it labriform fishes are those like coral rasses they use their pectoral fins to maneuver around the rowing or flapping motions but when they need a burst of speed they use their tail fins these fish robots are difficult to build the fish have low endurance when using their pectoral fins implying low efficiency furthermore achieving stability has been exceptionally challenging in my video about humanoid robots i talked about the benefits of soft bodies many of these advantages apply here underwater too soft actuators can be quieter more gentle and more resilient than their hard counterparts probably the most commonly used soft actuator material for robotic fish swimming is the shape memory alloy these are metals that can remember their shape for some time using heat you can cause it to move the water environment is ideal here because it helps cool down the sma metal increasing the frequency of motion robot fish have been developed with sma wires springs and more other soft materials do the same thing using electricity one notable recent chinese robot is based on the snailfish what this robot does will crush you they took the robot's control unit battery and voltage amplifier and embedded it in a polymer for movement the robot uses dielectric elastomers soft stretchy materials that kind of act like artificial muscles when an electric field is applied to them the team brought this untethered self-powered robot to the bottom of the mariana trench it had a flap for 45 minutes under crushing pressures one of the major issues with these fish robotics has to do with computation power the real ocean world is full of environmental noise that can crowd sensors and confuse motion planning algorithms not to mention complex underwater currents and dynamic obstacles and predators these fish robots bodies have limited power and space available yet its brain has to observe the outside world respond to imminent threats and work to achieve its longer term goals this remains an ongoing problem one that scientists are taking inspiration from the real thing for and actually i think that was what the professor at taipei tech is actually working on pathfinding rather than actual fish swimming mechanics one of the first big questions i wanted to answer when i started this video was why why would anyone want a fish robot this is nothing more than an over-engineered toy but when you dig into it you will quickly discover a number of significant real world applications for these machines right off the bat we have maritime monitoring a cheap quiet and low power fish swimming robot can be deployed from multiple underwater observation purposes as varied as americulture management one trial run set up a school of four swimming fish robots attached to a floating buoy that acts like a server beaming information back to the home base maneuverable fish robots can be deployed for industrial inspection and maintenance such devices would have immense value for the offshore energy and cable communication industries and on the military side fish robots would be valuable in surveillance and mind sweeping there is a reason why darpa funded mit's robo pike project i know these robots aren't exactly what pops into your head when you think about underwater robots but this is the ideal robotic swimming body you may not like it but this is what peak robotic swimming performance looks like nature has been working on their designs for half a billion years might make some sense to adopt some of that work alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching
