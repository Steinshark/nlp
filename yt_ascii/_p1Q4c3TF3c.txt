all right anyway sprints the biggest mistake of software engineering i actually already agree with this take do we even need to read the article do we even need to i mean the man is scare quoting it just to remind you that you don't actually run you use words that sound like exercise but we all know you haven't left the chair in a long time damn i know harsh yes reality real sprinting towards failure okay let's talk a little bit about being agile yeah that's a that's a word you don't describe with arch users and the brazilian definition of the current state of agile generated extreme goorse methodology extreme goorse what the hell is okay i don't know what the extreme goorse is now you got me misconceptions the first thing is to get the common misconceptions out of the way agile is going fast by now we should we all should know that agile is not about being faster it's about delivering value sooner and in a constant manner and being able to react and change course earlier i wouldn't necessarily say that's what agile's about i i'd say the fairest definition of agile is to pretend that you're the king of england and you love ceremony and that tradition trumps progress i thought that was the proper d definition yeah right like we all like to get dressed up in our robes we all want to have that nice hour and a half long ceremony for me to do the thing that i was already doing but to say i'm going to do the thing again and then i would love to have like a quick 15minute check-in to tell you that i'm doing the thing that i'm doing like who like like real talk like like instead of like imagine you had a roadblock you could wait till the next day and talk about it and stand up or you could just find the person that you're roadblocked and go and talk to them like why do you need to tell everybody about your roadblock why not have like a little like like why not have a team slack chat where you're just like yo dog i got blocked by this and then instead of wasting everybody's time to be in a meeting someone an hour later could be like yeah hey guess what i've seen this before you know how i i can help you with this you know how crazy that would be to completely destroy standups and just have a slack chat every now and then hey i'm just saying i'm not a big fan of multi thousand 15minute meetings you know that's my ideal that's everybody's ideal because it's better it just simply is better okay we can even have a stupid channel called i got [ __ ] dash your team name and then you put your problem in there and then everybody knows that that that channel is really important to listen to okay i'm just saying i just spilled coffee on myself we need to stand up i got to tell everybody about this oh [ __ ] i you know what i need to take i i need i need a moment here okay i'm going to talk about this for at least 15 minutes in stand up that i spilled coffee on myself today skill issue i'm dying of skill issues i'm literally dying in skill issues right now i pissed myself oh my god bro oh hell no man what the [ __ ] man get your ass on sprint is doing all in the time slot okay so you're saying agile is not about being fast but it also means having sprints questionable so you exist in society too it might have been an unfortunate term used by developers of scrum but it certainly doesn't help with all the agile as being fast people like to think sprints however are just a time box for certain amount of work to be done you know the more i think about agile is agile just really a reaction to the fact that developers don't know how to talk to each other and we didn't have a good chat app to avoid talking to people when created you know like slack really wasn't there you know i was i was using skype or some some nonsense i was literally using skype at one of my jobs as a form of communication like we were practically on we're practically on aol instant messenger sending each other messages yeah aim just shooting a little bit of aim at each other oh yeah hey hey everybody boomer yeah boom the problem executives push for agile and scrum because they think about being fast sprints the biggest problem is that making software is not a sprint it's a marathon yes well it's actually you do 400s over and over and over again until you die or create a marathon that's actually what software is is it's just individual individually the worst race you've ever done the 400 or you could say the 800 i think we could go back and forth on the worst possible foot rac is either the four or the 800 and you do that that over and over again until one of you die or you make a product unless you're not human you know that you cannot sprint a marathon it's really bad hell most people can't even sprint a short race and i'm also talking about software what the hell are we talking about the people resolve burnout plain and simple the profession loses a lot of good people because of burnout not to be confused with burn down charts also from scrum but somehow that doesn't generate any confusion for people the same people expecting more and more from developers so burnouts burnouts very interesting i don't think that moving fast is the problem or the expectation of moving fast is the problem for burnout i i just don't think that that's what causes burnout i don't think burndown charts are what causes burnout i don't think any of those things are i think doing meaningless things is much easier to cause burnout right like if you feel like you're just like just such a cog and you're just so cogged out and that everything you do is just such a process and every last little point in your next three four five 6 weeks are all individually mapped out for you never to have any questions and then you're going to have to go and wake up every day and tell everybody what you're doing every single day in some stupid meeting where some guy's going to tell you all about his dog for the 17th time about how cute boots is well boots is just so cute you should see boots this morning boots is so it's just like you do that over and over and over again and man that's not that much fun like there's probably different archetypes of burnout i just don't think moving fast is the problem right like if you got up and your environment is changing all the time and you're constantly never making progress and it's an ever like it's literally like playing wow and just trying to level by killing pigs like that that starc that starcraft [ __ ] it that south park episode yeah you get burnt out pretty pretty much because it's not fun let's not blame agel for burn i'm not going to blame agel for burnout i don't think that that's the fundamental problem like i don't think those things make burnout worse like i don't think agile itself leads to or doesn't lead to burnout let's blame agile for everything yeah i mean i i mean understandably agile agile is like that kid that always tells too much and you just want to punch him that's real i understand that the problem i have with just like whenever someone says like agile is actually great or agile can be you know like you're talking about scrum not agile the problem is is that scrum is an implementation of agile in some sense it's the attempt to codify what agile is into a thing into a set of things people can do and that becomes increasingly more and more difficult kbon is another one of these but kbon can feel equally as like miserable as scrum is right it can be equally miserable because kbon in some sense i find kbon almost worse because it's just like you're literally so replaceable that you're just a cog that takes off the top of the list like that's your value is that you are just like how do we effectively drive software engineering into what llms should do right it's just like we're going to break down the task as as small as possible and you're going to just shove through these things on just like a fire hose right kbon is neverending torture absolutely and so it's just like my i mean my personal favorite way to develop things is that you get together with the people you're you're trying to develop with set a set of like goals and then you come back a week later and you talk about how are your like progress towards the goals going in any roadblock or anything you have in the way you reach out to the team members individually you don't you don't do any sort of planning you don't do anything of course that's agile agile that's the problem with agile agile has such a broad definition it's only part of agile it's one definition which is a team should set forward its own thing right that's it just set a goal as a team we set one goal one thing we want to make we want to improve the reliability of service x go and make it happen team right fail fast it's it's but it's not a sprint like there's no there's i don't think check-ins or i don't think like tasks and extreme breakdowns work right if everybody's held accountable for what they do and every last person wants to see change and works hard you don't need need all these rules right and when people aren't doing it you're protective of the team and you talk to them you address issues and eventually you have to let them go like it's that simple i'm going to agile these nuts across your face right such hard well you have to you have to create the team you have to create the team you want right anyone that thinks you can't create the team then that's a that's a problem this assumes yes again you are the reason why teams have to be held accountable right you have to find people like yourself that hold people accountable and that's that like if you're if you're trying to do it in some top down way you're going to just land and scrum in daily meetings and every this that and the other because now management has to come in and they're the ones that have to go through and do all this stuff and then it's just awful like i don't want that do you want that i don't want that but i love my scrub mommy well we all love our scrum mommy okay okay but only one team gets a scrub mommy and that ain't me okay first off i don't believe that i i i don't believe this at all right here i cannot create my team and 30 million is on the line and contracts with deadlines are in effect if we fire people i have no one to replace them bs if you literally paid people a good wage a competitive wage whatever that competitive is for your area slightly better 5% better 10% better whatever it is you will literally have a load of developers knocking on your door right now saying pay pay me pay me pay me i'll do the work i'll do the work good and you you can just handpick right now great talent okay there are people desperate for jobs right now this i this idea that somehow like i mean i understand like tribal knowledge is really important and you can't just get rid of an entire team and then come back and create a new one right like that's not it's not that easy right people are really really really really wanting to work there's plenty like that is not right that is not like a thing okay all right anyways develop deliver deliver software not fast but with consistency the first thing people see in new frameworks is how fast they can make a to-do app yes i hate to-do apps i hate to-do apps but that's not the reality for most of us go horsing quick and dirty to make a big bowl of muddy pasta is okay for an mvp side project and a throwaway project i still don't know what go horsing is is this like a is this a brazilian term that's being like transliterated across languages is there like is am i missing something but most of the time you'll be working for months on end on something what matters making one thing fast than slowing down on each new feature until you jump ship this yeah this this is actually pretty funny is that you slow the the the inevitable slowdown or decide to rewrite the whole thing dude holy cow oh so this must be okay so this is i see axiom 8 axiom 10 this is funny cuz right when i said jump ship my next thought was or you just try to burn the ship and get a new one and then here you go rewrite the whole thing i might okay maybe extreme goorse is a i'm a fan of extreme goorse like is this is this hdmx mentioned is this what's happening right now okay as i was writing this post it came to my attention that extreme goorse is commonly known only by brazilian deaths yes i literally i first off brazil mentioned can we get a brazil mention can we just get i just just just so you know brazil was just mentioned okay and i i don't think people are are are experiencing how amazing that is processess right brazil mentioned this is fantastic horsing the man's horsing around but not enough around the world this was made by who knows when by who knows who it's a little outdated in the writing i'll refactor as needed but you will see it's timeless c axium 14 and re and relevant to what i was saying disclaimer this is basically not a to-do list it's a funny it's let's see it's funny as a meme but as i like to say if all you do are things from memes then your life is a joke it's real take you know those people that always are like ironic on the internet and they're and they're and they're continuously just like saying [ __ ] that's like really on the edge like real edge lords and they're just constantly being like dude it's just a joke bro but they only operate in that mode you know what i mean and you're just like are you sure you're living ironically or are you just like is that just you it's this this is who you are there were some translations out there but i translated them here by timeing let's see by trying to update things and make it more easy make it more sense today enjoy but don't follow it little note people usually just read x g extreme goorse as goorse all right the goorse manifesto by the way i typically don't like to read manifestos just the idea the whatever reason the word manifesto gives me the heebie jeebies okay i don't i don't i don't like it but we're going to do it anyways here we go if you had to think it's not extreme goorse in extreme goorse you don't think you do the first thing that comes to mind there's no second option the only option is the fastest one there's this weird part of me that likes and hates this all at the same time i feel i feel like a mixed drink right now you know what i mean i can't tell which part of me loves this and which part of me hates this you know what i mean and the hard part is is that i'm thinking about something and it just told me not to think let tim cook already okay so so extreme goorse can also be replaced with gsd that's the american way to say it which is get [ __ ] done yeah for the most part i actually genuinely agree with this whenever i'm prototyping or kind of specking out something or just trying to investigate how something works like this is what i do i don't even try to make it pretty at all i i'm building it just to get [ __ ] done come up with some ideas and then maybe make something that makes sense later on there are three ways of solving a problem the right the wrong and the extreme goorse which is like the wrong one but faster i'm not sure if these are great axioms extreme goorse is faster than any other methodology of software development you know okay okay the more extreme goorse you do the more you'll need to do it for each problem solved using extreme goorse about seven more will be created but all of them will be solved using extreme goorse extreme goorse tends to infinity i'm glad we got like the limit definition of extreme goorse as time goes as time goes to zero is infinity react mentioned is that what is that what we're seeing zoo zoo mentioned extreme goorse is completely reactive erors only exist when they surface so that's kind of a funny phrase they're using there erors only exist when they surface which by all definition is the only ways in which errors become known which you can be proactive by trying to look at the surface so is it reactive or proactive extreme goorse accepts everything solved the problem compiled commit that's it always commit before updating if [ __ ] happens your part will always be correct and your colleagues can go [ __ ] themselves i think i'm a huge fan of i think i'm a huge fan of goor right now extreme goorse goorse i think i i'm i'm in on this one i'm in on this one extreme goorse has no deadline the deadlines set by your client are more are mere details you always be able to implement everything in the given time even if it involves accessing the database with shady script i mean i i've worked that job i've been at this job i know this job i feel this job be prepared to jump ship when it starts to sink or blame someone or something else for those who use extreme go horse one day the ship will sink the more time passes the more the system becomes a monster the day the house falls it's better to have your linkedin updated or have something to blame be authentic extreme goorse does not respect standards if you write code however you want let's see write code however you want if it solves the problem commit and that's it isn't that pretty much i mean i mean that's actually just modern-day coding this is this is actually just like this is actually just like this is just coding right i i hate to break this to you but this is how everybody writes code when somebody tells you something is cleaner it's not cleaner it's because they like it differently okay some people like their cucumbers pickled like that's just a fact of life 10 there is no refactoring only rework if [ __ ] happens redo a quick extreme goorse that solves the problem the day the rework involves rewriting the entire application jump ship and the boat will sink it will sink it actually will sink i have rarely seen a rewrite work and when a rewrite happens i've just never i've never seen good things about rewrites extreme goorse is completely anarchic the figure of a project manager is completely disposable there is no owner everyone does what they want when problems and requirements arise you know this isn't far from bad advice because i mean i understand like this whole list is like supposed to be bad advice but there's accidentally good advices in here in the sense that everyone should try to solve a problem or everyone should try to like do what they think is best when problems or requirements arise rather than having formal meetings about everything like i'm actually on that team that there is something like sometimes these bad advices are actually accidentally okay always delude yourself with promises of improvement i mean i agree with that okay i agree i agree i mean i i i agree tweet material putting to do in the code as a promise of improvement helps the extreme goorse developer not feel remorse or guilt for the [ __ ] for the [ __ ] they made of course refactoring will never be done c m 10 extreme goorse is absolute it does not cling to relative things time and cost are absolute quality is totally relative i actually this is accidentally true i know this is supposed to be a meme but this is accidentally true never think about quality only let's see only about the shortest time the solution can be implemented in fact don't think just do it that's axiom one you should have cited axiom one okay if we were proper here you would have known that that that that that if you had to think it's not extreme goorse you would have known that but you clearly didn't you forgot clearly whoever wrote it was not thinking extreme goorse is timeless scrum extreme programming all of this is just a fat extreme goor does not cling to fads of the moment that's for the weak extreme goorse has been and it will always be used by those who disregard quality extreme cor is not a workaround oh let's see on extreme goorse is not always workaround oriented programming many workaround oriented programming requires a high level of thinking but extreme goorse does not see axm one thank you translator node in the original it uses garia oriented programming since i understand some people will know what garia is it's more encompassing term than just hack or workaround is garia something like circumference is that like fairish it means ass doesn't it garia is like brazilian macgyverism appreciate that anyways don't try to swim against the tide if your colleagues use extreme goor for programming and you are the stickler who likes to do things properly forget it for each design pattern you use correctly your colleagues will generate 10 times more rotten code using extreme goorse extreme goor is not dangerous until a little order arises the axium is very complex but it assumes the projects using extreme goorse is in the midst of chaos don't try to add order to extreme goorse it's useless and you can waste precious time this will make the project sink even faster don't try to manage extreme goorse it is self-sufficient just like the chaos you know there's actually an accidental piece of wisdom in this one as well which is like if you came into a project it had one month to ship and it's just absolute craziness like do you think you can just say well this is crazy we better rewrite this right sometimes you do just have to embrace the chaos sometimes you're like this c this is crazy i'm going to make a script that does like a full integration test on this and i'm going to hope everything goes great you know like you just sometimes thanos mentioned sometimes you just got to go for it you know what i mean just give the gasoline for the fire you called exactly chaos cl charlie yeah exactly let's see goorse is your ally but it is vengeful as long as you want goorse will always be on your side be careful don't abandon it if you start a system using goorse and abandon it using trending methodology you're [ __ ] goorse does not allow for refactoring c10 and your new full of frills will collapse and at that time only goorse can save you if it's not working don't or if it's working don't touch it never changed let alone question working code i mean this is every piece of legacy code that has ever existed that's a waste of time especially since refactoring doesn't exist c10 time is is the gear that moves goorse and quality is a negligible detail testing is for the week if you put your hands on goorse system you better know what you're doing if you know what you're doing why test testing is a waste of time if code compiles that's enough get used to the feeling of eminent failure failure and success always go hand inand and in goorse it's no different people often think the chances of a project failing using goorse are always greater than it being successful but success and failure are a matter of perspective did the project go down the drain but you learn something then it's a success for you the always positive bob ra style i love it the problem is yours only when your name is in the g blame never put your hand on a file whose author is not you if a team member dies or is sick for a long time the boat will sink in this case use axiom a oh my goodness more is more with goor you thrive on code duplication code quality doesn't matter and there's no time for abstractions code code reviews or refactoring time is essential so copy and paste quickly again there's so much accidental almost wisdom in here almost it's like so close isn't it funny that what is actually a good idea can be masqueraded as such a bad idea isn't it funny how that works like that you could like that's it's actually one of the dangers it's i think it's one of the reasons why really bad ideas tend to crop up in software is that i can make such a straw man such as this and sell it as a reason why you should abstract everything and it's like i've just created this bogey man that's like impossibly scary this is why we should do something else and then the next thing you know is you find yourself just with builder factories coming out the ass it's crazy right not accidental we now we we know it's the right way it's like it's grug programming not grog grog is something different anyways the code is the documentation i actually do agree a lot with this general approach in goorse the code is the only documentation needed comments and additional documentation are just a waste of time if someone can't figure out how the code works they shouldn't be working on it cm20 again this is so close to being true i actually really dislike 99% of code comments one of my favorite code comments was a code comment at the top of the file and just said hey i had to make a lot of shortcuts in this file i want you to know that beforehand that these two tickets and jro were the reason why i did what i did i'm not happy about it but i did it and i am happy about it the bug was fixed this code is [ __ ] sorry not sorry that was at netflix it was fantastic one of my favorite developers i've ever worked with put that code comment at the top it was amazing it was perfect it was exactly correct the code was [ __ ] i couldn't be upset because i saw why it was and i just kind of agreed i was like yeah you know you're right you're right you're right the code is horse crap the go the code is goorse but i'm not sure if you could give any you i don't i don't know if you could do any better in goorse a security is a secondary detail it's a waste of time to implement robust security c5 and s trust in luck the lack of interest from hackers c ax8 it's pretty good this is pretty good you know it's weird because i can't tell what part of this was satire and what part of this wasn't satire you know what i mean like i can't tell i honestly can't tell cuz like this right here feels like it's meant to be true right that agile is not about moving fast it's about delivering value sooner and in a constant manner and being able to react to change and change course earlier like that feels like you're you're trying to give a legit definition of agile and then just tosses in in goorse you don't think
