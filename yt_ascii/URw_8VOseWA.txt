ladies and gentlemen welcome to the candidates 2024 this is round number eight out of 14 and now we begin the second half of the tournament the winner will play for the world chess championship later on this year we now restart the round robin and we flip the colors everybody plays everybody twice in this round we have hikara nakamura versus fabiano caruana in a battle to catch up to yan pishi the clear leader of the event and oh my goodness what a around this was here we go hikaru versus fabby i'm going to give you a statistic and then i'm going to begin today's recap hikaru has defeated fabiano the last three times that they have played with these colors hikaru defeated fabiano in the 2022 candidates then hikaro defeated fabiano in the norway chess tournament held annually in stavanger norway then hearo defeated fabiano in the isle of manang grand swiss and every single time he has played the movie four and every single time hikaru has faced e5 he has done it in a variety of different ways we have knight f3 knight c6 bishop b5 they repeat the opening that they played in the candidates 2022 when they played a6 bishop a4 knight f6 hikaru castled and fabiano took this pawn entering what is called an open spanish they played 20 moves of scintillating theory and then hikaru went on to win this time hikaro plays d3 a pretty big sideline because normally we have c3 and d4 that is why it's major plan in the spanish but hikaro plays the move d3 fabiano plays aggressively putting the bishop out on c5 rather than the more passive traditional bishop 2 e7 we have castles d6 he carl c3 ready to bring the bishop back to c2 and expand with the move d4 black castles and now a sideline hikaro doesn't play h3 which is a normal move stopping anything from coming here he plays rook to e 1 which is a move that has been played in the database and now fabiano deviates from pretty well-known theory and he moves this knight away from c6 and he basically says look karu you missed your chance to take normally after something like rook e1 we have something like h6 white plays some move and then black puts the bishop here then sometimes it looks you know and then the queen goes to the b8 square sometimes when this trade occurs well fabbi says no you just can't take my knight not only can you not take my knight i'm going to put my knight over here and karo says you know what fabiano that looks like a splendid idea but we are now in a position that neither player really remembers all too much and fabi thinken plays d5 he explodes the center of the board if black can successfully implement the move pawn to d5 in these types of positions black is going to be completely fine we have pawn takes we have knight takes now a nice idea bishop to b3 lining up some stuff over here some of you may be wondering why karo did not take this pawn well black has bishop takes f2 check and after king f2 knight e5 the queen would strike the rook and the king over here you can play king g1 and continue the game but that is not what hearo wanted to do so he went here fabiano played c6 holding the center and then we got to this position with h3 bishop takes fabiano forced an isolated pawn and it looked like we were going to shake hands not you and me cuz i don't want to cuz you don't wash your hands but karu and fabiano and the point is that white has an isolated pawn but the bishop pair black doesn't have a bishop pair but he's going to put the bishop right there and white just can't really get a whole lot of anything so knight to d5 and hikaru played bishop c2 that's why hikaru spent 14 minutes moving the bishop back one square because he didn't really get anything from the opening he put the bishop back on c2 he put the knight out fabiano played knight to f4 pretty active and you know hikaru brought his rook to the center and then the knight went back and that's a draw offer so i'm not sure if you realize that but the knight was just there it went there rookie for the knight comes back karo has the option to make a draw like if he goes back fabiano is going to go here draw with black pretty effortless he had to think for a little bit but not too much as much as you know he might have thought would to eat for lunch or something but hikaru thinks in this position after the knight goes back and plays a3 he didn't even he didn't even spend a minute yeah he did he spent like a minute and 50 seconds whatever a3 and he just says you know what fbby let's play let's play i mean the winner's probably going to go to the candidates right i mean the the world championship let's play and poy played rookie eight f he's like all right you want to play we play you want to improve your position i'm going to improve my position as well by the way not too late to make a draw rookie went back we can still shuffle the pieces now okay carl moves the bishop out so he thought for 12 minutes on a bishop move like that he doesn't have a whole lot here knight f6 but now he does he gets rid of his bishop pair to alleviate some of the pressure in the center and then he plays queen d2 queen g5 and the computer likes to move queen c3 in this position rather than trading queens and playing with the isolated pawn hikaro plays rook e 3 and fabiano's eyes lit up they got a little big and he thought why would hikaru let me put my knight here now i'm just taking over but hikaru had set a trap for fabby the idea is h4 and suddenly the sneaky little defense of h pawn is moving forward if black takes white plays rook e4 pinning the knight to the queen if black plays g5 which looks okay suddenly black can't move any pieces his queen is kind of stuck the pressure is building on the e file if black tries to escape bishop d1 traps the queen queen h4 knight f5 and you get hit over here so all of a sudden fab's got to go back to d5 wait a minute fab's got 13 moves 14 moves to make but but 13 minutes this is the 26th move of the game so karu sets a little bit of a trap and fabiano spend 20 minutes before falling right into it a little bit and now the knight goes back back and now hikaru's building wait a minute now this h pawn which used to be there moves up and guess what on the very next move and it's going to go to h5 so look at in the span of a few moves hikaru pushes fabiano's knight back to f8 and then his queen back to d8 this is massive progress but it's a very tense position he's got an advantage if he puts the queen on f4 for some reason activating the queen he doesn't play it and the advantage drops by a full point that's a big deal he misses a critical chance and now fbi needs to come out this way with the queen to put pressure to also put the rook on the d8 square he also doesn't fabiano was in retreat mode look at that the knight was going backwards the queen was going backwards he wasn't thinking to switch it up and go forward bishop d7 despite what you would think alleviating some of the pressure with a trade rook takes e8 ac cross straight down the middle backs fabiano up and in comes the hay maker the knight arrives on the f5 square with on both the pawns near hikaru's king excuse me fabiano's king and it's also looking to go over here and just when fabiano thought he had ducked underneath the hook hikaru lands a cannon on the other side the rook is coming straight down the queen is hitting the queen side the knight is ready to go to e7 and the bishop cuts the king's only safety room and fabby plays a move that from a distance i also thought he had to play which is pawn to b5 and the advantage skyrockets because hikaro finds the fatal one-w punch knight to e7 check king to h8 knight d5 and there's an attack on the knight which is checkmate and an attack on the queen c5 only prolongs the game because after this this you have knight f6 knight c5 and you grab the bishop hikaru played knight d5 fabiano resigned he has now lost four straight games to hikaru with the black pieces in classical chess tournament and hikaru is on the hunt for first place and the candidates with six more rounds to go i mean you cannot script this stuff this man just beat the number two rated player in the world this is unbelievably clutch stuff from hikaru sensational what an attack a couple of moves ago right at the critical moment of this game fabiano had this sacrifice knight takes g2 he had to sacrific the knight the engine isn't even fully convinced the idea of course being f5 he didn't find that he backed up too much and in the heat the tension of the moment he succumbed to the pressure of hikaru who is now rated 2790 may i add and that was just the beginning of the fireworks again this is a rematch so round one of the candidates tandong y defeated leing j who won the candidates the previous time and leting was with the white pieces this time we have a london because what better way to annoy somebody that you've defeated with black by playing the london against them with the white pieces knight bd2 bishop g4 this has all been seen seen before very boring very solid stuff ling j just says look i'm in it for the long haul but she knows that tandi is an aggressive player tandi does not need two invitations to go party h4 h5 she says you know what lei i beat you the first time i'm going to beat you two times in the same candidates there is literally no better way to assert dominance over somebody l strikes back the queen slides back the queen goes to d8 to eye the dark squares and also potentially a bishop trade rook g1 the attack continues gh gh lay insane why would she open up her king like this she has no interest in defending the pawn she has no interest cuz the king is going to be safe in the center now here tanong yi repeats the moves and she can play bishop f4 and make a draw but she's got five out of seven i mean she is a juggernaut make the draw no f4 she spends 17 minutes and she gets into a firefight a5 on the board the king now moves to protect the pawn on g7 again they threaten us with a repetition but this time the knight is the one sliding back and all of a sudden tanong yi in a deep time trouble the attack has backfired she ran into a brick wall the best that she could get in this game was a draw but instead of that she got a little bit greedy i mean hey can you blame her she's been leading the tournament for all seven games and all of a sudden the attack is coming in there is absolutely nothing an absolute rock formation on the light squares and black is breaking in on the the dark squares within the span of a few moves black makes a few reroutes reroutes the knight to f6 puts the king in the center where he's safe surrounded by his friends and family black defends wins a pawn and the attack comes barreling back down right at 10 dr y queen h8 king f6 the king is safest out in the open surrounded by all his fellow pieces and in the second part of the time control the attack was swift but my god was it brutal rookie queen h4 rook e2 queen f4 all the pawns collapsed and at the end of the day she played queen c1 and resigned because rook d2 and one of these two checks leads to check bait in three moves leting g just won three games in a row and is tied for first in the women's candidates after a disastrous last place a couple of rounds ago she is on a war pass she's on a revenge tour i mean oh my goodness let's keep it moving prague versus ali reza could we be witnessing one of the greatest comeback stories in the history of the candidates i mean i said this tournament was over one and a half out of six what are we even talking about right but then he beats gash in an absolutely insane game and he shows up today and he plays the sicilian defense you know a man does not just play the sicilian defense do you understand that like you play the sicilian defense because you want to win or lose knight f3 and not only does he play the sicilian he plays the tonov nobody has played the ton of sicilian in this candidates if you're going to play the sicilian in defense you are going to move the pawn to d6 and a6 like in the nidorf because that is the meta all right but in this position prague instead of playing bishop e3 f3 a3 any plethora of m prague in this position plays a way that is the 15th most popular move in this position it has been played less than like .1% of the time knight b5 that may shock you because you're like what but me see queen me queen when me take queen me get fork i understand that's how you think and you're not wrong right you're not like stupid i i i totally get it this is why top level chess and your level chess and even my level chess is at a very big disconnect it's not a good move traditionally because black is just going to go here and then your knights are going to get kicked out and by kicking out your knights black is also going to be able to improve their position that is why this type of stuff it's like you know it's like being a onetick pony in any type of sport but guess what the computer nowadays has shown that in this position white is doing very well white is scoring very very well in fact ali reza here does not play e5 alza play c5 and from the opening plays in a way no one has ever played before and is worse is considerably worse but prague needs to find the best plan and the best plan out of this really offbeat opening that he chose is b3 that is the engine's top move the second move is h4 anticipating the night coming here and and then playing h5 and so if you play h4 and black plays h5 you secure the g5 square which will be good for you in the long run and then you got to play b3 so this plan to get the advantage is the right way prague thinks for a little while and he plays castle spends 12 minutes castling and then he plays c3 and then he plays rook b1 and b4 that this is the plan prague chooses right this is this is how it works like sometimes you got to take three different paths to get to a destination metaphorically but also in transport and sometimes doesn't work out like sometimes one of the paths just like well doesn't work out would mean you don't get there so i don't know what happened but it takes longer you run into traffic there's something unexpected this is the wrong approach to the position instead what prague had to do is he had to put the bishop there to get an advantage not to win but he chooses the wrong plan from the opening and just like in the game that you just saw where the attack ran into a brick wall prague sort of runs into the same thing and now we have a mass simplification so we have pawn takes pawn takes rook sacrifice you get the rook back when it's all said and done this is the position black has five pawns and his two and white's two pawns are just not very good so queen d3 you got to defend both of them and prague does and you got to give credit to my man ali resa fuja because he showed up today looking for a fight and he got a fight and they both had to be accur accurate neither one of them really wanted to take massive risk and this one peters out into this position and a draw a couple of moves later on the 40th move aliv resa is not going anywhere i mean if you want to if you want to bury al res in this candidates you're going to have to call an ambulance and make sure he gets in it so like reports of ali resa's elimination from this tournament are greatly exaggerated he is certainly underperforming bros bros ready for a fight every single game with white and black i think that's just going to be his approach i think the pressures off and i think he's a huge wild card to make a comeback but for now prague with four and a half points now kat lagno versus alexandra gach on the women's side this was another spanish this one is called the arhangel variation with beef and bishop c5 this is a matchup of the two i think strongest russian women in the world cuk she has changed federations but i mean historically originally let's say she's a world champion and this one white had a really nice position but black did a nice job trading off her pieces and although it was tense and it definitely looks like stuff is brewing here this is kind of one of those positions that sometimes black just puts up a really nice defense you trade all the pieces and yeah the su of this game does not get as much of a time as the previous because it was a relatively straightforward draw but they are still in the hunt on the women's side g five points tied with leing and tanong incredible comeback by tanong yan pishi versus nar basov yan pishi versus nar basov are you ready e4 e5 a petro you dare use my own spells against me potter type of moment knight e5 d6 knight f3 knight e4 this is an opening that yan plays with black okay and abasov shows up and plays it against him he's like show me how to beat your own opening buddy yan plays a sideline he plays d3 which is just going to lead to a french exchange we are now playing a french defense exchange variation you don't you don't believe me e4 e6 d4 d5 e ed knight f3 knight f6 look at that it's the same exact position as the one we have in the game it's just a different move magic right bishop d3 now abasov abasov is the guy who plays c5 he plays c5 himself and then he plays c4 he brings the fight to yan he's like i want to imbalance the game and he forces a position that jan actually kind of has to think and yan is down in the opening we don't see that very often nepo down 20 minutes thinking in the opening but now we're playing very naturally developing his queen side expanding right pawn takes on d5 black has to go here grab the pawn back same pawn as in the fabiano game kind of hikaro right with the isolation there but we have knight d5 knight d5 and yan begins building some pressure i mean jan's got when you have an isolated pawn you use the space around it to create attacking chances for yourself which is exactly what he's doing he plays rook a2 plays rook e2 but just bringing the forces then he plays rook e4 i mean you talk about a nice moment here rook a2 rook e2 rook e4 the engine really lik bishop d5 for what it's worth potentially looking at knight to d7 on a higher depth it doesn't like that move as much maybe it was here it lik bishop d5 no no it was it never mind i apologize i think i'm mixing i'm mixing up something rook e4 knight c3 yes yes rook e3 bishop c4 and now knight c4 and here yan could have played bc so it's another moment he could have played b takes c4 queen takes d4 very very tense moment bishop b2 and there's a lot of pressure on the black position black has to be extremely careful but he is surviving yan chooses knight c4 giving up the pawn in the center of the board and a massive attack roaring back rook c3 there's a lot of different lines here but he chooses this one and the dust settles and the position that arises is a fascinating one because it's basically one where jana is going to put pressure on abasov for the remainder of the game king f1 right rook d8 king e2 and he runs the king to the other side of the board and he has got a very menacing position here like this is a target the king is going to walk to a4 how is abasov going to defend himself i got news for you by being an absolutely badass clutch i i can't even like stress abasov was under like the threat of losing all his pawns so he just chucks one he says you know what yan take on f6 this is sublime high level understanding from nadab basov unbelievable understanding to get his rook in in the end game material is important black is upon down but look at the activity of the rook look at the activity of the bishop and the king like you're you're weaving a checkmate net around the white king and suddenly jan is on the back foot he has to trade his bwn and abos of just plants a defensive stance you just can't do anything with these pawns so nepo i was wondering if the if some of the results of the round went a certain way but i mean aos of just an unbelievable defensive hold and catches yan in a cube unable to get out of this formation and the game ends in a draw abasov lowest seed in the event in last place holding the tournament leader the man that has dominated three straight candid in a row and he holds him to a draw with the black pieces i mean that is a mammoth result all right the other players should be depositing money all right into the account of abasov and thanking him for his efforts to slow down the locomotive that is yanomi now i have a couple of other games nul salimova versus anam musuk they're not doing as well as they would have expected at least in the case of anam musuk we have a catalan this one was one where central pawns were traded very early this one at a very funny conclusion but throughout this game nurul was putting the pressure i mean she had a fantastic position she was playing a masterclass positional game look at our pressuring on the queen side with the bishops on e3 and f1 slowly but surely taking down the much more experienced opponent in anam musuk b4 this is like this i mean this is a master class this is a modern-day positional masterpiece rugy just fantastic anna defending doing her best all the piece is coming there bishop c5 knight c7 nice zuk in between move and anna blunders and finds herself down in exchange she had a better defensive move there knight b6 the rook goes to b1 and this is perhaps the biggest moment of the game instead of knight c7 maybe you just immediately go bishop b5 some of you may be confused because the knight is hanging but after bishop e8 king e8 you have this check and you can try to win this end game this is likely a winning end game because the rook is simply better than the bishop nurul in a time trouble simplifies the game incorrectly first she plays f3 then she goes bishop b5 and she lands in an end game where she's going to get material back but black gets another pawn on the way out and white does win the pawn but this is a draw this is simply a draw there is just nothing you can do here to the knight the knight is going to dance around and this went on for 110 moves but you cannot win rook and knight rook versus knight so unfortunately nul despite playing a fantastic game was unable to win it i have two more big games for you the biggest game of the round the all indian derby between vided gti and gukesh and humpy conu versus vali this one was unbelievable a grinfield a queen b3 system humpy also not having the best tournament that she would have liked neither of them are two and a half obviously is not in the running for a first place finish but this one was complicated right off the bat as humpy just aggressiv went into the black position she had a completely winning position after 17 moves it wasn't even close but vali fought back she was like i'm going to lose my rook anyway so i might as well just go all out it got into a time scramble 20 minutes remaining for the players white is totally crushing completely winning but suddenly she's getting pushed back she's trying to fight but vce shal's knights are getting in bc queen c5 she's creating a dark square blockade and she gets to an end game where i'm not even sure she's all that worse with the planted knight on c3 both ss have just minutes on the clock but humpy gets a second breath of air she's like all right time to convert this my younger opponent is doing a nice job oh my god those pawns are really scary i don't think i'm winning anymore she's not i got news for you vali with an unbelievable comeback she's got a pass b pawn she's got a blockade she's got a very good position and the pawn makes it all the way to b2 i mean you you this is just incredible an absolutely back and forth battle rook to b1 king f8 king f3 king and yeah yeah unfortunately now it's just the fortress like white can't move black can't move everything is defending everything else rug goes to b4 and we're simply heading for a draw an incredible comeback from vali king g7 but vali accidentally falls asleep at the wheel she had to keep her king close to the d pawn and on the 55th move she just made one mistake and now the pawn goes and now the king is not fast enough to stop the pawn so the pawn makes it to d7 in time king e4 and you just can't stop all these pawns you can't like i said d7 she didn't she didn't have to go there but it was also winning and now the bishop is stuck so the bishop can't continue to defend king d3 king c2 and humpy wins humpy was winning 50 moves ago and after an unbelievable comeback from bali unfortunately in the low time humpy the more experienced player the stronger player for now does get the job done and moves to three and a half out of eight and this game the final game of the day gesh with one of the most heartbreaking victor defeats to ali resa fuja in the previous round vidit having an unbelievable event back and forth wins losses miss chances can vid can vid continuous strong tournament can gcash possibly recover and let me tell you something gash in this game played one of the weirdest openings i've ever seen in this position he did not develop his bishop to c5 he played a6 i did not understand this move this move looks like it allows a giga fried liver i mean it just looks like it's a better fried liver than normal that's what it looks like it does but the idea is that after d5 ed knight a5 which is the main line of the fried liver there is no bishop to b5 check and i was talking to the one and only anish giri super grandmaster he has a youtube channel we did a candidates res day coverage there if you want to check it out that was yesterday and i was asking him questions about the system because vidit spent 20 minutes on castling and i didn't have any idea what the heck vidit was spending time on i was like why is he thinking so much and anish was like well you know instead of a4 vid can play c3 right and go here but then he thought the idea was g5 d4 d6 d g4 ef gf queen f3 knight e5 he thought that was gash's prep he thought that gukesh played like this to make vidit castle early to catch him a little bit off guard and then hit him with this move g5 which is why vidit made it out of the opening and played a very solid setup but he was down 24 minutes and the thing about the italian what i could not understand for the life of me i did not get it why didn't vidit just go back to a regular italian when the bishop was on c5 okay you want to go c3 here black is going to go here but when the bishop is already on c5 why not play c3 black is going to castle and this is just going to be a completely normal italian game like black might play d6 d4 the bishop goes to a7 like this this is this has all been played before and i was like why did vidit not just play c3 gkes literally had that do you remember against fabiano their g was it wasn't exactly this but it was castels knight d2 d6 like rook e one rook e8 b4 like like this there was an h3 in there whatever and then that was their game why did he not do that instead he does it this way so now the bishops are going to get traded right so this is a typical thing but this reminds me of the game hikaru prague which if you remember in that game exactly what happened here happened there bishop e6 and you know karu took took and nobody won because it was just way too solid vidit now play b5 so he plays this aggressive way and gukesh is like really what if i just play knight back to b8 like who are you attacking right are you going to take are you going to go here are you going to play queen c2 how are you actually going to put me under pressure well vid it takes spends 10 minutes he trades and he plays queen c2 meanwhile this knight continues moving now vid plays d4 so vid's opening two fronts of attack he opening in the center he's attacking on the queen side the queen goes to e8 and now vidit makes a very bad move makes a very big mistake he gets the rook off the a file there a lot of things you can do here none of them particularly look that appealing white want the computer wants d5 and c4 just wants to shut the whole thing down that looks impossible to play as a human cuz black puts the knight on c5 it just does not look very pleasant at all i mean there is knight h4 attacking ideas here for white but vid goes rook e one and ges on corks pure savagery immediately taking on be doesn't even think goes to a5 takes the entire a file and at this point the game is over like it it this is the thing about highle chess he got the a file the only open file the game is over the engine could maybe defend this with white and vidit is going to try but my man gukesh literally just termin just acts like the terminator stops the whole queen side advancement puts the rook on the a2 square puts the rook back on the a3 square brings in the queen and then he brings in 19 points of material down this open port he has got a massive shipment and it is going down the a file vidit tries his best but ul ultimately what happens in this game as gukesh infiltrates is vidit has to chuck some pawns and in this position it is forced checkmate in 11 moves and gukesh finds it check here hunt the king the king walks glue the knights together and pawn to g5 is mate so you have to sacrifice your knight and gkes plays que he doesn't even take queen g3 is mate so you got to go back rook f1 threatens rook f4 and rook f5 and g5 and queen g3 lukesh sacrifices the rook gives a check plays knight h7 and this is mate gukesh found forc check made in 11 moves after losing a heartbreaking game against ali resa fuja this man gesha is on another level and these are your standings after eight rounds of the candidates hikaru just shook up the world he is now half a point away from gukesh and yan who have led this tournament wire to wire but the men are separated by a point between five people and there are six rounds to go what a around the women have a three-way time for first and katarina lagno is knocking on the door with a point away incredible stuff thank you all so much for tuning in i'm going to go watch ufc 300 get out of here
