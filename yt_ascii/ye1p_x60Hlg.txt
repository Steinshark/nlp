ladies and gentlemen what am i famous for you might think i'm famous for my devilish good looks or my signature sense of humor some of you might not think i'm famous at all and others may be wondering wow this is the first video i've watched from this guy ever he's so arrogant all of those things may or may not be true but i am famous for one thing and one thing only it is screaming about sacrificing the rook the rook is a chest piece it resembles a castle and each side starts with two of them in the corners of the board the rook is worth five points it's somewhere between a knight and a bishop and a queen and sacrificing it can sometimes lead to some very nice things and the game that i'm going to show you today encapsulates the art and the culture of sacrificing not just one but two rooks in one game you see this game was was played a couple of days ago at a tournament in europe and the competitors are daniel darta who is the number one ranked player in belgium and he's only' years of age and shakri ar mamedyarov who is in his 30s he is a longtime top 10 player in the world and he's rated over 2700 now i have a complaint can i just complain about something real quick before we get into this game daniel d is the highest rated player the highest elo player in belgium and it's not close belgium does not have a strong chess culture the next youngest grandmaster in belgium is born in 1994 and then it's a bunch of 40 and 50 year olds he's a national icon and he doesn't even have a social media page like i couldn't find a twitter maybe he has an instagram young chess grand masters who want to build themselves up and develop some sort of following and everything like that they got to they got to put themselves out there that's that's my complaint that is my plea to them people have to be interested in them now having said all of that daniel please take my advice he starts this game with pawn to d4 d4 is a very good move it's move one i don't even know what we're analyzing black responds knight to f6 knight f6 trying to play either an e6 or a g6 opening this could lead to a nso indian this could lead to a kings indian or a grunfeld now we have c4 g6 played by midaro you'll notice he is either going to play this or this you have no information is he going to play a king's indian is he going to play a grunfeld none of that really matters because in this position white plays h4 so this is a very bold move this is a massive overc commitment meaning you're probably not going to castle this way if you do then i mean the position's really going to have to lock up otherwise your king's going to be open and in many lines if black just develops white will actually in the future just play this move h5 now right now white might not do that because black will take and this sacrifice of the rook is not particularly good you do not have the backup to do that you could play e4 and try to take this but black is just a little bit too solid so what white does here with this move h4 is sends a warning shot this is like hey if your knight ever leaves i'm going to go h5 and i'm going to get some sort of attack and then taking me is going to be real bad because i'm going to get my rook in there i'm going to go e4 take the center boom have eyes on that so it's a very interesting move and it was played at the top level many years ago by that i mean like 7 years ago or something like that maybe maybe 5 years ago in a game mvl guk from the candidates in fact i think it was in 2020 so you know that listen three years of ages older than like half of the youtube audience bishop to g7 knight c3 and now my medarov plays an interesting move in this position black can play like a kings indian black can play c5 like a kings indian is black can play the grunfeld but this move again the knight needs to cover h5 so you really don't want to allow the knight to right you don't want that so midaro though plays a move that i've never seen in my life it doesn't mean it's bad it just means it hasn't really been played and that move is knight c6 that's a very provocative move and you'll notice that based on d's time usage he clearly was not ready for the move knight c6 he spends 8 minutes on his fifth move the idea of knight c6 is simple you want white to go d5 that's the point then you're going to go here white has to guard this pawn by playing this move and now black is going to play d6 and if white plays the move f4 black is going to get to the g4 square and nobody can kick the knight out so you can't really play f4 you're going to have to develop some other pieces and black is going to happily live with the knight in the center which is why knight f3 is played but midaro prevents excuse me darta prevents the knight from going to e5 midar does not care he just puts the kn on b4 so black has just developed his setup without moving any central pawns white meanwhile gets a full center and attacking possibilities on the king side you would think that he's very happy right now here i really don't understand why white did not go e4 obviously he did not like that black would get ownership of that square if you play a3 the knight runs around to c5 and if you try to prevent that then black suddenly snipes you from the other side of the board now having said that this is actually not the worst position in the world for white because you can can play h5 and create some sort of attack but it's difficult to do this and just lose a rook if you don't know what the followup is so that's that but d plays a move here that i don't really like he plays a move which is fine which is pawn to g3 but as you can see from the computer it's not happy and he spent 11 minutes on that move which is how you know you know you're in like imagine spending 11 minutes at a cafe ordering an item and i don't mean like sitting there talking to your friend and then deciding when the waiter comes i mean staring at a menu for 11 minutes like you overthought it you know what i mean like you should have just gotten something if you spend 11 minutes ordering something at a cafe you got something you didn't want to get you're going to get something and then regret getting it does that make sense same thing in chess okay g3 is a weird move like if you wanted to play g3 you should have just done it in the beginning if you wanted to play a g3 setup you should have just played it on the third move and then black would have went here and then maybe mmy jar would have went d5 or whatever and you know you you would have had a position like this or a position like this when you play knight c3 and h4 you're trying to attack your opponent baits you into being aggressive and then you follow up with this like little g3 move it's almost as bad as being the number one ranked player in a country by a mile and a half and not having social media anyway i digress black plays e6 so mov spends time for the first time in the game and plays a very provocative c attacking move just basically saying look if this guy's not going to play h5 then i don't really know what i'm doing here i'm going to play e6 and we're going to build up on the e file and i'm going to play c62 like we're going to crack open the center d kicks the knight out but we already talked about this it's actually maybe even better for the knight for black to be on a6 because it'll rotate the center it's a very very obscure position darta now plays bishop g2 which makes sense because he's just played g3 my mov now takes in the center and black here can play excuse me white can play knight takes or pawn takes both moves are about the same the reason that black makes that trade is now the rook gets the entire open file and after d6 the bishop can come out and the knight can go to c5 so white played in a very provocative way and tried to be very aggressive but it's not really working out rook e8 and now d does castle and you may remember i told you that castling for white is sort of a thing right it's it's it's sort of a weird thing because you what about like why did you go why this should be here but all right you know fine we'll put the pawn on h4 but remember when you when you have the pawn here you're a little weak you have weaknesses here that they can't really be exploited anytime soon but anyway knight c5 okay my miar spends another two minutes puts his knight in the center he wants to put the knight on e4 that trade will make progress into white's position and now darta plays the best move he plays pawn to d6 that's a very good move that move severely restricts the black position it is now much harder for black to develop if you take with black i don't actually have to take back with my queen i'm going to go here and then i'm going to go there and you're going to say well no you're not idiot you should have taken me when you had the chance now see now i'm going to justify this move and after something like knight takes i'll even take with the pawn i don't mind i'll take with the bishop i'll take with the pawn black's got a bad structure suddenly daniel d is a genius and i'm an idiot but he still should get social media seriously you got to promote yourselves guys the best you're the best chess player in an entire country all right nobody nobody knows promote yourself seriously anyway mov plays c6 he had to do something because if he played a move like b6 to try to get his bishop out this way i'm going to take and then i'm going to go here and then i'm going to put my knight there and then i'm going to move that knight and then i'm going to take your rook and then it's going to get real bad so c6 white is better okay white is better because he has a little bit more space here he's controlling black's position it's a small advantage okay but he has a couple of things going against him all right he is down a lot on time a lot he's down like 30 something minutes and his advantage is a little bit it's it's ofus skated is that a word like it it's mysterious and enshrouded by smoke and it's not very clear like white has an advantage but how is he going to push it forward is he going to go here is he going to go here some of you are wondering where is the rook sacrifice right like where well p knight d2 wow okay so undevelop a knight why did he do that well he probably thought about bishop f4 clearly he didn't like this move i don't know if he didn't like it because of knight h5 i don't know if he didn't like it because it doesn't really do enough and black is just going to develop his i don't know but he played knight d2 and the idea of knight d2 could be to bring the knight that way it could be to play e4 maybe he wants to play e4 he wants to play b4 e4 f4 e5 like you know in a perfect world yeah white could somehow i i i don't know get all these pawns to the center and and being that's why he probably played knight d2 now here myar plays the best move which is taking space on the queen side the amazing thing is he played that move in two minutes like the fact look at m's time management this dude hates thinking he didn't think the whole early stage thought for three minutes on this move then he then he took he hasn't spent more than like two minutes on any of these moves look at that c6 a5 he plays so fast a5 prevents white from playing b4 you also want to play a4 and clamp down on the light squares maybe you're going to play b5 and bishop a6 and rook b8 and basically say like look this pawn's a thorn but i can't do anything about it so rook e6 something weird happens here again daniel you know responding to the play over here he could have played knight b3 to try to trade the knights but then black would have moved the knight to the middle and then this knight would have not wouldn't have had a target and a4 would have come so it's a tough position it's a it's a tough position you know maybe you play rook b1 and try to play b4 but then the guy's going to go a4 i don't know i'm just glad i have to commentate the game and not and not actually you know anyway b3 okay now my mov says bro who's getting this pawn and from this point forward the players begin a very aggressive battle against each other the players now engage in in in hand toand combat basically this pawn is very hard to protect if white plays knight c4 black plays b5 then you have to move this knight somewhere if you move the knight to b2 that just looks stupid and i'm not going to analyze it if you move the knight to e3 it's still very difficult to defend this pawn cuz i will go here or here or here so clearly d saw this move what did he have in mind this what what he lost the pawn no actually it's a very creative move by d number one ranked player in belgium doesn't just happen overnight the idea of this move is that the time black spends doing this it's like being in a very bad parking spot getting out is going to be really difficult and there are moves like bishop to h3 which actually cut off the rook's escape that rook might have to die somehow right now d does it this way he plays knight c4 kicking the rook back that's three moves invested in moving the rook nothing else in the black position is moved now here comes the bishop now d has pressure here and pressure here and he's going to put a rook on the defile and he's going to play b4 b5 and black still hasn't moved three pieces can we just address this black has played nearly 20 moves in this game he hasn't touched his queen as bishop aris rook that's 17 points of material that have not been moved midar continues not moving them he undevelop the bishop to the home square all of these pieces are on their home squares to guard his knight that's crazy now darta attacks the rook so the rook has to go back again that's one two three and four moves every piece in d's position is playing the rooks are about to come to the center and he's going to play b4 but black is a pawn up what are you going to do about that well d saw all the way here and his idea was b4 and that's actually a very good move because it's very difficult for black to do something for instance if black plays ab ab trades the rook trades the rook and puts his knight in the center white is going to go take take bishop g2 and after something like pawn to d5 excuse me if rook takes there would have been bishop g2 if this you can even play something absurd like rook a8 and i mean listen i got to tell you five out of six pieces on the back rings good pressure nice position for white very difficult to move for black that was kind of the idea now if the knight just moves without taking no i'm going to keep moving i'm going to play knight b6 and you've got a very unpleasant position it was a good idea unfortunately at this point midar activates the trap card of being 2734 formerly 2800 and he throws a counter punch the punch comes in mid yarov slips slaps it away and boom the overhand right pawn to d5 midaro is a gotham chess subscriber the knight is hanging so he counterattacks the knight and the bishop but wait a minute let's calculate this if white takes the knight black takes the bishop so what if we take the bishop then if you take the knight i will get out if you take the bishop and then takes can't i get the this okay wait a minute bishop takes c8 what is mamedyarov doing queen takes remember a while ago i told you that if you're going to castle after playing this move you're going to have some weaknesses yeah i think a lot of you are look like queen this is very scary looking you you got to be really sure that there's some something here for white now d plays bishop takes c5 and what d was probably expecting is bishop takes c5 pawn takes pawn takes now white is worse but white is going to cover the infiltration and then white is probably going to try to win this pawn and maybe white will survive no bishop takes c8 queen takes c8 by the way that's a fork it doesn't work because queen h3 knight g4 is just checkmate i told you a long time ago white did this in a way that was very dangerous for his own king so bishop takes c5 and now my friends i would like to reward your 17-minute attention span by showing you a nasty discusting sequence of moves shakri aramar in this position could play bishop takes and go for that end game he could go for that end game middle late stage and and just win it up upon but instead of that mamid yarov leaves the bishop he leaves the knight he leaves everything and he still plays queen h3 now that move makes plenty of sense because the threat is knight g4 and mate however did he blunder something did midar make a mistake m ak because white just has to stop knight g4 or the queen going to h2 white could either play knight to e3 or knight to d2 knight f3 and he does just that that knight was hanging it is now no longer hanging and it's going to f3 where it will stop checkmate mam jarov removes the bishop from the board what just happened wait the thread is mate but the knight is stopping mate well mamar saw one detail that was missed by his opponent and in this position mamar sacrificed the rook rook to e3 one of the most disrespectful rook sacrifices i have ever seen rook sacrifices are generally violent you smash through a position not that move but you smash through you sacrifice it for a knight to open up the king you you very rarely slide it down the board and it stays alive but it goes straight through fire you cannot take this because in this position i will take with check and then i will take the pawn i am forking the queen the knight and mate a triple fork of epic proportions the most powerful piece you have the second most powerful piece you have and the square which matters the most and then if i take this and your rook was here it would be another fork but you know that's wishful thinking rook to e3 and my friend friends the other thread of this move is to take the knight which stops mate so the only way to survive here is to make sure the king can run you have to play rook to e1 the idea is that after take take queen h2 that's not a checkmate and after queen h1 i escape where do i escape e2 so what does black have to do in this position you go all the way back here rook to e1 black has to sacrifice the rook again leaving it exactly where it is and white's position is completely defenseless the threat is renewed rook takes f3 queen h2 and queen to h1 there is absolutely nothing you can do the only thing you can do with white is to get hit with this move and lose your queen queen takes g4 take take take and try to survive this position position where black feasts on all your pawns and promotes you will not survive this and the game ends in one of the most disrespectful ways i have ever seen black already put one rook on e3 and now he's going to sacrifice it in this position darta plays queen d3 the idea is very simple he is losing his queen that's what he wants he want wants his queen to be captured and then he wants rook e one rook e one and he wants to defend this position but instead of that rook takes d3 pawn takes d3 it seems like the attack has been stopped but midara sacrifices the rook again on the exact same square it doesn't matter that the queen is gone the threat r is once again rook takes knight and there is nothing to be done if you play rook takes then i take this is mate and if you take then i take and you go here and i take and then i take and then i take and then damn it i will take literally everything you own have you ever seen something like this this man just put one rook on e3 followed by the winning of the queen and he still put a rook on e3 oh good oh my god maybe it's good daniel d doesn't have social media but he really should have one after this game this man just put two rooks on the exact same square in the same game there's nothing you can do if you take with the pawn i take and you get m it on the next move king here that's m king here that's m i that's mate geez i daniel darter resigned in this position because i can't imagine getting hit with the exact same rook sacrifice twice in i mean that is ah that's crazy i oh my good my friend sent me this game i was smiling i was like that's nasty that's all i have for you today i hope this was nice now get out of here
