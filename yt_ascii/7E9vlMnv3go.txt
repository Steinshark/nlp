so hello everybody i'm here with benedict and talia sheehan you have probably seen them on my channel before and so benedict is a composer and talia is a choir conductor they are at saint econ seminary they they direct the choir there but benedict is also a composer and recently in the past few years he has been kind of this you know this crazy ascending moment and he is now nominated for grammy for his for his liturgy and i just wanted to talk about it because i've been really excited to follow him social media to see all the attention that his work is getting so i'm really looking forward to hearing about how he is able to be a liturgical composer in the contemporary world this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world so benedict please tell us a little bit about what's going on with your liturgy i mean i think it's not even just your literacy or all the other things that are yeah so just to be just to be clear it's it's actually not my liturgy that i'm nominated for right now oh okay so but but it's actually for my work as a as a chorus master or a choral a choral preparer for the cas for the kastowski requiem recording that just came out at the end of august my liturgy got released in october which means it's in the next it's in the next year's round for the grammys so it's too early to know about that one but i'm hopeful i mean it's it there's it's gotten great reviews and it's it's also like number one on the classical charts for it was number yeah it debuted number two on the billboard which was great i mean that's pretty pretty awesome for a thing that is produced by you know more or less by saying by saying take guns to dairy we we haven't even had ever enjoyed that kind of spotlight so it's pretty awesome yeah well to me it's like there's a it's a testimony to some of the things that i've been thinking about or i would set the testimony to my own journey too or to other people that we know like andrew and other i would say people who are really striving for excellence and have felt like the contemporary art scene is stale and so trying to revivify traditional form but not in a just not in a i would say not in a kind of nostalgic desire to crack the past but in this alive this form that's alive and that is connecting to a real community yeah that's exactly exactly the way i would put it wouldn't you agree yeah it's born out of the sort of you know it's born out of the daily life but worship is here at this place at this monastery and partly it's it was actually that that work the work of oh gracious excuse me oh we're gonna have to edit that out we actually still have a well we actually still have a funnel find for no earthly reason that i can come up with no reason at all yeah but i think it's just nostalgia actually there needs to be some physical connection even though my wife refuses to have a cell phone and so we have a landline and it's the main phone for our house and she just refuses to have a cell phone which i admire her greatly because i refuse for like i didn't have a cell phone until about 2017 and wow and then but then i was just forced by everything to get one and since yeah completely addicted so yeah which i like it's a good tool it's just the tool starts using us after a while but the yeah so i mean okay you're saying that it was born out of the the prayer life and the worship life of the monastery yeah and and you know to to a great extent the you know so there has to be context for artists and and the more immediate the context is the more it's grounded in in in a a daily experience kind of the more validated the art is and that's definitely what's happened here at saint economics because you know we have the privilege it's also a burden to a certain extent but the privilege of the worship being exclusively vocal and exclusively almost exclusive exclusively coral and exclusively unaccompanied which puts an artistic constraint on what we do in a way that necessitates creativity and you know if you have to do it every second every single day that's even that's even more interesting you will go insane if you aren't doing something creative so that the abbot here father sergius is is hugely supportive of the work to you know to create beautiful worship singing because a it's just like as frequently as they have to do it and they have to endure the doing of it like it had it had better not be awful like please let's fix problems let's not just let problems sort of sit we gotta do something about this but then also to kind of cultivate a vision and and that's really what what to say it comes from the life here at the monastery it really is it really is that it's born out of that that vision for what it could be yeah right and so and so in part i mean so so the the the the liturgy that i composed and that we recorded you know that's not the kind of music or this gale of music that we could sing every day church like to be clear that this is not every day kind of you know like you you get up it's 6 00 a.m and you go and sing the liturgy it's not that thank goodness yes you know so it's like if if you're you know it's like the difference between you know your kind of work outfit that you go to do carpentry and and you know a a black tie you know a black tie outfit or a ball get down or something like that but i do think these things are are very they're very integrally connected because you have to be able to to to look up words and to look outwards and to see you know we we say that the liturgy is an i kind of the kingdom of god a lot of the time it doesn't feel like the kingdom of god at all but but it's okay because in a sense like every now and then you might get it you might get an inkling of that and and that and that little glimpse is enough to sustain everything else that you do and to inspire everything else that you do so i kind of see the the the work of trying to create like new great works that arise out of the or out of the orthodox con text of worship but are not just aimed at at it is is part of in trying to inspire a new a a new how can i say it a new school of art a new a new a new reason to put it to put energy and res sources into to this that's what the saint evan choir was now and this performance of the gustalsky rapidium because that's obviously not a liturgical work and not only is it not a liturgical work it incorporates like it it's it's a it's an almost an international work it has custody envisioned it as being representative of of the international you know the allies of the allies in world war one and so he he envisioned it that way and then the performance of it almost winds up being like a work of diplomacy because the forces are so huge there were three three ensembles four four four three choirs and four choirs and an orchestra that went into doing this and it really it felt like talking about symphony you know like it felt like multiple levels of reality coming together to do a thing all to the same purpose and then the you know and then the pieces and then the pieces itself it weaves together religious music from the traditions of all the allies so there's there's there's there there's repression or there's a russian orthodox chant but there's but but there's gory enchant and there's and there and then there's an episcopal he came to tunes and american hymns but they're about there but there's also there there's also a japanese is like like it was a shinto melody in there and there's and there and there's an indian vedic here him but the idea being that that through this kind of expression of honoring the dead through through stone it brings together all the nations of the world into this one single sound and it's a beautiful beautiful image and it's a beautiful piece of music so that that's that i i see that that all of that is connected to this kind of routine work of trying to be in church all the time the wealth that we take and we offer as worship is is necessarily created outside of the worship the economy that sustains the church is not and it's it's not a closed system so we have to be creating we have to be creating wealth outside of worship in order to enrich worship yeah and i think that you're one of the things that kind of hits me as i'm listening to speak is one of the strength of the way that the orthodox will envision reality and to envision it in terms of a hierarchy instead of envisioning it in terms of opposites or in terms of this is inside this is outside you know this is good this is bad but rather seeing it as this outflowing of a hierarchy and so when you talked about the idea that let's say you try to aim with your your own composition to something which in a way is not accessible to the everyday choir of every church but nonetheless becomes an aim and that's what hierarchy does is that you can have an aim and then the fact that you don't reach that aim doesn't mean that you're going to hell it just means that you're that you're moving that everything is moving and kind of in this discussion with the higher things and trying to embody them as much as possible in the moment that we're living today and understanding that we fail all the time and that we're always kind of not reaching that ideal and so i think there's something very powerful about what you said and and talia which you talked about the idea of an economy which is outside the church i think that that's that's really very a very powerful way of understanding it which is that in a way liturgical music doesn't have the it doesn't have the symphonic aspect like you said that something which is outside the church could have but it's fed by the simpler patterns that we or the more pure patterns that we find in liturgy or that we find even in iconography can then boil over and how funny is that it will act sometimes look like the outside works are more complex or more subtle or all of these things you know like right novel obviously it's more subtle and more complex than the the liturgical pattern but the liturgical pattern has this purity which then kind of unfolds and kind of sprinkle down into all these other works that's a really beautiful way to yeah that's a beautiful way to put quite that sorry we have we have a that's okay we have the real because i do this every day i have a door that closes and everybody knows in the house well we do too but it's we but it's not well lit the room that we we wanted to use it's all right we have we have a lot of kids in a small in a small space so it's just part of the it's part of the for it's part of the work of it but i love this idea of identifying identifying patterns you know because we we have this idea some times that like that that the patterns that you see in church art are somehow are somehow the origin of all the other patterns that you see in in art but i actually tend to see them as kind of the as kind of the dis down of them they're they're not the origin church art and the life of the church of the church draws on everything it borrows from everything well good way to understand it i would say is the difference between let's say you could say that it's it's the if they're the origin in the sense that they're closer to the source or the but they're also not the origin in terms of body the body comes from the outside right right out of the body christian iconography is based on roman art they took all the roman tropes of art and then they like you said exactly distilled them removed some things adjusted some things and then kind of push them towards something push them towards a very pure language compared to the very sensual and and you know chaotic language of late roman art yeah so the quote i guess the question has always been for us how to feed this because i we we both feel that we're in a time right now where where church art has become really has become rather poor in terms of both the understanding of it and more importantly the practice of it and i think we see it the most clearly at least where else we see it the most clearly in how people how people sing in church and and kind of the energy of the difficulty the difficulty with how you sing in church is that you have to do it over and over and over again right you can't just like to do it and then and then it's all done it's like every time you go to church you have to sing again and ever and every minute that you're in church you have to you have to keep that's on the right take like that's a good take that's not how it works in church right yeah right right so so in in a way tr the this is this is staining of music in the church is the work of sustaining the people and the work of sustaining their abilities the work of sustaining their their their just their ability to be there and and and unfortunately sustaining their interests they're right exactly sustaining their interests which is to a great extent i think why a lot of a lot of church singing is suffering from a lack of talent because without a sort of without something of a transcendent vision that kind of gives gives direction to the everyday task of of you know the the the clothes that you wear to go do carpentry then it it becomes very drying and so you know in in in education in teaching people i like to call it an extended purpose it's like that thing that everybody focuses their energy on that's a that's a sort of an intermediate goal it's not it's not the next life you know it's not paradise some are too far away that's that yeah you can't you can't effectively work towards that on an everyday level you have to have an intermediate goal and i think to a great extent we use pasca as that intermediate goal but there also has to be artistic intermediate goals and without working to kind of find that for your average everyday you know person participating in worship it's really hard to maintain the dryness of of the routine and so i mean i'm curious because i don't i've confessed this to you guys into people who watch my videos before that i don't understand music but my so i'm curious so when you write let's say you wrote the liturgy so i listened i listened to the liturgy and i have to admit that i did find it i was trying to to be as aware as possible and i did what i found like my experience of it was it kept moving me from something from someone who who has been to church for for several years now something familiar and then kind of moving me into an unfamiliar space and then kind of bringing me back into a familiar space and i kept feeling this this tug where all of a sudden i'm like okay i know where i am and then all of a sudden i'm not so sure anymore but then there's a little something that reminds me you know it's as if i didn't think i had a i didn't think i had a musical vocabulary if it means to be in church but i could kind of feel that happening to me if i would listen to it so i don't know if that's really i don't know if i'm onto something i have no idea well that's kind of the experience of development in music there's always an establishment of a baseline and that baseline is kind of like a a contract between the listener and the performer or the composer depending on how you scale the relationship and and so you know where you're starting from and then there has to be a sort of hero's journey and that in musical terms that's called development and that might be you know chord changes it might be texture changes but there's always there's always some sort of of movement away from the initial stability and this is of course the monomyth and there's ways of interpreting music according to this structure that are pretty pretty widely used but that sense of i'm here now i've moved away and it's uncertain and it's unstable but then it gets resolved again is absolutely right that's a theme that you that it goes through all of music on many levels of resolution right exactly i mean that the whole idea of of the sonata form which is where all the great pennies of the past relied on the idea of a b and then a return of a and you know in some sense that's like the history of time the history of mankind it's you know in in in the repression world view of beginning from places to that is yet incomplete it's not it's not fully for formed it's naive it's young and then it has to fall or depart or to go out it has to leave in some way and experience trial and er and adversity and and ch change and growth and and and evolution and then at some po point it then and then it returns to that place of stability but it's by but it's been made new it's transformed it's been it's been it's mature you know so so that's that's in a sense that's the story of mankind in in in our world view but and i think you know like you think about like any pop song is in a sense aba it's like you know it begins with you know production it builds to the bridge and then you come back to the beginning again and it's the most satisfying thing to be satisfied it's the three acts that's that familiar content but with the with the knowledge that you gained or with the perspective that you gained having traveled away from it and that's why the hook brings you back you know it's just like oh yes so it's been i'm glad so anyway i'm glad i'm glad to know that you're kind of experiencing that on a route level as you're as you're listening because i that means like okay that means i'm i'm kind of on the right it helps me know that i'm on the right track in some way because i mean i know there's a kind of myth i think that we have about about about about composers that you know and i think i think that com composers very often tend to help perpetuate this this myth them them themselves and which is that like of course it was all my of course i planned all this you know but really i would say i mean i don't know what goes through the mind of other composers but but i susp the fact that a lot of us don't really plan anything i mean we i mean there there there there's all kinds of techniques that you use to to kind of organize and to get things to get things to move when they're when they're kind of stopped up and and prompt or a prompt you know like our autistic forms are are but they often act as a good pro pro prompt but then but when you i actually sit down to do the work of like what is what is the next note what is the next sound no you don't know what's going to come out and and and so often then you look then on the back and you're like oh that's that's what i was trying to do but you didn't know at the time yeah you just kind of you did it but it's just like you you and i'm sure that i i'm sure that there's an analog to doing the visual art for sure analog to doing to writing stories or to telling stories i always tell because people always ask me oh i wish i could use the symbolic stuff you're talking about to write stories and so there and i tell them stop thinking about symbolism when you're writing a story you have to exactly like think about symbolism before think about symbolism after but don't do that while you're writing your story you're gonna not you won't be able to do anything like just let it go the hat let it happen and then after that you can maybe edit it and and maybe you know you can notice what you're doing like you said and then adjust some aspects which maybe aren't totally in line with what it is you're seeing that's happening but don't while you're writing seriously don't don't don't do that yeah i know exactly and so i have a i haven't he had to learn to actually to forcefully and it was an act of will ignore the suggestion that arose to to take that kind of a critical perspective on his work as he was working yeah and and you know sometimes he tells this this part isn't a secret that that you know for a time he's a carpenter professionally and and it was the it was the immediacy of the having to get the job done it was almost the contractual obligation and the fact that you know this was some place somebody or something needed to live and it just had to get done meant that it was training and how to apply it that how to quiet that sort of insecure voice and and you know that's kind of a procedural cognition right there's like rational cognition and procedural cognition your body just has to know to do a thing in order for you know it's almost like we have two different brains the the part that thinks and the part that that does we're always trying to align them so you know you're doing you're composing you're carving it's like just let the doing part do its thing and you'll find this incredible you know complexity and wonder it's like trust the procedural brain we have to train it some too but yeah training happens by doing it's like there's some things that especially in carving for example there are some things that i'm doing now that i never thought it's only when i now that i would take a picture of an old carving and a new carving and i realized oh i'm doing this differently but i never thought about it i didn't plan it out it just it's just as you're doing all of a sudden like you said you your body you're in this flow of making and your body realizes that if i do it this way it's better and it's cleaner and it's nicer and it just kind of happens and so for sure when i'm carving i'm not thinking about i'm not thinking about what i'm doing in the same way that if i'm making a video for example if i'm talking about a subject yeah that's why my brain is actually free when i'm carving when i'm carving i can listen to i can listen to like seven hours of a podcast because it's there's like my body is doing this but my mind is actually quite quite available yeah well so this is the this is the the elephant of the rider which would be an interesting thing talked about but i interrupted you so i don't no i mean i had i guess i have a big question coming from someone who doesn't understand music yeah my my big question is so you so you write let's say this liturgy and my question is what makes it a liturgy i mean except for not just the words obviously the words we know that that's what that's the obvious answer yeah but what is it about let's say the way that you approach the music which makes it a liturgical piece rather than just something that you hear on the radio or whatever other type or another type of music that that could be or dancing music or whatever it is that's a really really hard question it's possibly a hugely subjective question yeah well i mean there are there are certainly things that are not suggestive like you know well i think that well i i think the words are in some way the most the most the most obvious answer like in the orthodox tradition we you know over the over the last couple millennia we more or less arrived at at a point where things like words are kind of sentenced to down so words and then perhaps except if we want to translate this well but translational plating is a major issue right yes and and then and then and then the order in which those words appear appear you know like in a sense like when what hypnography comes after but that that has certainly been things you know that that has been subject to change in the past but it hasn't changed a lot in the last i don't know 400 or 500 years but i guess it's this thing i i would say it would start from this thing called that we culture that we call tradition but which is the thing i'm always kind of trying to underst stand what what what it is because we we often we tend to use that word to mean an old thing rather than a new thing and i think that's not at all what it means tradition is really a series of new things it it's it's it's maybe a better word is life and and the way in which life is always linear so like dies a tree keeps on growing and it keeps on producing new branches and new leaves and new fruits and the trunk grows the tower every part of the tree grows the tree roots go deeper it produces new trees and and but but all of that growth is though it's in a sense omnidir retrospective it's still always it's a linear in some ways in some way it's it's always connected to what came before it it proposed in secret in sequence so there's a continuity yeah there's a continuity in in terms of communal continuity that is we're a part of the same community and there's continuity in the sense of continuation which is that i take what those that are there before have handed to me and now i continue with that as a the day that's complicated by the strange mobility that we have as modern people and by being in the united states like okay so you and i jonathan were both converts and that's the kind of mobility that humans really that was inconceivable to the vast majority of humans through the vast majority of human history like why would you separate yourself from your your identity from the network that has actually borne you and nurtured you and given you any agency that you have why would you willingly separate yourself from that in order to follow an individual conviction first of all individuals weren't actually permitted to do anything of the sort for the vast majority you just die like who are you gonna get food from forget it right yeah so we have this like weird privilege that we can actually make these decisions for ourselves but what that means because we can make these decisions for ourselves and i personally firmly believe that that would have been impossible without christ because it was christ that called us to individual conscience as opposed to group conscience and so that's like that was a little revolution in humanity but we have this weird thing now where we bring to as by just being plugged into this suddenly we bring the the places we were before into the tradition which means that what seemed like worship to people who knew something other than orthodox worship is now now it has to be listened to it has to it has to actually be somehow at least yeah yeah and and now part of the church and that life we can't just ignore that life and and be you know society for creative anachronism and and and try and maintain i okay which i think is great i'm not saying we're not saying anything bad about these yes yeah it's really a cool thing and the church sometimes does feel like yes it does but you know what frankly black tie is sca a little bit it is too and going to the opera is also s and if we don't if we don't have those things in our lives it yeah it's pretty awesome but his voice as a composer is necessarily influenced by his experience in a culture that is not exclusively christian or exclusively orthodox yeah i think that one of the things that one of the ways of understanding it in terms of the tree let's say is that we have this strange situation where let's say that the tradition the tree of the orthodox tradition is now been planted in the soil that it doesn't know and now all the nutrients that that are there all the possibilities that are there are not the usual nutrients and so it'll cause a transformation in the tree but there has to be a way for it to be transformed so that we still recognize the tree or else then or else what or else why are we not then why did we become orthodox in the first place because whatever we just become presbyterian or just become some some other some other thing and so there's there's i think like you said it's like as if there's a more intense discussion which is happening in america also because of the mixture of different ethnic groups you know coming together in this strange land of mixture so it's it's like an accelerated it's like an accelerated laboratory something which maybe of maybe it would have happened over centuries you know at the media places where russia came in contact with other cultures and georgians were you know fighting with russians but also in the same church and all this kind of stuff that would infiltrate and transform culture is happening in in like fast forward well as it as is the rate of technological advancement yeah so many things about like so many things about about our lives right now are so much better and effective and easier than they were 15 years ago yeah you know and and that kind of innovation comes from that's happening all over the world and that's happening all over the world right and and that comes from the uncomfortable like the negotiation between conflicting conflicting forces right and and i think the liturgy is this in incredible it's like it's some people experience it as a war i was just talking to one of the monks who was like you know what the liturgy is it's it's fighting i experienced the other in the other players he did not mean like you know like the idea of spiritual world warfare and doing about it with the t demons which i think some people have all kinds of weird ideas about but no he's just like he's like no no when i'm serving the choir is the actual enemy yeah you know fire is the enemy the altar servers are the enemy but it's like it's like a sport right it's like a game where it's our voluntary participation in that conflict that actually creates this thing that's like a positive some game like it's way more valuable than had we not engaged in that conflict yeah and that's that's tantalizing but it's about it's about these things that don't in a sense go to get together and then the work of trying to put them to get to to get together and what else is what else is chris even a or the idea of god becoming men or the uncreated and the created i mean like things that don't go together that don't belong to to get together and yet somehow they have to negotiate and they have to come together to get to get together the idea of of love is exactly what that's what that is it's it's too in a sense mutually opposed or realities having to to you to unite so and it's the pattern that it's just the pattern of everything i mean everything is like that and so the the let's say the distinction between like you said a fight and a dance if you watch two boxers you'll realize how close those two realities are yeah they're coming into rhythm with the person that in front of you they're trying to understand where they're going where what anticipate their next movement all of this is part of the of how you you do engage in a fight and then so hopefully hopefully that that fight looks more like a dance in the christian in the in the christian world and say but i can understand the analogy perfectly yeah well right and so in that that way that's kind of to go back to what you were asking at the at the beginning of like how do i write a liturgy what what what is it that will that will make it a liturgy i'm in a sense i'm doing battle with with the tradition as i've received it it's this negotiation yeah or just a straight up a battle where it's like i've received a thing it's like no this is not going to work for me or it's not going to work for us but i still understand you and respect you so i'm going to come up with a different answer that i think you will agr that that you might agr agree with or you might accept you know it's not like me trying to assert my own in individual quality it's this sense of how do i unite myself to this the thing that so often if you know is so what is seems so alien and so and so other and so remote it's like the act of of jacob having to to fight with the angel you know it's like we we don't we don't i don't think the idea of like trying to conform to the will of god is just like oh just do do whatever you want you know no like no it's like we went like for for us saying to god do whatever you want i don't think i don't think that's how god he i don't think he god created us to be like that i think we sure hope not i mean because i mean yeah because so but but i think you can you you we there's only there's so many there's so many arenas in which we can kind of we we have to bump up against this this god that we that we believe in and but a lot of the time it's like no i don't agree we agree with you i'm not going to do it like that and then god is like well how about how about the the the this and like i mean like well how about this and he could be like well okay but maybe and then the sense of like having to give in association it's a yeah the the habit of seeing obviously deacon's father sergius has this great thing about the orthodox well here all that you say just the this the the idea that it's forever you know it has everything oh yeah well yeah you know he's like look can can you imagine how diverse a tradition would have to be in order for it to actually be for everyone and so that necessarily means that there are some things that are for you and there are some things that are for other people right that in the tradition even in the liturgy there are some things which you will have trouble attending to or or that won't necessarily come to to meet you but that they're there for them completely that's fine yeah or or the marketplace or or that just seem meaningless or even kind of wrong or absurd it's like you know basically if it seems that way do you fine all right yeah but it's an interesting idea for you the way that people understand traditional societies like i said the way the people they portray the middle ages is that this monolithic thing with the church as having massive authority and just kind of imposing its authority on everybody but if you actually study the middle ages you realize that it was this flowering crazy time of like everybody was all in these guilds and in these different societies of this saint and societies of this feast and they had they had feasts non-stop like they were constantly celebrating all these odd particular aspects of christianity that we don't even can't understand today like this idea of celebrating this wound of christ and having like a feast about that and so so it was it was actually extremely diverse like you said right because and but the diversity was possible because ultimately was in a hierarchy instead of like you said instead of being this opposite is that we we were able to to be able to all fix our eyes upon something which transcended this diversity and therefore the diversity became acceptable because yes following price here it's just that right now this aspect of christ is the one that's attracting my attention more than right yeah the way that you're looking at it yeah well that's a really interesting point you just said it's attracting my attention right and so the freedom of where to where to focus your attention where to direct your attention was actually given a little bit more i think i mean maybe this is a modern fantasy but it was given a little bit more freely that that that you you knew that there was going to be that there was going to be demands on your attention that you could you could you had agency over and you could decide with your community at whatever level you know you identified whether it was your family or your town or your region munition that that you all could pay attention to various you know important things at various important times and i think right now what we're really struggling with and it's i basically i think it's it's validated by the fact that we call it an attention economy that what we're struggling with is the fact that we don't feel like we have a lot of agency with what we pay attention to but we do we just don't feel so we don't feel like we do partly because and this is you know the other the other part of our work is is this this company we call the artifact institute that is a an attempt to talk about that space outside of worship and to talk about how how it can be ideally constructed in order to create the wealth that we then bring into worship and whether that's cultural wealth or emotional or psychological wealth or actual artistic wealth and that there's a there's a pulsing there's a sequence of attention that is effective in creating a cohesive culture and that that sequence is the common worship the common work and the common feast and that those things themselves are kind of how we perceive we identify a goal we work towards it and then we get a little hit of dopamine because we've attained it right but that applies to individuals at in that applies to relationships as well as individuals yeah so so this this idea of knowing where your attention should go and being free to to direct it as you will is i think directly related to actual like quality of living and and we get some satisfaction some relief from the effort of where to direct our attention when we worship we we see other people directing their attention the same way and we get reinforcement that this directing of our attention is is good and right and then we can be shaped by the millennia of of the wisdom the church has about about who it is we're paying attention to exactly because that's kind of a really big deal but what you're saying is so right in terms of attention because one of the reasons why we talk about the passions is because when we direct our attention towards the passions we become slaves we actually don't have freedom we feel like we have freedom like when someone falls into some some some look obsession or whatever in terms of their attention then they feel like it's them but at some point it's not they're they're being ridden by this passion and they have to sacrifice to it constantly whereas like you said the true freedom of attention will rather bring us up you know together right and so the idea of feasting together or doing something together a task as a family or as a group or as a church or as a community that is that is actually the freeing up of attention from these these these these slave owners that we have you know at the bottom of us right right no that's beautifully put yeah i mean because we we we're we're in a time and i like what you said a while ago about we're we're kind of we're trying to come out these at this making of art from a place not of nostalgia but but actually of kind of gratitude i think that's really important because we we're in a time now where we actually although we we kind of like it's a you know it's it's kind of a rope for us to say we're just busy all all the time and we don't have any free free time but that's that's nonsense sense we actually almost all of our time is free free free time because for so many of us and more people every every year all over the world what we spend our time doing is at some point a thing we chose to do you know that that was not true for people for most people past they they didn't have really any agency in terms of what they did with the great majority of their time they spent a huge majority of their time just trying to get the food that they would eat that day today or or you know or or just to get under cover from the elements or get water or you know or just do the trip do the parade that they were born into but now in the modern age so many of us choose what we choose what we do with our time and if there comes a point where like i don't think what i'm doing with my time is meaningful or good or productive enough or lucrative enough a lot of us even relatively poor people have some freedom to then say i'm gonna do do something else and that and and then and then even for many of us if we don't do that other thing we still have enough to eat we still have a place to to live you know so that's like this is a great this is a great thing about our modern age and so we're we over the last few years we've been we've started to become more and more aware of just the reality that we're that we're in and how grateful we can we ought to be however this has created a new problem because every every solution seems to generate a new problem we get good at solving the old problem we always tend to refer to these as as good pro pro problems i will like our pro i really like our problems but our one of our big problems right now is how do i mean how do i meaningful fully spend my time yeah what do i do with all this with all this new agency and new free free free time and some people just long for no agency right so yeah people do i wish i would just be told what to do because because the reality is that going to get water is meaningful yeah of course one of the difficulties is that as we are able to free ourselves from those kinds of tasks then we're actually low on meaning unless we have something to replace that's the problem but it's not but but i do i don't time for the other i don't know yeah you know but so we tried that for a while yeah we did we did we did three minutes we generated our own electricity i don't know i don't recommend this i mean you know maybe for some people people it's a great idea yeah a lot of work you know but i'm not sure that the the fact that the back to the land movement in the state in the 70s and the 80s would have worked without the rush that a lot of them depend on so i mean it's like we i don't pine for the alternative but i do pine for what how do i do meaningful work and so that is in some way what we're trying to do to answer with our with our project we that we call the artifact institute is is to learn from the past like to see like how do people meaningful meaning fully spend their time what what is the work that that that they did how did they how did they cooperate how did they overcome their differences to to kind of to come to a common ideal and to work to get you to get together and celebrate to keep to get together and then on a you know a more a more then on a smaller scale gail like just what did they do what songs did they sing what dances did they do how did they set that their take their table what what did they say in their in their toasts you know it's not because we i idealize the past we don't but we can but we need to learn from it and then as we learn from it we try and we try and recreate it or we try and we try and reproduce the patterns that were effective to lose solutions to common problems yeah and that's basically what a law is it's a it's a it's an effective solution to a a common problem and it gets called a law because it's routinely and reliably effective not because it's arbitrarily mandated and and and you have to adhere to the mandate no it's because of its effectiveness so we look at tradition as though it's it's a it's a set it's a set of of to a certain extent and you know again i don't mean the pejorative sense a law so but then once we once we actually enact the law we need to rely on some serious social reinforcement so you it has to be common it has to be common worship you have to find out what other people think if they value it it's like a market you can't be a price setter as an individual you rely on the reinforcement from as many other people as possible that what you say the value is is actually you know close to what they think the value is and so that's where the common part comes so coaching people through this process is kind of what we're trying to try to do i've been i mean i've been following your the work you've been doing on artifact for a while and been very fascinated and interested in it and now but there's a weird irony of the situation now which is that is that there is no comment and and and it's there was no comment before kobe but right now there seems to be an active desire to dismantle the common in in you know with good reason i guess like yeah it's not like arbitrary right it is happening nonetheless and it doesn't seem to be going away soon at least like where i am we're not allowed to have people at our house and we're not allowed to have any i like church services are 10 people top maximum right and so and so because of that it's it's and it's not going away soon it's going to be right i mean it's not going to say it's not it's not it's not going to go away soon but it you know it it might be six months it might be 12 12 12 12 mo months you know from now but at some point it will go you know it's gonna it's gonna change change well the the nice thing about this and and fractals are the most wonderful things because you can rely on this shape at whatever level of resolution you're looking and so you know it seemed as though what happened what has happened at least in our relatively affluent culture was that people have have turned their common inward and so what you know we we just we just we just narrowed our focus and now our community is the people in our immediate physical proximity whether it's our bubble or our family you know the people we actually live with or it's forced people to basically look at the community that is their own self and the the kind of feuding identities in in themselves that really frankly we can ignore them if we have enough other distracting things outside of ourselves but that's the uncomfortable self-awareness that's come from quarantine it's like oh lord i don't want to listen to those voices because they don't get along well you can have you can sit down and force those inner warring voices into a con into a conflict resolution process where you come up with a common ideal you try and articulate what do we actually agree on me who doesn't want to do this and me who does want to do this and then okay we agree on this one thing cool let's do it yeah did we do it yay we did it celebrate us yeah let's have a coffee yeah i think i think you're right and and i mean obviously that's why people would like go to monasteries and stuff but most most people won't do that it's really they won't do it on their own like let's just that's to kind of to cause that but i also think one of the things that the pin dammit has done that we've that we've we've observed is it's made people really see the the value in being together yeah in a way that we all just took for granted with a way that we all just just we to to took it for branches you don't know when it's going to happen again right so that's really important that's the place where all this comes from and that's literally the that's the foundation of what our worship is supposed to be it's supposed to be thanksgiving and and we lose sight of the word that's what it means right it's the title of the song you know so anything that can help us in shoes that where we can support each other into a relationship of gratitude and sometimes just really actually objectively looking at our just the gifts we actually have the fact that we have a what a report that we have a refrigerator who decides to build a smokehouse and actually preserve their meat whatever as you know in a in a traditional non-electric way they're gonna probably have a deepened appreciation for that refrigerator yes they will exactly and that's that's an argument for learning these traditional skills but learning them as as art right because it gives you an appreciation for the technology that we enjoy every day and it's also it kind of puts that technology into a framework where it can have meaning as opposed to just being something we consume take yeah right and so then like in the same way that like not being able to be together has made us realize that the act of simply being together is like it's like an experience of worship and and faced all i know and work and so it's all kind of bound up you know it's the same thing it's like you know you you do this this old task and it's something beautiful and something meaningful and then and then you then you go and you open your refrigerator or you turn on the the lights and you're like this is this is great this is so awesome wow thank you god you know and the thank you to mankind for being so smart collectively you know that that's that's that's it's a beautiful thing yeah you know we we we've been liking to say that you know the the work of our our artifact is to make america grateful again i it might be too soon it might be too soon but but but you know but but you look at where we are now and you know we have these two boring sides that are diametrically opposed you know and and have legitimate pain and legit legitimate you know our arguments on both sides but there's there's so much resentment there's so much resist you know and fine we have things that we can that we can say our problems you know like be you know saying that we need to be grateful is not to say that there aren't problems but you cannot you cannot live in a place of resistance a place of risk risk determined you will die in subside yeah well i think that i think that i find it amazing to see that you're doing your little part and we're all trying to do our little part to to bring some some gratefulness some magic some light to the current situation and so i will definitely like i'll be watching because the grammys are wet like next week is that yeah yeah and march 14th so we'll all be paying attention thank you exactly if we don't win then you can just say next year no exactly yeah then because then then the liturgy will will i will at least have a chance to be to be netted again there's no way to to know it's you know it's and it's not what i work for it's i'm not i don't compose this i'm already three pro three or four projects in from from front of them that's that's the old stuff i think we need to celebrate when some of the we need to celebrate when those who are trying to to create art and create culture that is vivifying that is that is kind of bringing us together and that is celebratory we need to we need to we need to be happy and to cast light on that you know so that because i think you're right like one of the things that i've been doing and i think we've all been kind of working together even if we don't talk to each other a lot is we really do believe that there's right now the energy and the interest to create a cultural movement that will that will be a participative cultural movement and yeah you know and it's happening it's happening from orthodoxy let's say but it has tendrils that move out it's it's not just an orthodoxy either i it's something i'm seeing i'm seeing in a lot of in a lot of other areas that that we there's there's a sense of a kind of work where they're they're there they're they're they're they're i think there is a a new a new died and i think i think orthodoxy has a part to play in this but but i think it's really important that it comes from a place of gratitude and from a positive vision of what we can build you know because like i cuz like you know because there's this big the split now of the rural and the urban de  fight and and we we spent a lot of time over the last 20 years in small town america and in rural world and in rural areas you know and you can absolutely see the sense of meaninglessness and and the pain and the sense of like the world has passed you by and you've been forgotten and and the and the and the in the in the and the and the elites and the billions nairas are off they're doing their their their thing and they've they've forgotten us but you know and so you just you can absolutely see how that that would inspire resentment but you know one of the things it sounds really strange and really easy to say to that day but i think what a lot of people pined for about the past is the sense is those is the times that they imagine that they're that their small town was was actually a beautiful place to be and the buildings were were overwhelming contained and they could go to to the county fair or to the town dance or go listen to to the town band or have a have a have a party to get together or go go to go to church to get to get to get together all of these things are in since part of they're actually an artistic nobody is actually stopping us from being able to do these things yeah you know i mean you know of course yeah right in general now but it's gonna change it's gonna you know so but but it's like we could we could maintain our small towns we we have a lot of free time and we have more disposable in in income than that than we realized we could start a town fan we could have a town dance we could go and talk to our to the people next to the people next to the door and we would probably find that we actually had a lot in common you know and it's like why don't we why don't we do these things well you know it's it's the thing that's getting in the way of it is is mis mistrust of the other and resentment you know but if you sense and to be fair if you take jonathan's perspective a little anxiety about doing it wrong well that's true too yeah there's that and i refer to you because because i hear the anxiety oh i don't know how i don't about doing music music so in order to do that you need a guide and there's the hierarchical structure again you just need the person who can walk you through so you don't fall in a pothole and then you get to enjoy it yeah and you can lean on them a little bit yeah yeah well i really i celebrate the things you're doing and i just need them to be in french soon so that i can so that i can i can engage with them in a more in my actual surroundings but well then then fairness yeah okay all right noticed let's let's yeah let's figure it out all right so i will so i will i would like i said i'll be paying attention to the upcoming awards and i'm just really happy that you're that you're in the church that you guys are being so so active and even the videos you're posting about your family and kind of these moments together i think it's very valuable to help people see what it can be like to just have a good time together because that's something that it seems difficult for us to do you know today because of everything that's going on so i appreciate that as well so thanks for thanks for coming on and talking to me today it's such a pleasure awesome
