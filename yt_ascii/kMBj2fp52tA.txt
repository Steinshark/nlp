i wanted to show you a bunch of interesting curves that you can draw; and actually i wanted to get my plotter machine working on some numberphile brown paper and do some of the drawing for us. well i wanted to talk a bit about something called turtle graphics - which is something you said you're familiar with from school right? where you are basically controlling a little turtle robot as it moves around on screen drawing pictures. what are the instructions you can give to the turtle? you can go forward some distance - d, say. you can turn an angle theta, and then the other thing you can do is you can say pen down and pen up. pen down is you're imagining this little turtle has a pen in the middle of it and when pen is down and it goes forward it will end up drawing a line as it moves; but if the pen is up it will just move over to that new location no line drawn. so you do like a little example i suppose of a simple program that you might give the turtle; we'll start we'll go forward 1 unit, i will turn 90 degrees, forward 1, turn 90 degrees, forward 1 turn 90 degrees, forward 1. (brady: even i know what's going on there) yeah?
- (i reckon you've drawn a square) yeah. i think so. shall we check?
- (all right) cool. so i've made this little turtle thing out of a top of a pringles can, a can of hyperbolic paraboloids. our first instruction was forward 1, that means we're going to end up there; and the pen was down so we've
drawn that line behind it. and now we're turning 90 degrees which would be like this. so our new point is going to be there when we go forward 1, and the pen drew behind us. turn 90 degrees again, forward 1, forward 1; pen was drawing the whole time. you're right - we drew a square.
- (and you) (can get more elaborate than this?)
- yes, but i'm interested in things that are still quite simple programs but make more elaborate curves. i've got a version of this running on mathematica. so if i do 90 degrees we can visualise what the
turtle was doing. so it started off going forward, turn 90, forward, turn 90, forward, turn 90, forward. i turned right 90, that's turning left 90. so from now on i'm going to just assume that after every turn there's a- there's a forward 1 and i'm always going to just assume the pen is down the whole time. so actually this program we wrote here we could just write as 90, 90, 90. so it's even simpler right? we're just gonna have a list of angles and see what we can draw with a list of angles. so for example let's let's say theta is 1 degree, and our program is just going to be theta, 2 theta, 3 theta, 4 theta, 5 theta - just keep doing that again again like what what do we get? so i could do that manually, i could just put in 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees, 4 degrees, so i would just put in in here and see what we get. okay it's gone- it's going to be slightly curving up as it goes. kind of makes sense i guess, so that's 1 degree above now it's going another 2 degrees turn, another 3, very gradual. so let's let's make this more automatic; so let's do like'0 steps and we multiply by what a degree is. and this is what we end up with: as it gets tighter and tighter it spirals into the middle. let's do more steps, let's do 360 of these steps. so what's happened here is that the turtle's gone into the middle and then it's ended up spiraling back out the way it came. so at the end, it's very small, but at the end it's pointing back from where it started, it's rotated'0 degrees. so now it's ready to go up and do the same thing over here. so if we set this theta to 1 degree we're just going to get this repeating thing where the turtle's going to go around, spiral, come back exactly the way it came, go in spiral, come back exactly the way it came. this is very similar to something that's called an euler spiral, also called a cornu spiral; but those spirals are defined like in a continuous way whereas this is all by taking discrete turns. what happened here is because we're doing exactly 1 degree, and 1 degree is a 360th of a full turn, so we ended up going back to where we started; but we can get more interesting pictures if we make it not a- like nice multiple, a nice divider of a full turn. now what if we turned 1.02 degrees each time? and now we end up not quite coming back where we started, we do all these dancing around. and it's very sensitive to what you you change that number to, so this is 1.03, it's a totally different picture. it's kind of like getting back to ideas of chaos where this is very sensitive where you're going to end up after a long time, it's just very sensitive on that little number there because you can come out the spiral kind of in a new random direction. so we could we could play with this a little bit maybe; so i'm going to say we're going x degrees each time and i get- going to vary what x is. so this is going 1 degree each time, this is the original picture, and then as i change this slider i'll be changing number of degrees. so here we go, a different picture each time as it increments.
- (wow) yeah (very cool.)
- so shall we get the machine to draw one of those for us?
- (yeah!) so here i've got code that does the same thing in python, and it's- what it will do is it will generate instructions which will send over this usb to the machine and it will tell the pen what to do. in this code i've called this dth which is d theta, like the change in theta each time. and looks like i've set d theta to this number here. this is a number i figured out is good because it stays on the paper, right, you don't have a guarantee that you're not just going to go off and like go off the paper. here's the final product - well we actually cut it off a little bit early because we got impatient - but this is the first few spirals of this one here. let's have a look at what it would have been if we let it run for for a bit longer: here is what it would have done if we did it for ten thousand steps. so yeah let's see, can we match that up a little bit? we got some of these guys going but then it was going to kind of come out and go out here. we basically stopped after roughly a thousand steps it looks like. if we did ten thousand then like it's kind of making a spiral of spirals itself. you can see this pattern, it's kind of recreating itself and going out there; so let's do a hundred thousand. so there, there you go. so now this is starting to look like its own- it's kind of macro scale version of of an eu- it's an euler spiral of euler spirals. but we didn't manage to get the next level, this looks kind of chaotic.
- (that would) (have been a huge piece of paper)
- yeah, yeah it would be. can you- yeah look at this, so it's the side by side scale comparison. (so that thing you're holding, where's) (that on the big picture there? it's one) (of those little-) 
- it's gonna be one of these little, yeah, hubs. so now i want to draw a sierpinski triangle picture. this one's actually called the arrowhead curve. so this is the kind of picture that we're going to kind of try and end up with, and it's nice for the plotter because it draws a whole kind of sierpinski shape all in one path. so you can see it starts up here, it'll end up drawing you know this triangle and this triangle this triangle, and it ends up here. (you never have to do pen up?)
- that's right, it's all it's all pen down and each step size is the same, and it's all just turning left and right. it's always either turning right 60 degrees or left 60 degrees. and so it's just how do you come up with the list of left, right, right, 
right, left, right, left, left, that comes up with this picture? and there's a kind of interesting way of deriving what those instructions should be. we're going to do something called like a substitution system, where we're going to- making repeated substitutions. and we'll just have two rules; so we're going to have every time we see an x we're going to substitute
it with y plus x plus y, and every time we see a y we're going to replace it with x minus y minus x. and here these aren't actually pluses and minuses, plus means you know turn right and minus means to turn left 60 degrees. and we're just going to start, you know, iteration one, we just start with x. this doesn't have any instructions in it but we're just going to keep applying these rules and see what happens. so at step two, you know, we're reading this and we see an x so we replace it with what we're supposed to replace it with: y plus x plus y. and so now if we were to do this instructions it just says turn right 60, turn right 60, which is not a super interesting picture but you know, we'll say we've go- we've gone forward, we turn, turn right 60 i mean we go down like this, and then we do another turn right 60, and i've just drawn this picture. not very interesting yet. let's do it again. so now we're going to use this other rule for y. so we're reading y, we replace it with what we're supposed to replace it with: x minus y minus x. we see the plus that doesn't have any replacement rule so we just copy it down. we see an x so we replace this y plus x plus y; we see a plus so we copy it, we see a y so we bring down x minus y minus x, which is the rule for y. so now we could try and draw what this is like; i'm not going to do any- i don't want to do any more turning right and left by 60 degrees by hand, so what i've done is i've prepared a grid that should help. so this isn't cheating right? this is using a pen on brown paper, i just- we used the machine to create this, so this is fine.
- (okay, it's fine) i didn't- i didn't print this, this is
within the rules of numberphile. i'm going to say like we'll- let's start going forward first and then we'll- and then we'll do these instructions. so we're going to turn left. and then turn left again, now we have to turn right, turn right again, turn right, turn right, turn left, turn left. so we've created this image here. it's kind of getting closer to a triangle maybe, it's kind of triangular shape; but it's still not got the detail of this sierpinski triangle. yeah let's do it again. this this one had one x, this had three x's and y's, this had nine x's and y's, next one's gonna have 27 x's and y's. so let's do it one more time. there we go, i think that's right. and yeah, if we did it 
another time we'd end up with 81 which is not going to be good to do by hand. but i think we can try and draw this iteration by hand? and then maybe we'll recruit the plotter to help us with the next step. and what were we saying?
minus was turning left and plus was turning right? so so we've gone forward 1, turning right means that we're gonna
turn right along here. ah, phew. so that looks like getting closer to this triangles inside triangles look of the sierpinski fractal. we got up to was this n equals three picture here. i've just programmed this- this what we were doing by hand into mathematica here, you've got a substitution system where x and y, there's a rule for x and y. instead of plus and minus i've just put in the angles directly in radians of pi by 3, pi by 3, for the where we had pluses and minus pi by 3, minus pi by 3 for where we had minuses. the next step up would be n equals 4. so, you know, we've got our what we just drew by hand copied three times in each side. and n equals 5, getting more and more detailed. n equals 6 is nice. and here's a picture for n equals 7 which might be a good one to plot with the machine. okay so we've stopped the machine exactly halfway through drawing this sierpinski turtle program; just wanted to show you something about how it's doing the drawing. so here is halfway and maybe if you look at it like this; because if we reflected this whole thing over here we'd have the full picture right? and this is just the vertical half of the picture. but yeah looking at from here i can see each of the previous iterations kind of lined up one after the other right? so we drew this one and this one by hand, then we bailed and we started going to the computer. and you know these are the previous iterations, now we're going to draw the one on top of that. so what we've seen is that the next iteration of this arrowhead curve, this arrowhead sierpinski curve, you could do it just by taking all the previous iterations lining them up and then reflecting it in sort of vertical axis. so shall we make it draw the rest of the picture? 
- (yes please!) yeah cool. so now i want to show you another type of turtle program we can send to the to the plotter machine, like what if i just start sending the digits of pi?
