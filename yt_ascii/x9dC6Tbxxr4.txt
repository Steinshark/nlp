inflation is a wild subject while once considered almost universally bad high rates of inflation have now hit america and countries with very different reactions than i'm used to coming from media outlets it's a bit like the pandemic actually some say it doesn't exist some say it's transitory and it'll go away by itself while most people think having a lot of it around is gonna be really bad for us we're inviting on the finance channel tom nash aka mr bearmarket let me just ask you inflation a big deal should we be worried about it well let me tell you a little story when i was 15 i had a toothache and i ignored it for like seven years and what ended up happening is that the tooth was in such a bad shape i was screaming for my mom and more in aesthetics and eventually we resolved this issue the dentist needed the treatment but it's like neglecting your teeth when you neglect inflation you run the risks of experiencing immense amount of pain and long-lasting damage which is exactly where we at right now only problem is we have a very strange situation where we went to the doctor he told us our teeth are fine he asked that we paid the bill for for his services we paid the bill and now he called us to say well in fact i was wrong your teeth are completely [ __ ] the minute he got her money which is wait obviously wait hold on let's play fair obviously you're talking about our supreme leader jerome powell no no no no i would never how dare you doubt him such a cynical such a cynical person without jp look i wanna this is actually why i wanted to bring this all up is because i've been watching with some interest sort of the media cycle around this trying to figure out what what's going on how to feel about it and it's been interesting to watch it feels like the five stages of grief but with inflation realizing that it is happening at first they said inflation will not happen you know it's not going to happen we're going to be fine and then jerome powell told us it's transitory in the end it will be transitory and people need to have faith in the central bank that we that we will do that but we won't do it just because you know we honestly it would be a mistake to do it at a time when we really do believe and virtually all forecasters do believe that these things will come down of their own accord as the economy reopens so there you go we just need to all have faith and everything will be fine but then eventually he told us that well that's not what he meant by transitory things aren't coming down the concept of transitory is really this it is that the increases will happen we're not saying they will reverse that's not what transitory means it means that the increases in prices will happen so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so okay now it's just gonna stop all on its own but now he says we need to retire the term transitory altogether even though he's the one who invented it how long does inflation have to run above your target before the fed decides maybe it's not so transitory i think it's it's probably a good time to retire that that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean so tom this is my conundrum i'm trying to understand what jerome powell means when he's talking about inflation it's not here it's transitory white that's not what we meant wait it's not transitory it's here to stay are we facing an inflation crisis and what's really going on here explain to us what's going on well stephen i think the problem is with you your cynicism does not allow you to appreciate the full scope of jerome powell's explanation let me explain to you what's going on please and i know some of you cynical people will say well it's really ironic it's like the common is saying let's retire the word stalin right it's pretty much he's the one who came up with the term and now he's retiring it i think it's only fair it's like my dad once told me i brought you into this world and i will you know you know the rest basically russian dead it's okay different cultures but basically what the thing you don't understand stephen is that jerome powell started off saying that this is that we don't have inflation even though we printed 40 percent of the us dollar ever in the past year and then he went and explained that the problem is that we don't understand what transitory is it's not about the transitioning of inflation up and down it's us transitioning into the realization that we just have to believe every word he says despite the reality now finally we're coming to the last stop the final stop which is accidentally close to his renomination of course i'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact he got renominated but essentially now he got renominated he gets to keep his job which is good for him and now all of a sudden he's basically saying well you know i made a huge mistake basically everything i told you in the past two years was everything is wrong and the i think it's it's it's good wait hold on you're not suggesting that jerome powell was saying it's all transitory it's all fine while he's being renominated and then as soon as he's being renominated he suddenly changes his language that's not what you're suggesting no no god forbid this would be the case i think it would take a really cynical person to think something like this of course the thing you need to understand stephen again you're as you being a cynical person you're missing the whole point of this is the point here is quite simple jerome powell is basically telling you right now listen i made a huge mistake everything i've ever said since the epidemic started until yesterday which was before the the hearing was complete nonsense and i think it takes a really a strong person to admit that he's been so wrong for so long i think he should be awarded for this in fact i should i think we should give him the congressional medal of honor for having the balls to say that every hit he stopped i'm sure it has nothing to do with his renomination i find it really insulting that you would think that stephen the thing about that really plexus it really perplexes me we should keep it in little bubbles coming out of my mouth the thing that really perplexes me stephen is that in fact the data that john powell is basing his assumption on it hasn't really changed it's basically the completely identical the cpi which is the core price index which is the fed's favorite metric to measure inflation which is in itself a little bit of a cheat code because it doesn't really look at housing and stock market which is usually the more inflationary areas of the economy is already at a 30-year high the last time it was this high i think the original bush was the president or even clinton i don't even remember it was long ago so the numbers hasn't changed it's very structionary low participation in the job market very high core price index and all of a sudden he sees something i think god must have spoken to him bro this is the only explanation i have because the thing that hasn't changed god came down and said jerome i think you were wrong and i think he embraced this and good for him for having the courage to realize that he was wrong listen now let me give you an example it's like going to the doctor's and and giving him an x-ray of your chest and the doctor is looking at you and saying well everything is fine your chest is you know you're like a spanish bull and then he calls you two weeks later said listen i looked at it again and the you're dying this is exactly the same thing not that the economy is dying but i mean this is the same level of mistake that was made here and i think it's it's a real shine it's a sign of honesty if federal officials are willing to come out and say how bad they are at their job i think we should be commended for doing that so one of the things that i've been looking at is just the amount of positive coverage that's come out about inflation there's been a lot of talk by media outlets recently that there's no need to panic because in fact not only are high levels inflation maybe not even happening but if they are happening at all it's actually a good thing for poor people and a bad thing for jeff bezos do you think that's true that jeff bezos is the one suffering and that his amazon workers are the one who are going to be liberated by inflation these are real headlines i just just saw something from the intercept i've seen something some things from things like you know vox where people are talking about look inflation's not that big of a deal it's actually good for you it's going to lower your debts what do you think about that i think it's rich people are saying this to the poor people where while they're getting off the titanic pretty much it's very similar and you and i are the band playing on the boat while everybody is basically saying to the poor hey stay on the boat drowning is good for you this is this is the transitory sinking curry dried you'll come back better than ever if it doesn't kill you make you stronger i swear to god just stay stay here while we get on the lifeboats it's it's literally what's going on here because listen to be involved seriousness this is what's going on inflation erodes your purchasing power inflation causes a single dollar to be worth less a month ago a year ago you could buy 10x this time you can buy 3x you just lost a [ __ ] that you can't buy simple as that if you're rich 3x is still a lot of x's but if you're more than 3x it's not a lot of x's so by definition and i've seen this with my own eyes as a kid some of you may not know this but i was a young kid in russia when the russian influ hyperinflation happened in the 90s and i saw how people send their sell their underwear and socks on the market this improvised market just to get some food and how you know a kilogram of apples is now basically your monthly salary it ain't pretty you think the richest people felt the same amount of pain as the poor people i mean it's preposterous it's pretty much reminds me of the story a long time ago when i came back i was 16 17 years old came back from a party very intoxicated my dad saw me and i immediately said without him even asking well i'm not drunk and he of course said nothing but his eyes was very telling and as i walked to my room i immediately started to lose the the gravitational force lose to the gravitational force essentially skewing to the 45 degree angle all the way to basically lying flat on the ground while i was making my way to the room essentially making it very clear what's really going on here when i hear mainstream media push this narrative i'm much like my dad in 1997 or whenever that was i just i pity the fool i mean it's simple it's just a bunch of googly goon nonsense so what do you think the lifeboats are you talked about people are getting on the titanic the lifeboat whatever what is that like what does that analogy mean that analogy is very simple there's a lot of asset classes that are very good inflation to protect your money because they park your money at certain areas of the economy that's going to go up during inflation i don't know if you notice but real estate is hella expensive right now why do you think that's happening because everybody try try buy a house right now rather just try and list the house yeah everybody's buying up real estate the problem is which is it's a really good measure to counter inflation to park your money in real estate the problem is if you're a school teacher or bus driver you can't really buy real estate because you're living paycheck to paycheck and once your paycheck is realistically now worth one half of what it was worth two years ago you're in dip and ain't no amount of good publicity is going to help you pay for your lunch no no amount of articles are gonna are gonna can they no problem you can have this burger it will be four and a half articles here you go one cnn article three fox articles and one cnbs article here you go here's your burger sir it's not gonna it's the only way bro what do you think i mean obviously biden wants to keep the party going that's he's he's kind of incentivized to you know and every president is incentivized to always every government is low and always keep growth at all costs then you have the fed coming in and saying wait we need to do something different who do you think is going to win this little battle so first of all we have to be clear about it's a completely bipartisan thing every government in any country does not want the fed of its country the central bank of its country to actually stop the party right now we have an example of what's going on when the politics wins over the economist of course all of you follow the the turkish economy i'm sure every single one of you is you know nope yeah an avid viewer of what's gonna so i don't know if you heard this but in turkey just about two weeks ago the the local currency which is called the turkish lira so the turkish lira crashed about 30 percent lost a third of its value in just a few days why because basically they have a guy over there that calls the shots and they decided well we're not going to raise interest they don't have like an independent central bank that can actually do it and the economy is collapsing and you're going to see some really harsh results now the thing is you have to understand despite all my criticism either direct or indirect or cynical in the us we still have this independence the only point of of non-independence we had is when biden actually appointed or renominated john paul for another term but once that happened it's no longer in biden's hands it's basically he has the job he can do whatever he wants and he's actively pursuing that to his credit what he said in the latest hearing is 100 correct they have to stop asset purchases as fast as possible and raise interest rates because right now we're dealing with a junkie the u.s market is a junkie in really bad shape and they must go through rehab if we have any chance of saving it and trust me going through rehab isn't going to be pretty isn't going to be nice it's going to be painful but it has to be done so to his credit and that's not cynical him actually the latest testimony actually sounds what he should have said like about a year ago finally we're getting this done yeah i just looked at turkish lira thing up it said i'm reading this is from reuters 1005 the lyric recovered after weakening to 1388 first the dollar it touched an all-time low of 14 last week after a 30 plunge over the last month so this is what you're saying is what happens when you have too much just nobody's basically paying attention to how much money is being printed and pumped into the economy you're just trying to keep the party going but you try to do it too long if let me let me give you a simple example how i think things played out the government wants a long-term relationship with money printing imagine it's tinder right and the government is is looking for for and jerome powell is on tinder basically saying well i want a really long relationship with the with the with printing money as well they hook up and then after they hook up john paul says well nope and he blocks the government from his focus it's literally what just happened bro so i think it's a really good analogy of what just happened you're saying he just kind of he kind of stiffed yeah he just ghosted bro he's he goes to bed he goes he goes to bite it obviously biden wouldn't have renominated him had he known that powell was going to just like tighten things up no no no i think it would be very hard for me of course to claim that there is a relationship between the biden and john paul but i think like on a more economic level i think that relationship would not have gone forward had biden thought that paul is going to pull the stunt which he just did on in front of the congress basically saying well the party's over and he's doing it right in front of just before christmas which is probably the worst time for a politician to start tapering yeah right because everyone wants to go out there get their christmas gifts not worry about the economy yeah it seems like we're it's really interesting to see the times we're living in with this like sort of unprecedented monetary policy so i guess there's so much that i don't know here i guess what what should people be looking for just your average average con person out there works a nine to five job you know he's looking at this he's wondering what's going on obviously we don't give financial advice on the show but what are your thoughts as just someone who watches the markets yeah i think it's a good time to er to to stay away from the stock market a little bit if you haven't dipped your feet in in the stock market now it's probably not a good time because you have to understand that the byproduct of what the fed is about to institute right now which is a major policy shift essentially you know stopping the money printer stopping basically the asset purchases is essentially stopping the money printer and raising interest rates is pretty much you know clubbing the economy with the club until submission that whole process is going to have an immense impact on the stock market it doesn't really matter right now how it's going to work but essentially the elevated interest rate is going to push most of the u.s stocks way down and the most of the pain will be for the speculative stocks the small caps the the ones that don't really make a lot of money now and they have a really huge upside in the future explain that a little bit break that down a little bit okay so why is this the case okay i'll explain when in finance when you evaluate a company how would you evaluate the company you look at their cash flows right how much money can i get from this company if you're buying a business that's the first question you ask right how much how much revenue you have every year how much profit you have every year and you say okay so how much money will this company make for the next 10 years and you use different assumptions basically say okay how much the revenues will grow or not grow every year how much the expenses would grow every year and you come up to a certain number like a cash flow a projected cash flow for the next 10 years but you know if i tell you right now well stephen you owe me a million dollar in 2035 and you tell people tom i'm willing to pay you today in 2021 how much would you take to get rid of of this debt and then i'll probably tell you probably like give me 500 000 today and you don't have to give me the million in 2035. the same thing happens in the stock market now that difference between the million to the 500 is determined by the level of interest because that level of interest is what's the weighted average cost of capital and as the way the average cost of capital will go up eventually once they raise interest rates it's going to push all these valuations down because the bringing these cash flows from year 10 all the way back to 2021 is going to become more expensive essentially lowering every single valuation of every single company in the stock market right so prices of stocks go down we enter perhaps i'll give an example a better example you know the commercials for the for the guy who like i want my annuity now i forgot his name and there's the people the singing it's like the jerry finally [music] he'll basically give you a lump sum today and he'll buy you and it is off you the the amount you get now basically gets slashed massively once the interest rate goes up the same thing with company valuations because company valuations are essentially annuities if you really think about it so i guess my question is this tom to sort of wrap this up where do you think the u.s is headed now that we're gonna probably see rates change them try to control inflation which is going to kind of stop the party a little bit what do you think is gonna happen is this gonna be a recession not to be a michael bury or a peter schiff here where we're calling those guys the doomsday forecasters all the time it's kind of never really works so i'm not trying to forecast anything but where do you think the general trajectory is by the way shout out to michael berry for successfully predicting five out of the last zero stock market crashes just kidding i love michael berry one of the best in the business so i think it's a necessary beating the market has to take it's it's honestly the thing the only choice the fed actually has you have to commend honestly john paul for actually doing this now i think it's gonna be painful it's gonna be unpleasant like any rehab we have to go through it and eventually we're gonna come out stronger i know there's this thing in the u.s as a foreigner i find it amusing how self-deprecating americans are to their own country and economy everything is going to be fine it's going to be unpleasant it's going to be a little bit painful but eventually i would not bet against the u.s economy bro it's going to be just fine usa hey thank you so much for coming by that way to end it off strong guys if you guys want to go follow tom nash on youtube show thanks for watching everybody
