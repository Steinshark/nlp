hey everyone so i was looking today on youtube and i noticed that i just passed 10,000 subscribers and i want to say thank you to everyone there usually when you hear youtubers make a thank you video for this you know when they reach a subscriber milestone you hear them say things like you know i can't believe it i you know never thought this would happen i seriously can't believe it though like i i mean a few weeks ago i had 500 subscribers i was just punching posting punch out videos you know me being the game as fast as i could or whatever getting fast times on fighters and in the past like three weeks i have gained 10,000 subscribers off of pretty much just three videos and i genuinely am like in shock from it i did not expect anything near this anything of this magnitude to happen from it and i am i'm really thankful for everyone who subscribed and he's been watching my videos i really do appreciate it and there's gonna be more on the way and they keep making them i enjoy making them i don't have as much time as i'd like to to make these videos but i'm gonna keep working on them as much as i can you're probably not going to see them come out more often than every two or three weeks but i'm going to work on them i i read most of the comments of the videos so i see what type of games you guys are looking for what type of you know improvements i can make what things you think i'm doing well i read that stuff and i appreciate it and i keep it in mind i know you guys want me to get a new microphone because the one i'm using it's just for my phone and it's not very good but i'm gonna order one in a few days i found one that i think would be good i'm going to get a pop filter as well and hopefully it'll turn out pretty good but so yeah there's going to be a more videos on the way to just take a little while to make but yeah thanks again everyone i it's here it genuinely is unbelievable really grateful this has happened and how my channel keeps growing like this that would be amazing thanks everyone
