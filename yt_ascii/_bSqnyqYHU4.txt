i gotta sit down with john who was a coding 
dojo graduate for cyber security and i picked   his brain there was really nothing that was 
off limits in this video you are going to   get an inside look of what his experience was 
like going to a coding boot camp specifically   for cyber security what he is doing now advice 
he would have for others who wants to get not   only to tech but specifically cyber security 
and more alright let's get into it [music]   hi john how are you today i'm doing well how 
about yourself thank you i'm doing good thank   you i know prior to us recording we were speaking 
about your headphones which i need my own pair   of i love them yeah they're really neat i know 
everyone everyone that like i go into meetings   with really like it just you know puts a smile 
on their face and everything so i think i made   a good investment on them i think you did too 
well john before we really dive into a little   bit more about your experience at coding dojo i 
would love to hear more about yourself and also   to your current role sure yeah so before 
i actually got the position where i'm in now   i started off doing a lot of different things 
i bounced around in a lot of different industries   for a little while i worked physical security 
for a little while i did financial securities   for a little while so i worked with like 
things like atms and a lot of that technology   and then i moved on to other industries 
like restaurants skydiving and probably a   ton of others that i'm just forgetting now at the 
moment but yeah it's not been a linear path at all   but you know everything i think like 
happens for a reason so i you know i   definitely think that now i'm in like a 
really good like it it made me it had me   it made me go into a place where i actually 
think that i can make like do some good here   that's amazing i love that and i love that your 
path wasn't linear because i know i can relate   to that and i think a lot of individuals who 
are watching this can relate to that as well   so you even with your you know you're 
not linear path what is your current role   so i work as you can call it 
a teaching assistant role at another   like technology school like another cyber 
security type of boot camp and it's really   neat so the position that i was in before help or 
you know being a student that can actually like   reflect a lot on now being like kind of like 
that assistant teacher and just being able to   you know like help out students like where i was 
like struggling at one point so i think that it's   like a really interesting like a really i don't 
think i could have asked for like a better like   position to like start off this journey with 
that's amazing i yeah having gone through it   then being able to you'll be able to i'm sure 
connect with these students on such a deeper level   because you you're like yeah i feel you i've been 
there i've experienced those those highs and those   lows yeah definitely like i know everyone 
struggles at some point so i'm just like oh   i've seen this before like i i know exactly 
how you're feeling it's it's good it's good   tell me a little bit about your decision to attend 
coding dojo to attend a coding boot camp was it   super you know obvious too you're like 
okay this is the next step or how did that   how did that come to be yeah so that's actually 
a really good question i so you know going like   you know bouncing around a bunch of different 
careers and everything like i was never really   happy doing anything there was never really a 
place where i found where i could like really   kind of settle in and just like oh i want to make 
this my career a lot of things just got really   repetitive and it wasn't challenging or anything 
and i've been around computers like my whole life   so it made a lot of sense to me to like try 
to find a place where i think i could settle   down and actually challenge myself and keep 
learning because i think that's one thing that   keeps me going is like you know like 
never stay in the same place you know if   you can continue like being more like effective 
and productive i think it's really important   so going into the boot camp i think 
made sense like after doing everything   that i did like just finally just being like 
you know what i need to get some new skills   yeah going into a boot camp like definitely 
made sense and after doing a little bit of   searching i know coding dojo for me was one 
that really stood out so that's why i chose   that one when you were that's really interesting 
when you were doing the searching part of it for   the code and boot camp what was the criteria like 
did you have do you have a criteria as to what   you were really looking for that made coding dojo 
stand out or that made others not so appealing   the big yeah so the the big part for me there 
was like what assistance could i get in job   hunting like afterwards i know that not a lot of 
other boot camps biggest from the research that   i did like didn't really put an emphasis 
on helping their students out afterwards   and i knew nothing about going into tech like 
first like going off like i could have probably   sent in like you know a thousand resumes and 
never had gotten like you know never really be   able to hone that search so that was really 
important and even just like having like   a really like the initial like response from like 
all like the admissions teams and everything i   think really stood out to me as well like there 
was not a question that they weren't able to   answer and it just it felt a lot more personal 
i guess compared to a lot of other like boot   camps that i was checking out yeah i i can con 
i completely relate to that because i went to a   coding boot camp oh gosh it's been almost seven 
years now i think six and a half years so like   it was before really the hype around coding boot 
camps right before they became very popular and   that was one of the things that was really missing 
for me is what you you exactly said which is that   job support afterwards and for me there was none 
of that and that is so key and so critical i think   for a lot of people to have success is having 
that job support there even just knowing that   you can bounce job like bounce ideas off of 
or get that advice that support it's it's huge   it definitely is yeah i know you know again 
like being in the position that i am now like   there's a lot of students that are looking to like 
you know for their careers so you know like it's   i have like a little bit of like insight now 
on like how like jobs hunt go how job hunts go   and like you know like interview processes and 
everything but you know like a lot of the stuff   that i was a lot of stuff that i learned a lot 
of the help that i got was from like career   services which i think is like about like it's 
super super important yeah i completely agree and   i know prior to to us starting this recording we 
were speaking about that both of our roles are   fully remote and i believe i'm assuming when you 
went to coding dojo it was fully remote right it   was yeah well so it definitely oh sorry sorry 
oh no that was my i think you're gonna answer   my question yeah like it made it like having 
that flexibility of being able to work on it   you know like from the comfort of your own home 
like definitely help but it also let me keep like   working in the meantime as well so like i had i 
was able to do both at the same time which i know   gets kind of difficult sometimes but it worked 
out for me and like not having to like travel   extra and being able to work things that 
like rel like having like a deadline but   being able to work at things at my own pace 
like definitely helped out and it wasn't like   i didn't like have any opportunities to 
reach out to people if i you know didn't need   help because like there was always like some 
kind of like ta ready to assist in everything   but having that like not kind of like 
eyes over like your shoulder all the time   like being able to like wander and make 
mistakes and learn from like i think is   definitely important in the process too yeah 
yeah i completely agree and kudos for you   for being able to balance both the working 
well learning that's pretty incredible   yeah with and also too on that note of taking 
the boot camp fully remote i'm sure it gave you   really good skill sets to prepare yourself for 
working fully remote you know like you already   did this boot camp fully remote so then kind of 
transitioning into a fully remote position you're   like i got this i've already been been essentially 
working remote it was yeah it wasn't the worst   it wasn't a hard transition at all but it 
was definitely one that took a little bit of   getting like the transition was hard but getting 
used to it was a little bit strange because i'm   just like oh you know like i have to i don't have 
to go anywhere today but i can i still go to work   you know it's just like i i you know just walk 
into another room and then it's like work mode   it's it's really it's a really unique position 
to be in and it's one that i'm like i'm really   grateful for that's awesome i love that i'm just 
curious to hear you're kind of shifting gears here   for a sec but you know you mentioned you you 
work with a lot of students now and even when   you were taking the going through the coding 
dojo boot camp i'm curious to hear just very   candidly you know i get asked all the time now 
of course about ai around you know oh my gosh   tiff you know is ai going to take over my job 
as a developer and maybe some of the students   have asked that you work with to varying 
degrees have asked around that or maybe not   but i'm just curious to get your thoughts on 
that whole whole topic for developers and ai   yeah yeah so ai is actually one of the like 
areas we're trying to implement a little bit more   i know that there's still a lot of like debate 
about you know like whether or not we should or   like you know shouldn't use it in like workplaces 
and stuff but i mean in an education role i think   it's really useful like especially you know if 
i think it's a really good tool to aid in learning   just because like it you know it has like 
just almost like it seemed like infinite amount   of knowledge and stuff and you can use it 
to streamline like the whole process as well   so the way that we go about it now is you know 
we make an emphasis to not fully depend on like ai   i think it's still important to you know to you 
know trust but verify i know a lot of the things   that like a lot of the responses you'll get 
from ai aren't necessarily correct 100 of the time   but you know just using it as a tool to get 
you on the right path i think is really good   especially you know like you shouldn't struggle 
too long on any like one topic so if you can get   like just kind of like a bearing on where you 
should be going it definitely helps you out a   lot i totally agree and that's such a good way of 
putting it i know for myself anyways i have found   it super helpful for learning as well you know 
even doing that prompt where it's explain you   know a technology to me like sometimes honestly 
i'll do it i'll say like a fifth grader or like a   child because or i oftentimes do with a real world 
example because that really helps me and i think   it's so useful because you can learn in the way 
that's best suited for you by prompting it like   how you learn best like oh i like stories or oh 
i'm a you know different kind of thing or i'm a   more logical thinker different things like that 
so i completely agree i like how you you summed   it up with learning thank you yeah when you going 
through your through the boot camp what are some   things that maybe surprised you about the boot 
camp or about your experience whether it be the   challenges you came across what are some things 
that surprised you with it oh that's a good one   i think the most surprising things were just 
how vulnerable i learned that everything was it   was really surprising to know that it wasn't you 
know you would think that out of like all the   technology and like all like the things that we've 
done and learned like you know we'd be in like a   very secure like type of you know like system 
and stuff like we'd be like very secure with all   of our like networks and everything but they're 
really not and i know there was a big emphasis   on learning like enumeration and exploitation like 
vulnerability like hunting and everything and   that was that was really eye-opening because it's 
just it they after going through a lot of the   the labs and the lessons with that it wasn't like 
you learned that it wasn't a question of like oh   like if something's gonna happen it's really just 
a matter a question of like when so preparing and   like trying to stay ahead of the curve with that 
i think is one of the things that surprised me   the most i'm just like there's no way that it's 
this well i don't want to say that it was easy   but there was no way that you know it was you know 
like that you would think that it was possible you   know just like you're just using a lot like in in 
um in our stage like you know just a lot of like   free tools free software and everything so it 
was just like it's it's amazing the things that   you can do with just you know like a pc and 
then just like a kali linux box and stuff so   that's that's a lot of like what we used was just 
tools like that and just being able to utilize   them in like every witch way was really really 
fascinating that is super fascinating i know it is   it is wild and terrifying it's wild interesting 
terrifying is a good word yeah it's really it's   scary sometimes just like oh this this shouldn't 
be here i know we think we think tech is   so secure and in many ways the the security is 
there in other ways it's you're like you know it   is kind of just teetering almost it feels like 
yeah i think there's def like there's you know   being in the field now there's definitely like you 
see that there's a good like there's a need for   people like us like here so like you know being 
able like being on top of the security aspect i   think is really important so i i definitely would 
like push for people to like either like jump in   the field take like the you know some type of boot 
camp or something yeah for sure i think i can't   remember what the stat is around cyber security 
jobs but i i remember seeing online and staggering   how the demand versus wait what is it the openings 
versus the applicants like there's so many more   openings the demand is huge and there's not enough 
people to fill all these roles yeah it's it's   you know like they'll like they'll be positions 
opening all the time i know i see like a lot of   because my a lot of my job hunting originally 
was going towards things like private sector   and like defense contracting and everything 
because i know they do a lot of entry-level   like a lot of entry level positions like 
opening up which i think is really neat   because you can get a lot of experience there 
um but yeah just like with how much we depend on   technology and how much we you know how much of a 
need there is to actually like secure it and stuff   like there's always going to be bad guys trying 
to do bad things and you know they're always like   should be good guys trying to defend it like two 
so it's it's really like there is no balance i   guess between it but it's just trying to like stay 
ahead of like what they can do as opposed to what   we can do yeah i i totally agree trying to stay 
ahead is the key what would be and i know this   would vary based on what based on what class you 
were in or what stage you were in in the boot camp   but what would be can you give me an example of 
what a day would would entail going through the   the program yeah sure so most of the time like 
we just start off with lectures and everything   you know just like going over like 
core content that we would need like to   core content that we would need to use like later 
on in like completing like our like assignments   and everything so it'd be maybe like an hour or 
two of like lecture time and then outside of that   we were really just well outside of that 
we had like you know things like office hours and   stuff where we could like talk to instructors 
and everything but outside of that we were   really left on like left to our own to like 
you know space out our time where we could like   like set aside enough time to actually get the 
assignments and everything done so if we had like   assignment side we knew it would take 
a while you could break it up into time   but like time management was really a skill that 
you needed because if you're doing like full-time   work and then like trying to like go home like do 
assignments it can get kind of overwhelming really   quickly so having that like time management 
skill you know like after lectures you know like   just kind of like take your notes and everything 
and then do what you can you know to get the   assignment done if you get stuck just like sit 
on it for just a minute and then you know like   come back to it like later on and then always 
like you know seek help there was like never a   time where like you would be left stranded if you 
needed help you either had like other students   teachers or like the tas and everything wow 
that's really nice it's nice to to hear that too   about not being you know left stranded because 
there does come a point where it's like you're   spending almost as you alluded to earlier too 
where you're spending almost too much time on   something that it's like okay now's the time 
to get help you've done everything you can on   your own now let's reach out for help and then to 
have help be readily available is i think a huge   a huge huge thing one of the things that 
i remember is they emphasize the like the 20   minute rule so like you know if you get stuck on 
something for 20 minutes like you should actively   seek help and stuff so i'm just like you know that 
that makes a lot of sense i didn't take advantage   of that when i knew i should have yeah like 
i when i struggled through something i struggled   through it though like a lot of times almost the 
whole way through and i'm just like well i learned   a lot but it took a lot longer to learn that than 
like it would have or that it should have i could   have got so much more done in you know like 
the like two or three hours that i spent you   know like staying stuck on something then like i 
would have learned if i spent like you know maybe   like 20 minutes in like another 20 minutes like 
actually getting the problem fixed and then the   rest of the time continuing to learn i know i i 
know i feel you it's one of those things that and   i've heard of that rule before i don't know if 
it was a similar rule anyways and it's in theory   you're like yeah of course that makes sense and 
when you put it into play it does make sense but   i think oftentimes we're so stubborn or i don't 
know what it is like i need to figure because the   feeling when you figure it out on your own it's 
such a good feeling it's it's it's priceless it's   just like you know like yeah like oh i can keep 
doing this but a lot of times i just like it's   if you don't watch out and you keep running 
into those roadblocks it gets detrimental and   like that's the thing that i try to like push 
my students to like you know don't struggle   too long your struggle is good but there's a 
point where it doesn't benefit you at all like   you stop learning past you know like a certain 
point of frustration yeah i totally agree yeah   john i wanna i wanna end this conversation 
with some advice from you what is some advice   you would give to others who are watching this and 
are considering going to coding dojo getting   a career in cyber security what is some advice 
well first of all you know i love coding dojo   i love the people there a lot of the students 
that i was there with like i'm still you know   friends with and stuff i still talk to like 
semi-regularly i think another like big barrier   like to people you know thinking about actually 
going into the boot camp or like some type of   boot camp program is you know like they you you 
wait you know like you wait until you think you're   ready but i think the thing is that you know 
you're you're never really ready so you know   like you know the what was it there's an eden 
song or there's a song by eden where he says   why would the right time grant you what you want 
you know like you really do need to take advantage   of the time that you have because the sooner 
you start you know the sooner you can get to the   places you need to go so like when it comes like 
again to like the struggling thing like just you   know you shouldn't sit on it for too long because 
there's a point where it's just like you could   have got so much more done in the time you know 
in the time that you spent waiting or yeah for   like the right moment you could have got so much 
more done you know like i i think it's it's   really important to like try to just overcome that 
it's just like don't wait for the right time take   advantage of what you got right now because you'll 
never be ready to actually do something like that   another thing you know like it gets really 
overwhelming sometimes just the amount of content   that you're going to try and learn but you know 
a lot of things you know they'll make a lot more   sense when you like repeat them like over and 
over again a lot of the things that you'll learn   in the boot camp you know you might only use once 
like depending on what kind of career you go into   it might not even be something that you use at 
all but all the content that you learn is there   for a reason and it kind of builds on top of the 
next thing like it's really nice to have like a   such like a strong foundation to like build like 
your future knowledge on because you never know   like when that's gonna come back into play 
so i would say you know like 100 you know   don't wait you know like another 
recurring theme that i keep seeing   between like myself and some of the other 
instructors that i work with is that you   know like they say and i say it too and i didn't 
know that i didn't realize that other people said   this but they say that i wish i started yesterday 
and i i think that's super important you know   like cyber security is such a vast field and it 
really encompasses or just touches on like a lot   of different things like there's something here 
for everybody and if you can you know like put   in just that like small in comparison you know 
the small time to like sacrifice to like you   know push yourself forward like you can learn 
so much and it's it's a really great field to   be in and you can do a lot of really good work 
here 100 i love that i wish i started yesterday   that's so good i i and also too it's one of 
those the industry is it's going to continue   to become i mean as everything is shifting to 
tech now it's that we think it's in demand now   i mean if anyone ever asked me well tip what 
section or what area of text should i get into   i'm like have you looked into cyber security 
because if i was to you know i'm happy in my   career now but if i was to to do anything again 
it would be cyber security it's so important i   mean yeah like i think that cyber security like 
is an all-encompassing type of thing but like you   can really apply it to almost anywhere like 
i've been doing i just started like a ton   of other projects and everything that you know i 
didn't realize that would fit into cyber security   i know a lot of people might be interested in 
like like what is it sdr so software defined   radio which is like just its own little thing 
like raspberry pi's and programming and everything   so like i recently started python so i could like 
just build with that too like the more skills you   have the more valuable you'll be and the more 
like the more you struggle now like the easier   things later on like or the the you know more 
things later on will make sense so like you'll   be able to find your niche and everything i love 
that yes i totally agree and it's it's the the   fun part about being in this industry you're 
constantly getting to you know build different   things tinker and continue to learn oh yeah i 
love breaking things all the time i know a   lot of the or some there's a one other teaching 
assistant that i work with who's more of a blue   team type of guy and i'm just like no i'm red team 
like all the way if i can break something i will   100 try and break it i think that's just the 
way that like more of like the coding dojo was   geared towards things like like pen testing 
and it was like a big like an overarching like   type of topic and it like vulnerability hunting 
and everything so that's that's really where   i like found my interest in so you know there's 
something here for everybody so it's just you know   doing a little bit of research finding what you're 
interested in and then you know just gaining the   skills you need to actually go and pursue it 100 
i love that john this has been so great to connect   with you and i know there's so many tidbits 
like one-liners that you just organically said   throughout this conversation that are going 
to be in my head for the rest of the day so   thank you for for connecting with me yeah thank 
you tiff i really appreciate it talk soon bye
