the panel on c++ in the developing world why it matters thank you all for coming we have a panel of six people now and know there's some folks from south america south some people from from africa and some people know have been to various parts of we have also a guest which is honey from india and who lives now in ireland so i think we have of angles cover covered and i'm the host and let's kick this off with a short inod round let's get start hy thank you m thank you for the opportunity i am honey suan as yan already mentioned i am originally from india u then five years back we migrated to ireland i got a job in jagua land rovera ireland so for my regarding my career i'm i'm an impeded software engineer now i'm having around 16 years of experience so my first programming experience is of course with c++ so i do program mostly in c or c++ in linux and some other os as well that's me or to gabrielle thank you thank you h hello everyone my name is g valenzuela i'm from argentina i am currently working as a engineer in gua cyber cyber security company where we develop a standard defense and response system and system information and event management and we i work with c++ for almost three years it was my principal language in my thesis development of p networks so i keep continue with pa thank you thanks gabriel so thanks jam for the invitation i'm i'm currently working as a software engineer in a company called buus de on a project related to audio development i have been working in the field for about five years professionally but i i am audio technology enthusiast since the early childhood so well my first experience with c++ was actually in high school this was the language that were taught on these very old pum1 computers at that time but after that i i i didn't had any other chance to work with c++ after i i worked as a programmer well apart from that experience i have been an engineer in telecommunications for about 15 years but yeah u well in software engineering as i mentioned it it's just five years ago okay okay continue to philip yes my name is philip mand i'm originally from angola sou s in africa so i have been working mostly on computer architecture in the last years mostly focus on processing in memory as well as accelerating dna analysis on processing memory technology and exploiting the computer architecture and computer science st trying to find out a code design between alori on hardware and i am in the process of joining arm right now in land to work on the gpu modeling team so yes i'm mostly a hardware guy but i also very interesting in software as well so i try to be in the middle but in the last years my focus have been more on designing processors and and other kind of specific accelerators for ai and dna analysis yes i think i would continue with matthew so my name is matthew benson i'm a computer scientist by training and by experience i generally haven't actually worked forly in software but it's actually like my first love so to speak so it's something i just do day in day out i worked a little bit after i left university in energy generation is you know kind of like a bit bit of civil engineering so to speak and from that experience i mean i think the energy use in computing and programming has been something that's near and dear to my heart which is what has you know something i've been researching and tinkering and trying to see how much can i get how much performance can i milk out of older computers and how much i mean what kind of impact would that have so this is something i've been researching on personally as my personal passion so to speak all right so naturally this is a panel and a panel l from questions so the audience should ask the questions if you are in hobo just in the chat or in the questions tab is probably the best place to put that and if you are in linkedin the chat is the place to put your questions for the panel and so when when we talk like about you know the compute being different in your part of the world than it is like in the in the first world like where we have like the leading the edge of the computing can you just like speak a bit about your like your experience like what kind of hardware is available to your folks and like you know what's what's a normal hardware where people write code on in in your environment should we take the question on ourself or anyone can take this question yeah maybe i should you know so anyone wants to to start answering this question okay okay i'll take that question to me i can't i can now tell that what kind of hardware now people are using back in india or like the place where i'm but i'm sure that they are using highend hardwares at least they say like i i don't know it is la8 class but at least the software community is using um highend hardware depending on the use cases probably the graphic programmers or gaming those kind of programmers they are getting access to to highend systems and regarding as matthew was telling in this talk about connectivity and all i think the platform where i belong to uh like they have h there is no issue about connectivity and all unless in we are in some very remote areas so connectivity is also so good speaking about the time when i started programming i remember the not i start programming the the first computer i work i am given at my workplace so it is like 250 256b hardisk and i don't sorry 256 yeah to to i don't remember the ram but it is very very it can run as you as matthew was telling about the ids so it can't run highend ids and all but nowaday i'm not facing that problem so why i'm telling that is like we not because of the performance issues but we when when we are introduced to linux those time we we start with vi vi and then so it's like as matthew told it's like one step at a time so when matthew mentioned about uh trying out ids i immediately got to that point i mean like i remember the days which i tried with vi it's very hard for some somebody to learn vi at the first place you easily get mad but then vi to whim then i remember like we do have when we browse the linux kel source code and all so like we need how would i say that what is the term i forgot so we need to browse this code right so we need to check the functions kind of so those time i forgot the package name we have we need to like in vim we need to install some packages and we do all this with terminal i forgot the package e packs or some something like that so that we install we don't browse the kernel code in id or anything like that so we we browse a code from terminate so we have to install some package i forgot the package name so we have to install some two packages and with some command command of like keyboard only we we browse the functions and later it was a very useful thing that happened is i think free electron so some company like that they have a free or lxr i believe lxr they have a linux code browser online so i i remember my happiness when i see something like that those times so it's all good memories i know i digress from the question but it is good to think about those times thank you i think anybody else want to take this question i think matthew has some memories to share yeah well what what i could say i mean in in in relation to the question is that of course there there will always be those people who have access to the latest and greatest but they are very small minority so even as i was like made the focus of even like what i was alluding to is when i go out into the street when i see what is available for sale what i see is a lot of there's a lot of core to du you know dual core sund bridge fourth gen intel so to speak and you know kind of like on the higher end maybe you'll find a few eighth gen and you know it reduces as you go up so the gen general trend is that what i mean let's say let's say the $100 price point it's very similar to what you'll find i mean like on ebay what's what's available for $100 on ebay is generally what you'll find many people now have access to so to speak yeah so anyone else yeah think i can i can go next can you hear me please i'm i think i'm having some trouble with my connection i can hear you you can hear it yep yes yes so mostly i'm based in angolan so mostly i think people this they have really access to highend computing i think most student and people work in it most i probably imd intel and probably mobile phone mostly dominated by arm and i think just i think i see the same high pces that i see around in europe i don't find anything in particular since we basically don't produce processor and everything we mostly import and i think intel to dominate mostly the market i think paul had something to tell yep so well back in the days when i was at elementary school er having a computer it was very just for very few people and well the only access that you had is if you are going to a school a private school know so i recall back in the day that when i went to school i had the access to the computer but they came with a microsoft doos and we usually only learn some commands u creating folders files and so on it it was not it it didn't have too much impact u as i had when my father came with a computer from the flea market it was another fancy computer it was a trs 80 from the 80s well 10 years after i came across with this device i connected to my computer to my my computer to my tv set very old tv set with cut race and my curiosity started when i typed a command in basic that games it was called play and after play the arguments were the notes in english notation c ef and you can play a sound so that was my first time when i came interested in kind of programming it was very straightforward so typing a command then some argument value it was basic and when it took years after the some policy measures that came onto place to make the equipment more accessible to people so computers color computers with more resources like this memory etc and well it was the time when everyone started to play around with visual basic so well i i i notic some professionals starting making their own programs to handling data as similar as you do with excel or something like that databases with at the time access so yeah i i i i the the next generations here were more a forunate to have this uh the access to this to these technologies so yeah i'm now i can compare is you can have a $100 computer with a raspberry pi or any other single board computers and this is one of the slides i i can highlight from matthew's talk when you will gain a lot of experience when you have a less resources and you will close to what is on the done on the computer rather than a higher level language or even an ide so on a raspberry p you can inst any editor and you can program on c c++ python or something like that but it's more it's not it's it's more democratic to to make programs so gabri has some memories in my case is very similar to follow history my first computer i have was in the year 208 h pion for i remember but it wasn't until the college where i started to programming and the har laboratory of computer science was a d terminal which run on windows version in a server so i started er programming in that computer and after that in my personal laptop i'm start using linux and continue using linux un system and develop in this platform with a small midsize hard one it's not especially a cluster computer it's not more a laptop personal laptop that can run a c make and c compiler and make sofware mid size small size but i agree with in the possibility we can now we have to develop in a very small hardware like rb and create a software in a variety of platform and that is a vantage yeah so i think do systems like rasberry pi get any distribu ustion in like into like your words like for example matthew or gabriel paulo is is it like is raspberry p thing in in your countries yes yes there is rasberry pie in my college there was some rasberry pie er three i think not the last one but a previous one the last so as as regards raspberry pi i honestly don't see a lot of it i did see a few people you know trying to sell them a few years back but i think i think the last two years there might have been a shortage like globally i think i noticed something like that but what i do see a lot of like i i i mentioned before is a lot of desktops and older desktops that's that's really like what i see many people generally will have access to talking about like know the regular people not maybe people who have access to like a job with a multinational or government those who have jobs generally have access to to you know kind of like the latest computing but kind of like only in the office so you know like even what what i felt was a core a core a core principle of you know what i was speaking about is the distribution to the masses like is is it okay i mean if only 10 people in a nation have the latest macbook pros i don't think that's you that's not that's not an ideal situation we it's like how i mean we we i'm talking about performance that would empower like you know like a large large parts of the population to have as good as an experience kind of like as those you know throughout the world so to speak or do we have something to share well yeah here regarding single bir computers there are really easy to find here so and obviously there are cheaper so but yeah there is some tendency to buy some computers not the latest one obviously they are really really expensive are they might not justify investment if you can do on a computer from not the latest one but maybe two three years to go with some technology or some processing power that can do almost close to the same that you want to achieve or program and yeah as well in this part of the world one of the fields that are more popular is web programming so for web programming you not you don't need a huge computer power usually it's an editor yeah just reflecting on the browser that's it it's not not very power consuming so yeah i i feel here it's the very important part of the population have access to the hardware but this should be accompanied with how do you er teach or how do you approach u a programming language according to the field right so c++ for systems or web programming for obviously web interaction and so on so yeah this is this this is the thing i feel like it's not fully accompanied but yeah it can be improved thanks do we have questions in the background ch yeah seems the audience is rather listening today but but i see here now i ch a question on communities which probably is like interesting how is like kind of the you know the setup to to just be in contact with with other developers for you locally and i think we're going to go with matthew first okay so i think i'll i'll try and answer the three questions i think they the my answer probably try and answer both this it's the three questions do seem related so my view on teaching languages and programming especially c++ to kids from a smaller age and also in in rel and related to the that is also women how do you encourage women to get into software engineering and programming and and the like i do know that there are many may not say many but let me say that there are women who are involved in programming because of university and there many okay i think i think many many is not quite the right word there are women who do learn computing but i think as with many cultures you know it takes a lot of encouragement you know even it's it's the brave few who will soldier through you know going going to a university course for for programming and what have you so i think to encourage more people one the core thing is access is like you know the the the lower the cost say you know as paulo mentioned his father you know brought a computer i mean the more people who are able to get computers into their homes and the more you know young young girls young boys will get interested in it so it's it's really about access which comes background to the energy the energy the availability the the cost like what does it cost to get the computers in people's homes in people's environments and what have you and that's you know that's something that i usually see a lot i see that you know children these days have i mean they really know how to work mobile phones because you know they'll get access to mom's phone or dad's phone you know they know how to play the games they know how to play videos and they like so the access i mean the lower the energy they more accessible then they more exposure to more people i mean children women and yeah so that's that's really the heart of why i i'm you know kind of like you know zeroing in on c++ like this performance it it really matters to get more people having access to computing so to speak someone else going to take this question yeah i think it's you okay so are there many me women in your country into software engineering or programming roles so at least from the part which i come from yes a lot i i don't know if i have mentioned in some talks earlier but i i don't feel like i am i am the only woman in a particular project team since i care started my career because in in our companies and all where i pass worked on it's almost like i don't know about the correct percentage but i don't feel like a lack of women there so probably because of a lot of engineering colleges here and software engineering has been abu probably in i would say that when i pass out of my secondary school it's like some people go for medicine some people go for engineering like default some people check like yeah after 12th we'll write entrance examination medicine or engineering or and for some people some people who are very passionate about arts and like that they go for arts or different jobs but it's always kind of a default like we choose this or this like that okay so i don't feel lack of women in software engineering program roads at least from my from my part of the country but when i migrated to here then i irand then i realized that yeah in the west it is there are regions where even stem is considered like we are encouraging girls women or other under represented people to get into stem because like there are jobs which are i i didn't realize that there are it's not like i didn't realize that in our part in our place as well there are like jobs gender based that is still there but i didn't know that engineering is also considered gender based i didn't know that that that knowledge i get only after coming to ireland okay but i know that more more people are coming into that and there are more communities supporting girls into stem or other other commun underrepresented people into stem kind of but so let's wait and see there there will be more more representations in future years that's what i i feel thank you po oh yeah well related to women i can tell that i i i noticed there are few participation like in online community or some networking events but if you look closer to a list on employees or the numbers of percentage of the roles in software or programming yeah we are close to have some 50% 50% so there are is an important participation of women in programming roles but as i mentioned earlier i i don't see that they are willing to participate on on communities so it might be an oversight that there are not too much women in the in the field so well something to improve it at the early years of education not being not in telling that programming roles is are gender based or something like that that are it's only a role for this particular part of this particular kind of living some some some stuff are very hard to accept but yeah that's the reality and so encouraging from this not necessarily a 100% coding areas or 100% coding acad memic programs to in to children to in later years involved in programming and software so a a different approach should be taken like and at at a higher level like robotics or video games on some kind of tablet or something with a display so yeah not necessarily like someone needs to type code to make something work at the very at that age some abstractions should be more encouraged like building blocks or connecting cables something like that and by doing that improving the foundations obviously we can u address and encourage you if kid wants to make in the future a careering software now the current motivation i'm seeing is at the later age maybe when someone is entering to college or already leing the college is u obviously and we cannot deny it how many how much money i will earn if i enter to the programming roles so now that is the how do you say now it's the slogan to make someone to enter into the programming world but u without the foundations we are not changing something substantial that it's improving lives quality of people not it's not about just the money it's also about doing something something else for what what is in your community or improve someone person's life yeah thank you gabrielle well about woman in the software engineering in my case i knew woman with a a high position in this eng world unfortunately few woman but it's necessary that number grow up in any programming field i think is not necessary only for c++ but the good point is here we are some communities dedicated to woman especially and it's this communities promote the programming in the in the woman and it's related with the question about the communities what commun can do to encourage and improve the quality of people life i think is [music] in the main part that community makes is a bridge between news and seniors programming so new week can learn more of real life projects and think is this is important and more community promotes more sharing knowledge and i personally think is the knowledge sh everyone can can grow up and related with the programming in in children a professor one time told me the language is only the vehicle so anyone can learn programming in any language and adapt the knowledge in programming to any language that rings a bell in me i mean anyone that you say like anyone can learn a programming at any age right so my mom is retired now so i was thinking about ideas to keep my mom engaged so my next question to my mom start learning python or [music] c++ that's true i've been wondering like how do like the new standards spread into your countries like is like you know what what are the standards you use on your code basis especially like in in africa and south america i mean i know that in in ireland it's probably where honey lives it's probably a very modern or embedded system but like what what are the systems what are you working on and what standards are used for that and let's get started with h first okay okay so yeah in my case in audio programming i have this flexibility of using a standard something in the middle i'm not using c++ 20 due to some constraint i have it's not it's not my fault but it's apple apple clank is not up to date on c++ 20 so i cannot use modules for now well i know don't know when when i i can do it anyway so i i usually stay on the previous standard in plus+ 17 this is the standard that can i work in close platforms environments apple and windows mostly but this is i can tell from my field in other fields that they use here c++ yeah it can be something in the very best scenario something like c++ 11 the the standard that you will find some literature like the like the books that from be and some others that appeared at that time h but traditionally and some legacy code is pre c++ 11 even on academia so because the the textbooks and the people that are teaching stay in the past they they didn't they they are still relating as c sl c++ something like that that they are still kind of the same language so that's very unfortunate so even me before entering a professional field of using c++ i was thinking the same because that is the mindset when you graduate it's like there are because we don't we are not aware of the c++ is having a continuous development is being standardized compared to another popular languages they they don't standardize they are continuously providing new versions from a really really small time frame so you you never know which version are you using i i can tell that from python so there are several python on 3. 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so and there are kind of compatible unless you are doing something specific so yeah back to c++ is that is the one of the challenges is like we cannot keep up with the latest c++ the most recent will be now c++ 23 and we are not even adapting c++ 20 or it's not even available fully on the rest of the compilers so the support is not so how can i how can i standard be established it if we are moving or what the compiler support is not at the same pace as the standardization also the guidelines on c++ today there were there was a zo meeting from andreas viice on misra c++ which was recently released so now this is another sub set of cor lines like should we adopt or should we ad not so there there is a discussion on this on the very recent discussion on reddit so this kind of mismatches between how a standard should i learn and not to being really a lot of years behind or adopting too fast c++ any c++ standard might be a a challenge on how i can adopt a particular one yeah bre well i agree with pao where i learn c++ was a mix up between c and c++ is more like c with standard code nothing a very ugly version of c++ but that is the way i learning and i think is [music] it's important to introduce the new standard of c++ er most of the companies i think is using legacy code so the max level of standard is 11 in my case in where i work we are using the standard 17 and but some companies i here or listen is using all version c++ i think it's more for a phrase of the new change introduces it the new standard and the the fact that change old standard to new one er probably will require a lot of investment in time and money because some things change radically from one standard to another m okay so i think what some something that i observed and something i was trying to bring out in my talk is this the way i view it is that we like when it comes to the standards and i don't think this would be something unique to my country just something that i think is there globally is that it's it's something a bit like a triangle where you know just at the top there the few people who would even know how to access c++ 20 i mean many people i mean they just know okay just use the compiler so whatever is the standard on the compiler is what they will use so depending that now that now depends also on the operating system that you're using so for example the reason why i was using arch is because arch linux is because you know there it's a rolling release so i get access to newer compilers but you know because i've been trying to work with modules and even that i've actually had to now compile the compiler myself in order to access those features so it's the the the the the more recent the standard the less people have access to it and so it kind of like goes like a triangle so to speak so in light of that i know many people you know like even even the difference between c and c++ is not something that very many people actually even understand because they just use what is there and even if you're using a modern compiler i mean you might be writing c code with you know just using iio stream for input and output but everything else is c raw pointers and poter arithmetic and what have you so i think that's why you know i kind of like said okay fine get away from the ide you know you need to understand i mean just what it's like to type in the compiler and give it flags and i mean it's it's it's it's all about access basically the more people have access to the core of the actual programming and not you know kind of like you know where the id is hiding things for you and holding your hand and making things work for you i think there was a question about chat gpt now i mean you know my my personal thoughts about it is that i i i believe in natural intelligence the intelligence of people the that natural intelligence that's i mean for example even with the question about women in programming there is that natural different intelligence that women have that i mean if you look around in your team and you you're all men you're you're missing something you need to have more women there and yes it is our responsibility even as men or other women to make sure that you know it's not just it's not enough to have some women you know doing university courses we need to make sure that they come on board and they feel that that natural intelligence that they have is part of you know whatever software whatever programs that you're building so i think what what the vision i have i mean this what i was trying to you know kind of like bring out is that we need to encourage more access to code by women men the natural intelligence because the problem with ai is you still need to kind of like investigate whether what it's telling you is true or not and i you know for me personally that's too much of a mental burden i think i prefer dealing you know with humans it's i don't know it's easier to tell if a human is lying to you you know you can kind of like look in the eyes maybe but you know ch gpt will just spit out whatever and now you you you actually have an extra job of verifying whether what is said is true or not or not true and and yeah there that's that's what i think about like the standard and that's what i see about i mean the exposure to the to to the new the new coding standards because i think you know like we we're like ambassadors those of us who know how to we i mean we kind of like to pass on the knowledge through the communities and you know kind of those who are learning from us will aset on so that's what i think know the community is the key to improving the situation basically that's what i think multiple bell ring moments for me when you talk yeah i also think about the same i mean i mean like chachi p i don't know i have a different opinion but i agree with that the point of like you love to work with humans so yes humans are different in anyway and you talk about women so women are very good in multitasking yes so that you should accept and and yes community regarding the community so to me why i'm interested in community is similar to what you talk like we are ambassadors or like we are so to me in i come from a family of like in in my family there there are no software engineers at le so i choose my path on after secondary school i choose computer science without knowing anything about computers much i have literally seen a computer but i haven't ever worked or i haven't played games or anything like that so i choose computer computer science leaving my most favorite subject biology so it's kind of so emotional uh rather than passion so it's it's kind of emotional to me and i choose computer science and the first programming language which i learned is c++ so and i still live with programming computer science c c++ all these things so to me it's a emotional part there and regarding uh why i'm interested in knowledge sharing or like why i'm interested i'm coming in community first point which matthew has already mentioned it's it's a community it's a human human factor is still there i have probably i'll will have more friends in the programming community than probably in the outside world so that is one factor it's a friendship community another factor is i so as i told like i come from a family they can't guide me where i need to go like that so i get many advices from many of my gurus starting from my when i start my career and even now so i'm getting a lot of encouragement from c++ committee friends i have to i have to thank yen in particular for all the opportunities which he gave me so so when i receive something like it's my it's my thought like when i receive something i am obliged to pass it on to other people as well so that's always in my heart so that's one reason i am i am trying to engage in community it's a bit hard finding time with the family and all but still on my ler time whatever little little bit lesser time i get i i try to be share my knowledge i mean h invoke some discussion so that like prompt some questions so that new new thoughts arrive new new mean these are something which interests me as well thank you yeah i think that's always important to to give people a chance to you know to become part of the community and to share their knowledge which actually like you know when we see us a committee and how the language evolves how is that accessible for people in the developing world how can they understand where c++ as a language is coming from and kind of you know how it's made and has has any of you like looked into like the committee and how things are working there well so checking on the isopp website you will see some reports of the working group it's sometimes over welling because there are too much and as there are papers obviously the the length or the extent of the the document it's just re having a lot of reference from past meetings or past technical reports defect reports something like that so yeah here there are some question related to the experts in c++ i say they are expensive well there should be some arrangements or some partnerships with maybe some institutes or universities because if they can't afford bringing an expert as much i did cost dividing the ticket cost for the a lot of several students well it will minimize the impact to to the to to some of the the wallets of of the students because i i i tried to enter in some c++ training but yeah there are they are expensive compared to the economy that we have here so it's very restrictive to do that so most of the times i and this is related to the other question about the the conference conf es i watched the conferences from the previous year so it was not to be aware of what other professionals are using c++ another areas approaches or some criticism on c++ which they are but i i was surprised that i i don't recall which was the day from munich c++ end of the year meeting i think it was on tuesday and there there was a a a particular islight regarding people attending to c++ conference and jet brains u aggregated this information from the surveys are they found that 80% of c++ developers that they claim to be c++ developers or are using c++ are not going to conferences which is very a high rate of people not going well i can i from my end i can tell you it might be because there are bas it in countries that you might need to get a visa or the flights are really not affordable for someone's salary so yeah this this might be a c i don't know or there are people that too much reluctant to assisting that conference where there are too many er speakers several topics and you cannot get anything and you get the fear fear of missing out and if yeah it it it will it might be an overwhelming experience but from what i heard on on meeting c++ stuff that and some colleagues that they went to cpp con and that it's actually very fun i i haven't been there but i i plan in the future so yeah well i i i don't think there are any other questions related to that so dri you have something to share yes i have a similar with pablo and in argentina is it's hard to bring some international conference er some universities cannot afford the cost but personally this incoming year 2024 i will try to promote the virtual conference in my university and teach more c++ in a subject i teaching that is the idea i hope is could be possible so it's related with the area to change in the university education is promote in at least in my university promote more c++ and using at least the standard 17 and even more maybe the 20th standard i that was we be a great success and related with the jpt i agree with matthew i think is the human intelligence is important to make a criteria or what happen or make a an deep analysis of something is not working well i personally use only for create text and more elegant and nice text for an issue and and comment and so on but in always tce or even better for eyes can make a deep analysis and and trace back in something is not working i think it's on the question talking on now i don't know matthew do you have anything to say well i i just wanted to say something brief on the on the matter of experts and training i think you know the the the developing world i think will always be different like how how things will work out for the developing world is different in fact i was you playing around with this the idea of instead of calling it a developing world let's it's kind of like looking at it like developing differently meaning it could be devel we could say that we're developing at a different time that you're coming from i mean you're coming from behind so to speak that there are those who have gone ahead of you they those who have access to the latest and greatest and you may be having access to the same thing maybe say five years behind so in light of the conferences i i've noticed that i tend to get the most value from older talks so you know say cpon say 2020 2019 at this stage is when i feel i'm gaining more value from the content that was may have been given say five years ago so i don't think it's it may even though we may get to the point where there are conferences the ability to benefit from the online recordings you know the ability to to kind of like pick up from your level just wherever you are to be able to you know just see a talk from say 2017 and now you able to apply the features that were being talked about then because now the your current compiler has availability because you know like in the conferences yes there is that tendency to talk about the latest and greatest which you know you know not many many people will have access to so i think it's okay to be coming from behind so to speak and i think that's one of the benefits of technology you know even with as paulo mentioned the issue of traveling i actually had hoped to travel to cppcon and it turned out i wasn't able to and so they actually made an exception they said okay they weren't planning to have any online sessions but i i i mean i i i me my request i told them i'm not able to but there something i i mean this is talk that i felt i wanted to to speak about and so they gave me a chance to you know do it online so even to today this is the second time i'm giving the talk and i got to improve on the slides a little bit and hopefully the next time i'll give it maybe it might be in person on but the point is the technology is bridging that gap so we don't we don't have to do it the way you know kind of like people do it you know fly to one place and they like being able to watch the videos even if it's five years later still has great value so so that's what i think about that i'm sure yens will have a point to mention about this and i mean first i i do know that you know some of the trainers i know have given trainings for companies in india where of course you know the prices are usually set for the commercial world right so there's a company who wants to train their team and then those prices are okay some trainers probably also give like courses to students etc and then they probably have different prices or may just not take anything for it and then there is like the the common c++ personalities which also you know give talks and do things for free for user groups regarding like you know community and content creators that also exists in in other countries right there are c++ books written in spanish and i guess maybe there those authors are from spain maybe there are some c book authors from from th america mentioned in the chat here it's not visible to the audience but actually there is a website called learn cute. guu and they offer various courses on the online platform udmi and the author is currently publishing a qml 6 book and they are from randa so they are actually an african author and c++ programmer who shares their knowledge online and i think that more like or at least what i see like a lot of the knowledge where people go for probably in also like in in the developing world is using online platforms like udi and the other learning platforms which exist online maybe can we hear some think about that like from from matthew like what is your experience with that so i think i i'll i'll kind of like mention from my experience one of the things you know like my my actual learning of c++ has actually been more out of like a personal you know like my personal passion and endeavor to learn and most of my learning has actually been outside of university because when i did computer science you know it's at that time java was you know like the main language that's what the lecturers were really excited about and so my my learning has come from personal personally looking for the information and so i think that's why you hear me like kind of like advocating more for community and like using the resources that are out there because it's i don't think i i see even like c++ being taught you know as a as a language in the university and i think even these days with the with all the browser based language is there's not a lot of interest you'd have to be really interested in the performance to venture into c++ so my my my my idea of the learning is that i mean it's more about your personal initiative that's why i'm also talking about more about the community and access so that anybody can kind of like reach out and so you personally do not have experience with online learning platforms like ud me no no not really okay maybe paulo or gabrielle well here is something that might be controversial yeah i i tried those online platforms which it's almost of the year are with courses on sale but i haven't finished any of the courses because maybe my learning skills are not video based more handson experience i i prefer some great and tutorials rather than videos as as far as i can tell i had good experience with other online platforms with where they have some kind of community there are not only recorded videos and where you cannot interact with any other one so but not for c+ plus for any other type of technologies that are complimentary to c+ plus or complementary to software engineering so yeah this is what i can tell on these online platforms i'm curious of learning qt guide because there are not too much condensed stuff on qt as a framework there are usually dispers and the forum i haven't i i haven't found helpful on qt compar it with any other frameworks of c++ so yeah i'm going to give it a try but there is a the book as you mentioned so maybe i will buy the book rather than opting to this udmi courses because as i told you i have several listed ones but i haven't finished any of them yeah maybe maybe those online platforms are also a bit of a generational thing that maybe you know but also it's like i i know that kate gregory is like on a different learning platform and she's like quite you know keep pushing coures so there's definitely an audience for that and i see honey yeah i i am a fan of actually they say moo right this online learning platforms i'm actually a fan of it but as you told like everything is on price fortunately i get this vre from our company so in my earlier companies as well they they give importance for learning so they give so in our goals itself like for every year our objectives itself are set for there's some goal related to learning goal so we need we they because they believe in that they give this subscriptions so i have tried many of this like udam skill skill soft plasite corsera corsera course which i take on my own i i i purchase mean i did the course corer has an interesting feature like if we finish we can go by the certificate so what i also experience like paulo was telling like many ces s like so i see a recent [music] meme apple i i can't express it like like a kid in front of a lot of apples each apple is like like that a bite just and somebody was telling about in the meme the title was about my books so in that i i i responded my programming courses so it's like so like that so i think everybody has this experience like we can't finish things in time or like even for books we can't finish in time but to me what i like the positive thing which i take from that is that we at least learned that much so we don't have to we don't have to be regret on it like we could at least learned that much so i don't i take it only in a positive way so yeah udi por adex i have tried many of this and yeah as yans mentioned kate ggary is a active ployes cess cours maker and i have attended few of her courses as well and i i usually say kate is my c+ guru because like i i think for c+ was especially if i take a course like i mean i i i i i learned cus at start learning c at the age of 15 but again uh regarding the modern cis if i ask if somebody ask me who is your guru i i can point to k because like i attended her plasite course from right from the start to end like that so yeah i have good things to tell thanks gabriel do you have something experience to share about udab or any i personally don't use it i learned most of the most mod c++ for the conference and that's is why i i knew agents ch but i knew about the platform i'm more like the tutorials in youtube articles or book well i have some a piece of advice on the corsera platform in particular the c++ courses there are obviously from universities if you want to get the foundations of the principles of using c++ it's fine but it's not model c++ yeah they used they are still on the raw pointers not for for each based loops the legacy ones something like that and there are only focus it well console applications rather than dealing with gui frameworks of some stuff yeah i i i this might be related to the question related to what can be improved in c++ at universities and it's adopting reset standard not being like a legacy code because it's an old language compared to the newest one that came into place and there are i languages that became to be replaced as a modules er for teaching computer science so this is what i found they're actually from there is actually a course from the mit on c++ and it's c++ o3 so yeah this is one to take care about the recent ones that you can find in another place like udmi or plural side yeah there are they they they are really likely to have modem c++ but the price is really high chloroxide it's around $300 a year so not too many people will be allow be allowed to to pay that it's it's cheaper compared to going to college or taking a continuous education course and some institution but still many people will be reluctant to pay to want to this kind of prescription model that's kind of true i think especially with universi it's like an international problem that you know they they start teaching a course and then they keep teaching the course for a decade and then of course after the decade the course is not like but it's still like what they want to teach and of course like so like meeting some of the folks online from all over the world with online user group i've seen many and especially like with india i see that india might not have the the big problem with with like getting the newest computer hardware but there's always often teached with like very outdated software like that turbo c++ is like seems to be still b a big thing at least in india and i've also in the job fa i had some interesting conversations there has been in folks which don't know any standards but they kind of know live in a world where c++ is defined by the version of the compiler like visual studio they're working with and that's how they interact with that and there there's this huge world of developers which are you know more like seeing it as a tool or like as work and then they're not really interacting with or like motivating to to learn because it's like i think it's like like a huge difference to people which are coming to to our community events and which are part of the community events mostly we have like also like c++ as a hobby we have an interest in learning this and you know it's for for many of us maybe the motivation has been to secure a good job and as honey said yeah it's i think for for many of us it's also the situation also for me it's like my dad wasn't software engineer so but he worked with computers so he he does have sometimes some advice with things but that has you know things have changed so much especially with the cloud and basically when you have internet access when you have the connectivity you have access to everything but is your connectivity good enough we had like the person i know he's originally from angola but i'm not sure where he is right now if he's in angola or somewhere else but he had to drop out due to his connectivity issues and then we had one panel member who couldn't make it to the panel because she had an issue with her microphone and you need to have have a microphone to join this and so without a microphone doesn't make sense to be on a panel and it's kind of interesting to see how the perspectives are internationally and c++ so maybe let's close out like with with what your perspective is on c++ and let's have our speaker speak first on that matthew okay so i think i'll kind of like let me say summarize even what what i was trying to say in the talk with regards to c++ it is a very rich language kind of like english which has evolved in different places for different reasons and i think it is it is kind of like a common platform for what i think can unify our computing so what what what basically i'm trying to kind of like point out is that this language is very broad but it has that ability to kind of like unify our our computing and especially now when it comes to learning and teaching there's the question here about you know like can an old person learning yes i do think it is possible but i think we need to rethink how we communicate that you see that's why talking about the emphasis on community just emphasis on spending time reading programs but reading programs with the understanding ing that there are many dialects so to speak of c++ so you kind of like have to be a bit flexible that that flexibility is actually one of the the the core things the same way that we're able we all speaking in english but our english is shall i say motivated by our background you see those from south america you know there's a bit of a spanish portuguese flavor to our english even the english is english is very different from the irish english so i see c++ in the same way that it's a it has a common base that's a common starting point but it reflects the diversity of where people are learning from where they're coming from and when you're talking about the language you you kind of like need to be open to somebody else's background so as you can see as we as we speak to one another we able to understand one another despite the our different donations accents you know phrasing of the english language so that's that's what i see in c++ and i think it has that potential with more community with more encouragement and not not just looking at it like you know a university type thing but just the kind of thing that just take the time read about it there are many free resources what something i was trying to you know point point to that there are even free resources before you get to the paid courses start reading just read us read what you can watch where you can then after some time then you'll be able to see the value in investing for example you know kids course on plural site there's there's a talk she gave some time back where she she she she gave this phrase that yes good training is not free so as though you may start with the free resources now as you want to learn more than how you you can invest kind of like in the quality teaching but it starts with the the community with encouraging people to take a look at it it's not just a university thing it's it's a language it's a way of communicating and it's one of the best ways to really understand the program that you actually use because many of them are actually written in c++ or c c++ so to speak yeah that's what i think okay so finishing u answer and related also with if a someone early age canar c++ well my my suggestion and my conclusion is to start in programming we have to start as matthew mention it with english as a way to communicate with others with our interests in the developing word we are using english because it's the language that we can it can allow us to communicate between each other from different countries or different parts of the world c++ i consider this is something in between like what it's running in bits and bites of the computer and what you can touch or see on any any object that you have around the uses technology so u to to say that is like anyone can programming but not necessarily should be c++ the in initial language it should be something with a high level abstraction but having a mindset that there is something underlying and we can do or we have more control are we are more have more freedom to create software stuff when we are closer to a machine language and c++ allows you to do that without being aware of how assembly works but not only leaving to a high level extration doing every stuff because sometimes you are curious of how things work behind the scenes and this is what we have to keep the our motivation on learning c++ regarding to resources look for what works best for you if you like reading obviously look for books there're not they might can be seen as expensive but there are a nice investment because you can look anytime you want even if you don't have internet connection or in some part parts of the world as i'm living now in ecuador we have some blackout power ag so actually i i have a blackout now i'm i'm communicating with you via a ups connection to the model and the computer so yeah maybe i will limited to be limited to navigate to the browser if i want to learn something now i can get the book but yeah if you like videos i knew cl class made like some colleagues that they want they like to learn from videos that they last for a r around 30 minutes 1 hour i can understand that but this is mine yeah it's totally valid yeah once you are confident on paying a training and if you are willing to invest that amount of money yeah there is no reason to to leave that out of place to consideration gabri well to close i i agree with m and pao important thing i the important thing i i believe is start probably with any language not necessar c++ but it's possible start with c++ now the last standard allowed to new people learn c++ in an easy way and that is a a nice feature i think is the language and i think also c++ needs more diffusion more people doesn't know how wish but is important in mod area is using c++ communication robotics er 4.0 industry and for that the resource available about c++ like the pr conference or articles or book or the communities is the key point to to do that and also i want to say thank you to jen for the invitation to the banel and this is also a a very nice way to share the knowledge about c++ and promote the language and probably i can also close closing words about c++ as i already told like c++ is an emotional part to me one a few more points which i want to mention is c++ keeps me grounded because like i at work i still work with c++ 14 probably for everyone may be knowing this because i talk about this because of the standard restrictions we are we have to be in c standards restriction we had to be in c++ 14 and as paula mentioned earlier like with the with with the new misra c++ standards based on c+ 17 we have hopes that we'll be switching to c+ 17 so soon okay that's said so we know that how he process as a language is growing and that keeps yet that always makes me humble all the time that yeah i have more things to learn i have more things to learn i haven't experimented this feature yet like that so so that is one one thing and it also keeps me my brain activ because like every day we'll we'll get into some challenges this is common not only for c+ my software engineering job as well so why i'm passionate about this job is yes it it gives me challenges every single day it keeps my learning muscles active it it it it involes lot of new thoughts so it keeps my brain active so same for c+ as well and again the wonderful programming community and the wonderful friends i have nobody has seen me live anywhere unless in the online space so that's it thank you over to yens yes well that's quite wonderful to hear from all of you and that brings us to the end yeah my one perspective is i've learned a lot through the years and trying to continue that learning and yeah it's like running the community or like not running but you know being being one of the contributors of events and organizing it this always makes other things hard so i'm looking forward to write a bit more c++ next year and that's that's the other thing which i've experience this year is like how hard the learning curve is with like you know it's not just c++ no you also want to have git you want to have a package manager you want to have oh cmake you want to build and and there's there is not only like one language to learn there is multiple accompanying tools and things to learn and it's getting kind of hard to you know to to get a grasp of like what's all like you know like normal like what what we learned by just working on it every day and just you know maybe having some team members take care of other things so so and with that thank you all for coming also thank you for those who have had to drop out or couldn't make it because of technical issues maybe we have more panels in the future we'll see and with that i think i'm going to end the stream and so i wish you have all a nice day or nice evening and with that thank you for coming thank you for watching thank you
