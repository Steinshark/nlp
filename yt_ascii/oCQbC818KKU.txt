missing data may be the most interesting thing in the whole data mining so just to clarify something and i say missing data in the immigration video we were talking about data that's unobtainable i don't mean that i mean data which you could obtain it but it's missing so that was the unknown that's right now we just talk about things like you could know it but for whatever reason it's just not there let's start at the beginning i mean you might go missing data hold on i heard is the world of big data we could data coming out of our ears what do you mean missing data yeah yeah the data is getting bigger and data is everywhere because we have centers embedded in everything these days for example and there's surveys all the time and everything is recorded forevermore so there's more and more data that of trouble is the quality of the data is actually going down and down i mean years and years ago times when i was doing my phd for example we had these tiny small data sets and they were hand curated and it was like wouldn't wonderfully crafted and everybody was checked in was on you haven't got time for that anymore now data gets collected russia russia russia and you know and of course what happened this center goes wrong something doesn't quite get collected somebody goes on a cigarette break and doesn't take your temperature whatever this sort of thing but also it can be can be completely a completely good reason i'm just going to show you another example why data can be missing on my screen here i've got a data set from a hospital where we talking about colon cancer patients and if they told 500 people lots of lots of different measurements have been taken from them over the years if you look through this you'll see that it's quite a few blanks here and for some patients seem to be completely blank what happens over the years is technology changes i mean there's some tests available now that just didn't exist ten years ago so of course for the patients now we have some data we just didn't have ten years ago it's missing but it can't be much about it also patients don't turn up on appointment the data's missing or i mean a lot of these things are done by biological sampling and sometimes the chemicals don't work the guy looks through the microscope he doesn't like it they answer and you know so all sorts of things also i mean if you're talking about things like a survey for example somebody might just not wanna give the answer i don't know the answer so a lots of reasons why data can be missing now what do we do about missing data and why am i going to try and tell you this is really interesting i mean okay let's do the basics first missing data you might go well okay well just go back and get it in okay well possible i mean it depends what you're doing i mean we've done a project with hq the security with you you will hear a bit about this or maybe he just become aware of a zero-day attack somebody nobody else knows yet and he really there we collected a relatively small amount of data from experts and there was one or two answers missing and we've really wanted those answers so yeah we went back to the experts because you knew who they were where we said look you forgot to answer this question kay just tell us the answer that's all right we can do this with one or two things they can't do this like for hundreds and hundreds of things i mean in a hospital they can defrost some samples and i can try and sample them again there's a lot of effort a lot of money goes into this i think you normally do this so yeah maybe you can go back fill in the blanks but it's not realistic not for any large scale thing next then what else can you do i just ignore the missing values then you know who cares you know well okay so let's take this example here of my of my 500 patients on the hospital in the hospital this is probably the uk's best dataset in colon cancer now from the 500 patients about 90% of them have got one volume missing or other for all the reasons i mentioned so if you just got rid of everybody who's got a bit of missing data we're left with 10% of the data completely no point anymore to analyze it okay fine well swell now maybe you think okay maybe you shouldn't get rid of the data it's just a little bit of data is missing that's fine just get rid of the ones where there's a lot of data missing oh that sounds like a nice idea but i'll just straight up to you so let's imagine this is how a day turning is like oh well you know attributes for six seven eight nine and then a my example there is 200 of them and then we could our patients 1 2 3 4 5 and in my example there's 500 of them we've got this enormous matrix or table of data and you know the odd value is missing so there's a few missing if you're missing it for some of them a bit more dismissing any kind of what it looks like it's all right so you know who should we ignore okay you go all right let's guess it with other ones would have a lot of data missing do you mean the columns or the rows where do we start because and you're certain you're zod realize you actually end up with something which is a giant sudoku kind of thing because like okay well if we cancel this one out then actually how many x's have you got left in these columns now and i feel aunt elizabeth i suddenly cancel this one but now this one doesn't look so bad anymore because we cancel that one and also you will find this a lot of them have the same number of data items missing because they maybe miss the same number of tests so which if then do we get rid of and then depending which when you delete first you somebody different in fact what you can share is this is an optimization problem in itself which is harder solving the data mining problem so that it's not there's no easy way of just deleting a few because which few and you did need some ideally some different bones we pay for analyze the data we get different answers again pointless so deleting the data that's missing nice idea and might work if you could huge amounts of data and little bit is missing but in reality it's actually really really hard okay right convinced you now we need to do something about missing data what can we do about missing data but it's a date anything at random was it missing not at random and that's why it gets starts get interesting so give you some examples let's say for a particular patient one of the blood values is missing and it's missing because the test failed a chemical failed almost certainly this is completely at random it's just a chemical failed in this particular moment and there's a random random failure fine another example might be if you do fill in the survey and you for example asking for income of people and somewhere else in the survey you're also asking what's your mental state at the moment are you happy or you're not so happy and what happens is a lot of people don't really want to say what their income is because they're bit shy about income but actually the people not so happy are probably even more shy about their income because you haven't got so much income so what happens is it's kind of random what's missing because it's randomly missing but there's a bit of a correlation on happening between some of the things how do we deal with missing data we can probably fill it in somehow for example i could calculate the mean of the date of everybody else and wherever the data is missing i put a mean volume that's a classic approach of filling in missing value if my data before looked something like this and now i've got a number of people where the number is missing and i put the meaning of course afterwards my day table looks something like this weren't it because suddenly i've given everybody who had something missing this middle value the argument is if it's completely missing at random that's a somewhat acceptable way of doing it because i'm not changing any of the distributions now but it's not ideal because i get this peak in there and actually the data it's not as diverse anymores before so better way of filling in a missing value would be i give me the middle value but plus mine is a bit of an error and then probably i go from something like this to something a bit more like maybe looks like this and that's quite acceptable now what if it not missing completely random well if it's not missing completely at random then and i do this i'm kind of distorting the data because i'm putting in something random it shouldn't be but of course but i can do is i can have use a bit of domain knowledge and go okay income is missing for some people because they don't wanna give this value but it's kind of connected to your mental state and i know different mental states of different incomes and i can build a bit of a correlation model where basically if your mental state is this then i give you the medium income of those sort of people if your mental state is that i give you the median income of the other group of people well that's better that makes it quite a nice thing maybe i can do it for men and women for example i can do it for all the young people or i can just see what does it relate to the missing thing why do we need to fill in these missing values actually why not just let's just not do anything at all because a lot of software can't handle it a lot of machine learning needs to have a value there if a blank it just breaks so we need something there and if you think your software can deal with it it probably behind the lines does something with the blank so so far this is all kind of still a bit yeah ok missing value is calculating missing values ok it's a bit of interesting now it's not that interesting yet where it gets properly interesting is when the value is not missing it randomly at all and that very often is actually part of the answer that you need for the whole data mining problem let's take another example let's say you're an insurance company and one of the bate data item should be collected to driving the license number and of course i only want to give insurance to people who really have a driving licence now if you don't tell me your driving license number might well be because you haven't actually got a driving licence so you just to sort of person i need to date a mine and not give a insurance to or really expensive insurance maybe so not having the value of and it's not random at all might actually be the data that you need to mine now because we can't mine a missing value it's not possible in this case what we can do is we can do something like a sensor value it's called so they give you something like a minus one for example or two five five or something like this where all the missing values get replaced if they send it it just means that i can sort on this value and i can then data mine on it now i need to be careful because i need to understand why is the body missing but if it's missing for this reason that could be very good now the last thing and this is very guess perhaps the most interesting is where the day isn't missing at all but it's really missing i do this all the time and i'm sure these all the time we have to fill in questionnaires and i don't really want to give the real data for the bloody questionnaire it doesn't let me finish without putting in a number so i need to put in something and i often put it into something random more people do this in questionnaires so it might be something like my telephone number is nine nine nine nine nine nine i don't want anybody calling me thank you very much or number of children minus one because you know i don't want to tell you it cetera et cetera so what happens is i do data mining and damali isn't missing because there's a number there but of course the number is completely false it's wrong and really it's missing so what i need to do is two stages here i need to do a basic data mining maybe something unsupervised where i find all these outliers and then i can either delete the outliers and replace them with something more sensible or maybe having found the outliers i'm actually finished because if i want to find all the people not to give insurance - well you lie about the telephone number but no what else are you lying about so maybe you're just sore person you shouldn't give you the insurance and the finger vein reader rather than just a traditional fingerprint reader actually searches for signs of life so has to make sure that you have an edge of finger cough that someone's brought you through so it's quite extreme the other way these methods usually work is to actually start off by saying but how many groups would you like your data to be and how many clusters would you like
