- if you push this button you will get an insanely
stupid and random punishment, which probably makes you
wonder why would you press it? well, one random press
won't be a punishment, it will actually be $100,000. i grabbed all my friends, and what plays out in
this video is hilarious. you guys get the point by pressing that you could win this $100,000 here for your sister, or you could get punished. i don't care.
- can i press it now? - yeah. (bell dinging)
all right. wear pants filled with mayonnaise. before we make him put
on mayonnaise pants, anyone else wanna press it? - it can't get worse than that. - break a two by four using only babies. - what? - we have chris' pants here, and we have to mayonnaise it. - here we go. - [chris] it's gonna
look like i took a dump. - [mrbeast] oh no. - ew, i can feel things dropping. oh. (all laughing) it's so cold. oh. - all right, let's go bash some
babies against two by fours. - [karl] oh, you disgust me. - here's a two by four. - okay.
- and here's a baby. i don't know how you're gonna do it, but you gotta break that in half. - let's get to work. - [mrbeast] oh, and if you need
an extra baby, here you go. - okay, good, good. - [mrbeast] and if you need another one there's another one. - we're going two handed. (babies crying) - while he's busy bashing
babies i'm pressing the button. (bell dinging) (explosion booming) yeah, let's go. - what that means is when you get a punishment you don't like you get to press this button and skip it, but you can only press it once. - oh, okay. - nolan and chandler, neither of you have
pressed the button yet. one of you guys wanna take a go? (bell dinging)
all right. (explosion thudding) go home and flush your toilet. - my home's in nebraska. (group laughing) - just go to the hotel you're staying at. - okay. let's go. - nolan is going to flush the toilet, chris is showering from the mayonnaise, and tags is still busting
it two by four with babies. who's pressing it next? what says this next one's a punishment? - years of knowing you says. - oh, oh. pick someone and pie them in the face. - yes. - that could've been you. - oh, hey, look who just walked back. did you read the tv? - no. all right guys, i'm leaving. - i mean, it's a lot of money, this $100,000 could literally pay for my sister's
entire college tuition. - they said i only had to use babies. (intriguing music) (saw rumbling) (wood thudding) (explosion booming) - oh hey. - that baby stood no chance. - did you actually break it in half? - yeah.
- look what he is doing. i might not have rushed back.
- oh, what? - if i'm doing a challenge i don't have to get
pied in the face, right? - yeah, you don't. watch this video of chris
farting for 20 minutes. all right, go watch chris
fart for 20 minutes. - why do you have chris
farting for 20 minutes? - karl, for the love of god, you've gotta pie something. (pie thudding)
(all laughing) - you got the most thick pie. - now i know if i'm ever pieing someone don't buy pumpkin pie,
it didn't do anything. - no, keep buying pumpkin pie, i'm very happy that happened. - this is is a 20 minute
montage of chris farting. enjoy, you gotta watch it all. - red bull gives you farts (farts). red bull gives you farts (beeps). - it's just farting. - red bull gives you farts.
- is this actually 20? oh my gosh, it's 20 minutes. jimmy's gone, maybe we'll have
better luck if we press it. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) - no. (karl laughing) - oh my god, wait, who pressed it? - i don't know. - here's the fish? - 100 times? one, two, three, four. - currently chris is beating
himself with the fish, chandler is watching
you fart for 20 minutes. and nolan is going to flush his toilet. karl, i think you should join the party. (bell dinging) sit in a corner for an hour. - ha.
- now that you're sitting, see this counter above your head. it's started. - hey.
- what? - 69. - nice.
- nice. - bam.
- oh. - let's get it. - do 100 pushups. - oh, i'm done with my punishment. (bell dinging) - sort this bowl of m&m's by color. (candy rumbling) -', 19, 20. - this might seem stupid
and you probably wanna quit. - mm-mm. - oh, all right, nevermind then. - you think sitting in a
corner is gonna stop me from doing more punishment? (upbeat music) - you cannot push this
button until you pee. so while you're sitting
in this corner karl here's some water. - [narrator] ooh, ooh, ooh. (chandler grunting) (upbeat music) - i'm flushing this
toilet for you natalie. (toilet flushing) let's go. - my sister is worth all this pain. - [narrator] aww. - [tags] 60, oh my god. 68. 69. - you wanna take a break sorting m&m's to go watch chandler watch
you fart for 20 minutes. - yeah, that sounds nice. hey buddy, how's my farts? you're gonna go to sleep tonight, and it's all you're gonna
hear looping in your head is my fart. i'm sure your sister appreciates this. get back to my m&m's. - 99. oh my god, i'm so close. mom, this is for you. 100. woo. - congratulations on your 100 pushups. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) kick a field goal. we rented a football field, i'll text you the address you
gotta go kick a field goal. - all let's do this. - four seconds. three. - red bull gives you farts. - one. go, go. (upbeat music) (door squeaking) - [narrator] a few moments later. (toilet burbling)
(door squeaking) - chandler is back. (bell dinging) let's see it. pick a contestant to
skip the next 10 turns. - me. - you're supposed to pick someone else. - one of the next 10
ones could be the winner. - i doubt it. - chandler just expelled
himself for 10 button presses. nolan has literally been
gone for an eternity, i'm gonna call him and see where he is. nolan, where are you? you've been gone for like three hours. - i've been gone for like 20 minutes bro. what are you talking about? no, you haven't, it's literally
been an hour and a half. - if i wanna win this
100,000 for my sister i gotta get back as soon as possible. - it's good, i have my pee bucket, and my pee blanket, my pee, what? pre pee. (upbeat music) - that took forever. (bell dinging) - go give away $1,000
to 10 random strangers. i know you just got back nolan, but here's a briefcase
with $10,000 in real money. sayonara. (upbeat music) we are about 13 button presses in, and so far so many crazy
things have happened. tags is currently kicking a field goal, nolan is giving away money. chris and karl are in corners, chandler's playing
video games, it's crazy. i can't wait to see who wins
$100,000 for their sister. - i'm not leaving this corner until i pee. (upbeat music) - you want $1,000? - yeah.

(explosion thudding) - beat minecraft. (laughs) karl now has to beat minecraft on a brand new world. - for a better chance at winning $100,000 for my sister right now. - jimmy, i'm done. (upbeat music) - oh. - oh, come on, why has that gotta be mine? come on. - press it again. - you brought it back. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) - let carl draw whatever
he wants on your face. i need a moisturizer and i need a marker, and a karl. before karl draws on your face
moisturize your right arm. oh karl. - hey bud, how you doing? (both screaming) - karl gets to draw whatever
he wants on your face, i'm gonna go check on
tags, i'll be right back. - since jimmy isn't
here if i don't like it, i can just not do it. - ooh, let's go. - [mrbeast] get a one hour massage. all right, here. - and they said they were punishments. - all right, this might
seem like a good thing, but technically for the next hour you can't press the button. - 100 grand, massage. sorry mom. (group laughing) - after three more presses
chandler can start playing again. - i got you buddy. - two more. - facetime your 69th
contact in your phone. (mellow music) karl buddy.
- hello? - how's it going? - it's good, i just got old iron. - so how long till you win? - realistically an hour,
i'm gonna be honest. - you still have two more
presses until you can play again. tags is getting a massage,
nolan is giving away money, karl's beating minecraft, and
you're just chilling here. time lapse. (upbeat music) - [chris] all right, how
many do you have left? - two. - make it one. - skip a punishment. - hey. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) - dump a bucket of baked
beans on your head. - i'm gonna go ahead and skip that one. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) - stop, no, just stop it. (bell dinging)
(explosion booming) - no. - chandler's going to get arby's, but you have to pick
some of your crickets. - you know what goes really good with a nice game of minecraft? a little snack. oh, karl. - oh, hey man. - you got the gamer hungrys? - not really. - [chris] you want a gamer snacky? - i don't. - didn't you throw a
water bottle allegedly? - allegedly, it didn't happen. (upbeat music) - i'm curious, are you eating
the crickets one at a time, or you are just four and done? he's four and done. - it's the texture, it's the texture. oh my god. - all right, let's move on. - we're at arby's, this food is gross. can i get a kid's meal? - [narrator] 4,27. - thank you. - [narrator] bruh. - wear a princess helmet. - for the duration of the video you now have to wear a princess helmet. - let's go.

i've ever had in my life. (balloon pops) - [crew member] there it is. - i did it. - [mrbeast] so you beat minecraft? - yes. - congrats, let's go. pick someone and stay handcuffed to them for the rest of the game. (bell dinging) - ooh. (explosion booming) - unlock the correct lock. - have fun with that. - while you're thinking i'm
gonna go get locks for chris. this is a wall of locks, and chris here is the key. find which one it works for, and you can push the button again. - it looks like one of these so i'm gonna try all of these first. - here is a pair of real handcuffs, once you handcuff them, they can't come off until
the end of the challenge. - what if i have to pee? - pee together. (bell dinging) jump in a swimming pool fully closed. there's no swimming pool here, go find one. not joking we're getting
close to the $100,000 press. - [tags] could i please get two whoppers? - [narrator] we don't have whoppers. - first we gotta find out... okay, so it's probably one of those. all right, let's just speed run it. - build this six year
old minecraft lego set. - no. - have fun. we were recording this
video for a very long time, and there's a ton of punishments
that i just can't show. or, this video would be an hour long. - [karl] oh, button. - okay, wait, before you press it, what do you wanna say to
chandler's sister right there? 'cause you might steal 100 grand from her. - i wanna steal 100 grand from you. - well, you didn't. open this present. here is a giant present i
spent all morning wrapping. open it up. (wrapper rustling) - no. - (sighs) i can't, i
literally cannot actually. (upbeat music) - i love how the guy who is
handcuffed has to do this so it's even harder. - it hurts so bad.
- it hurts. what is this? - carl is not allowed to push
the button for five turns. oh, can i use my button on that? - yeah, you could actually. - oh, you're surrounded. (explosion booming) - [mrbeast] all right, he
skipped that punishment. start a fire and put it out
with a fire extinguisher. go have fun. i love how the box is attached to them. (box thudding) (ping pong ball thudding) - yes! - that was his, what did you get? give jimmy $4 and 20 cents in pennies. - that seems simple enough. - go find it. - hey, you, anybody got pennies? chandler, you got some pennies? do you have some pennies? - no. - you got pennies? you got no pennies? - [voiceover] ooh. - fire?
- fire. - fire! (extinguisher wheezing) (upbeat music) (bell dinging) - ten. (both screaming) - nobody had pennies, so we're having to go to
the gas station to get some. - give it a press. maybe you wait, do you think this is it? you won a... just kidding. - you guys got one of the hardest ones, you have to paint this
entire side wall right here. - come with me. - oh my gosh, it's kind of working. - [karl] the pee, the pee. - it got all over me. - you're gonna sit out
the next two presses. - yeah. (bell dinging) - [mrbeast] chris, that's the 50th press. build a gingerbread house. - (claps) yes. - [nolan] is there any way i could get change in pennies for this? you don't have enough? all right. (upbeat music) - ladder please. no one come hit the button. - here's a gingerbread
house, here's some icing, here's some duct tape, you
have to put it together. - right. - so somebody back at the
studio apparently had pennies, i didn't ask enough people i guess. (upbeat music) - the word on the street is
tags literally fell asleep. his 15 minutes ended 10 minutes ago, but he's still laying in bed. (mrbeast yelling) hey, you're 15 minutes is up. - [nolan] where's some pennies? - [ethan] i stepped in your pee. (all laughing) - stop worrying about pee ethan. - we're at 51, how many can there be? (bell dinging) - jump rope for 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes? - why do you get all the physical ones? (upbeat music) - all right, i'm gonna
hit it, i'm gonna hit it. do it, do it, do it. - so you are gonna press it? (bell dinging)
all right, what is it? solve a difficult math problem.
- we got this, we got this. - we? - here is a maths problem chandler, when you solve it you get
to press the button again. (upbeat music) - i got the pennies. - did you go to a bank? - no. - all right, so $1, $2, $3, three and a half dollars. this is only $3 and 65 cents. - [nolan] where did the other ones go? it said it said $4 and 20 cents, this is actually the answer
to the math equation. that actually looks good,
the wall is complete, i am actually surprised. i thought they were just gonna quit. we are on press number 53. - you were here first. - all right, who's pressing it?
- he was here first. - oh no. - it's between you and me again.
