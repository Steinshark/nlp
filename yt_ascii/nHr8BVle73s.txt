hey guys what's going on welcome back really exciting day here i have finally remodeled the office and studio drawing a lot of inspiration from content creators that i like i really hope you like it because i'm going to be shooting all of my videos in here right now i think it's oh sorry i think someone's at the door like i was saying this office took a lot of attention i'm really proud of the results i got here i think it looks as good as i can oh hey man how's it going what are you doing here [music] all right so fun day fun day i feel like i've been following your channel for a long time it's a big inspiration for mine and we're finally actually getting to sit down so i came back to toronto to visit family amazing here we are i'm guessing that if you watch this channel odds are pretty high that you already know who mark is but just in case mark who are you i am a documentary filmmaker from canada as well just on the other side of the very large country that we live in and yeah i also talk about filmmaking on my youtube channel and run a really cool filmmaking academy called art of documentary yeah grade plug art of documentary is fantastic i took it as a student even though i have like 10 years of experience so well worth it for anyone who's trying to get in so we're going to talk today a little bit about basic first steps like how how do you break into this industry i know a lot of the time this idea of becoming a professional filmmaker can feel like this big nebulous goal you know it can be really hard to figure out where to actually start so i wanted to go over some actionable steps that people can take if they have very little or even no experience but first off i think you and i arrived at very similar places but we started in different with different starting points how did you find your way into documentaries the real quick story is i after high school i loved kind of everything in high school i was one of those weird people i you know did all the subjects enjoyed all of them so i didn't know what to do so i thought well i've been figuring out i'll try to go help people maybe so i went and did humanitarian work over in africa and when i was there during the sudan war i my job was with some doctors is i didn't have any medical training so my job was just to listen to the people fleeing the war listen to their stories while they waited to get medical treatment because talking was just helpful for them and hearing their stories i was like these these stories are incredible they need to be told and i kind of came back to canada with all this rumbling around my head and it was actually my dad who was like hey maybe you want to get into documentary filmmaking you really seem to like cameras and want to tell stories like this wow that's wild i mean i think they feel like i've seen most of your videos have you ever told that before i don't think i have i i feel like every podcast month's the first question but no i mean i would hope people would be able to draw some of that from the films i make they're always from people in different lived experiences than of my own and different cultural in different cultural contexts in different countries but yeah no i guess i don't share that much of my my youtube channel i just probably assume people know but it's good to know that they don't yeah i mean i think that's pretty similar it sounds like it's similar to me in the sense that maybe neither of us had this clear calling like i must be a documentary filmmaker it was more a you know for me i was i wanted to experience and learn about the world and then i realized that one of the best ways to do that was by having the excuse of a camera yeah you know to there was a reason why i was talking to these people there's a reason why i was there and the communication was born out of a desire to experience yeah so he wasn't like you didn't wake up at six years old and say like i must be a documentary filmmaker no i think i woke up one day and was wearing all black and had a black hat with a white logo and i was like okay i think i'm a filmmaker no that's my try i i think the only indications for me that filmmaking might be something i was interested in were were that i loved comtec in school like when we did the that's communications technology it's like our film class i just did all the work my friends my friends showed up and i would shoot i would edit it i'll come to school early and i just i just i don't know i couldn't help myself but i always thought in high school i was like i love this so much this is so much fun i was like it i felt it felt wrong that i couldn't do that for a career which is weird i felt like my career needed to be like work needed to be work you needed to feel like i earned it and i was like in my mind i kind of just denied myself of the opportunity to do that as a career because i was like i enjoy this too much it probably isn't work it feels like play right and then also too we had this really terrible webcam on my computer it was like the first time we had a camera attached to the computer it blew my mind there was a usb cable i was like the camera is going into the computer it's like it just blew my mind and i it had stop animation so i got all my action figures out and i make movies over the weekends and like eight hours would go by my mom's like you should probably eat some food so there was probably some indications earlier on but i don't know if you really enjoy filmmaking and you're watching this it can totally be a career for you there's no reason it can't i think actually we had pretty similar experiences and we're almost the same age as well so it was communications class in high school where i was also the one i haven't thought about that in a while that's interesting my very first film made in grade 12 jeff mcquinn porn addict was it a fake documentary fake documentary about a friend who ruined his life oh my gosh oh my gosh my i can't even say the title of my film is a horror film and now it's like it's just a terrible title but it was like a guy jumped out of lockers and like stabbed people and like i've only made one horror film it was my first film and i'll never make it again all right so ontario's public education really promotes some disturbing films really got us both started yeah but nuts and bolts wise you know how did you actually make it happen like where did you like at some point you made something and said now i'm gonna start trying like what was that well yeah well i did go to film school after after again i have to give credit from my dad who really kind of called that career out of my life or called it fourth rather but i once i graduated film school my career was up and down you know my first job out of film school was actually teaching the queen of england 3d i did a demonstration when she came to canada yeah and then and then i worked in 3d and then 3d kind of died and then i had this year where i thought maybe i need to quit filmmaking because i had no work i remember showing up to my brother's job he's an engineer and i was looking at the receptionist going oh like that seems like a great job she knows when she's going to get paid like i was like just was had such strong doubt about my career at that point but what was great about that is i was like since i was making no money i kind of wouldn't take any job but my friend asked me if i wanted to come down to haiti with him where he was a humanitarian and film what they were doing so i you know they were going to pay my way and pay my food i was like that sounds great you know i'll take that and so i went down there and shot a little mini documentary about it and it was like that was kind of a turning point for me is i was very proud of the project i made and then another aid organization saw that and they called me to come shoot and then i you know was like okay you never want to take a side step in your career i don't want to do the same thing so i got a better camera and i decided to write a script like vigil and i shot more interesting sequences and tried to add like a bit of a plot to their video and so then i that i put on my reel my website and just emailed everyone i knew it and that led to another opportunity and then you know we could spend all day talking about how a led to be deceited right but it really started getting out there and shooting something and and actually putting it online you know one one really great thing i got out of film school was our one teacher said you're not a filmmaker until you make a film and i feel like i was waiting in my career for people to give me that opportunity and in a way it kind of did when my friend asked me to but he didn't ask me to make a documentary film he just wanted footage but i decided no i'm gonna make a film out of this i mean i think he said a couple things there the one well two of them but the one i want to start with is is this idea of of constant improvement yeah you made the thing but when you went out to make the second one you didn't just you looked you analyzed what you've done and you actively made it better now what i think is more important is what you said about actually finishing films yeah filmmakers finish films and the easiest thing and the most common thing in the world is a is to find someone who's got a great idea for a documentary maybe even people who've gone out and shot a little bit but the difference between that and actually having a finished product no matter how good it is how flawed it is is kind of everything yep do you agree like do you think you need to finish these films and share them right i do you do i mean that's just to read yeah you have to finish films in order to become a filmmaker and also too you need to get over that hurdle of a minor artist what do people think of my work because if that is what stops you from creating a film that that will always be present in your career the doubt of what an audience will think of your film or the self-doubt if you can complete it so this doubt is a bit of like a muscle and in in the way that or rather i think self belief is a muscle and the more you use that the smaller doubt gets and so it's been different stages in my career you know i made that haiti film and i was like okay i can actually complete a documentary film but then it wasn't until i made rascate in 2017 where i was like oh i can make a film that completely encapsulates my aesthetic vision and i was like that was cool to go i've been working commercials for a while and was always doing what a client wanted but then to go out and shoot my own film in my own style and choose my own music and have no no one else's opinion i was nervous about that because i was like maybe i need other people's opinions which it's good to collaborate but when i made a film that i would say was with my voice and put that out there and then get the response back from people that was also like again self-belief it was another stage there so i think filmmaking is just a series of of little steps like anything and you know if they say if you can ignore the destination and enjoy walking you'll get further and so you never will reach you're never actually gonna get to quote you've made it i'll never be perfect you know because whenever you get to that next stage you're going to crave something more yeah that finish line keeps shifting yeah i just finished my first feature film this year and i thought you know you would i would have thought 10 years ago that i would just be like oh yeah but i'm like no i'm hungry for more and now i want to do it in a different style and i want a deeper challenge with my films and i want to tell other so it's like you can't ever expect that you'll be completely satisfied with your career and that's not that the actual act of making films is unsatisfying it's that if you're you're always going to desire more that's kind of part of what what makes you an artist yeah it's hedonistic adaptation you know it's whether or not it's if i can only get this job for this client then suddenly like when i first started photography i've told this story before i for a couple of years i struggled and i all i wanted to do is work for the new york times and i thought if i can just be a new yeah i got my first assignment it was disaster i was so stressed out i didn't enjoy it at all and i realized that you know that wasn't the answer at all my all my problems in the same way that i don't know getting an fx9 is not suddenly going to solve the problem and i think it certainly hasn't finished but the thing that will move the needle forward is finishing films though right like yes you can tell me if you agree but i think having 75 of a finished film is almost the same as having nothing absolutely you know it's not you don't have 75 of it you do not have anything yeah exactly you're not a filmmaker until you've exported a film and sent it publicly that's why for art of documentary we're we're creating a new stipulation to come out of our module one you need to actually post a film online with no password like it needs to be publicly viewed because that is part of filmmaking it's like an artist can paint all these pictures and if they keep them in their basement yes they're an artist but the art is meant to be enjoyed what you create is meant to be part of the human experience it was meant to be part of culture it's meant to influence what people think or or inspire what they think so if you never share that if you never export your timeline and put it out there you're not contributing to to the the you know the scene but you're also you're not embracing your calling as a filmmaker and our calling is to make films and so part of making a film is hitting export and in this case uploading back in the day it was getting it on some celluloid and putting the share it yeah put it share it exactly and that and then maybe if you're like i don't want to put it on line out but get a bunch of people in the room because if you never it's always going to look either amazing to yourself when you're by yourself or look terrible and you just need other people in the room to feel that audience because that's it's about having other eyes can consume the film you make i mean i think that's that's amazing advice i know when i just did the mentorship program thing a lot of people were nervous about sharing the links to their that's where the growth comes right that's the good stuff yeah it sucks and but you just got to put it out there you gotta go make some bad films yeah we do you don't make great films until you've made a bunch of bad films yeah and unfortunately what we do as creatives especially with social media is we see just the highlights or we just see these rare people that just their first film was so successful and was the thing but usually what you haven't seen is them spending years inside their mind or writing bad scripts or or or or working on their computer by themselves but it's it's part of the process is actually making a bunch of bad films and that's why i love we do this one day doc contest in order documentary and we make it you have to go shoot it in one day and you have three weeks to edit it but we force people to do that because it gets them finishing the film and that act that muscle of like like getting in the game and going all four quarters if it was basketball you know like finishing the actual activity that that's a muscle you build up and then the next time you go make a film it'll be easier yeah and i i mean i think you're you're spot on i think even if you spend all the time in the world perfecting the one you make now in a couple of years you're gonna hate it anyways yeah just just like get it over with just get it over with just make the thing yeah finish it so if we've established that then for a lot of people especially when you're first starting out it seems like how do you how do you even go about starting to make a documentary you see you know cartel land or you know one of these big ambitious projects and you think well how can i possibly do that and in my opinion one of the mistakes people make is they think too big they think yeah i'm not if i'm not flying to kenya then i'm not making a real story we have we have a film crew in kenya right now that's the only way yeah we have a bunch of them yeah i know we have some aod filmmakers there making film for that we're all working on but you're right i think i think to build to break down what a film is or to help people if you're like oh what am i trying to make here with the documentary because there's four kind of four steps find your topic that you want to do but i'll say this topic is not a story so once you've established your topic you know like i'll i'll use an example of the film we're doing we're talking about elite runners like let's say you like endurance athletes from you know a real rural africa so like ethiopia kenya so that's the topic that's not a story it's not at all that we the topic is not a story the topic is just a general space and place and time it's a theme maybe not even a theme so once you have your topic then you got to find your character who is going to take us through that topic who is going to emulate what's happening in that cultural context so once you establish your character in the case of this our filming of bengoria he's michael who runs aod with me they created a foundation years ago and they sponsored his trip over to north america and now he's the top ncaa runner this is his first time going back home in nearly a decade so that's this film is him returning home after becoming cool and one of the most successful runners in the world anyways topic character then you got to find out their desire because desire without that if you if you don't know what the person wants then you don't actually have a character in your film there's no it's hard to make a resolution right it's hard to make a resolution it's hard to have the film go anywhere because think about it desire if i desire food i'm going to walk to the fridge now we can make about a film about me walking to the fridge yeah there's a there is an outcome but if i sat here and had no desires there's no story i'm just sitting here yeah and i could just talk about whatever but it's not a story so you have to have a character who wants something sorry i'll just jump in they don't they don't have to get what they want no no no no no exactly then you show the journey yeah and then what i always say is at the end so you have topic character desire journey and then the last thing is resolution or lack thereof yeah so you i say you celebrate the success or you explore the failure yeah and both are fascinating yeah do they or don't they get what they want either one is a resolution but without that desire and obviously maybe if people are gonna go in the there's probably exceptions to this but these are principles vast majority of compelling documentary stories and really any story in any medium is is using this structure right absolutely i think what's what i the biggest mistake i've seen a lot of people's films is that someone's sitting there talking about something that's happened we don't get to go on the journey yeah or if you're gonna have someone talk about a past event do something that's inspiring on camera that like reenact it or create some beautiful visual sequences that emulate what they're saying because then we we need to go on a journey we need to feel like we traveled somewhere that's like when i made my film for cnn and discovery called 58 hours we were retelling an event from 35 years ago so we like you know it was about a girl being trapped in a well so like kim who's on my team and she like she found a pipe in some welding shop and we sent a probe camera down in and we reenacted all this stuff because we didn't want to just shoot journalists talking about this event that happened we wanted the audience to feel like they were there reliving it it sounds like i mean it sounds like you're saying there's a lot of ways to portray this journey and you don't have to like limit your creativity you'd still need the journey and that's where you as a filmmaker get to decide how you show that journey and there's there's a there's a million different ways you can go about that okay so let's talk about even the logistics of it you know i think for me me personally one of the best places to start and a lot of advice that i give out regularly is don't try and plan some massive story that you need to drive for 10 hours away or you can get on a plane yes especially when you're starting out you need to pick you need to think way smaller you need to pick topics that are crazy easily accessible great advice i think you need to pick topics that are easily reachable by car so you can work on them in your free time totally and if it were me i would look at friends family community learn how to tell a story about someone who may not be the biggest celebrity in the world but if you can't tell a story about your aunt judy yeah you also can't tell a story about lebron james the principles are are the same so you know do you what do you think no i agree we say this in aod we say go tell a backyard story what we mean by that is what is in your town what is nearby and and that actually often you think a very good painting has a border and then you paint within that you might find that telling a story within my town is restricting no it actually just gives you parameters now you get to make whatever you want within that space in that place but i fully agree that's some of the best advice on this is if you want to get into documentary filmmaking not only do you have to finish a film but go do something accessible the more hurdles you put in the way they say this with training for people with gym people will i forget what the percentages it is but anyway you know 75 of statistics are made up so i'll just say 80 of people are more successful at their weight loss goals when their gym is within 10 minutes or less of their of their house like if they don't if they can drive with it walk within 10 minutes or drive in like five it's if you put a hurdle if your gym is 30 minutes away you're less likely to actually achieve your goal and so i would say for your documentary just like luke was saying it's really great advice is find a local story that has access and then also too we'll add something to that find a character who wants to tell their story a lot of people in our art of documentary course or always like asking us how do they convince someone and i think as soon as i hear that word convince it's like i get nervous i go you know like you need to put the vision of your film in front of them and if they don't believe the vision then i just say walk away you know you never want to be twisting someone's arm to be a part of your film because then they're never truly going to be themselves yeah no bill goes to you when it matters the most yeah it's no i that's really great advice because i often you think you need to find someone but if they become people you're filming become collaborators almost you know you can't yeah you're like they're like a co-director totally they have a say in how this story is told they're usually intelligent enough to understand how you're portraying them as well so you almost make it together so if you are you know putting pressure on someone to be in your dock and they don't want to be in it especially if you're starting out maybe if you've got decades of experience maybe you can make that work but i think you are starting off on the wrong foot if you're trying to film with people who don't want to be part of it yeah no i agree your exam it's another hurdle and then you're going to be putting your energy into trying to getting them onto camera when your energy should be putting into telling the best story once they're on camera yeah yeah and i made a lot of these mistakes as well when i was starting out like i would you know i was just as guilty of trying to plan these huge projects i think if my if i'm not making the biggest most incredible story ever but then i had all these half finished things that never said yeah you're not ready for it right it's like if you want to go run a marathon you start by running one kilometer yeah and then the next day you run to and then you scale back to 1.5 and then you run three and you know you build up to 42 kilometers it's so but problem is filmmakers put this timeline that i need to be this amazing person tomorrow and it's like yeah but you need it takes steps to get there and so that's why i'm saying go make like go make four or five really crappy films this year because then next year you're gonna make four or five better films and then you'll make four or five good films and then or maybe even just one or two and four or five is a lot actually it's been quite ambitious make make one or two and then eventually you'll get to the great films and you have to once you make a film you have to take inventory i say you have to go back look at it and actually literally for me the key point in my career was when i was editing my films and when i would after i put a film out i'll go watch it like two or three months later because then i would like the excitement of it being released would wear off and i could look at it more serious i had a sticky note on my computer where i would just write down all the mistakes i made when shooting and then all the mistakes i felt or the areas of improvement on my films and then before every shoot i would come back to that and it became went from a sticky note to like a journal entry into a full like three pages to book now yeah and i know it's a book now called mark's failures no but it's i've gone back to that often and now now i don't even read it then now it's just in my mind it's like now i know when i go shoot a a scene it's like i used to like remember there was a scene in this one film in haiti the guy's like sawing like a piece of wood and i just got this macro on that and then got a wide they never got his face so like to edit that sequence it was just like a pair of hands and then this really big wide shot like who's that who's the person doing this so it's like you learn these little things and you have to take inventory of them i think that's a really good thing to do have you ever heard of the the mathematician richard feynman have you ever heard of this guy has he been on lex friedman before i think he's dead he was one of the guys who made the atomic bomb anyways i talked about him all the time because he had this he's one of the smartest guys in the world but he had this he thought that if you wanted to really understand something you needed to be able to explain it to a five-year-old and so one of my favorite exercises when i'm trying to make sense of something is right down like you're saying write down how you how you messed up in a way that's so clear and then just defining it is going to help you not make those mistakes again i guess i feel like that's really great advice and that's encouraging because i i feel like when i start like we just wrote a book about editing and we were doing an editing course which i don't know when this video is coming out but it was it was our editor's intensive and i was like thinking about the craft of editing and i was like how do i break this down and then i thought about i was like oh editing is just three things like you can talk all day about editing but there's just all editing is doing is adding something to a timeline removing something from a timeline and rearranging like literally every act in people would be like well what about sign is this what about sound design you're like well you're adding i'm heading to it and they're like well what about color correction i'm like well actually most of the time you're taking away you know you're adding more contrast you're crushing the blacks you're you're or you're adding to the whites like you're you're you're just adding or subtracting then it's like well what about if like you know i need to there's there's something this person's saying the wrong thing it's like well sometimes you might take the word the and just put it at the beginning of what they're saying and now they're actually using a real sentence so i'm now when i'm editing and i'm coming up against a mistake i think do i need to add subtract or rearrange here and it's like i feel like i could tell that to a five-year-old yeah simplify it down and then make sure you actually understand it whether that's you know if you if you're coming up with an idea for your first project can you explain what your story is about to a five-year-old because if you can yeah you probably don't have a story well we do okay i feel like i'm always plugging aod but they always be plugging yeah but we always do we do 60 second pitch sessions sometimes on our monthly calls with our community and it's like if you can't explain your idea in two to three sentences you don't know your idea you don't you don't know that you don't know your idea you don't know yourself you're like well i think it's this guy in africa he's it's like no no you got it who's the character what do they want and what are we gonna see yeah whenever i do consultation calls i'll pretty much always say the same thing like if you can't tell me what your story is like who it's about and what the journey we're gonna see is so two sentences then you don't really understand ideally one you don't you don't i mean but that's the beauty is when you simplify an idea you then never get lost because you can always come back to that simple idea at the core but that was so fun is when you have that like it's like a compass you have your true north now now you get to build the  no it's getting there now you get to add all the crazy stuff you can add your music you can think about transitions and all this but what i think the mistake a lot of filmmakers do is they get nervous that people won't find their film interesting so they stress on what it looks like rather than what it's about what it's about yeah whereas you can look at lots of documentaries that have had like i wouldn't say tiger king was like a beautiful piece of cinematography no but it was interesting it was one of the most watched documentaries of all time and probably we're not gonna no we're not these kind of filmmakers you guys are probably not making tiger king-esque documentaries but maybe you don't have to you know you don't have to be so obsessed with the technical and the spectacle of it all like it all comes back down to that one or two sentence idea absolutely absolutely so if you were just starting out again now and you had you know i mean you understand cameras yeah what would be your sort of your sort of road map for your first year first year in filmmaking yeah you've got this idea i want to be documentary filmmaking seems appealing maybe they're you know thinking about taking aod or they're just watching first thing they do is yeah you do no there's no hope see my affiliate links in the description yeah yeah help luke pay is red yeah i feel like if it were me just starting out again what i would tell in the advice i always give is go and shoot three sub five minute films yeah so short very short everything manageable that you can drive to and that are out people you know and have access to do those three things is and then everything can be built off that but that for me is the minimum starting point and based off of those three films you get your first reel yeah you have things to show people you can try and maybe fail to pitch or succeed but that's really the building blocks of everything for me go shoot three two minute films finish them and publish them that's what i do first yeah i think if i was just starting off i would buy a camera and i wouldn't be too concerned about that but that was i i didn't own a camera until like two or three years after film school and i wish i would have bought it earlier i would probably put money into learning like i would hire like a director and i would dp like i would i would i would get someone around me that knows a bit more just like a little bit more remember mentor like i think about like how i just hoped i would stumble across knowledge but it wasn't until i actually started working as a camera operator on sets with really much better directors that i began learning so much yeah yeah that's how you do it so i think you know sometimes just being the presence of people who who've done that work it helps more but i i mean i would just also reiterate what you said was just such great advice it's like go find something let's think i always like making things really quick go find something in a five minute drive from you make it shoot shoot a five minute documentary and try to have it done within five weeks yeah the 555 that's how you can take that the the triple five is that already a thing no i just made that up there we go yeah there you go the triple five approach is like yeah five minute drive fight i mean even if it's a 10 minute drive that's fine but don't go past ten minutes don't you dare no it's true like honestly like the guy who is making your morning coffee probably has a story in there somewhere like everybody has everybody wants something everybody wants everyone and that's what a film is is exploring someone's wants their desires and so you have to find that yeah and if it's not obvious keep digging and then if it's still not obvious they may not know yet in their life and that might be an interesting story but that's a longer story you want to find someone who very clear their desires but i would say don't just stop like if you're gonna find that person who wants to finish their first triathlon that's what they want to do but then find out why they want to do it and that's we're getting this is like a documentary master class right now that's what we're going to call it this is probably the longest youtube video that you've ever done too this probably is except for way back at the beginning of my channel when i just let the camera record for 46 minutes while i packed that it has that video done well yeah surprisingly i know it would and it's very therapeutic it's like i think there's videos that have millions of views and it's just people like cleaning their house yeah no i think that's on twitch yeah no i actually i just one thing we'll wrap it up here in a sec but i think you're i think what you said about owning a camera i i will second that and i know it can be a bit contentious especially for people who come from the narrative or commercial spaces where they say never buy just always rent pro pro cinematographers just rent the camera on the day but in documentary things are a little bit different yeah and i think having a camera is so important any camera and that's not having access to a camera is what we say yeah you need something to use and learn on because if you need to go and rent a camera every time you're just adding more of those friction point so totally you don't need an fx3 you don't need whatever you you need a camera a camera i mean just get like put it i don't use cases so i put it on a napkin let's get your iphone out go shoot on an iphone smiled anxiety yeah just in the no case yeah there's your scratches all over it see what i do people spend like 100 on a cape maybe they don't maybe but i just like replace the screen every each year it's true and you get to appreciate and then i get to appreciate the objects well i think like look how beautiful it is like and then all the cases i buy i just think are so ugly and they all get dust on them i mean i tried to buy one of those today but they're sold out of the entire city of toronto all right so let's sorry i'm like i picked in my phone like emails the the cardinal mistake yeah never pick up your phone always always be plugging always yeah so yeah okay so you don't need to buy the most expensive camera you don't even you don't even need to buy an expensive camera i would say whatever one you can comfortably afford maybe a kit zoom lens a cheap one cheap prime lens maybe i say yeah i think it's good to get used to a zoom ones in your early days because then you can actually experience every different millimeter between like' and 55 you can you can begin to learn what does a 35 mil look like what does a 40 mil look like but if you're gonna have to own just two prime lenses 24 and 50 on a on full frame are great if you're up here on an apc or s35 sensor then perhaps a 35 mil and a 16 or just get a 16 to 35 at that point yeah and that that's a great focal range but for me most of my documentaries i just spend a lot of time on the 24 mil sigma art series 1.4 1.8 and then also my favorite lens the helios which is a 58 mil which is weird but it's this old soviet lens and it's it's my favorite it's not a lot of character oh it does it's beautiful and buy you stuff buy buy the old model used i have been doing this between photography like over 10 years i've never bought a new camera wow that's sorry that's not true the fx3 was new but my fx9 my fs7 my fs5 all all of my like pro cinema cameras have all been used what i do is this if you if you run a business we actually least to own our cameras because when you lease an item at least in canada you can write it off completely so all of our cameras we just pay them off over two years it's not really much more money but what's great is we can write off that expense on our taxes because it's a lease where if you own it becomes a depreciating item and and your accountant will tell you why that's not as good cool so let's wrap it up just in summary it was you know get get a get a camera find some easily accessible stories absolutely actually finish the films that's absolutely exactly and if you're mate poya you make finnish films because you're if you're from finland but if you're outside of the country finland go finish a film yeah you're not a filmmaker to you until you finish a film i can't get that out of my mind now i just see the word finish i get to see like like canned like like the saunas it's icy saunas and like canned fish and mountains great to connect what do you got going on right now what do you want to plug what do i want to plug when is this video coming out later in january later in january well in a month and a half from now we of course are reopening the doors for artist documentary we only twice a year do we open the doors for purchase so it's march that's march around the 13th i believe so you can get on our wait list at art of documentary.com but you know i think my tornado film would be out by the time this is out so that was a film i worked on last year and i can't wait to do the behind the scenes on that on my channel because that's a film where we're like are we done are we not like should we go shoot more it's like you know part of the art of part of the documentary experience is is is getting into the edit and and making some tough decisions of what you need to add and subtract from your film but yeah really i mean my favorite thing that we're doing right now is aod because now we're starting to help fund films for aod filmmakers people who joined art of documentary where we're getting into funding films and that's been so rewarding to get to see other people achieve success and and release their films and so yeah i'm really excited for this year ahead it's going to be a fun one cool awesome man thanks get out of my office yeah out of your office all right i gotta go it's cool bye luke bye [music]
