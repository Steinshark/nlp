this is mekkamon from reach robotics he's a four-legged little battle bot each leg has three degrees of freedom with the two servos in the hip and one in the knee and it means he's kind of nimble he can run around he can make some motions he can say hello to you i'll just connect him so everything is controlled through a phone app he can run around and the idea is if you've got two of these little guys they can battle with little ir transceivers in each side so we've got one in each major direction and what they'll do is they'll fire signals at each other and we'll know when we've hit or miss we're also working on augmented reality gaming so my particular particular area of expertise is computer vision augmented reality so that's kind of where i come in and the idea will be that we can put your mechamod in your living room have it interact with the space it can battle it can fight it can shoot and it can do that either with another mekomon or it can do it playing one of our virtual ai mechaman as well so he's got things like a i'd say he likes a bit of a dance let him finish dancing and then he can hopefully right himself it's a bit sloppy out here so he might struggle in this in this kind of terrain he's more of a living room liver we've got things to do with our battling so he'll he'll do kind of offensive lunges sometimes he's got a bit of an itch he has to scratch we have a range of things you can play around with you can change his body height so on some terrains you might want him a bit higher obviously higher is the more he's like to fall over so you might also want to lower him down to the stability you can change where the legs are so if he's on a narrow platform oh there we go he's on a narrow platform he can balance or if he's on a slope he can fall over we can increase how far out his stance is and obviously bring it in it's all highly controllable through the multiple servers we've got sitting within obviously you and your friend can get one they can battle but also you might want to play by yourself using augmented reality or you might want to teach him to move yourself one of the things we're quite keen on is that people can enjoy robotics as a whole it doesn't just have to be about the mechamod it's we want to inspire people and let them have fun so we've got an app called mechamotion where you can position the legs you can teach and move you can say all right i want this leg here i want this leg here you can build up a series of movements almost like stop animation and the mechanic will learn how to move between those hopefully coming up in the future is a visual programming kind of language based roughly around the idea of scratch so you'll be able to have kids programming the robot and having fun with the robot without necessarily having to know how to get stuck deep down in the code eventually we're also hoping to have an sdk that people can use to work with the robot more in a more fine-grained way as well i'm a computer vision engineer so i first heard of reach robotics who make the mechamon about four years ago when i was doing a postdoc in the bristol robotics lab which was just as they were starting out there in the startup incubator there and then it just so happened i'd worked for it as a postdoc for a couple years i moved into industry and then i just saw a job application for reach robotics and i thought i recognized that name and i thought i looked it up and it looked like a really interesting job building augmented reality around such a cool platform they really want to inspire people everyone there is really passionate about making robots and making cool things it's just a brilliant brilliant place can you show me the the app that you've been kind of working on so i should say this is a kind of development build that i've been testing on but i can show you part of it so what i'll do is if i disconnect the robot i can show you some of our ar functionality outdoors it's a little bit untested we're more of a living room state at the moment but what are you doing so what i'm doing now is building an idea of where the ground is using some of the cutting edge augmented reality techniques are available on mobile phones so there's a ar kit and ar core libraries from google and apple it's a bit too bright to see now it's asking me to explore the play space so i can kind of look around and i don't know if you can see on the light but it's building up an idea of what's around coming to the bar just to be able to see it better because of the great sunshine what i'm going to show you is our augmented reality app so at the moment i'm building up an idea of where the ground is just by showing it a little bit of the ground space it can map out what represents the ground and what represents say a wall or a chair or a table so i tell it yes you have found the ground and then it's asking me to you know have a look around find where whereabouts i can move the robot and you can see it's kind of building up a picture of what's movable ground and what what it can't work on throws out some scenery elements and now we can play the game this is something of a development build at the moment it's still a work in progress but the idea is i'm the silver robot we've got the gold robot there and i can fight the gold robot using my attacks if i was using a real robot then i would be able to take on the properties based on the kind of things that are mounted on my robot so we have these add-ons so we can put shields on and off and different numbers of shields will allow you to have different abilities in game and you can attach different weapons different rifles and these will again allow you to make different attacks within the game and so if you have maybe more weapons you can carry fewer shields because of the weight that sort of idea and it adds a bit more strategy to the game and means it as you as you kind of move on with the mechanic you can build it in the way that you're interested in so the other thing is it's entirely modular so we can take a leg off the robot we can fit it back on and it's it's a uniform connector so all the legs fit whichever side of the robot you're on so the aim with the ar is that if you own a robot but maybe your friends don't you can still play with your robot you don't have to be left just kind of running it around and you can get involved with for in this case you can have a battle but we're also looking at kind of more arcadey style games things like asteroids type games and it means that you've kind of got the scope to enjoy your robot and as we develop more games you'll be able to play more games with it with it as well and also the the mode you just saw was the entirely virtual mode so you'll be able to play augmented reality games in the mekomon universe without necessarily owning a mechamod and then there's another connector here which is a serial connector and that's going to little imu measurement system so i can basically correct the body attitude according to gravity and level the machine but was straight across the bottom and the screen was in landscape and we had the menu the a b and the joystick buttons
