hello everyone and welcome to yes yet another video talking about tires i know i can't seem to get away from it i'm always talking about tires they're super important they're super cool and aaa just posted a super cool study talking about 12 different all-season tires so that's what we're going to be discussing in this video and i know looking at this white board behind me it doesn't look very thrilling and in fact it does look pretty boring to look at but we're not going to spend too much time looking at that we're going to be looking at the actual test data the numbers from this test and what their results were so let me just set the scene first and then we'll start to get into the data so what did triple a test well they're looking at all season tires why all season tires well all season tires generally are the most common tires put onto vehicles because they're very versatile they can be used in quite a few different climates they're a pretty good compromise and so they took two different routes they went with a passenger car and a light truck which they wanted to test out all season tires on so the passenger car they chose was a 2017 toyota camry and the light truck was a 2017 ford f-150 the reason they chose a camera in a ford f-150 these are both among the very top-selling passenger cars and light trucks so it was very representative of what people drive and then between those they took the tire sizes of each so the most common tire size for each the toyota camry on 215 over 55 r17 and the f150 on 265 over 70 r17 okay so then they had to pick the all-season tires so they looked at all of the all-season tires out there if it was labeled as all season and it fit that size the most common size for the vehicle and then they broke those up into price categories so the top 35 percent most expensive were one category and then the bottom 35 percent the cheapest tires the bottom 35 percent cheapest tires are another category so then they randomly selected from those categories as long as the tire was sold from two major retailers that they were looking at and then they also made sure that they didn't have any duplicates within a category so it couldn't be three of the same brand obviously you know any one of these could probably fill all of these with an all-season offering and so they did each of those for each vehicle and so you have a group of three expensive tires for each car and you have a group of three lower priced tires for each vehicle now i looked at some of the prices they didn't actually list the prices for the individual tires in the study so i looked at some prices and gave kind of a range here for each of them for the toyota camry we're looking at the higher price tires being the goodyear eagle sports pirelli centurado michelin premier the lower price tires being the next end class premiere the fusion touring and kumo extra 4x2s and then on the f-150 we have bridgestone duelers goodyear wranglers michelin defenders for the higher priced tires and then for the lower price tires firestone destination cooper evolution and hand cook dynapro so those are the 12 tires which we're going to be looking at in this study and we're kind of looking at triple a's big question was you know does the amount you spend on a tire correlate with how well that tire performs and so that's what the test is about do expensive tires are they worth it are expensive tires worth the additional cost now the three areas that they are comparing are stopping distance lateral acceleration and then noise vibration and harshness so we're going to get into a discussion on each very briefly on nvh but definitely a good discussion on stopping distance and lateral g's and this is performed both on the new tires and then they actually wear them down and perform the same tests on warm tires now before we get into the study i do want to point out some things that might cause slight biases in this test i don't think there's any reason why we can't trust the numbers and the data in this test but i do want to point out things just so that you are aware of them the testing was performed at michelin's lawrence proving grounds so perhaps you could consider that a home field advantage considering that michelin is in this test the reason was performed there they have really consistent areas where they can do repeatable tests so it makes a lot of sense to do it there and it's also rented to third parties all the time so major auto manufacturers will rent out these facilities and use them when they're performing tests because they have you know exact road-like conditions that you find throughout the us all in one spot that you can perform repeatable tests at so that doesn't to me raise the biggest red flag but i think it's certainly at least worth knowing i think it's a smart location to choose just from a repeatability standpoint to minimize the number of variables that you have to deal with also i think what's kind of interesting are the tire prices so they say they were randomly selected with each but there's kind of a little bit of weird stuff going on here with these good years so the goodyears are about 120 based on what i was looking up which is actually closer in price range to these lower cost tires than it is with the pirelli and the michelin which are both in the 160s so to me this seems like it's more of a cheaper tire rather than the higher higher price tire as they have it categorized simply because you know it's closer in price to the next end than it is to the pirelli or the michelin and the same case goes with over here so the goodyear is 165. the michelin's 205 a difference of about 40 bucks versus you know these firestones are 140 so 25 cheaper than the goodyear so to me both of these goodyears kind of seem like a mid-range like they might have you know popped into this category rather than the most expensive but those are the ones that they randomly selected and so as a result i think just keep in mind that when we say expensive that more applies to the pirelli and the michelin here not quite as much to the goodyear but just something worth knowing as we go through the test results but i think the super important can we trust what we're about to see and i think absolutely yes for three reasons first of all they said that they validated their results at a separate facility this was not funded by any outside entities it was funded by aaa they performed the tests they did all the work they did all the analysis and the authors have declared the authors of this study have declared that they do not have any conflicts of interest with any of these tire companies which they are writing this study about so no reason why we shouldn't be able to trust the data in this let's get into the tests okay so the first test we're going to look into is stopping distance so this was performed on the 2017 toyota camry with both new tires and worn tires and so this is a wet stopping distance test from 60 miles per hour down to zero miles per hour on one millimeter of water so there's one millimeter of water on the road surface and then you're stopping from 60 miles per hour and measuring the distance and time that it takes to stop so here is one of the new sets of tires and then another set of tire is artificially worn down so they use a machine and wear it down to 4 30 seconds so that it is close to the wear bars and so there's two sets of tires one that's worn and one that is new and they compare the differences between how each of those sets of tires performs how well it breaks when it's worn versus how well it breaks when it is brand new okay so looking at the results for the toyota camry with new tires so we've got the higher priced tires up here on the top the goodyear pirelli and michelin and then the lower price tires down here on the bottom the next end fusion and kumo and so here you can see the actual braking distances and the time required to stop so looking at a graph of the stopping distances this is a little bit misleading so the graph is starting on the y-axis at'5 so the gap between this michelin premiere and fusion touring is not as extreme as it seems so it still is significant the fusion's stopping in less than 230 feet the michelin stopping in less than 195 feet so a decent gap but you know not like this is showing right here it's not like four times the distance but regardless you can see that one of the more expensive tires the goodyear eagle is actually performing worse even when it's brand new than two of the cheaper tires the nixon and the kumo so right off the bat we're seeing that you know cost may not necessarily be a primary consideration you know the price of a tire doesn't necessarily dictate how well does it perform though the pirelli and the michelin did do better than all three of the cheaper tires knew and so later on we will get into the worn results and be able to compare against these and how much these tires degrade as they are worn down so the overall trend here just initially with this toyota camry is that the higher priced tires are going to stop about 10 feet shorter than the lower priced tires but triple a found out that this is not statistically significant at a 95 confidence level so basically what that's just saying is price isn't showing an indication of whether or not a tire is going to perform well for new tires now it may for worn tires but for now all we know is new tires we do see a difference of 10 feet but not statistically significant so price alone is not going to be able to tell you whether or not you're going to have good stopping distance here we have the results for the 2017 ford f-150 so the higher price tires up on top the lower price tires down here on the bottom and here you can see a graph of the stopping distances so again you know this is a bit misleading the way they have this y-axis set up i wish it was a little bit more fair but what this is showing you is kind of the michelin is a bit of an outlier and the cooper is a bit of an outlier so the cooper not doing very well the michelin defender doing really well and then everything else kind of in this similar bucket here with that range of where they are stopping brand new now just looking at the averages again we're looking at about a 10 foot difference so the more expensive tires stopping about 10 feet sooner versus the cheaper tires but not statistically significant at a 95 confidence level and so really you know the only reason this difference really exists is because the michelin did really well and the cooper tire did really poorly aside from that you know these tires are priced more expensive than these tires over here and yet they're kind of in this similar bucket as far as how well they perform so the firestone doing better than two tires which are more expensive than it okay so here's where things really start to get interesting once they start testing these tires when they are worn down and because this is information that usually is not available to the public there's usually not test data out there where you can compare worn tires and see how well they do so really cool to get a look at this and cool that aaa did this study and we can look at some data on 12 tires out there so the first six here of course on the toyota camry and then looking at the graph of the individual tires okay so what are we looking at here well in red is a graph of the stopping distance with worn tires in green is the stopping distance with brand new tires and so what do you want to see well you want to see these bars as low as possible and you want to see the range between the bars from new to warren as small as possible so our worst example here being probably this pirelli where it actually does really well new but then it degrades quite a bit once it's worn so a 55 these percentages here are the increase in stopping distance new versus worn so 55 increase in stopping distance on the pirelli versus the the best case the michelin premiere only a decrease in 28 so it did the best at the start it did the best at the end and it had the shortest range of degradation amongst all of the tires the goodyear tire actually categorized as one of the more expensive tires and as you can see once it has worn down it does worse than absolutely everything i think the other interesting thing to see here is that if you look at this kumo you know it's starting here where it's not so great performance if you were to pay more for the pirelli you do get better new performance but then as that tire starts to wear the range at which this kumo remains is smaller and actually better than the pirelli so as you get towards the end of the life of the pirelli tire it's actually worse than the kumo even though it started as a worse tire over here you can see it started out pretty good but then gets really bad so it's pretty interesting to see that that changes quite a bit depending on which individual tire you're looking at and not necessarily based on price so the absolute cheapest tire here which did the worst new the fusion touring did not perform well at all new but it only wore down you know 37 versus some of these higher percentages like 46 or 55 percent where you know significantly worse in the percentage the decrease the the overall range of that tire you know you want to see something much more like this where it doesn't increase all that much and the stopping distances remain short so an overall average looking at new versus worn tires they saw an increase in stopping distance of 87 feet so this certainly was statistically significant at a 95 confidence interval essentially what this is just telling you is that in the wet worn tires are going to perform worse but it doesn't necessarily mean you know how much worse will yours perform because there's quite a wide range here from 28 worse all the way to 55 percent worse depending on which of these tires you start out with okay now looking at the results for the f-150 pretty interesting to see here so we've got the cheap tires on the right or the lower cost tires the higher priced tires here on the left and just looking at the overall range so the worst tire being the cooper evolution started off the worst ended the worst the best tire being the michelin defender started off the best ended the best one of the interesting things here you know the hankook did not start off very well but then it also didn't degrade very much and so that's another thing you know you kind of want to look at is you know off the bat this may look like a worse tire versus the bridgestone dueler but then you can see that as it wears down it actually becomes a better tire as far as wet stopping distances are concerned so price again not necessarily the determining factor of you know is this tire going to perform well when it is worn not necessarily going to be the case you want to look at individual data on each individual tire and see how it will do as it wears down okay so as far as the braking tests are concerned what have we learned well really that you know price isn't the determining factor it comes more down to the individual tires so we see some tires that start off really good and and not so good we see tires that start off really good and really well we see tires that start off poor and you know don't actually end quite as bad as some of the more expensive tires like here with the fusion versus the goodyear so the whole range of things can happen and price is not necessarily the determining factor of you know how well is a tire going to perform it's also interesting because you know you might make a purchasing decision based on a tire that is new because that is the test data that's available to you not knowing that that tire is not going to perform well as it degrades for example you know the pirelli and the michelin both cost about the same but as you can see one of them significantly worse at stopping once it's worn down versus the michelin so price isn't determining it you really want to have individual data available it would be great if there were more of these tests where we could look at you know all of the individual tires out there and see you know when you're buying your car okay when my tire is worn down how well is it going to perform versus when it is brand new okay so now let's get into the skid pad testing so we're looking at lateral acceleration and maximum speed so essentially what's happening is the core is going around a circle that circle is covered in a consistent 0.8 millimeters of water so it's driving around that circle going as fast as it can until it starts to lose grip and understeer as was the case with the toyota camry so they drive it as fast as they can and then they measure the lateral g that the car is able to hold without sliding out and so here up on top we have the more expensive tires and then we have the lower price tires down here on the bottom so looking at a graph of all of these where the higher priced on the left lower priced on the right in this case the higher you see these graphs the better so you want to see high lateral g's which is what this left axis is and then you want to see high average speeds which is what this right axis is so the little dot right here being the average speed and then the the green bars and the blue bars representing the average lateral acceleration so the higher the better for both of those as you can see kind of a three-way tie going on between the kumo the michelin and the pirelli tires all doing pretty well but surprising to see you know that kuma the lower price tire kind of matching these higher priced tires but then the fusion and the next end not quite there and the kumo actually doing significantly better than the goodyear eagle so this is with the new testing and if you're to compare them side by side you're looking at it you know if you're paying more for your tire on average with these three tires versus these three tires you're getting .02 gs of lateral acceleration and 0.9 miles per hour faster they are able to travel on that point eight millimeters of water around the skid pad now these differences were not found to be statistically significant at the 95 level so what is that saying well essentially based on price alone you can't say that one tire is going to have a better lateral grip now here we have the results for the ford f-150 and kind of going down to the graph higher priced on the left lower priced on the right and again as you can see all of them kind of in this similar bucket you know the michelin defender doing the best there the worst two being the goodyear wrangler and the cooper evolution and then this kind of three-way tie going on here but not a huge difference with price being a big determining factor in how much lateral grip do these have and so looking at them side by side a tiny difference the higher price tires got .01 gs better lateral grip and an overall increase in speed of 0.8 miles per hour not statistically significant and kind of coming down to some outliers here where the michelin kind of brought up the trend here for the higher priced and the cooper brought down the trend for the lower priced tires so getting into the interesting information the stuff that we usually don't get to see not often that there are worn tire tests done so here we're looking at the toyota camry results and here we have a graph so looking at this what we want again you want things to be as high as possible all of the bars to be as high as possible you don't want to see a big gap between here and here new versus worn so we want to see a small gap between them when they are new and worn and we want to see both bars as high as possible so remember initially we had kind of a three-way tie between the kumo the michelin and the pirelli so we can see that new all of them have about the same lateral grip but then as you wear them down to 4 30 seconds then the differences start to appear so the pirelli and the kumo lose about 40 percent in average lateral acceleration versus the michelin only losing about 27 percent there in lateral acceleration so you can see the red bar significantly higher than those other two even though they all start out the same so if you're just looking at new tire data you know all of these look identical and yet once you wear them down then you see a significant difference another interesting thing to look at with that is this next end tire so you can see you know it starts off worse than the pirelli so you think okay yep i spent more money i bought the pirelli and i'm doing better than you know this cheaper tire here this next end and yet as that tire wears down it doesn't lose as much grip 27 versus 40 and so as a result it actually performs better when it's you know starting to near those wear bars versus the pirelli versus the significantly more expensive tire so coming into it just looking at price doesn't tell you the whole story something may start off worse and actually end up better as you go through its life so you want to see that small difference here where these are only you know dropping about 27 percent the goodyear the michelin the next end not losing a ton of performance versus the pirelli versus the fusion versus the kumo where you're seeing as high as 40 degradation in lateral grip as that tire wears so a significant drop in performance so overall looking at an average of those numbers what does that tell us well worn tires are going to lose 0.7 g in lateral grip and they're going to lose about 10 miles per hour slower so on a worn tire you're going to have to travel around a corner about 10 miles per hour slower if you don't want to lose grip if you're you know putting it at the limit in wet conditions so it's pretty neat to have this data available and be able to see you know an actual difference between new and worn tires and see you know some have quite significant drops in performance that range being really big versus others having smaller ranges of how much performance they are losing as they wear okay now looking at the results for the ford f-150 and the different tires tested there so we've got the higher priced on the left the lower priced on the right again we want to see high bars for both green and red and small ranges between them and so we can see here you know there's a bit more consistent amongst the group there's not any that really stand out all that much the michelin defender doing the best so you know starting the best finishing the best and only losing 24 of its lateral grip versus the cooper which was doing the worst here so it actually started the worst it ended the worst and it lost the most percentage-wise so it has the biggest range at 32 percent now another interesting thing just that this hand cook here you know it starts off better than the goodyear and it actually finishes better than the goodyear so you know a different price bracket it's actually performing better than and it's not losing quite as much 29 there versus 28.4 percent so the range slightly smaller but it performing better throughout its life in wet lateral grip conditions now the overall trend for the ford f-150 we're looking at a drop in lateral grip of 0.15 g and about 8.4 miles per hour slower that you'll have to travel before losing grip and so this was statistically significant just telling you that you know there is a difference between new and worn and you will start to have to decrease the cornering speeds before you start to lose traction in the wet so just an overall summary with these skid pad tests i mean the difference here isn't necessarily based on price it's based on the individual tire so it's important to look at individual data based on which tire you're looking at purchasing and determining okay does it perform well new yes does it perform well worn you know maybe yes maybe not so are you comfortable with that range based on how much you're paying and does it make sense at the price point that you are paying for it now aaa also looked at nvh on each of these tires and i'm not going to get really into it i will include a link to this study so you can look at it if you're interested in the noise vibration and harshness data basically why i'm not going to get into it they said that none of their test drivers were able to subjectively discern the differences between the tires while they were doing their evaluations so essentially what that means is to the driver all of the tires sounded from a harshness standpoint from a vibration standpoint they all felt very similar and so because of that i'm not going to get into the data there are objective differences so there are certainly outliers in certain scenarios that do better and worse if you are curious about it you can certainly go in there and look at it but because the drivers weren't able to tell a big difference i'm not going to talk about it all that much essentially just what that means is from an nvh standpoint most tires regardless of the price are going to be somewhat within the same category and again there are outliers to that there are cases where it's not always true but if you would like to look more into that you certainly can i'll include a link to that in the video description okay so just a general summary overall what have we learned well we've learned that there's not necessarily a super strong correlation between how much you spend on a tire and how well that tire performs it comes down to the individual tire and looking at individual data for that tire rather than just saying because this tire is expensive it's going to perform well i think the other thing is that you know there's a wide range out there so some will do really well new and then not so great when they're worn some will do great new and worn some will do bad when they are worn and bad when they are new so there's a big range out there it's super helpful to just actually look at data for the tire that you're looking at purchasing before buying it and knowing going into that you know is it going to do well when it's new is it going to do well when it's worn so i think it is super cool that aaa has provided that information now i will admit i just made a video with michelin talking about the differences between new and worn tires and so part of me got a little nervous when i saw this study it was published and michelin was actually in it it was like okay have they actually done you know their homework can they bring it out in the test field and actually perform really well so it was cool to see that michelin actually did do really well and so my video was talking about from a design standpoint which i'll include a link to in the video description from a design standpoint how do you design a tire that performs well when it is worn and how do other manufacturers design tires that decrease in performance as they wear so it is a pretty cool video if you would like to check out that pretty neat to see the results from a third party actually back that up and then also i think what's worth knowing is that you know a small difference in grip can make a huge difference in performance and safety and so i have another video which is talking about if one car were to gain 10 percent more grip and one car were to gain double the horsepower which would be faster around a specific track and it's kind of like an oval track and really in that scenario they're about dead even so it's showing you that a small percentage in grip gives you an enormous amount of you know improvement as far as lap times are concerned the same amount as nearly doubling horsepower and so i've got a video explaining the math behind that if you're interested in checking it out what i what i want you to take away from that short overview there is that a small amount of grip goes quite a long way and so that's just kind of the key message not only for performance but also for safety so this is a super cool study very cool to see aaa doing this i hope to see more studies like this in the future which help give us you know more data to make our buying decisions with thank you all for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
