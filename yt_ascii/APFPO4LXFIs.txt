the last judgment is not just something that happens at the end but it is a perpetual reality it is basically an image of how reality functions and it's not arbitrary to think that that would be the case because it is an image of the end and you have to remember how the ancients thought of the end of something is not just the moment when the time runs out but it is the moment that shows you the reason for everything that came before [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] [music] world i'm very glad that you've all decided to join us for what i know is going to be a very special evening and i want to make a few introductory remarks about our speaker though i know he's already well known to many of you mr jonathan pou who has emerged as a truly powerful and prophetic voice in the last years speaking deeply to our cultures longing for meaning and coherence both at the individual level and at the level of our shared corporate existence he has been identified i think not playfully alongside of jordan peterson john bvi and bishop robert baron as one of the four horsemen of meaning and i know that many of you have benefited from his gifts as an interpreter a couple of years ago i had the privilege of sitting next to jonathan in a seminar on exodus with jordan peterson and other friends and that was an example for me of the kind of thing that jonathan does so very well this opening up of the texts and the images of the symbols of the structures of meaning and narrative of the past here in the present a few months ago our students had the pleasure of seeing jonathan in greece where our program begins and i had the great pleasure of going to metora that one of the oldest sites monastic sites in the orthodox world where jonathan gave a wonderful talk about how what monks do is they they look up and they show others the way of looking up jonathan pau is of course not a monk and i think it is true to say that his own life and witness has been dedicated to teaching others to look up though he's known broadly as a commentator his his mettier you might say his vocation is as a carver as an artist as a carver of icons in particular and these are found in churches around the world jonathan has spoken about how the icon works by compression that is to say it draws together different times elements and ways of thinking and understanding into a fundamental relationship such that all these can shine forth in this compressed form kind of unfolds i think something very similar to that is true of jonathan's work as a commentator that he draws diverse aspects of our world our culture our history everything from comic books to movie scenes to postmodernism through to the the images of the deep symbolic past into relationship with one another such that their meaning can shine forth for and in us this evening jonathan will bring his considerable interpretive talents to bear upon the topic of the med eval cosmos yet in speaking to us of the shape of the medieval world he is not only speaking of the past with his ic iconographic sensibility he will help us to locate our present in this time and place ralston college was founded you might say on a kind of double conviction if we're going to speak about directionality both of the need to look up and in the conviction that in order to look forward we need to look back by allowing our present moment to be illuminated by the past we are better able to understand who and what we are and what is the work we must undertake i can think of no better guide for us on this particular journey than mr pjo and i hope you will join me in giving him a warm welcome now [applause] so first off i obviously want to thank stephen thank ralston you know as someone who went to university in a very postmodern world i studied fine art and so that the the way of thinking was was very strong even in in the 90s this kind of very critical and cynical approach to art to the stories to the great stories that that that make us who we are you know encountering ralston and the type of work they do and also the level of students that we've met at ralson has been inspiring for us and gives me personally hope for the future but hope for my own children who are coming close to that age where they will also have to enter the world and the type of vision that ralson is able to give the students this love of these ancient stories but like stephen said in his introduction this is not about just analy izing the past in order to accumulate knowledge but it really is finding the light in the past but shining towards the future and so what i want to talk about tonight is a specific image in the beval world that is called the last judgment it is one of the most complicated images in the canon of iconography and i thought it would be interesting to look at that image especially in the wake of the students having just read dante's comedia and so of course dante goes down into hell ascends purgatory ascends the heavens all up into the prim mobile and into the presence of god and you know of course dti wasn't making up the things that he wrote he was synthesizing he was bringing together a cosmological vision that the ancients had that the medievals had in common you know that's why his poem was accepted so readily because he was able to just pull these things in together so beautifully and the icon of the last judgment does that also that is it is a kind of synthesis of christian imagery and it pulls everything together into one image this particular version of the last judgment is in a church near venice in on an island called torello it is a sixth century church but the mosaics were made in the 12th century and so they have this kind of high medieval byzantine venice approach some of the images in venice would have been in the same style as well some of the images that you find in sicily also for example would be similar in style and the thing about this image that i like particularly this one version of the last judgment is that it contains three images let's say stuck together so in the middle tier you'll see it on the left there is the image of the last judgment itself you can see is the crucifixion and then below the crucifix is an image called the anastasis or the descent into hades and these three images are kind of stacked on top of each other as we look at it i think there's a very particular reason why this is the case and those three together will help us understand what it is that this image this image of the last judgment what can it tell us today right is it just this very strange weird images of people getting devoured by worms and and everybody loves to look at the devils especially you know all these kind of strange figures of angels and demons and you know what is going on in this or does it have some thing to tell us and i do believe that it does i believe that the image of the last judgment is actually a way to understand how identity formation functions and i would even go a little further but looking at this image and kind of understanding this image can help us understand how thought functions that is how it is that we come to bring things together and how it is that they break apart right this problem of attention how it is that we're capable of having attention and how it is that our attention dissipates is contained in this in this structure and all the weird things about it once we understand that we can see how the last judgment is not just something that happens at the end but it is a perpetual reality it is basically an image of how reality functions and it's not arbitrary to think that that would be the case because it is an image of the end and you have to remember how the ancients thought of the end of something is not just the moment when the time runs out but it is the moment that shows you the reason for everything that came before right we still use that way of speaking today right what is our end that is what is the purpose what is the reason why we're doing things and so the ancients would have understood the last judgment as being a culmination right a kind of synthesis of all things towards their purpose you can say towards their purpose you could say towards their identity towards what it is that they are and how it is that we discern what things are sounds very abstract at the outset but you'll see that once we get into it it's not so difficult now one of the things to understand is that in church architecture in the middle ages the images were placed very deliberately there it was wasn't accidental the reason why we put certain images in certain places and in this case it's quite simple the church is a basilica it's a long church and in the what we would call the the east side of the church that when you enter into a church you look towards the end you see what's called the apps which is the place where the priest is you know and it has a little half dome on top of it and so in the apps is this image which is an image of the virgin with the child in her arms and then on the western wall which is the last part of the church is the last judgment so it's it's quite simple there's nothing subtle about it it's the beginning and the end it's the child and the fulfillment it's the rising and setting of the sun right there's this saying that the son of man will come like a like a lightning bolt from the east to the west and that's why churches are directed eastwards is that there is this movement i mean it's a cosmic movement m i mean everything moves from east to west the stars the sun the moon there's this there this motion that that that the ancients understood as defining the beginning and the end and so the way the church is structured is that you have this image of the beginning and that's the image from which revelation comes right the priest is there the eucharist is being celebrated there that's the source of identity and especially in this particular church which is a cathedral a cathedral means that it's the seat of the bishop it's the most important church in an area that is recognized as the cathedral which is the throne of the bishop the throne of the bishop is underneath below here and is down at the bottom there and that is the source of authority and it moves west towards the end so the whole church is structured in that that way which brings you up and down the the register now what's interesting about this image is that now the end is represented in three ways it's represented as the end of christ that is the end in the sense of the crucifixion right it's represented as the end in a different way which is what we call the heroing of hades where christ goes down into death and saves the people that are caught there and it's of course represented as the last judgment itself which is now the finality of all things and this is also a way to help understand how the medieval cosmos or how medieval people thought about the world they all fit into each other that is what's happening in one image is repeated in the other and what's happening in one image is contained in the other image it's like a little fractal bundle where things are just inserted into each other so that you get you get this this unfurling of reality in this way a little example to start with you'll start to get used to it as we moved into the image is that the crucifixion is of course christ dying on the cross his mother on his right side st john the evangelist on his left side and then underneath him there's this weird little image if you look at underneath his feet so that's a skull and it's the skull of adam so you can see the blood of jesus is coming down his feet and coming down his body and is dripping down onto the skull of adam so there's a whole legendary mechanism to understand why the skull of adam was there and everything that's not that important what's most important is to understand the the relationship that is happening there which is that christ on the cross is redeeming adam he is the new adam when we see the blood and water coming from his side it's often described as the new creation as the birth of the church as eve taken from the side of adam all of these analogies which are found in the lurgical text but what's going on down here right that is what this image is about and so the descent into hades is the secret of what's happening on the cross that's the way to understand it so we have the cross you have the crucifixion and then what's secretly happening on the cross is represented in the this image which is christ coming down into death and now the cross doesn't hold him he holds the cross as a standard you know almost like as a weapon as as this thing that he's conquered actually and he is going down into death and he is grabbing adam and eve that's who he's going to get so the two old people that you see are adam and eve and then there are different people represented in different ways the kings king david and king solomon and then st john the baptist who is pointing to him and who it was just there before and then would you see are the the dead right all these dead people in their tombs that are rising up right that they're coming into this moment where christ is bringing everybody out of death but that like i said is basically contained in this little image so the the anastasis is contained in the crucifixion okay we'll get back to these imag later but i just want you to start to think the way that the medievals thought and in a very similar manner the whole last judgment is contained in the other images as well the last judgment is a very complicated image but let me point you to a few things right at the outset that just for you to understand how all of this comes together is that right here right this is again adam and eve so adam and eve are now in the last judgment the skull of adam is in is at the crucifixion adam and eve are being taken out of death and now they're being brought to the final end the end of all things where everything is being revealed and the judgment is happening all through these is you have the same pattern where things enter into each other where things kind of fit into each other and there's this reflection in different ways of the images above and below and so as we moved forward i'm going to i'm going to show you a few of these but the first thing to understand is what is the last judgment what is going on in this image and so this is the first image that we know of of the last judgment this is a sixth century image from rena and so now we have christ in the center and he is has his hand out he is pointing to the sheep and on his left hand you have the goats and so that is where the whole idea of the last judgment comes from is christ saying on that day on that final day i will say to the sheep come enter into my kingdom and i will say to the goats leave away far away from me right and so that's the way to understand the basic idea of what the last judgment is it's there are some things which are brought inside the sheep and there are some things that are excluded which are the goats and so on the right hand of christ on his right hand you have the sheep and on his left hand that's what it said in the text it says he'll say to the sheep on his right enter to the goats on his left go away obviously it's not the kind of thinking that we like to have today but what i like to propose to you is that that is actually how all identity formation works that is anything that exists is necessarily a judge anything that has identity right anything i mean anything like a cup pencil a baseball club like anything that that has identity is necessarily a judge because because it is a specific identity it necessarily has two things it has an inside and it has an outside it has things that belong to it and has things that don't belong to it and there's sometimes a there's a hierarchy of that type of participation it's always often not necessarily a a clear demarcation but there is a type of hierarchy of participation in something and then there is an outside and so all things that have identity necessarily function as judges and that's why in the ancient world you know for example a very a saint that i love very much st maximus the confessor he talks about the divine logos like in the gospel but he says all things have a logos right all things that exist have a name a reason a purpose and actually all of those are the same the name of something the reason the purpose for it it's the reason why you see it in the first place why do i identify something as having identity as having being is because i can see its purpose even if it's unconscious it doesn't have to be conscious right it's like if i know that if i have a name for something is because there's a reason why there's a name for it i i know what a bottle is because i drink water out of it and it's a judge because and i participate in that judgment because i don't want to get wet and so if there's a hole in the bottle it's a bad water bottle and i will exclude it from it from its participation in the identity of bottle right and so this is just how things work and you just can't avoid it like it just this is just how reality functions whether it's your family whether it's the school all of these things all have this structure and the last judgment the way to understand it is the it's the most extren version of that it's the one that takes it to the very limit of what you can almost tolerate in terms of understanding what identity formation is think of it like it's a cosmic version of every time i recognize something as having identity but it's this massive massive version of it so what do we have in the image we have christ in glory at the center of the image this is the son of man right this is the prophetic image of the perfect man so if you're not a christian in some ways it doesn't totally matter for this conversation just think of it like it's the ideal person right yeah as christians we believe that that's this person but just as a structure think of it like it's the ideal of a person it's the it's the human the highest human that you can imagine the one that contains all that which is human in it and that is basically the source of why we know that there's humanity it's the culmination of all that is good about what human is okay and that's here and that's the judge and why is it the judge because that is it right that's how we understand the good it's like if we know what a good person is then we inevitably know what aligns with it what comes towards it and what is moving away from it right you can think about it in a in a a sports team is always the easiest one because it's aoral so it's doesn't doesn't doesn't rub people wrong you know you you know what a good player a good basketball player is and that good basketball player becomes a standard by which we measure other basketball players it just happens and if you have one that rises up really high then that standard gets higher and all of a sudden the judgment becomes stronger right if i go to a basketball game for kids that are 134 or if i go to a professional basketball game i do not judge the same way because the standard of the participation is not the same if i go to professional game those the standards have been have been lifted so high that i'm like well that's not michael jordan right you know it's always there's always this this judging and this is something that that that happens inevitably so imagine so this is the the perfect man who is there and now he is signifying that he is judging the world he is showing the right hand and the left hand and he is saying to those on the right come in and to those on the left move away those that don't fit with the ideal or aren't moving towards the ideal are pushed out and those that fit with the ideal or moving towards the ideal are gathered in so the structure of the image this image of the heavenly man and that's how to understand it right it's like why is it a heavenly man it's because he's the ideal he's just higher than us and it's a it's a metaphor but it's not in and and that's how we think of things that are above us that are more than us that are higher than us and so they appear in heaven they come down from above and that's how we recognize that they are the model by which we measure other things and it's a very practical thing there's nothing it's not magical in any way you know if i am here and i'm in front of you and i'm above you right now then i am the one who gives the standard of what is happening now right i am the measure of this event at this moment and that's how this is how it works if you have someone who rises above even physically above everybody else then everybody can see him but not all of you can see each other and so i can judge all of you right but you can't all judge each other you can judge me in this case though it's a little different but it just to understand that this idea of the heavenly man right and so the the image is very is very ancient from the very beginning of christianity we have these images that represent this relationship between heaven and earth and they're not actually stories it's like this image you see christ above as the heavenly man as the the son of man and then you have the church which is below and you have two apostles you have st peter as st paul that are like two pillars of the church that again is a very simple structure of reality right what is church if you know what church means it means not the word church but what it translate it means ecclesia it means the gathering okay and that's how that's how it works that's how a body works right a body is a gathering of identities that fit with a higher identity it's a gathering of things that are brought together into a higher participation that's what a body is anybody like anybody that you can imagine whether it's a body of literary work or whether it's a tire or whatever anything you can imagine as having identity that's how it works so it gathers the things together together into its head and then it has to align with what the head is offering for it to be part of that body right and so anything you can imagine always functions that way so that's why we talk about the church as being a body as being a gathering things together that are then seen in light of the reason why they exist and of course now we're talking about a a giant cosmic image but that's just how things work that's how that's how all things work it's a fractal idea it's like once you kind of see the the the final judgment the end of all things in this image of the last judgment right you get a glimpse of how it reflects in little ways in everything that we do okay and so there are different ways of representing it this is this is one way and the ascension is also another image that has the same structure as the last judgment in part because in scripture when christ goes up the angel says the way that he went up he's going to return but if you understand it that this is what this basic image it's aead something above an image reference and then a gathering below of people that are looking up and that are pointing at it they're saying oh it's that that's the thing that makes us together right that's the that's the that's the person that's the the principle that's the the top that makes us understand understand that we are we are together and then the the virgin becomes an image of that body herself because she is that for christ she's the one who gathered his body in her woo it's pretty simple she gathered the body in her room she becomes an image for the body itself so different ways you can represent it this is ascension sometimes it's just an ontological relationship it's actually not a scene at all it's not representing anything it's just the relationship between christ above the virgin below and the disciples gathered together in the body and it's analogous to a person with the head and the body the head is the place where meaning comes from right the head is the place that we recognize somebody by i don't usually recognize somebody by their shoulder i tend to recognize them by their eyes by their by their expression so the head is the place of meaning it's the place of purpose it's the place where we recognize identity and so it's normal to use that type of imagery together now the one thing i want to say and it's important to say this because it's already it's it's already kind of frightening to talk about the last judgment this way is that there is a way to understand the idea of the right hand and the left hand of christ as not just being good bad because that's how we tend to think about it it's like you know though that which comes towards the inside is good that which moves towards the outside is bad but in the very structure of this image you'll see that that is not the case right that that moving out from the identity is not always bad because obviously we're not we don't believe in the monad like we believe that multiplicity is necessary and that is good and so there's a sense in which the that which appears on the left hand of christ will often represent change will represent let's say a kind of wildness to it to it or a kind of or difference and that which is on his right hand will represent unity will represent identity because it's that which comes towards identity right so it's all not always negative not always positive a good example is in this case here this is an image it's a deasis which is again the son of man in the middle and two people on the side and now on on his right hand he has the virgin and on his left side he has john the baptist now comparing those two is useful to understand the difference between the right hand and the left hand one is secret one is covered one is is quiet and it's kind of like this inner reality this mystery of the inside and then the other one he's out in the desert he's wearing animal skins he's got crazy hair and he's screaming to everybody to repent so that's a good like a basic way to think of it if you look a little bit again to the right you'll see st peter who's here and then you'll see st paul who is a little bit further down they are again the same that are here the two pillars of the church st peter and st paul they are again here which is you have st peter and st paul this is the most interesting one because st paul was not at the ascension so why is he there why is he in the image of the ascension and it's because it's representing a structure of reality for you it's not just saying this is not just an event this is like a pattern but this is like a it's a way for you to see reality through these images rather than just a kind of dactic thing and so who's st peter right st peter he's the rock he's the foundation he's the apostle to the inside right he's the apostle to the jews in that case and who's st paul right st paul is the apostle to the gentiles but he's not just that he's also like the 13th apostle like semi-legitimate like i i'm a christian and everything but you know it's like he he he kind of self justifies his existence as an apostle like he's interesting if you look at him thinking about him as the left hand you could say of christ he talks about himself he says that he is a shape shifter he says that i'm all things to all men so he actually says i do not have a specific identity right i am in some ways shifty in my existence he calls himself the aborted apostle he uses all these really strong terms says he's a fool i'm the fool for christ okay so he's the opposite of reason he's the opposite of he has that and in this case it's not bad at all it's actually wonderful it's actually great it actually is the fullness of being to understand that this mo movement towards the inside and this movement towards the outside is this breathing in and breathing out of being that is just a normal part of how existence functions okay and i think that's important to say because we always sometimes get too caught up in the the moral question and thinking that it's just good bad but clearly in this image of the last judgment that is not the case and the importance of having st peter and st paul like i said not just in the last judgment but in all these other christian images is there to help us see this relationship right and there's if you think about the two apostles you'll start to see interesting images of what it is that they represent so what is st peter's sin it's pride right what is pride pride is excess of identity that's what pride is so you can see like and what is st paul's sin right it's the thorn in the flesh okay and so you can see in their character how they you know both in their good side and their bad side they really represent these two aspects of reality this idea of gathering in the multiplicity gathering in the identities towards purpose but also loosening the identity and kind of letting things have their own particular existence right and that's necessary in everything we do it's necessary in any team any family you have to find that balance between breathing in and breathing out right you can't always be moving towards unity or else you every else you become fragile and you can't obviously always be moving towards multiplicity because at some point your identity stops to exist you that's called decomposition and then and when things decomposed then they cease to be the thing that they were the idea of the last judgment is that it is this moment where the ideal man is judging all of humankind he's judging all of what it is that is good and bad about humanity and is showing the consequences of what that does of what that is and he's calling everybody towards the resurrection and you can understand the resurrection again as this finality as this this is all that you are so you're a person the resurrection is everything that you are is now gathered into something it's gathered into the end it's gathered into the finality and that includes body it includes your soul it includes all the aspects of you but now all of them kind of in this moment that is not chronological anymore that is like the end of time and at the end of all things and so it shows what things are and so what we see in the image is you're seeing the angels calling all the dead out of their abode and so the animals are regurgitating the people regurgitating their prey and on the other side then you have again the monsters the sea monsters regurgitating their prey as the angels are calling right they're calling us all to be gathered back into the unity and so this is of course an image of the movement of multiplicity into unity right it is the movement of that which is fragmented that which is broken and that which has been eaten by animals so for those that have read dante will know that the animals represent some that which is not human sometimes it can represent aspects of humanity it can represent the passions often it represents an excess of an aspect of us and so those excesses you could say say or those broken aspects of humanity are being given up right and they're being gathered back together to form a single body right to form a body again and that is represented in another way at the next to the angels calling the dead out of the earth as the angel that is scrolling all the stars back together right he's scrolling the heavens you can see he's got the scroll of the stars and he is basically wrapping them back together into a single role this gathering of multiplicity back into one there just different ways of representing it represented as the bodies represented as the stars but it's this gathering of all things back into their center okay back into the one this is a very interesting image so this image is so you can see i'll show you where it is in the image it's down here right so here this is called the heimia i don't know if i'm pronouncing it right with a bunch of greek speakers makes me feel a little uh embarrassed but that's how i sayia and with the heimia is it's the it's the prepared throne it's a very interesting idea it's the idea that the throne is prepared for the return of the heavenly man so the ideal is coming right the the reason for things is coming but in order for it to connect you have to get things ready you have to prepare the throne for the arrival of the king and now you see again adam and eve being brought to the foot of the throne you know because in many ways they are the throne right they are the body that is gathered they're an image you can take you take the first man and first woman it's a good way to get everybody in an image without having to make billions of people it's a good way to do it take the first ones put them there and say these all of humanity is gaed gaed together as the throne you could imagine it as a throne you can imagine it as a city imagine as a bride that's often how it's represented in in in scripture and it's and this union of heaven and earth and of the head and the body and of the the the heaven and earth are represented as a sexual union all of these different images are appropriate to understand the idea of gathering things together so that that which is above can come and encounter it right it's a it it reproduces the text in genesis 2 where god gathers the dust together and he blows air into it takes heaven puts it inside like gathers a bunch of stuff and then puts heaven inside and that's how things exist that's how everything exists everything exists as a gathering of body that has purpose inside it you need a reason or else you cannot recognize things as having a identity they have to have something which brings multiplicity into one now one of the aspects of the last judgment and you know you see it of course here quite a bit is so now you have the devils that are here and you have the devils that are here and you have the angel that is here and and what are they doing they're weighing the soul right and so they're actually deciding right they're basically judging they're participating in the judgment they're judging which side you're going to go are you going to go on the side of the right hand which is the one that gathers or you going to go on the side of the left hand which is the dispersal and the breakdown and the decomposition and so this idea right it's it's it's one which is so universal it's everywhere in in culture and so it's it's it's just this it's exactly this and everybody experiences this all the time right it's like there is something in you a wild part you know a part that is going to break everything or however else you want to think of it but there's a part in you that is pulling you towards dissolution and there's an aspect of you that is pulling you towards one that's putting you towards unity towards good things st gregor of nissa for example you know this early church father 4th century he said at birth all men are given an angel energy a demon and this is not just homer simpson this is very old like all men are given an angel and a demon and that's what we now call come to call a guardian angel but you know we've forgotten about the guardian demon we don't like that one but basically think about it as the aspect of you which is pulling you up the best aspect of you because you can see it right everybody can see it inside them it's like st paul would say christ in me what is christ in me it is that the the the aspect of me that i can recognize as moving towards that which i know to be good and that i know to be the truth and that which gives life but then there's also of course the flesh that that's the way st paul talks about it right that i do the things that i do not want to do that the flesh pulls me away from that so you can understand it as above and below is a good way to understand it right because it's a very simple way to represent it because above are the patterns and the lights and you don't hurt yourself much with what is above although yeah it's true that there is are storms it's say higher up from that you have the stars you have the patterns you have the patterns of reality you have the light which comes up and shines makes everything visible and then below you've got things that die in darkness and decompose and so the idea that hell is below is a very very intuitive reality like it's very simple you don't have to you don't have to to actually work too hard to understand that things decompose down here right and the specific and the particular is down here and the universal and the one is up here and you can do it if you want like go into a field and put your face on the ground and you'll see that you see very few things right you'll just see a bunch of grass and maybe a few bugs you know but if you go up a mountain then all of a sudden all that multiplicity gets gathered and gathered and gathered into one until you can see the pattern and you can kind of see the layout okay so this idea that heaven is above and and and that hell is below is very reasonable everybody should believe that it's not a okay so so below down here now you have the two like the two sides which is you have the gathering here and then you have the dispersal here and the gathering is represented as paradise now paradise is not heaven that's really important to understand the difference paradise is not up there paradise is the gathering down here right it's the garden paradise is eden it's the the the good which is manifested and gathered in the world so what you have is you have the image of the cherub that is on the door of the garden and it's usually i don't if you can see it here it's holding a lance often it's holding a sword like a flaming sword we see st peter who's opening the door right to paradise and then in paradise there are three people abraham the virgin and who can you guess who the third one is this guy so i'll tell you it's a it's a good thief okay but abraham the virgin they like it's really important to understand they're not metaphors for paradise they are paradise okay when christ talks about the vision of lazarus and the rich man he says lazarus is gathered into the bosom of abraham right that is what paradise is it is to be gathered in the thing from which your multiplicity originates right to be gathered to your fathers is to return back to the place where you were one with that which is around you that's what the garden of eden is the top of the mountain it's the place where all multiplicity comes together into one and abraham for the jews is paradise because he is the source of unity for their nation he is the place where they recognize each other as being one okay that's important to understand and the virgin is of course the same for us she is that which gathered the body together she represents the gathering of the body she represents the throne she represents the the the the land she has all she is the mountain she has all that type of imagery around her because she gathered the logos into her womb the thief is there to remind you what i told you at the beginning which is that all of these image go together because what's happening in this image is already happening in this image it's all already in that image because we forget there isn't one cross there are three crosses right and there's christ in the center and there is one who recognizes him as the source of value as the source of virtue as the source of innocence and there is one who does not recognize him and mocks him and derides him and so the last judgment is already happening on the cross it's already there it's all encapsulated into that one image not just that but this also what is christ doing why are these characters there he's saying this is your mother this is your son he's saying this is how you're together this is why this is your relationship this is what makes you not two but one is i am giving you an identity right now so christ on the cross does everything that the image of the last judgment does already and that's why this image is so astounding right this image it's like all of this is gathered together into that one image at the top and it's just this unfurling of the consequences of one action now why does it matter why why why the cross what you know it's like okay so i can i can understand this right i understand the idea of the ideal man i understand the idea of the the the top of the pyramid you know the head hono the president the the top guy the captain of the team i get that that's easy to understand we all know we look up to these characters that are heroic that kind of have that brightness to them and they kind of gather us into their leadership right so why this why why this and that is the that is the mystery of identity is captured in that image and that's what all of you that have read dante have discovered is that identity is not doesn't just hold together that's pride that's no good identity is always self-giving it always empties itself necessarily and there's there's nothing magical about it right it's a very it's almost a technical description of of how things work so for my steering wheel to have its identity it has to offer itself to the car it has to or else who cares about a steering wheel i just have a fetishized steering wheel you know like hung on my wall it's irrelevant all things give themselves to their higher participation the world is made of sacrifice and this is what's so fascinating about understanding and this is also why you know you hear all this talk about christian nationalism like you probably heard all this this kind of rumble about it but there's something about christian identity which is very particular which is understanding that which is understanding that identity always gives itself and it gives itself in in two directions it gives itself up necessarily like i said the steering wheel has to give itself to the car and the car has to give itself to fact of driving and the fact of driving has to give itself to the existence of towns and of people living together all of these things have to stack up all these goods to give themselves up always and that's what you see in d that ultimately that leads to something that is beyond beyond the world but identity also has to give itself down right it has to have compassion the best way to understand it is that for there to not just be one car there has to be flexibility in how car exists it it has to give itself to some extent has to loosen itself so that you can recognize multiplicity as well so identity always gives itself up but also always gives itself down and that's what it's amazing about this particular image of the last judgment it's the only one that i know that has this structure where they take the three these three images and stack them together in a way that you see how they kind of fit into each other but that is what is so to me astounding about this particular structure so we'll save the the worst part for the last so we have to talk about hell obviously a little bit the way to understand the bottom of the leftand register the way to understand hell is the is exactly the problem of fragmentation and in some ways the problem of identities and love and desire that are out of control and what and what they do is they're not sufficient right and so sin that's what sin is it's like the thing that you aim towards if it's the wrong thing it's not sufficient if it doesn't give itself up towards other other identities then it becomes insufficient it eats you devours you it burns you right it destroys you this is not something this happens at the end of the world it's something that you can experience every single day right it's like if you give yourself to something so exclusively or if you let something take over your life so exclusively and you don't let it open up and participate in the other goods that that are available to you then it will eat you right it'll be like worms that are constantly eating your body it'll be like fire that is burning or it'll be like the cold that freezes you and makes you impossible impossible for you to go forward and we know that it's it's easier to see that with people that are addicted when people when you find when you know people that are addicted to something you see it clearly right it's like this thing this drug this alcohol this whatever is has now taken over your life and is destroying you but you persist in it and is basically devouring you but the truth is that that can be true anything it's not just can be true about work right it can be true about the love of a person right you can idolize someone and love them so much that it will destroy you we met people everybody's met someone that has let that happen to them so it's actually like a coherent description of how reality works which is that if you are captured by things and you don't participate in the higher goods that lead up to the heavenly man then you will burn right it'll it will it will happen inevitably and so but the one thing that i want to show you that's actually i like about this particular image of hell is that all the people of hell are all the elites it's like monks and emperors and bishops you know regular people don't go to hell just important people i kind of like that and this can be represented as an upside down gathering gaing right as a fetishized gathering like a like a parody of the right hand you could say and so this is the antichrist who is on the lap of the devil as if he was christ he looks like jesus actually he's made to look exactly like the way that you would represent the child christ in the hands of the mother this exactly what i i tried to tell you it's like if you are captured by something that completely takes you it's almost like an inverse it's a parody of the right hand it's like this this concentration of identity in the wrong place that then devours you but what's beautiful about this is that you have these three so if you look at you have the antichrist on the devil's lap and on the other side you have probably lazarus it's not 100% clear who it is but it's probably lazarus it is a a soul that is saved and is in the bosm of abraham so think about it like show you the full image again okay so it's actually quite beautiful because down here right you have lazarus that is that is contained in the abraham here you have the antichrist that is on the devil and think of it that across from that if you were here and you turned around then you would see christ on the virgin's lab so this is what you would see so you have this beautiful kind of structure of meaning where all of the things kind of come together in the beginning and the end end and so i mean that is what i wanted to kind of help you see is to maybe look at these types of images again with fresh eyes understand that the medieval how they understood reality and the way that these image function as a kind of map of reality the same way this the the the the gospel stories the bible stories or the ancient myth function and if we see them that way we get we can get quite a bit of insight into how how the world works so thank you for your attention question i have for you is beautifully showed up showed in this image how things stack up from from the from the many to the one how do we find our way from division back to unity i mean start with yourself you know that's probably the best thing to do this whole image could be described as an im of the soul right and so you could actually understand that that you know this sometimes it's not there in this one but sometimes there's actually a person here in between the devil and the angel that's being weighed and so inside you right you are all of us are made of multiplicities just like together we we make multiplicities with others and so the best way to come back towards unity in the world is to come back towards unity in yourself you know and so jordan peterson talks about cleaning your room it's actually a great it's a great simple thing is to say that it if actually it sc can scale from the ground up and that a person that is transformed and that has you know that he's moving you know in truth towards virtue and beauty will have reverberations around them and then the the world can start to clump again you know and i and i and i think like for example what ron's doing is a great example because they're saying you know we're not here to we're not this is not about policy like we're not going to change the entirety of america what we're going to do is we're going to create a paradise and we're going to pull in the people that are capable and willing to enter into the right relationship with the vision and that is something which will then reverberate into the future in ways that is far more real than if we just change the law because when you change a law you don't change anybody's heart right you you you if people think that this whatever culture war thing is going to be won by putting the right number of people on the supreme court from whatever side you are that's absolutely ridiculous like you'll just increase polarity and division and and and fight but transform people that's real and that is undeniable when you meet someone that is transformed steven and i had the chance to go to mount aos together and we were able to meet the abbott of one of the monasteries and the man was just i don't know what to say i mean he was glowing not l physically glowing but he was clearly a transformed person and it hushed everybody you know it's like everybody was reduced to silence and i think that you know we don't often meet people like that but we meet little versions of it whereas we we encounter people that have that light and that that that spark and are glowing and we have to that's the way transformation happens i believe it some of what you said reminded me of plato both in terms of especially in his metaphysics but to a lesser extent the the politics that he describes in the republic is that just a coincidence or is there is there any kind of direct influence there no i i mean i think that plato is definitely part of the the the cannon of the of the west and all of you know i'm very in line with justin martyr that is that i believe that all things that are good are from god that is that you know justin marter talks about those that were christian before christ he and he talked about the philosophers as being images of that and that's the way that i see it i think that plato like like all the ancient thinkers is is someone that how can i say this that we have to kind of go through with a a certain amount of discernment and wisdom but definitely is the basic description of reality is quite is quite powerful but i would say that one of the things that i love about the the image that i'm showing you is there is this this aspect that you find this canotic aspect that you find in christian metaphysics which i think is is also very powerful this idea of this emptying and this the the trinitarian language of like the persons emptying themselves into each other is a very powerful way to avoid the problem of the the tyrant you know and of the of empire in the negative sense because sometimes plato's ideas can seem to lead to that you talked about identity as this exclusion of something and inclusion of something was a really interesting way to think about it and you mentioned pride as an excess of identity right do you mean excluding more or including more when you say excess you said you said that pride is an excess of identity so is it that inclusion or that exclusion it can be it can actually be both it can be a desire to make everything the diff the difference between unity and uniformity for example is a good example it's like unity is not uniformity right unity is actually a variation that comes together towards unity so so pride can be the desire to make all things uniform in a way that is absolute but pride can also be the desire to include things that that you think you can include but that you can't that you thought you could but then it rips you apart you know so those are so like you can be prideful and take on too much right and you can there are different ways but it can be either i think i just had a question about the image there of christ on the throne and i noticed there's two wheels below at his feet and then there's something that looks like a rope or a tail yeah yeah let me find a better picture down to i guess to hell yeah so could you so when it is yeah so this is the image of the son of man what one of the things it's trying to do is to gather in all the images that are there in the bible and so in the book of ezekiel there is this description of of the heavenly figure the heavenly man that that descends onto a throne a chariot made of angels okay and so made of cherubs and so that is what you're seeing there so you see you see the the cherubs right these two these angels with four wings and then you see these wheels that are described by ezekiel that have eyes all around them right and the this is what is being represented by the way this is also represented at the ascension okay this one is even clearer because you see the the wings have all these eyes on them and you see the four the four faces right you see the four figures of the lion the man the eagle and the o then you see the wheels next to them and see what if you once you start to see it you'll start to see it everywhere right here are the four figures here are the wheels okay this is from egypt the other one is from syria the other one is from italy this is a it's a kind of universal language this that's coming from christ feed is the river of fire it's a river of fire that descends all the way into into gana all right so see it that that river interestingly enough there's an image i didn't show you but it is interesting in russian iconography that river of fire becomes a snake interestingly enough and then the snake here this so he bites the the the the heel of adam then the snake comes all the way down into hell but that snake now is both going up and going down it's not just going down into hell it's like the ladder of ascent at the same time this idea that there's motion between between the different aspects and so as you move up in the virtues you're you're moving up the snake and as you go down with the vices then you're going down it's like snakes and ladders you know that came yeah like that in those images how do you know that it's peter and paul and various places adam and eve well peter and paul they're easy to recognize the peter has a white beard and he often has curly hair paul is bald and he's got a long kind of dark beard so he's actually easy to recognize and also because in some versions although not in the in the east for example we actually write the names so you'll actually have the names written next to all the characters so it's a good way to know that that's the character but we can still transpose it into the west where that tradition of marking the names was not really maintained but you can know that that's who it is because in the older in other versions it's literally written their name underneath them underneath them when you mentioned that jesus is the the perfect man and you say that all of us are tending to him is he then the the man by whom or by which all men shall be judged well that's what the implication of the image is for sure i think they clearly the implication of the image is that that man who who sacrificed himself is the one that judges all things and in some ways can judge all things because he did not take glory for himself that that's the that's the difference between just the emperor or the judge in the simple sense and this image of the man who has given himself and therefore is is allowed to be the the heavenly man so you you you said something about st paul on the on the on the left hand side or or right hand and it was a little confusing i don't think you meant to say that he was with those that go c are cast into hell because he's on the left hand no i was trying to show that the left hand has multiple aspects and it's not just good bad right that that's important because we we can tend to think that and it's okay in like a basic idea the way christ talks about the sheep and the goats but in the iconography and in the way the the language started to develop then the idea of the left hand of christ having also a a useful positive side you know which is multiplication and division and and and difference that level where where where you have peter on the on the right hand and then paul on the left would that then be like all the saints called with jesus to sit in judgment that's right okay that's what it is and and and it is it is this idea and you know and it's i think to me this is actually a very useful you know it's it's a useful way to deal with the problem of plato for example right because this idea of the forms you know it's like okay so where are these forms you know they they just exist completely independently of man and the the the christian answer is no the christian answer is they exist in him right they exist in the one that is the is the source of reality so so didn't get these weird things in medieval iconography which is that when they show the creation of the world they show jesus christ creating the world which is kind of just okay well that's not possible possible right because he comes 2000 years later but it's really understanding the idea that this is the the world of meaning exists through man that you don't need to just posit forms outside of consciousness but it also doesn't mean that it's idiosyncratic and it's like anything goes but that that consciousness is a a a way by which human the the world exist it is in some ways the filter to which whatever the forms are are made subject to and so the idea of so it actually to me it solves a lot of problems like metaphysical problems but also even in terms of science and and and a lot of the the questions we ask now so the idea that now we all of us are called to enter into that like we can become principalities we can become like the gods of the greeks right you can become gods and you will sit in judgment with with the the the heavenly man over reality and it's like it sounds weird but like it just it's it just means that you can become a standard by which others live their life right you can become an image you can become something a star by which other people judge their own actions right and that's actually just true it's just how it works it's how humanity functions like we have things people that shine for us and that become the standard the judge and so this is this is a cosmic version of that which is that you know in the end all of this will be judged by by the heavenly man and his those that he has gathered in with him you want to think about it that way but that's already why we have things like patron saints you know we have all the that's why we name cities after people that's why we name that's why we name roads after people because they are they become like principalities that that give identities to things and we want to live in their example by remembering them and by giving and by putting their name into the the landscape even i really enjoyed your talk and i've been enjoying following you on youtube and stuff and i'm kind of curious is there any good resources or is it possible for to kind of discover like a unity from the symbolic way of talking and like theistic aristan way of talking since plato's come up twice at aristotle is it possible i mean i'm not a it's it's complicated i'm not i'm i definitely am an eastern orthodox person i have my line you know and the the the saints that i love i don't know thomas well enough and i don't know his work and i also i'm careful because i know that thomas and the thomas are not the same and so i don't i try to be to be careful but i would i do believe that in some ways christianity is a is is a synthesis between something like plato and aristotle and it's very right in the in the image of the incarnation it kind of plays that role and it seems to play itself out in the in the the story itself so i say probably yes but i'd be careful myself to talk about that thank you again for such a stirring talk and for guiding us through this mysterious image and i was particularly struck by the throne and this that makes up the cathedral that is the symbol of the giving of the s to another so either we have these these figures becoming as children sitting on the laps of mother mary or father abraham and then we have others becoming as father as mother in giving of their own bodies for the glory of another and yet all throughout these images and all throughout especially religious art and iconography we have these male and female symbols that make up the one that represent this sublime unity and this ideal and i'm curious to hear your thoughts on how we can translate the masculine and feminine symbols as we as males and females respectively try to make sense of our own inner world to order our own identities which are of course multiplicities of of both so the the structure like the basic structure is there it's there in genesis 1 that's how the bible starts god makes heaven and earth and this heaven and earth this duality this original duality then gets reproduced all through the genesis narrative and gets repeated all the way down to then man separating separated into male and female and so it's like it is basically the structure it's just the structure all through the the the text of genesis 1 and it happens all through and like you and like you said in the images that we find we find this relationship i like this coptic image a lot right this basic structure right of the head or the masculine above in heaven and then the mother below with the the child as the hidden aspect of heaven in the world right the spark is kind of hidden in things but also the one that gathers together right that gathers together the multip licity into herself you could say know if you ever seen this image it's a it's a beautiful catholic image you see the virgin in statues and she has her cape open and then in the cape you have all these people that are kind of in her cape that's a beautiful image of that of that kind of gathering so the first thing to say that's important to to say is that we have to be careful not to reduce a person to their gender that's the first thing that we're all people made in the image of god and that we are all called to be to be in the image of christ and to be like christ and that in christ there is no male there's no female there's no greek there's no jew right that we have this idea that in the unity there's a way in which we can all participate into the story but there is also a manner in which we do play those roles in society because then there we do also we all also are male and female and that has a reality that we have to account for if we pretend like it doesn't exist then the world stops to exist it's actually quite simple if we pretend that male and female aren't different and that they don't have complimentary roles then there's no more generation basically things the being ceases it's pretty it's like that's why it's described that way in genesis 1 and that's just how the world functions and so we have to take that seriously but there's also a way in which we can all play the different roles in different perspectives right and so that's also important to understand is that there's a manner in which we are all let's say as christians i am the bride of christ like we are all the bride of christ we all have a feminine aspect to us in which we we are called to to to give ourselves to higher higher purposes and to higher things and there's also a way in which we all of us whether it's male female whatever sometimes we play leadership roles where we have to guide multiplicities towards purposes and then we play roles that are masculine that are heavenly roles in that sense and so it's important to understand it fractally and to not ignore the different levels that's the to me that's the key is that there are moments in history where we try to reduce the person to their gender and then everything becomes solidified you know like that and there are moments where we do the opposite now we mostly do the opposite where we just kind of collapse everything as so i think that the way to understand it and the best way to participate in it is to see it fractally it's like i play this role in this context and then there's this an understanding the the the difference between that which guides and gives purpose and and and let's say gives direction and that which gathers and gives itself up to that purpose so like ask one la one final question t that after your masterful explication of this image from the church in torello actually had the great privilege of going to that that church it's just in the sort of it was the beginning really of the of the of what we now call venice but they moved to what we now see as the main town so you've got to take a boat to get over there and i i had the great privilege of seeing this image and it was very moving to me but i have to i have to be honest when i was looking at this i couldn't see a tense of the things that you have explicated for us i don't have the the knowledge of of symbolism of a c a iconography and so on and so the question i want to ask you is really how do you learn to read and i mean of course you know how do you learn to get better at reading images our students are reading some very difficult books we're hoping to teach them something about how to read difficult literature and philosophy but that's not just a skill for this but it's in a way a way of learning to read reality analogy is the key in my perception is that when you're interpreting images for example it's very dangerous to get caught into the one image because one of the things that happens in language and in in iconography for example is that the images exist together right they rhyme they're like a they're kind of kind of a massive poetry and so if you can be able to look across from the different things that you're learning then you start to see the rhyming and once you start to see the rhyming then first of all there's a joy in like just in just kind of playing into that rhyme but then there's also a kind of coherence that appears that is wonderful because all of a sudden you have the capacity to to read something that you've never seen before because you know the pattern so well you know that this is how this is these are the basic patterns of icon of christian iconography for example and so often i can see an image that i've never seen in my life and i know what it is because i just know that if that image were represented it would have to have these elements in this in this structure and if like if there's something above or there's something below you know how are they interacting you know what what what are what type of of relationship you can see and so i would say that that can be true you know for image interpretation but it also has to be true for culture in general this is also one of the things that i think rson what's doing is amazing is that you need a certain breath to some extent these are a lot of the stories let's say the ancient myth or the bible stories or the fairy tales they used to be so part of people's lives that everybody just knew them they didn't even remember how they knew them they just did but now we have to be more deliberate about it because we're so assaulted with all kinds of insane you know ridiculous stories that are trying to get our attention that we have to be more deliberate about you know going back into the ancient text going back into the myths into the into the stories and then starting to look across and to see the patterns and how the they they relate to each other so that's at least that's the way that i read well i know i'm speaking for many of us when i thank you jonathan for the ways that you open up those patterns open up the horizon open up our understanding both here tonight and in your work on your podcast and beyond join me in thanking jonathan for a wonderful evening [applause]
