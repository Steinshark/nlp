so a couple of months ago we did a video on the old sun 3160 that i found lying around in the department and trying to get it to work and we sort of left it to the point where it was making an awful racket now we worked out that the noise was actually coming from the old hard disks which sound more like sanding devices rather than actually harder so i suspect they're shot so we took them out and if we turn it on now it's still noisy but it's a it's got a less of a sort of angle grinder effect to it and we've actually now got it to the point where short of installing the operating system is still booting what we've done is running in it now one of these which is a scuzzy emulator which uses a micro sd card to act as the hard disk so i've set that up to actually act as a hardest interesting the way i've set that up is i use an emulator on the mac to emulate the hardware and install the first part of the operating system on that so that's sort of working now and i can get it as far as booting and get it to boot into the preliminary stages and even get it able to ping out onto the local network which of course is connected to the internet so it's actually on the internet so we're just booting it up using the falcon as the terminal emulator and in a second hopefully it will ask me to enter the menus and i should be able to get it going so i'm now into the boom menus i'm going to come out of these and return to the monitor and i'm now going to boot it off the scuzzy emulator so boot sd naught comma 1 comma naught so it's starting to boot i think oops nope so it's actually now trying to do a network boot which is not going to do if you remember the right boot command we can actually get it to boot and you'll see it's now booting into scuzzy disk one which is what's being emulated communications have changed it's now moved from one serial protocol to another so i just have to change the settings for the port to seven bits rather than eight bits and i'm now at the installer prompt i haven't installed the whole operating system yet but this machine's booting so it's just a matter now of installing everything and it would work and if we look the internet connection is up so we can actually set this with a actual ip address so we can say we want ifconfig [applause] ie0 to be up and let me 23.5 net mask set that up and it's not picking anything up so obviously i need to plug the other end of the network cable in helps if you plug your internet connection in so we're not going to plug the internet connection in under the floor we'll pull that one out oops that was the cloud do you want to check these lights flashing on the little box so we've actually got a little converter box here which is converting the 10 base t coming out of that into the aui connector for the sun and we've got a link and we've got power and so on so hopefully i should be able to bring that up i'm going to play myself ifconfig ie0 has got an ip address now so hopefully i should be able to ping [applause] the router i've got no ping installed [applause] telnet if i have any ip stuff what do i have this is a very minimal installation so far we normally install the whole thing so i don't even know if i've got anything i can use to test the internet connection not much there tftp perhaps nope nope but if i do go to another machine assuming this isn't the one i unplugged i should be able to ping that ip address no i can't maybe see the machine i unplugged it worked the other day anyway so that's now up and running nothing getting there we just killed it it's almost like the adapters died no joy so no joy there it seems actually that the converter seems to all the lights have gone off on it so not quite sure what's happening there we'll keep her restore restoration and keep you posted i think the next step we just try this on another device see if we can get this working and then see whether it's the fault with this or whether it's a fault with the actual which is the power going to it but it doesn't seem to work any of the network card so i suspect something wrong with this which is encrypted once with k3 it's encrypted another time with k2 and it's encrypted a final time with k1 now let's think about what that means it means that only this it's a dirty job but someone's got to do it
