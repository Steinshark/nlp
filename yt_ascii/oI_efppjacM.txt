welcome to a coffee zilla christmas i come bearing gifts for the children potentially twenty thousand dollars worth and i know people say i take things too far frankly i don't know what they're talking about guys with christmas coming up oh my gosh this beer is so itchy with christmas coming up i wanted to do something crazy to wrap up this year which really put us on the map and which has been so humbling to see how many people have come to enjoy the videos and support us so i wanted to give back something to the shareholders of zilla to really pump the stuff to see some dividends before the tax year ends to end this year with the bank and no ho ho host i'm married thank you very much now instead i have something better than bad puns coffeezilla is going daily again that's right all through december bringing it full circle call your mom call your dad christmas came early ladies and gentlemen but listen to me for a second because there is a catch if you remember in january we had a challenge i would shave my head if i missed an upload well now i'm willing to do you one better not only will i make the same promise to you in december but i also have a challenge for our shareholders we are very close to 1 million subs the stock has been going absolutely crazy and i decided if we hit that goal by december 31st at 11 59 pm i will be donating 10 000 of my own money to save the children charity that's right it's an actual charity guys whose name was tarnished by the whole save the kids saga save the children actually helps children and i always thought it would be good if we could not only call out scams but we could also help out those in need where we can so that's if we succeed and hit 1 million subscribers now if we fail those same children are getting call in their stock no i'm just kidding actually we're gonna donate either way but only five thousand dollars if we don't meet our goal so that's the challenge bump the stock it's free to like and subscribe and this month it's a win-win-win no matter what the kids are winning the shareholders are winning and i win and you guys are getting content every single day but wait there's more i've also decided to add a bonus class a santa claus if you will to this challenge to raise the stakes if we meet our goal before christmas i will double how much we're donating that's 20 000 to save the children the actual charity in the name of the godzilla army if we meet our goal by december 25th so that means we have to hit our goal by december 24th at 11 59 pm and yes i know that's a very ambitious goal but i also think it's very doable more than half our audience watching right now is not subscribed so even if a fraction of you watching click that button we'd meet our goal in a single day so that's it that's the challenge literally everyone wins it's a fun challenge in the year and you guys will get a ton of content with special guests starting tomorrow on coffeezilla's christmas and maybe most important of all if we meet our goal we will also find out what's behind the one million subscriber secret door okay those are the rules see you tomorrow [music] but things will be different if i was balling
