my faith is a faithfulness to a process of self-correction not to any one faculty as the voice of the divine i think the capacity for the self correction to take on a life of its own and a life on its own that plugs into transpersonal and transc of aspects of my being for me that is a better i'm very impressed that you managed to bring all of that back to the point where it started by the [music] way [music] hello everybody i have the pleasure today of talking with my colleague at the university of toronto dr john veri we've discussed much many times on my podcast and in public and so it's a continuation of a conversation that's been going on for a very long time we concluded today with the proposition that we're both working on the edge of what you might describe as the counter enlightenment which i suppose is the endeavor to place what would you say cognitive processes that have gone to astray into the abstract and representational back on their feet to rediscover the sacred to rediscover what's deep and meaningful to rectify the meaning crisis as a consequence of that rediscovery and new discovery and we delve farther into that today so welcome aboard hopefully it's useful practically and metaphysically i've got a idea about the sacred i want to run by you sure technically well imagine that you have a hierarchy of thinkers such that this would exist over time okay such that some thinkers have more thinkers dependent on them than other thinkers right so they're more seminal right you'd get a rough approximation of that with citation counts in the scientific endeavor and citation counts are a pretty good index of quality as well as quantity at least compared to every other index that we have so you can imagine a dependency structure among thinkers so that obviously a thinker like milton would be of primary depth and shakespeare the people who are part of the canon and so rather than conceptualizing the canon as a consequence of the arbitrary decisions of arbiters of taste let's say you could say that the canon is the consequence of the cumulative impact of a thinkers thoughts moving forward and some thinkers are more key than others my sense for example and there's historical reasons for this obviously that the biblical corpus stands at the bottom of the western cannon and then there are thinkers who are who have their foot feet placed firmly in that tradition dante milton shakespeare etc and then a a branching structure above all that okay so it's a matter of dependency and so how fundamental a given thought is is dependent on how many other thoughts are dependent on it for its validity okay now this works out neuropsychologically too so imagine that you have a janof balman who talked about trauma has a theory that's analogous to this and i think it fits in well with the entropy control theories of friston so then imagine that your perceptions and therefore your emotional regulation are dependent upon a nested sequence of assumptions the the and a given phenomenon can violate an assumption and the degree of entropy that's produced by the assumption violation is proportionate to the depth of the assumption right right so yanov bolman talks about for example her model of trauma is shattered assumption the deeper the assumption so for example one way you can be traumatized in a marital relationship is through the discovery of infidelity yeah yeah right your your hyper priers get destroyed yeah so what do you call them hyper priors in the basian brain framework in friston's framework the the sort of priors that you use to run any of the basian approximation i actually don't like using the basian math because you don't actually run the math you run a dynamical system approximation but that's how they talk about it in the literature these are these are sort of your most prof these are the things that are applied in your predictive modeling in the most context invariant manner so they apply right context invariant right right well that's another way of thinking about it too is that something more fundamental applies across more situations and time spans right okay okay so here's a secondary consequence of that i think so then imagine that the degree to which you can handle entropy emerging as a consequence of the violation of your assumptions is proportionate to your social status okay and the reason for that is that the the better your reputation and therefore the better your situation in the social environment it happens to be the more resources you can bring to bear on a problem if one emerges okay now imagine your serotonin system index is that because we know serotonin is one of the systems that's implicated in the relationship between social status and emotional regulation sure so now the serotonin system has inputs into the memory systems that are that have this hyper dependency structure and they're a tuner and so that for you imagine disruption would be characterized in terms of its estimated magnitude by the depth of the presumption that was being violated and then there's a control mechanism off to the side of that such that the more tenuous your grip on the social environment is the higher the level of negative emotion that's produced in relationship to the violation of a given level of of assumption sure right okay okay so that makes that makes sense to you that seems to be reasonable very clar yeah okay okay okay okay good okay well so then i've been working well i'm writing as i mentioned a book on on on explication of biblical narrative it's called we who wrestle with god and i've been working oh nice pun on israel yes yes right exactly exactly and i discovered that relationship when i did the lectures lectures on genesis in in 2017 so i've been kind trying to come up with a technic technical definition of the sacred right and and this is relevant to research on awe too so the deeper you go the closer you get to the sacred and and i'm i'm speaking as a matter of definition here so as you move down your assumption hierarchy and you get to these you call them hyper priors yeah the closer you get to the ultimate hyper prior the the the the the the more you're walking on sacred ground and that's a technical definition now if you encounter something that shifts you in a hyper prior and that's a positive encounter that's going to produce a corresponding sensation of awe right and that i would say that's probably a dopaminergically mediated revelation of possibility it's okay so let me run something else by you and tell me what you think about this okay okay so i've been conceptualizing the sacred as a process too so there's a spirit in the old testament that's characterized as yahwa and the theory in the corpus is that whatever this central spirit is makes itself manifest in a number of different guises so for noah for examp example god is the spirit that calls the wise to prepare when the flood is coming and for abraham god is the call of the spirit of adventure and so you see these juxtapositions of narratives that shed a different light on this central spirit with each story united by the claim that regardless of the surface differences of the manifestation of this spirit it's reflecting an underlying unity that's the monotheistic hypothesis one god underneath all the gods so a dependency structure that has a fundamental base or a pinnacle depending on which set of metaphors that you use so when i wrote maps of meaning i had started to conceptualize the call of the sacred as something like spontaneous interest right is that well so things will grip your attention and compel you in a certain direction i realized later after i wrote that book many years later that that was equivalent to the more traditional notion of call fall in and so and then i think i missed something in maps of meaning that's half of the divine because i i really concentrated on interest and that was sort of under the influence of humanistic psychologists who were oriented towards say self-actualization but there's a corresponding element of conscience and so the there are conceptualizations by cardinal newman for example of god as the internalized voice of conscience right like the source of the super ego that's not that's another way of thinking about it but then you could think of yahwa as sort of the dynamic relationship between calling and conscience and to me that maps nicely onto positive and negative emotion because a calling is going to entice you forward with dopaminergically mediated what would you what would you say indications of treasure to come and conscience is going to say you've deviated off the golden path into the domain of danger and there's something you should sort out and then well you see and you see quite clearly in the old testament corpus and it also emerges in the new testament that there's a dynamic relationship between conscience and calling and that looks to me like what's conceptualized as the holy spirit that dynamic relationship so wow that's a lot well it's i've been working on this for months you know so yeah so so interesting because i've been working on this sacred a lot too starting a business can be tough especially knowing how to run your online store front thanks to shopify

what stage you're at that's shopify.com jvp let me share my thoughts and i'll share where i think they intersect with yours but maybe they differ but i think in a fruitful way first of all i there's sort of in in the literature i've been reading there's sort of three dimensions that are usually talked about with respect to the sacred one is ultimacy which i think you articulating and this and the move you made and this is a compliment to you by the way is is the classic move of neoplatonism which is called asymmetric dependence so what is everything asymmetrically dependent on that's how you get your ultimate what is that in terms of which everything else is explained or understood right that's ultimacy and then two other dimensions of the sac which i think you're alluding to one is axiological that you love this ultimate it isn't just an intellectual grasp for you so that's the directionality yes and and there's there's there's a valuing there's a loving but it's the reason why i want to say love rather than just value is love love doesn't carry with it necessarily the egocentrism of of value which can be very egocentrically oriented so love is so so would that be maybe that would be expressed in the old testament corpus as part of the covenantal relationship because it's a personal relationship rather than a than a what would you say instrumental relationship yeah est like me argues that in her covenantal epistemology and loving to know and how there's this deep b bond between knowing god and loving god that you can't separate them right and so that's so that's conceptualized metaphorically in the guise of a relationship rather than as having something oh yes it's very much about being in relationship and that's why i want to use the word love you can have preferences or even values but you have to be in love it's a commitment of the whole self right and so and the thing about love is is it gets you on plato's pivot point it involves the whole of the self without being self- involved which seems to be another dimension of this calling the sacred doesn't just call your aesthetic interest or your ethical interest or your intellectual calls you as a complete person this is one of the things that till emphasized speaks to the image of god within yes and you know the trad the christian tradition of the transmutation of the image into the likeness and so i think it's that's the axiological dimension and then there's the serological dimension that this loving relationship to what is ultimate is transformative it's healing it's redemptive it's liberating and so the reason why this is important is of course is this allows the sacred to be found in things that are in non-theistic traditions like buddhism the da right things like that so i the first part of what you were talking about like i said and again i think this this speaks well of it is in lines with the classic neoplatonic proposal of that what we're trying to get in touch with what is most real we have to get to the ground of intelligibility through at asymmetric dependence this is the notion of the ultimate the one asymmetrical dependence is that the terminology that's used yeah kevin corgan uses that when he tries to talk about how platinus u makes his argument for the one the ultimate reality within the neoplatonic system which gets taken up well one of the ways of sorting through that as far as i'm concerned is to note that there's either a unity or there's a plurality and then to note what the consequences of those are if there's a plurality there's in built contradictions in the structure of being and becoming itself and there's divisiveness that can't be overcome if there's an ultimate unity it might be mysterious and ineffable but it does indicate that all things can be brought together in some sort of harmonious relationship and that's relevant to human motivation because if there's a plurality there's going to be confusion and anxiety because confusion and anxiety mark a plurality so well yeah this is kirk guard's purity of heart is to will one thing so right right and so but this again is a neoplatonic argument the idea is whenever we're understanding something what we're doing is taking two things and finding a unifying principle and then if you were to pursue understanding to its depths you'd get something that technically speaking can't be understood because it is the principle by which all understand everything is understood right right right right so what what you'll get is you so it grounds out ineff ineffability it grounds out ineffability and and if you look at like nicholas of kuza where it grounds out is it grounds out in sort of of the paradoxical realization that what we consider ultimates ultimate polarities are actually somehow stereoscopically transcended so for example the even though the term is the one right it is understood as being beyond singularity and plural plurality it is neither singular nor plural because it is the basis for that particular kind of intelligibility it is trans centric god is an intelligible sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere is that nicholas of c well it was taken up by nicholas and others but it was actually that's a great that's a great line yeah and well nicholas has one that goes with it that god is within everything but not enclosed and beyond everything but not excluded oh yeah yeah yeah right right and so that that's ultimacy and then the idea is and this comes from yaden's work and some of my own work when people come into relationship to that which they consider more real the really real they take on this loving relationship ship in that they seek to transform their identities and their lives you suppose that's a marker for the validity of the encounter like if you if you stumble across something that entices you into a relationship of love is that actually a reliable ontological marker let's say well i think it i think if two things line up yes i think the answer is yes i think that's an excellent question i think if you get the reciprocal opening that's found in love for example you know i have a wonderful partner and i come to understand that there's something about her that will always be beyond my grasp and i open up to that and she opens up to that in me and we reciprocally open and aaron that's that's how you fall in love with so i think and from the first person perspective it's yes but i i think yayen and other people have done work that when people have this sense of being called and they have this noetic experience of the really real they do make their lives better by meaning objective measures their relationships get better well you mentioned healing so i've been wrestling about that physiologically well partly because i've been writing about the gospels and about a quarter to a third of the gospel account is miracles of healing right which is a difficult that's difficult ground to tread on if you're an empirical materialist let's say if you're a naturalist exactly exactly but there's a another frame of interpretation which doesn't necessarily exclude the miraculous but at least sidesteps it for the moment possibly or brings them together to suggest that well if the pattern of being that christ represents is a divine ideal there's every reason to assume that it would be allied with the kind of healing that you were describing which so imagine that you could embody a spirit a set of practices a set of perceptions and emotions that would optimize your function in relationship to the transcendent there's every reason to assume that that that what would accompany that would be an optimization of psychop physiological ial function me that's that's no different than claiming that you're going to have a much higher risk for mortality if you're depressed which is well known right so there there there are certainly there are links between attitude and underlying thriving that are well established and it it's not unreasonable to point out that like the archetypal ideal would that manifestation of the archetypal ideal or even contact with the archetypal ideal would be something that would tap you hard in a healing direction i think so and i mean so i i one of the arguments i've been working on is well you know i mean you know this better than i do i mean one of p's great insights the thing that made him a brilliant scientist right is he was looking for systematicity in the error being produced in the psychometric measures of intelligence just just that move alone is brilliant everybody else treats the errors as noise he says well what if there's patterns in the error and if the patterns if there's systematicity that points to intrinsic constraints and developmental arc and all that and and and that alone is brilliant and then i've sort of been reflecting on that and connecting with some of the literature and insight which is to think well if there's systematicity of error there's also the possibility of systematicity of insight which is not an insight into this particular problem but an insight into a family or network of problems such that right it would be lead to a systematic transformation of one's orientation and grip on the world and would also be systemic it would tend to percolate through the entire psyche that's what a baptism is well i mean it can be i mean well well right right that's the transformation that a baptism is designed to bring about if it's possible yeah and i i mean i think the shamanic death and rebirth abol i think the great doubt in zazen is doing it um and you know well that's what happened to dayart too how so how do you think well he decided that he was going to doubt everything right and to take it to take a journey down to what to what would you say the land of the fundamental presumption something like that and my sense with dayart i mean it's his realization is often translated as i think therefore i am but i don't really think that that's how he would have conceptualized it had he been alive now i would i think it's something more like i'm conscious therefore i am or i can't doubt the the fundamental reality of my own well i'll i'll put it back to you in way way i it and let's say we're so before the scientific revolution in decart we have a contact epistemology we have the epistemology that when you and i when you know something the form of that not the shape the form of it the the the principle of intelligibility in it is identical in your mind and the thing they conform together so this is a contact epistemology it's a mutual participation and then of course when we get the because of cernus and kepler we get this separation and the divorce i talk about this a lot in awakening from the meaning crisis and what dayart does is he tries to find where there's still that contact and where he finds it remaining is in self-consciousness the mind's contact with itself is where that knowing by being is still to be found and he withdraws the problem we have faced since that is you can't get contact with the world from that contact of the mind with itself and so this is what a lot of the work i'm engaged in is about trying trying to overcome what's interesting is that dayart on on notes to a lot of people of course dart puts a lot of emphasis on logic but deard also puts quite a bit of emphasis on insight that moment of insight when you where you get the flash and so the all of the premises of the argument hang together that's crucial do you well okay i want to go a couple of directions from from all that i've been thinking about thought itself as a form of secularized prayer okay so so let me okay so let me lay out lay out what i've been thinking and tell me tell me what you've been thinking and and what you think about this so the first the first issue is this is that we say we think things up but we have no idea what that means because the phenomenology this is something by the way that yung carl yung caught in me on to to some degree he said that we come across our own thoughts like we come across the furniture in a room it's like they're laid out before us and so and that always struck me because being struck by a thought or having a thought appear in your internal landscape is well i think it's a revelation i don't think it's any different than a revelation and so here's the steps as far as i can tell of thought the first step is something like a confession and the confession is whatever i think about this is insufficient which is equivalent in part to thinking i'm insufficient right so it's a humble step i have to not know something and that not knowing has to be of motivational significance and then that has to be allied with wanting to know okay and that has to be allied with faith that knowing would be better than ignorance and that's a presumption man especially because lots of times when you get a revelatory thought you're going to pay a price for your knowledge which might be the catastrophic dissolution of some of your previous assumptions right so you have to have this axiomatic presumption that more knowledge is good in the ways that would be desirable to you and even more generally and i think that's something like faith in the essential goodness of being and its intelligibility itself and i think that's partly why the scientific endeavor is embedded in that assumption of the goodness of being and the goodness of knowledge anyways no i agree with that okay okay okay so with regards to i want to talk to you about that at some point i call extended okay we'll go we'll get back to that so with regard to re so the first is admission of insufficiency yes and then there's the positing of a question and that seems to me to be alied with this gospel insistence that if you knock the door will open and if you ask you'll receive and if you seek you'll find all that all depends on actually asking actually wanting to know actually seeking it it can't be a game you got to want to know you know one of the things i've noticed in my own life is for example if i'm having a problem communicating with my wife or i'm having a scrap with a member and there's a certain amount of pain in it that if i sit down and i say probably i'm contributing to some something to this i'd like to know what it is which is not a fun thing to do no no but you'll get an answer okay so that's the next step so you've got your humble confession then you've got your revelation which is the appearance of a solution to that now people say when they describe that that they thought that up but to me that's an empty explanatory framework because yeah if you could think it up why didn't you know it to begin with and what exactly did you do to think it up and the answer is well i asked a question and the thought arose it's something like that and you can infer all sorts of unconscious mechanisms but phenomenologically the revelation appears and it strikes you you know but that's not enough that's not enough because you still then have the problem of potentially delusional or self deceptive revelation of course but then there's a there's an insistance a judeo-christian insistence in the case that i'm referring to that you have to test the spirits to see if they're of god so you have your confession and your openness to revelation you have the receipt of the revelation but then the next step is well you better put that thought to the test and you know attack it from this side attack it from this side and test it out and see if it's got solidity and weight and to understand its implications and it's seems to me that well first of all it seems to me that that's a variation of the practice of it's a secularization of the practice of prayer that's how it looks i mean that makes sense historically as well but okay so what do you what do you think about that well first of all i mean notice that you were provoked in my mentioning of insight and the possibility of systemic insight yeah because a deep revelation would be a systemic insight i think so and yeah there's a lot of work here part of what i'm doing on sabatical is also going through all the the most last five years of the insight literature try to keep keep a breast of that but yeah so interesting both in the neoplatonic tradition and then zen tradition you'll get like i do a practice every day where i'll say who is asking the question oh yeah and then there's a good question yeah and then who's listening to the answer whether you're feeling stressed anxious or simply seeking a moment of peace and tranquility the hallow app

meditations and okay when you get an answer to that you get a do you get a vision like are you asking about like a form of possession so to speak like what set of motivations are positing this question and what set of motivations are offering the answer no see that's that's the thing i mean i could if i was doing sort of a phenomenological analysis for scientific reasons and i do do that but in this practice what i'm trying to do is to get at aoria to get at genuinely not knowing what nicholas ofua called learned ignorance which is what socrates started with he said my wisdom consists in knowing what i do not know i call it a an aporetic aperture what happens is you get a sense of actually i don't know who's listening what'll happen is images will come up yeah that's what i was wondering right and but then when you go is yes and those are helpful images but that is i can just as easily ask what generated the image yeah and what you get is right you get you get this falling away and you get a very profound and frequently disturbing sense of actually deeply not knowing but it's not a not knowing in the sense that you're you're you're disconnected from the depths if i can use that language it's a not knowing that precisely connects you deeper and deeper to the depths and then okay so do you think by doing that that you're are you attempting to circumvent what might be regarded as narrowly self-serving biases in questioning or answering yes okay and you're doing that by attempting to establish a relationship with what's ineffable at the base instead of stalling out let's say part way down yes but but it's nothing i can have it's only something i can participate in it's only something i can be i can't have it right i can't ever it's like james's distinction between between the eye and the me which you're familiar with i i i can never have the eye i can be eye because i can only be aware of i can only have the me it's the same kind of thing there's a no thingness to it but even saying no thingness sounds like you're putting a name on an entity what happens instead is a falling away of representational reification of any attempt to rify things by representing them and what you get is you get in a completely non-inflationary way because i'm cognizant of who i'm talking to you get that nothing is excluded but nothing is enclosed within and without and there is no within and without you get to this right now so what's been the practical consequences of that practice for you the practical consequences of that is a abiding sense that becomes more and more capable of intervening in my everyday consciousness and cognition of that epistemic and moral at least that's what i believe is happening what people are telling me humility yeah well you when i when i saw you today and started talking to you i thought three things i thought you look more resigned you look more hopeful and you look more humble well thank you yeah yeah well i don't know what it is exactly well your expression maybe and your voice tone like and i mean it's not a dramatic shift from the last time i saw you but but it's a shift in the direction that you just described and the resignation is interesting cuz i think that's that's a sign of faith and a sign of humility you know and it's not people often think of resignation as pessimistic but it doesn't like i think of resolution i ed to because of the double senses of the word of coming properly into view like when you resolve an image but also i am resolved um this i am being called to this pilgrimage on walking the philosophical silk road i this is my pilgrimage to the god beyond god i am making myself as available as i possibly can to that to that and so okay okay so i mean go ahead well i mean we mentioned baptism a little earlier and i was writing about the descent of the holy ghost in the gospels so that's when christ's ministry starts so it's an opening of the sory that you described it's an opening to possession by this ultimate ineffability and there's a consequence of that and that's the descent of the holy spirit and so that descent we talked earlier about and and you helped me characterize too in in different language what that ineffable spirit how it might make itself manifest i talked about the interplay between conscious and calling and you talked about you talked about love and you talked about the axiological and there was one other dimension sort of logical transformative the healing okay so imagine now you open yourself up to that okay so that's when christ's ministry starts but here's something very interesting and weird and i'm interested in your take on this as soon as the baptism ends christ goes into the desert yes okay so now what that indicates is a radical transformation of personality so what was there before has i wouldn't say it's been planted but that leaves a a desert emptiness that's a good way of thinking about it now so christ goes out into the desert it's like the israelites leaving theic 40 days tyranny okay so now he's in the desert and that parallels the is israelite desert and then he goes to the bottom of things so you can imagine this is a colloquy with conscience that's a good way of thinking about it so imagine that you did something wrong and you decided that you were going to delve into the depths to understand exactly why it was that you set yourself up for that and that you were willing to go wherever the spirit called you to delve into the underst structure of that error so i think that's what happens i think that's what's being presented in the sequence of temptations that arises in the desert so imagine you go into the landscape of the soul and then you go down the dependency hierarchy to the point from which evil emerges that's a good way of thinking about it it parallels the notion in dante's inferno yes right cuz dante's inferno is a set of conent inferno what's that i'm reading the inferno oh okay okay so it's a journey so my sense with the inferno is you could take any given proximal and trivial sin and delve into it and end up at the bottom and what what dante presents is that the meta sin the sin upon which all others emerges is something like betrayal right because it violates trust yeah i mean for me it's it's betrayal but of the ultimate that is also idolatry because all of the sins are are are are versions of idolatry about loving something in place of loving god right that's a tower of babel problem too yes yes right and so and this is tk's notion tk's notion is what we're trying to do is we're trying to bring an ultimate concern to and have it properly conformed to what is most ultimate and this is the quest for the god beyond the god of theism but i i see that tunneling down i mean that i do other practices i do a spiritual alchemy practice in which you you try to recall moments of profound hurt and humiliation because those are the moments where you get the falsification of the pretentious projections that you make the pretentions to know and to control both within and with without and in those moments of hurt and humiliation you so indicate profound indications of error and presumption yes yes exactly exactly so they remove the prese they they give you now what you try to do is you try to bring agape to bear on them neither pride nor guilt so that you can you can you can turn away from the super salience of the pain and get the revelation humiliation right and get the revelation though of ab but look there's an aperture here there's a glimpse of how things are outside of the pretense and the presumption and then what you're trying to do is smelt that and bring see i think that's the same thing as the father who's trapped in the belly of the beast oh i i think so and this happens to jonah you know when jonah descends into the depths and the consequence of that is his radical revaluation of his ethical stance and his reemergence as a prophet right but he goes all the way down to the bottom of things he does that interestingly enough because he tries to escape both his calling and his conscience yes right cu god well god tells him to do something stupidly impossible and dangerous and he basically says yeah i don't think so i've always been fascinated by that story of course melville makes a lot of it in in moby dick there's a moment in that story that i find particularly compelling and one of the things i like about the bible is it will have these little moments of very powerful humanity in the mix of wrestling with the numinous if you remember the story they come to jonah the sailors and say what's going on and he says well you know blah blah blah blah and god's punishing me and they don't immediately throw more they go back and they try to save his save yeah and i thought yeah what's what's going on there that's such a powerful moment and for me right they only throw them overboard when there's nothing left to do they try everything they can they exhaust their human capacity in the pursuit of this stranger right and and it's guilty stranger by his own admission right and and it would be so easy to be self-righteous and just well yeah and throw overboard and witness the miracle and they put all of that aside for this and and like and it's often for me i mean i i i am often like everyone else i mean especially coming to the christmas season i impressed by the impressive moments of the the go of the bible but but even even that i mean you think about elijah right after he has the you know he defeats the prophets of ball on mount carmel and the fire l fire from heaven all and then he flees into the desert and then god you know says come i'm going to show you something and there's the big fire and but god's not in the fire and the big wind and god's that's the that's conscience there right the the the still small voice within or or it sometimes even trans it's also can be translated as a sheer silence it's like it can be translated that way also in the hebrew and and so it's it's almost like what we were talking about before that that i love this idea of the sence because it's the ineffable but not as negativity but as superlative as that which is calling you because what does he do he he covers his face in the right he look he beholds these other do you think there's any difference between the valid voice of conscience and the voice of the ineffable i mean you can if the ineffable is the foundation and if conscience is a sign of transgression against it then those things should be related well see here's the problem and this is a this is a problem that goes back that i have with dayart dayart i mean and this is a standard philosophical trope so i'm not claiming any originality here but daveart seems to get bunged up on the difference between a psychological and logical indubitability right he gets the things that he can't doubt and he then concludes that they're ontologically certain and of course our inability to doubt can be driven by many things other than metaphysical necessity they can be driven by all kinds of psychologic issues self-deception issues demons of various sorts yeah yes and so and and of course everybody made continual philosophical hay out out of that and i worry also because this comes up in plato plato's private problem about what actually turns people towards the good because of the problem of el sobies and i don't trust any maybe let me try a different word in i don't idolize any any one of my faculties i think my conscience can also be something that was driven into me perhaps by aspects of my culture my parents that's the pathological super ego problem and i suffer from a sadistic super ego in a lot of ways and so in in pinocchio the puppet has to establish a relationship with the conscience and it transforms as well yes right so it's not an uniring divine voice from the outset it's it's something like a generic approximation that can air and a a tyrannical great father within would be an example of that right and i think part of the socratic project and how it's unfolded for me often in a psychologically startling way is to try and enter into a dialogical relationship with my conscience with my consciousness with my character and that for me is one of the great benefits of the socratic way of life when they came to antiy that part testing the spirits i think so i mean so socrates had a demonium yeah right he had his divine sign and and he said he always listened to right right he relied on that in his trial in the apology and said that that was the thing that made him different than other men now what's interesting and many people have said about this about it um especially in what's called third way scholarship platonic scholarship socrates both trusts it and always comes up with an argument around it he never does one or the other and while we see them as oppositional he somehow saw them as deeply dialogical yeah dialogical and convergent with each other and see when i was uh when i've been in this journey and i was in the midst of doing ifs i had a very powerful i talk about this in my after socrates experience i had a i had i i don't know how familiar you are with ifs internal family systems where you do parts work so what's going on right now is this huge convergence within the psychother psychotherapeutic domain of biological models of the self- diic practices and i was in the middle of doing parts work and i was working with a part what would that mean practically what were you doing exactly so what happens is you what you'll when you notice that you're sort of possessed by by something you try and step back your mother your father an ancestral spirit fragment yeah and you try and step back into well schwarz calls it the the the seed of the self but i don't think that's quite right but what you try is you try and step back into that more sage likee awareness right so you're going deeper or higher yeah yeah and then what you do is you try to and you you don't demonize this part you try and enter into a dialogue you realize that it is guarding something this is it's it's it has some adaptive functionality mh now this is my take not necessarily his but i think what what you do is you bring sort of a a a mirror of agency or self-reflectiveness to this part you act like a mindfulness mirror to it you dialogue and you get it you get to say well oh well what you try and get it to explicate its normativity what how what's actually governing and guiding it and then you get to and then you get you call you help it develop that way yes and you call it and then you become socratic with it you call it to but how much part are you following the the normativity that you're enforcing on me yeah and what will happen frequently is it will relax and open because it's being listened to it's being listen to and it's also realized that there's an opportunity here for for growth and of course this overlaps with a lot of so you recommended naming those things oh you do you name them you name them but something happened and and and you'll probably see a very union thing in this and like i said this is difficult for me to talk about but i did talk about it already public and after socrates and i trust hell of a thing for an introvert to do yes so i was in the middle of one of these sessions and an archetypal presence came in and pushed aside all the parts and said no you're going to listen to me and who are you said i'm hermes oh yeah the god of interpretation the god of meaning making this is you have little wing slippers on in a little bit well no he was it was he messenger wing messenger of the gods he yeah he appeared he he very much had that presence of of like of a psychop pp and and when you mean it when you say appeared what was the phenomenology what was happen the phenomenology is like the phenomenology of the presence of a mind like i have a sense of i have a mindsight into your awareness now what's interesting about these things and this is again my take not the ifs people although i've talked to mark lewis at length about this and he thinks it's a good take i think of these entities as neither subjective nor objective i think of them transc and i think is in the domain of relevance and relevance is neither objective nor subjective but what binds them together right he's binding the inner and the outer the upper and the lower and all of that together and and so it's the sense of a presence but it's it's like what charles stang talks about the divine double it's both you and not you kind of like the way conscience is but it has a it h it right i mean and so i have an ongoing dialogue with hermes it's very much is this some is this a presence that you visualized how how do you know of its appearance i've had only one sort of vision of what was the vision like the vision was very m well i've had the vision was very much what i later very much like sort of micah l the archangel which is very interesting and then i've had one of sort of tho from egypt and hanuman from the viic tradition as well as hermes the from the greek tradition and they they've they in the ancient literature they're often seen as corresponding to each other in some fashion you understand i'm chatting on this very okay so what was the consequence of the appearance of this superordinate spirit arguably superordinate spirit in the presence of this domain of chaos well one i mean it it made it very clear to me that it i don't want to say it anymore he wanted to make it very clear that um there was a dialogical relationship that needed to be developed and cultivated and it would be a relationship by which i would cultivate something analogous to socrates demonium that was the promise that was given oh oh that's a good deal i think so well it's dangerous but so is everything else yeah excellent things are rare or we wouldn't pursue them as spinosa said or we would all pursue them as spinosa said so i found raph's work on ally work and i've talked to a bunch of people that have you know the kind of practices you can do to enter into this anderson taught a friend of mine very helpful around this and so what became very apparent was that that this demonium and the way of i i've internalized socrates as a sage were very allied to each other because socrates also portrayed himself as being maxu being between the human and the divine and then to to get to the deep answer to this this all started to psycho dynamically integrate with the intellectual philos opical realization of the platonic proposal that human beings are supposed to always hold in tonos creative tension nicholas of kuza heraclitus our finitude and our transcendence if we only hold on to our finitude we fall prey to servitude and despair if we only hold on to our transcendence we fall prey to hubris and inflation but if we can hold the two together if we are the maxu between the beast and the god right we can properly realize our humanity and this is what socrates sees himself this is how he portrays aos this is how he portrays the task of philosophia and so for me that socratic spirit and hermes as a psychological biological presence have become integrated together so that's that's that's quite a trip well i mean that's very much like it's very much the conscious equivalent of a dream it's like a dream yeah but what's intriguing is the platonic socratic possibility of it being filled as much with logos as it is with mythos that there is also as much because when i when i dialogue i write out dialogues with hermes yeah it's very much at at times it's very much like encountering an archetypal figure there's all this have you read the red book i've read parts of it because it's what you're talking about is quite reminiscent of what of the sorts of exercises that yung over undertook well what what you find out is this is also deeply reminiscent of a lot of theurgic practices that were going on in the neoplatonic tradition as i've come to discuss and then get taken up into eastern orthodox christianity by dionis and gregory shaw has done some excellent scholarship showing that so let let okay let me but i just want to make clear that there is a lot of rationality in this discourse where i don't mean sort of cartisian logicality i mean the calling to the full person recognition and responsibility towards the ongoing proclivity to self-deception and trying to comprehensively address it and seek systematic it's a deole and and and to and it's not there's something mysterious about it in marcel's sense if you ever think you've got a full phenomenological grasp on the engine of self-deception within you you of course have fallen prey to one of the deepest forms of self-deception so whenever you think you frame it you have to not idolize this is tiic again you have to not idolize that framing you have to constantly it has to be constantly open to self-correction yeah well the opposite of self-deception is probably something like the constant openness to self-correction rather than a stance per se i was de now i have the truth it's like no there's a process by which you continually discover the truth and allegiance to that is the opposite of self so that's what my i would call my faith my faith is a faithfulness to a process of self-correction not to any one faculty as the voice of the divine i think the capacity for the self correction to take on a life of its own and a life on its own that plugs into transpersonal and transc of aspects of my being for me that is better i'm very impressed that you managed to bring all of that back to the point where it started by the way so i would say in relationship to that that first of all that i agree that that in fact the eye that's at the top of the pyramid let's say the eye of horus that's at the pinnacle of the pyramid is a representation as far as i'm concerned of the aware attention that allows for continual self-correction and part of the implication of the ancient egyptian theology is that nothing should be put higher on the higher up in the pyramid of value than the thing that's gold at the top that's associated with the open eye that's right watch and attend and and in that spirit of you said guilt free there was two criteria you had free of guilt and free of pride pride yes just apprehension of what's there in front of your this is christ says something like this too this is in the gospel of thomas though he says the kingdom of god is spread upon the earth but men either do not or will not see it the will not being the more interesting one as far as i'm concerned and part of that organization of the psychological hierarchy to put the the ey not the letter i but the ey on top is to prioritize that ne neutral isn't exactly right it's an attention that's oriented towards the highest ineffable good to put that above everything else now i would say that i wasn't trying to reduce that to conscience and calling i didn't think you were okay okay i i was thinking about those as what would you call they're part of the dynamic process of attention that allows the attention per se to rise to the top so because i could pay attention careful attention to how it is that i'm calling myself out let's say in a socratic manner because you also are granted the right to the presumption of innocence right so even if you're accused yourself it's perfectly reasonable to set up a defense but there's a starting point with the prodding of conscience if conscience prods you two questions come up one is i'm falling prey to an internal tyranny the other is i'm wrong well you need to figure out which of those two is right you can do that dialogically you can do that in conversation with someone as well and calling is the same thing i would say is that a calling can emerge as a consequence of your possession by a particular ideological spirit or it can be a manifestation of the real thing and like it's up to you to tread very carefully to make sure you get those right and then the dynamic interplay of those two things is even more reliable probably especially if you share it with other people there's a i've been thinking about the exodus story of the burning bush in terms of calling and i think it maps very nicely onto our discussion of depth because and you tell me what you think about this so when moses encounters the burning bush things are actually not going so bad for him now he's escaped from egypt so he's freed himself from tyranny and now he's got himself two young wives and he's doing pretty well with his father-in-law who he gets along with and he's a shepherd and so it's not like he's no longer an egyptian aristocrat but you know all things considered he has a perfectly stable and productive ordinary life now he's wandering around and it's near mount si by the way which is the place where the divine and the proximal meat and this thing glimmers and catches his attention it's like a manifestation of hermes yes and so he decides to step off the beaten track as a consequence of this calling and invitation and he moves closer and closer to this manifestation of the sublime and as he moves closer he starts to understand that he's on sacred ground and i don't think there's anything different than that than than noting what it is that calls to you and then pursuing it and going down into the depths as a consequence and eventually what happens to moses because he continues his pursuit is that the voice of being itself speaks to him and that's when he's also transformed into the kind of leader who can fight tyranny and slavery so that's excellent that's why it's moses and elijah by the way i think that end up at the transfiguration because you have elijah as the well they also both the they both encounter the fire of god they they're both they both but but they're interesting parallels because it's elijah who's the first proponent of the notion that god is not an external phenomenon associated with the natural world associated with b but this internal voice and its conscience for elijah and then for moses the god that he encounters seems to be the god of calling and so and they they're like on what would you say one on each side of christ which is you know mindboggling narrative representation there's a lot i want to talk to you but let me try one thing because it there there's a there's i want to circle back to the question of sacred and and god and the god beyond god so so one of the things that i find interesting in the fire of course is the it it it burns but it does not burn up right and so this goes towards a neoplatonic model too and of course plato is it's the sun the image of the sun but it's the same thing the fire that burns and is not burnt up at least in greek mythology and heraclitus said that the cosmos was that too what am i getting at i'm getting at this notion all those associations cu i'm associating the long-standing association of fire and logos by the way they're associated together so the sacred also seems we've been talking a lot about the serological and the axiological and the ultimate but i want to return to something that i think binds them together which is the the neoplatonic notion of the sacred as inexhaustible fountain of intelligibility so the that never runs dry the tow right yes the da right absolutely and and let me give you a concrete experience of that i i i i i'm going to assume given what you've said that this is the case for you in the gospels i have a different relationship with the bible we can perhaps talk about that but for me the republic does this for me plato's republic i will read the republic and it's inevitably transformative there's a reciprocal opening i see something in the text i haven't seen it opens me up i go into to my life my lo my life opens up i'm transformed i come back after a bit and i read the text and it opens itself up again to me and i and it's inexhaustible there's this inexhaustible fountain and so there's some sacredness in there i think this is you know this is the present the the the opportunity to enter into a conformity with the good with the one right and so i for me there's a positive in this u in the experience of the sacred and the reason i want to do that is i want to complement and i use that word exactly complement you know the call and the conscience with also this notion of of being fed of being nourished i'm doing i'm reading a book on lexio deina by what's his name the latter of the monks and he he talks about when you're reading the text and you're you're actually being nourished by it and of course there's the mana from heaven all that stuff and and of course you can't grasp it because if you try and grasp it and store it you'll lose it and all that sort of blakean stuff that's there and so i want to this this idea also of a fountain an inexhaustible fountain of intelligibility and if neoplatonism is right and i think philosophy at least some philosophy and a lot of philosophy of physics and of biology is pointing towards to which is that there is a non-logical oneness between intelligibility and being the way we get at what most real is we we we trace out the asymmetric dependence relationships of intelligibility that's based on a faith in parmen proposal that somehow thinking and being are one they're not identical but they're one in some because if they're if they're fundamentally not conformable we are bound into skep something richard dawkins said an adapted organism is by necessity a microcosm of its environment yes and friston has said this we don't have models we are models and i i've made similar arguments based on the stunning work of katherine pix and others for extended naturalism but we can perhaps come back to that in a sec so let me let me because i've been thinking about this and and there's a concern for idolatry here and i think you're in many ways maybe the perfect person to talk to about this so i'm going to say something and then give me a moment around it y i find plato's republic and i find let's say my relationship to my beloved partner we made a lifetime commitment to each other right there's something sacred there in that i continue i i've come to realize i will never sound her depths completely and right and there's a way in which that's a good deal yeah it is a good deal and i have i've made a lot of horrible mistakes to get there and appreciative for those errors and for the people that actually hurt me in some ways because they that hurting was a sensitivity that allowed me to see her first person i fell in love with their soul before i fell in love with their physical beauty that's a good order i'm not responsible for it i just happen but you can be responsible for being grateful for it i am i am continually grateful yeah well that's a good deal too so now why am i bringing this up i think these things are properly sacred but i don't think while while they are symbols in the yian toian sense they are not themselves the one they are not the ultimate and so i am i'm just i'm going to talk about a practice i've adopted so i'm not advocating for this as a metaphysical proposal but i've been using the term the one or god for when we experience ultimacy as sacred not just something pointing to the but ultimacy itself and and that we so so that's a very restricted usage and careful it is it's careful because you again the concern is the concern defense against idolatry too idolatry yes that's the concern is the concern for idolatry and the and but there also the zen concern of ultimately not being bound to your representations but realize they have an ongoing as a like asymmetric toting towards reality right and that you so like this the cohen is right is the commitment to no matter what i'll do my thought will have representation but i'm always trying to push towards that which low is below rep representation all my work on relevance realization helps me because that's much lower than the level of representation much more prim right right so i wanted to i wanted to put those two things together in a that's meaning as the ultimate instinct yeah whereas what if what we mean by meaning is religio if we mean to be connected to something that has a reality and a value beyond my existence that's that nourishing aspect that's the nourishing aspect but it's it's interesting because what happens is once we are well at least what seems to be happening for me and what i read in in the texts i'm reading is once we get a certain degree of nourishment we are more and more capable of because we're primate mammals of turning the arrow of relevance outward agapic right not how are things relevant to me but ultimately how i can be relevant to them the meaning in life literature this is how you find out if people have meaning in life what do you want to exist even if you don't and how much of a difference do you make to it now you have a good answer to both of those you've got say them again what do you want to exist even if you don't yeah and how much of a difference do you make to it now yeah and that's that's not brought those down yeah so i think the only do you have an answer to those yes would you share them so for me my religio to the sacred realization of ultimacy is that that gives me those the answers and so all of the projects that i'm engaged in that that help people for themselves not for me but for themselves either individually and collectively realize that that gives me a sense of meaning in life and what are you doing about that would you say those are the proximal actions that are imbued with meaning by that transcendent goal yes so i mean a big part of it is all the work i'm doing with and for the verveacu foundation new series but also the academic work i'm doing all of my academic scientific work about intell and rationality i've just recently been integrated the relevance realization and the predictive processing framework in a lot in a way that a lot of people are finding very valuable all of that has i i think i think it's fair to say because other people are saying it to me it has scientific merit i'm happy about that but it's all oriented towards this what i've i've pointed because for me it's not just the call away from self-deception the call of conscience it's it's the call it's the calling to a fullness which isn't a completion it's it's that it's that sense of religio that meaning in life that so that i'm and i feel that i have experiences of what is ultimate as as sacredness experiences experiences of sac things that are calling the whole of me to a commitment right and that's the genuine answer to the problem of relevance realization and the meaning crisis to find out what's actually meaningful so let let me offer you something in relation okay so i talked to sam harris recently again and one of the places that sam and i find firm mutual ground is in a concern metaphysical concern with evil so sam was really struck to the soul i would say by the reality of evil associated in his case particularly with what happened in owitz and places like that so sam is metaphysically convinced of the existence of evil and that's been an orienting point for him and part of the reason that he wanted to ground his ethical metaphysics in objective science was because he didn't feel that there was a better way of demonstrating the reality of good in relationship to evil unless that grounding was possible now i've been thinking about that as i've been writing what i'm writing but i took a different tack i would say to some degree than sam even though maybe the net end goal is the same as it was by the way for pj because that was his project right right from the beginning so because pj wanted to reconcile materialism with metaphysics and so in any case i've been thinking a fair bit about what's real in terms of meaning and one of the people have very little doubt that pain is real they certainly act as if it's real you can't it's very difficult not to act as if pain is real and one of the consequences of that realization is that you can therefore very rapidly claim that whatever rectifies pain most effectively is even more real and then you might ask what rectifies pain most effectively and so here's a couple of here's something not to do think about your a lot your your proximal immediate demands and needs so you know that relationship between narrow self-consciousness and suffering is so high that they load on the same factor in fact factor analytic studies of negative emotion so if you're self-conscious that narrow self you are miserable this is what i meant just one small intervention that i'll let you go this is what i meant about this is plato's pivot problem how do you involve all of the psyche without becoming self- involved in that narrow that n narrow pain you know self-inflicting suffering loss of agency on this is plato's thing about how do because we need to involve all of you this is till too that's his definition of spirit that which involves the whole of the psyche but how do you get all of that involved with while resisting the magnetism maybe it's also partly by realizing that it's not only all of the psyche it's all of the psyche embedded in the whole structure of being simultaneously right this is part of the reason that our current conceptualizations of mental health suffer from such a posi of content of of conceptualization because we view mental health as something like harmony in the subjective world but that's like you're talking about the mysteries of your relationship i mean it's obvious from talking to you that part of the reason that you're as sane as you are and as happy as you are is not because immediately because you're well constituted as a subjective creature but because you've established a harmony of existence in relationship at least to one other person you want that more broadly and that means that you have to be called to service for something that's certainly not localized to the like narrowness of you now yes be okay because your phenomenological markers subjective well-being don't track meaning in life they come apart they can move they can move opposite to each other this is what happens when you have what happens to job well but it's also what happens when if you have a child and you and you enter into committed all of your measures of subjective well-being collapse and if you ask people why they do it and they're giving you a healthy answer not they fell into it or they ir responsible but they've chosen parenthood yeah and and and and and they're going through what la paul calls a transformative experience something you can't understand until you go through it so very much right this this act of faithfulness right what happens is why they do it is because they say it makes their life more meaningful because they're connected to something that has a reality beyond there beyond the immediate yes and beyond subjective self-report right and they and and it's an entity they want to exist even if they don't in fact they're willing to sacrifice their life for it right and right they feel that they make a difference to it this is the agapic concern their love is person not morally person i mean cognitive person it's creative of i mean when you bring a child home they're obviously a moral person i'm not talking moral but they're not a cognitive person and this we we get to partake in this miracle like we we we shine agape on them which isn't aos which isn't fia all right that's not your friend it's not something you want to be one with in fact the project is the opposite you're trying to make it autonomous from you right right a major sacrifice yes it's agape and and and and it's just an astonishing thing it's like it's like magic so one of the things i figured out by going through the book of job is allied with what you just described so there's a moral proposition in job that has to do with the segregation between immediate subjective well-being let's say and long-term meaning so job's proposition is so he's things fall apart very badly for job right yes and we know he's a good man because that's stated right at the beginning right that's axiomatic okay but his friends attribute blame to him and he basically says well yeah i'm sinful but no better than the no worse than the typical good man and so you can't just dump all this at my feet i'm not going to take myself apart in the face of my misery and decimate my soul in addition to my suffering and then his wife says well shake your fist at god and die and job says well i have some reason to do that given the tragedies that have befallen me but at minimum i'm going to suspend judgment and better than that i'm going to retain my faith in the essential goodness of existence regardless of the proximal evidence and then there's a deeper consideration in job which is you're called upon to do that no matter what and that is definitely a place where measures of say subjective well-being and ultimate meaning are going to separate because the moral impetus in the book of job is that you're called to maintain your allegiance with what is highest no matter what proximal price you currently might be paying and then you can even think about that practically which i think is a useful thing to do it's like if you're stricken with a terminal and painful disease let's say and maybe coincidentally a series of financial catastrophes just to make it a little bit worse and maybe your family's also dumping heaps of coal on your head you have every reason to descend into a kind of nihilistic bitterness but then you might say well to what end now you have your illness you have your financial catastrophe you have your moral culpability and you have your bitter nihilism to contend with the one thing you do have if you're fortunate and i would say also god willing that it is in the face of multiple dimensions of simultaneous catastrophy the refusal to take the path of nihilistic bitterness and to shake your fist at the world and that's not nothing you know maybe that wouldn't be enough to rescue you from the dire states that you're in but it might be enough to stop you from sending to the ultimate possible hell i really love talking with you i i i want to respond because um i i want to talk about my take on job and how when i finally got job was i was actually watching a tom hanks movie called joob versus the volcano which is a very silly movie it's a farce but it's a guy who discovers he's only got a year to live and he goes on the proverbial last great journey and of course it becomes a quest and he doesn't realize it there's a scene where he he's shipwrecked and he's on a raft made of luggage and there's a girl that he's taking care of and she's unconscious and he's giving her the last remaining water so he's starting to suffer from exposure and so he's by all measures of to dtive well-being he's at the worst he's literally lost he's a drift he's cast away he's suffering physically the one person he's with is unconscious and he's caring for them and they're not they're not capable of reciprocating at all it's very powerful image i don't know how this scene got in this movie i think the staff writers went on lunch break and g they gave the intern a moment to to write a thing and then what happens is and it's astonishing well done there's a moonrise and it's the moon illusion and the music swells and he o calm ocean and he struggles and he rises to his feet and he opens his arms and he says oh god whose name i do not know thank you for my life i had forgotten how and he struggles and it's not the right word but he just spits it out how big thank you for my life none of his problems have been solved and what i what what i took from that is what happens at the end of job when god appears and starts showing job all these astonishing things and he's saying and god and god is don't forget about the wonder of the world well and also the numinous the numinous oh that's interesting right and the and the numinous and what the numinous says even in even in its monstrous forms yes even in the they speak of transcendence and god is saying i am that presence that goes to the very depth of the numinous both the happy forms and the and and this is supposed to be the thing that is the answer right right and go job does reattain his fortune in the aftermath of that encounter and and what happens with joe is he he he gets gratitude for his life i may steal that put it in my book well and i'll tribute you well thank you now what what that speaks to me is that there are these three things and this i think has to do with the transcendentals the true and the good and beautiful they're all convertible but they're also not reducible they're not logically identical to each other and i think one and these three leo and i talked about this in the the article we wrote on wisdom one is kind of sensory motor mastery if you don't have sort of sensory motor mastery over your environment if you're not be if you're not solving the frisian problems of relevance realization and anticipation you're you're just b with anxiety your life's going okay so there's that but then there's the excellent work by susan wolf and others and this really is something that our society is not well set up to reflect upon right now is that meaning in life and morality you can't reduce one to the other okay okay so she gives the she gives many examples of well you know double dissociation means you can't make an identity claim right is it possible for somebody to leave a very highly moral existence and yet have a life that it's not going to be absolutely lacking in meaning because that's impossible for human existence but it's very a life that's not very meaningful by many measures and she says yes consider the very real possibility of somebody who is leading a very moral life but is very lonely their lives there's nothing that they're doing that's especially imoral maybe they're very honest maybe could happen to a good person in a totalitarian state many things yes and their lives could be very bere right so there can be a dissociation and you can think of the other can we think of people who maybe had very powerful meaning in life and yet were leading highly immoral existences of course we can i mean they're thoroughly possessed those people yes so what you can see is just like subjective well-being and meaning and life come apart morality and meaning and what that does well it shows you at least to some degree that morality isn't reducible to emotional state well it also shows that meaning in life can't be satisfied also just by being a highly moral person you so that connectedness that we need it has sort of three dimensions to it one is the dimension of sensory motor mastery one is the production promotion protection of personhood that's what i take morality to be and the other is a connection what what do you mean i'm i'm confused a bit about that there's part of me that's objecting in the background here let's slow down and let's listen okay well just it's just that i'm not sure exactly what you mean by moral you know let let me give you an example something that came to mind so solit and talks in in the gag archipelago and i have to bring that up one once per podcast by necessity know about these intellectuals who are in a a camp being worked to death and they had a seminar that they would conduct once a week and they would all meet and they would talk about their specialty and they were com men committed to their scientific endeavor who had been imprisoned because of for ideological reasons and they took the opportunity to share what they loved and every week one or more of them would disappear right because they were dying now what they were engaged in was a moral endeavor you could say that the li the meaning of their life was pretty bitter at that point they were all starving to death or freezing to death or both being beaten at the low end of the totem pole in the gag hierarchy watching the people around them die but they were doing something profoundly ethical adhering to something they saw as a positive good acting morally and there would be a meaning in that like the the surround is pretty damn dismal but but they're getting together and do the seminars the seminars aren't a moral endeavor the seminars are a meaning endeavor what do you love what are you connected to what do you want what what do you want to exist even if you don't i don't know how to separate them the the fact of the action oriented towards that good and morality per se i i get your argument look i can certainly see the utility in dissociating emotional state especially proximal emotional state from me as such or purpose i mean delay of gratification is that fundamentally but but i'm i'm i'm still struggling with no but perhaps let me suggest something back so i'm using morality the way i think wolf is using it the way that it's you been used sort of post enlightenment postc which is your commitment to a sense of duty born from something like the categorical imperative okay okay i see you're talking i think a platonic notion ofs right right where we talking about human flourishing now interestingly enough kant goes on to argue that if you do something out of love then it is expressly not a moral act because if you're doing it for anything other than the sense of duty right well he's hyper conscientious well so do you think that that's the morality that christ is pointing to in the gospels where he states that unless your ethical striving exceed needs that characterizing the pharisees the hypocrites the scribes the academics the lawyers the legalistic types that it's not a true ethic at all and that the morality that you're describing that would be dissociable from meaning is more the hypocritical or or academic or legalistic type i i think totally i think okay that resolves the problem that that i was having i and i think paul wrestles with this and i think there's ways i'm critical of it when he's talking about law and love the two different things and so what i think happens in job and what i think happens in jo versus a volcano is job or joe perhaps job to joe recovers a gratitude for his life not because any of his moral in that in this other sense there is no proof that the world is just right all that's been happened is he has been opened to a connection a contact with what's numinous and that is sufficient i think that's what's also happening at the end so the reason why i bring this up is because my lab we're doing a lot of work on post-traumatic stress disorder and how it looks like a violation of the hyper prior of ajust world hypothesis right right and and what we're pursuing one of the things we're doing is we're seeing of meaning generating meaning in life generating not semantic meaning like the dialectic into theos practices that i right if they can restore people's sense of religio connectedness meaning in life yeah that helps heal them from the trauma without trying to argue them into that this is ultimately a just world see that's this is this is what i'm this is what i'm hoping for i'm hoping that these that's an experiential replacement for a logical argument in some ways and i and i think more it's more real than well one of the things that i always did with my clients in in therapy sometimes for post-traumatic stress reasons was this is where it's not cognitive it's like the first thing i would do often was a differential diagnosis let's say for people who are depressed okay so there's two part there's more than two but there's two possibilities okay one is that you're depressed the other is that you have a terrible life okay so let's take those apart do you have a partner do you have friends do you have family do you have a job do you have ed educational resources at hand you know are you embedded in a structure of meaning a multi-dimensional structure of meaning where you find purchase and if the answer to all those questions is no and sometimes that is the answer then you're not depressed yeah like you might be sad and guilt-stricken and lonely and anxious and show all the symptoms of depression but your fundamental problem is that well you have nothing now you can take someone who's completely different in that you can and you find people like this they're doing fine in all those evaluations dimensions of evaluation and they're depressed i found by the way that those were often people who responded well to an anti-depressant right because their depression wasn't a consequence of the failure of these embedded structures that you described now if you're dealing with someone who who has a terrible life that's when you do that's when you revert to the level of behavior it's like okay well why don't we see if we can make you a friend and then we can evaluate the consequences of that we got 50 things here to work on we can work on one of them and see if that produces a concrete difference has very little to do with cognitive restructuring except in so far as the person might have to restructure their cognitions terrible cliche written phrase to allow themselves to risk attempting to make a friend of course right but but it i i see the the same thing working quite well in the treatment of something like post-traumatic stress disorder it's like well you don't want to retool your explicit representation of the world necessarily but you want to you might want to see if you can expand the discovery of true intrinsic meaning within your life the other thing that that's often recommended by behavioral therapists is that say if you're having someone track their moods if they're depressed across a week they do that every 2 hours and then you see variability even though they may say they're depressed all the time there's usually variability well one of the things you find out is okay what were you doing when you were worse and what were you doing when you were better and could we have you do a little less of what you were doing when you were worse and a little more of what you were doing that's an empirical collaborative empiricism essentially is how is how that's described that's very powerful i found those behavioral techniques generally much more powerful than any mere cognitive real evaluation not always but but often well i yeah i i mean i i would say that that's because ultimately for e cogi is right cognitions embodied embedded enacted and extended and the propositional knowing is sitting on top of the procedural the perspectival and the participatory and you have to bring oh you know that's actually one of the primary things i wanted to talk to you about today maybe we'll do that on the daily wire side because we have another half an hour okay let's do that so for those of you who are watching and listening you can join us on the daily wire side we're going to continue this conversation but in a pretty targeted direction i want to talk to john about the embedding of explicit knowledge the kind of knowledge you can communicate verbally let's say in other systems of representation and memory because it sounds like we're dovetailing with regards to the way we're theorizing about this so if you want to join us i also want to talk to john about the academic reception of his work and his sense of his impact in the broader public sphere so we'll do that on the daily wire plus side i think we came to a good ending point otherwise for this discussion even though i just soon keep talking to you like for the next week but we'll do it again in the not too distant future like that so yeah yeah and so for everybody watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention and to the daily wire people for making this possible that's much appreciated the film crew here and john thank you happy new year to you happy new year to youo really good to see you man yeah good to see so join us on the dailywire plus side if you're [music] inclined
