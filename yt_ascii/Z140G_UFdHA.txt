back in my day we had to write resumes and cover 
letters buy this thing called a pen and paper   back in my day we use chat gbt all right although i'm joking for the most 
part in that intro there is some truth to   it we've come a long way very quickly and 
as text moving so quickly there are so many   new tools that will really help make the job 
hunting process so much easier land a better   job higher salary and all that and that's what 
we are going to cover today before we do though   make sure to hit that subscribe button for 
more tech coding career related videos and   any questions or other tools that you have 
leave in the comments let's get into it now we're going to start with a platform or an ai 
tool that does pretty much all the heavy lifting   for you i'm sure i'm not alone when saying when 
you are starting to craft a resume a lot of times   we end up just sitting there with this blinking 
cursor staring at the screen for what it feels   like or maybe hours not knowing where to start 
that is where tools like the one i'm about to   show you can really come in i'm not saying get an 
ai to completely write your entire resume and then   ship it off to companies but what i do think this 
tool or tools like this can really do to help you   is give you a starting point so using this tool to 
start writing your resume or even do a rough draft   of it taking that and then modifying it yourself 
this is great for anyone who has what is it called   writer's block writer's block isn't necessarily 
a writer to begin with you know you're applying   for maybe a technical role or whatever role you're 
applying for and you're just staring at the screen   okay let me share with you about this tool all 
right you can see here on screen i have kick   resume up and the first thing it's going to do 
after you sign up is ask you a series of questions   so right now we have what's your name question 
tiff what was a recent job title software   developer and then you get to pick a template so 
let me zoom in here what template should we pick   i'm kind of gravitating towards the middle one 
let's pick the middle one here but also two as   you saw at the bottom there you could browse 
from other ones as well ai robots at work   better than me being at work all right so next up 
you can see here it literally will generate kind   of a template for you also too from there you can 
there are free aspects and then of course premium   aspects but honestly if you're job hunting and 
you need the help of setting up your resume   sign up and then not sign up when you don't 
need it anymore so we can see here add new   section there are different sections 
to choose from graphs references skills   etc etc personal information you can start filling 
that out adding a photo if you choose i'm not   really i don't add photos when i have the resume 
i don't know why i just not my my thing curious   to hear if you do though anyways overall this is 
a really great tool you can see examples of other   ones especially others that are close to what 
you are applying for software engineering team   software engineer yeah so that's really helpful 
as well this is for i believe an intern but you   still get the idea of what others have done 
for when they are applying to roles similar   to you anyways i linked all these tools down below 
none of these are sponsored i just wanted to share   some really cool ai tools with you and cake 
resume is definitely one of them all right so   now once we have our resume created with the help 
of ai but then also too with our own human touch   we gotta still have the human touch there time 
start applying for jobs and i know many of you   are looking for remote jobs i found this really 
cool ai tool that will help match you based on   the remote jobs that are best suited for you and 
the name of this tool is really cool very suitable   i must say for remote jobs it's actually called 
pajama jobs and all you need to do is upload your   resume and it will sift through all the different 
online job platforms and match you with the ones   it thinks is best let me show you all right so you 
can see here on screen this pajama jobs that i was   speaking about is actually by the same company kik 
resume that's why it has its logo there and that's   how i discovered pajama jobs so you don't need to 
use kik resume to build your resume in order to   use pajama jobs to find your perfect remote job 
but that's one way you can and for me for this   example because i built my resume with kick resume 
you can simply upload it through kik resume to   pajama jokes if that makes sense i'll link it down 
below i think i made it some more complicated than   it knew to be anyways once you are in pajama jobs 
it will ask you a series of questions questions   such as the salary you are looking for how senior 
you are where you are located even though it's all   remote jobs some remote jobs still want you to be 
located in a certain country and for this example   here's what it's put out for me so 87 remote jobs 
and you can see here if i scroll down it says the   salary the range of mid to senior full-time 
and all of that so it's pretty interesting it   takes from all of these different job platforms so 
you don't need to spend your time sifting through   them you can come here and start using them now 
once again like kik resume it's free and then   there's an upgraded version so this is just with 
the free version that's probably all i would do is   just use a free version have you been there when 
you are applying for jobs but nothing seems to   stick now this might be due to the market high 
competition many different factors but it also   might be due to the fact that ai is rejecting your 
resume yes you heard that right a lot of times   especially at bigger companies the first initial 
us at your resume isn't a human it's actually ai   it's looking for specific keywords throughout 
your resume and if your resume even if you   are the perfect fit for this role but it does not 
have these keywords specific to this job that you   are applying for you might miss out on it that's 
where this tool comes in handy it will actually   scan your resume give you a score a percentage 
of how accurate your resume is or how likely it   is to pass through the initial ai test and from 
there give you suggestions on how to modify it   this tool is called job scan and i've used it 
in the past before and it's really i love it i   think it's super user friendly and it gives really 
good tips about keywords you can implement let me   show you all right let's get into job scan i spoke 
about job scan in the past because it's actually   a tool i used when i was job hunting it's i mean 
i think i shared this earlier but i think it's a   really great tool so i'm not going to go into the 
actual tool itself there is you can upload your   resume for free and there are certain parts that 
you will get for free but like anything like any   tool there's always a paid version they need to 
make money too but you can definitely use a free   version that's all i did you can sign up and scan 
your resume so you can see here in their diagram   though what it will do is it will share with 
you the match rate and this is based on the job   or type of job you are looking for and then also 
too it will share with you different keywords to   include different kind of descriptions you 
can add and then also too it shares with you   specifically in your resume areas that are weak 
and areas that are really good so in this example   you can see here contact info not so good whereas 
education match is good now i want to do a little   caveat here just because a tool is telling you 
something isn't good doesn't mean it's not good   let's make that very clear here ai is going based 
on logical data it's not going on human ways of   thinking so the reality is maybe ai doesn't think 
your education is a successful match but it might   be or maybe it's not a successful match but that's 
okay so don't get too much up on these things it's   just a really great tool to help enhance you when 
you are job hunting okay i have a confession to   make one of the areas i am the most laziest in 
is cover letters actually to be totally candid   with you about a year ago when i was applying 
to jobs 99.9 of them asked for a cover letter   i don't think i did any cover letters which is 
really bad and this is why i'm confessing it to   you because we're friends but it's true honestly 
i should have and i probably would have you   know seen faster job results or job searches or 
interview whatever it was a good process knock on   wood knock on wood but at the end of the day cover 
letters are still really important and they are   needed and it really shows you when the extra mile 
when applying the reason i didn't do it is because   honestly i detest the idea of having to write 
a cover letter it just seems so i get writer's   blocked to a next the next level like i can't even 
think about writing a cover letter it just sounds   terrible but it's so important and it really shows 
that you want the extra mile so my biggest advice   and what i would do if i was job hunting all over 
again is use this ai tool to write my cover letter   for me then from there once again just like all 
these tools i would modify it to with the human   touch this tool i'm talking about is called 
coverdoc ai and i'm going to share with you   what it can do in a second here but it promotes 
and i think it's truly accurate in saying you can   write cover letters up to 10 times faster or in 
cases for people like me a hundred times faster   alright i have up on screen here cover doc ai 
and as i mentioned their whole mantra one of it   is is you can write personalized cover letters 
10 times faster or as i already mentioned 100   times faster if you are me let's watch this video 
here of the tool and kind of it in action actually   all right so we can see here create a cover 
letter and then from there take what you want   the title you want drop title company name they're 
getting very specific here about the jobs you're   literally taking the entire job description at 
this point copying it and pasting it into the job   description which is really great how customizable 
it can get all right let's see the output here cover letter request is in progress you'll get 
an email of a draft which you can then open up   it opens up in a google doc and there 
is your cover letter this is next level it's so handy i'm definitely going to use this 
in the future it's just super user friendly   you know it says 20 minutes per cover letter you 
can get started for free as well this is just   really great i would highly recommend checking 
this out it's something that you can use to   varying degrees but just to not have this writer's 
block and in turn not create a cover letter like   i did you cleaned up your resume you applied to 
many jobs and now you got some really exciting   interviews you thought the hard part was the first 
part with writing the resume applying to jobs no   no no no no if you're anything like me the most 
stressful part at the very least is the interview   not even the interview but it's leading up to 
the interview i should say it's the nerves the   anxiety the fear of failure especially when you 
were doing a technical interview that is where   tools that can really help you practice your 
interview skills both soft skills and technical   skills are key and of course there are tools 
that we are all familiar with especially from   the technical side such as leak code or different 
sites where you can practice algorithms however   if you are looking for a tool to kind of interview 
you if that makes sense like you're it's a two-way   conversation i would highly suggest checking out 
this tool it's called interview warm-up and it's   actually by google and there are different roles 
that you can select that it will interview you   for now there are still some that are missing i 
think there's a lot of key roles but still a ton   of key roles that are missing from this tool so 
what i would do if your role isn't there select   something that's similar because at the beginning 
of these interview warm-ups these tools or this   tool that it interviews you with it's a lot of 
personable questions which i think especially   if you are applying for a technical role we often 
kind of push off the tech the soft skill side and   focus so much on preparing for the technical side 
of the interview which is key of course but you   also need to put some thought and prepare to the 
soft skill side because if they are interviewing   you and for these questions you didn't prepare on 
the soft skill side you start freezing up they're   gonna be like well yeah they're a great coder but 
they don't have communication skills they don't   have team skills so this is a great tool for you 
let me show you all right this tool by google as   i mentioned interview warm up i've used in the 
past and it just even helps take out take me   from psyching myself out do you know what i mean 
like being able to practice the interview and just   feel more confident going into it if anything so 
you can see here let's go into start practicing and then from there you can say what field do you 
want to practice for so we have data analytics   e-commerce it project management ux cyber security 
in general so once again if your role or your   field is not here you can always go to general 
after five interview questions you can start   hi let's practice an interview what 
are you looking for in your next job okay i can't do this right now don't listen to 
me oh no it's gonna answer okay yeah you can   literally speak to it so what are you looking for 
in your next job you can click on answer with the   microphone and speak back this is so key i know it 
sounds so silly but the more you practice speaking   your answers out loud the better you will be 
during the interview process i can guarantee   this this is a free tool by google interview warm 
up go check it out all right i hope you found this   video useful and helpful and hopefully picked up 
some tips or tools that you can use for the next   time you are job hunting ai doesn't have to be 
this big scary thing that we put off using because   we think that it's going to take over 
our jobs or it's not as good you can   use it for snippets of your everyday 
life such as job hunting and still add   your personal touch your human touch
