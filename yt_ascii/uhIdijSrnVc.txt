[music] all right what's up mkbhd here and today it was a pretty exciting day today was apple's october event and really i'm just gonna call it their macbook pro event now of course i'm gonna try to stay neutral and measured about all this stuff i'm not about to just jump right in and say hey this is the greatest laptop ever made because it's very expensive and clearly it's not for everybody but for me as a as a final cut editor this was a laptop that i was waiting for the most this is the one that applies to me the most and my workflow and the stuff that i do here at the studio every week so i was excited for it so let's just go right through everything first of all they did open up the event it wasn't just macbook pros there was some audio stuff too so there's a new apple subscription service basically a lower tier of apple music through siri that's five bucks a month there's some new homepod mini colors and also there's a new third generation airpods so there's a new design that basically looks just like airpods pro but without the silicon tips and the noise cancellation and they have a new wider case with magsafe wireless charging and a longer battery life and they're 179 bucks definitely get subscribed to stay tuned for that full review and i get those in my hands here but then we got right to the good stuff right into the new apple silicon so the m1 chip which seems like pretty recent but we've had for a little while now was a pretty huge jump right from all the intel stuff that was in max before this was the first time we were getting apple silicon inside apple machines and all that integration gave us much better performance and much better efficiency in the macbook air and the macbook pro 13 in these imacs in the mac mini it was even in an ipad pro but after all that stuff came out all this baseline stuff is covered and it left us wondering when are we going to see the stuff at a pro level some higher end apple silicon for the really intense workflows because we still had intel chips in the higher end macbook pro and so we were looking for higher end aposilicon for the higher end bigger machines and so that's what we finally got we actually got two new chips there's m1 pro and m1 max yeah kind of cheesy names at first but they do make sense so this is the upgrade this is apple silicon unleashed you might say so the m1 pro chip has a 10 core cpu eight high performance with two high efficiency and a 16 core gpu with up to 32 gigs of ram which doesn't sound like a lot but keep in mind this is just the first tier pro chip same shared memory architecture still built on the five nanometer process but it's basically simply a physically scaled up m1 chip as expected and they're saying it will deliver 70 faster cpu performance and 100 faster gpu performance over the m1 the already really good m1 which was the head and shoulders over the intel chips that came before it which is pretty crazy but then now there's also m1 max which again scaled up even further and it's mostly in the gpu department so it's a bigger system on a chip look at the size of that chip and this time it's the same 10 core cpu but up to 3 32 cores of gpu and up to 64 gigs of shared memory so now you have four times the m1's graphic capability so this answers the question i first had when we first started getting m1 max which is okay those are replacing all the systems with integrated gpus but what about when they get to the bigger systems that have dedicated graphics cards are they going to continue to have dedicated graphics cards or will they build it all in and of course in the laptop world it makes sense for efficiency's sake to just build it all in so that's what they've done and that's where we see really impressive performance per watt numbers with m1 pro and m1 max so apple spent a healthy amount of time drawing graphs comparing these new chips to the m1 and to pcs and at least this time i think they heard a lot of talk about those old graphs this time they actually name drop the exact pc laptop they're comparing it to every time but yeah this is still a tough graph to draw any real world conclusions from basically i think what we're all gathering here is this is a really powerful really efficient set of chips at the high end significantly faster than any of the fastest intel macbook pros and with potential to still have really great battery life and so naturally that is when we switched from new silicon to unveiling the new hardware the new laptops the new 14 inch and 60 inch macbook pro with all of the like quite frankly too good to be true sounding rumors surrounding them which all turned out to be true which is kind of awesome so they basically went backwards on three years in a row of very questionable to bad hardware decisions and just said oh we've been listening you guys didn't like that so we fixed it so these redesigned laptops number one brought back magsafe a magnetic pin-based reversible charging connector on the side of the laptop safe beloved 67 or 96 watts on the 14 inch depending on if you have the baseline or the 10 core and 140 watts on the 16 inch for faster charging you can still charge via usbc if you want to though then they also got rid of the touch bar and put back real function keys at the top of the laptop full-size buttons too and there's a fingerprint touch id sensor on the top right hand corner you can see there as well and the whole keyboard is now in this black keyboard well which is it's subtle but it's a really nice touch i think it looks really good and then they also brought back ports real ports they added ports that they had previously removed from the macbook pros i don't know when the last time apple did this is but i'm happy to see it and it's funny because this was the this is the part of the event where they got really preachy and basically patted themselves on the back for a solid amount of time for bringing back ports and how great it would be to have real ports on these machines for pros but they're the ones that got rid of the ports in the first place nevertheless i won't get mad at that part i'm just glad they actually listened and brought him back so they brought back the hdmi port number one which is great to see then they also dropped in three thunderbolt 4 ports and then they brought back the sd card slot why they ever got rid of it i'll never know but hell yes it's back and then the headphone jack which is still here also now supports higher impedance headphones which will be really interesting to test with some more pro wired headphones so okay it was a great start they've brought back real keys they brought back real ports and then we get to the new improved display on these laptops so at this point you've looked at it probably already noticed the notch which i'll get to in a second but the actual display itself is also much improved and might be the most pro part of this laptop especially for people like me video creators so both sizes now have 120 hertz pro motion liquid retina xdr display so up to 1600 nits of peak brightness for hdr so now having real hdr screens high-res screens is a massive unlock for creators looking to jump into an hdr workflow like i've been thinking about for a while so instead of having to buy a separate hdr display you can all do that on the laptop which is great but also now just having hdr makes hdr content look better and having 120 hertz pro motion display of course just makes everything generally while you're using it much faster and smoother and great too it's been around in the world of three thousand dollar laptops for a while but it's good to finally see the first ever high refresh rate mac be this macbook pro but we can't ignore that notch up there so these are always fascinating design decisions from apple the laptop does not have face id like you saw the fingerprint reader on the power button there's your touch id right there that's it for your biometric authentication i would have been totally down if they did put in face id for just an extra layer of security it would have been more secure than windows hello which just uses a webcam but that's all that's up here just a webcam it is a 1080p webcam actually it's also about time but yeah i'm not sure why the notch is so big i don't know why it's this wide now i love the extra screen real estate you're getting they thinned up all the bezels and it's awesome that it's a 16 by 10 display underneath this notch and the extra screen real estate up top here is basically where the menu bar can permanently live and not overlap your content but i don't know i just don't know why the notch has to give us pixel 3 xl vibes it is pretty massive there are other laptops with thin bezels out there some of them thinner than the macbook pro and usually they don't have a notch some of them have some weird creative solutions i remember there's a zen book that has like a sort of reverse notch about the top and there's even some weirder ones there's a huawei mate book that avoided that all together and just put the webcam underneath one of the keys in the keyboard so apple chose a notch that shows kind of a big notch not sure why i think this this is probably one of those things where we'll get used to it once we start using the laptop and looking at the rest of the huge hdr display and i wouldn't be shocked if laptops in the future also start to do the notch thing and i also wouldn't be shocked if a future version of this laptop did have touched your face id but it doesn't at this point it's just one of those weird design decisions apple's just done a notch this year now these laptops also have an improved battery life 17 hours of video playback on the 14 and 21 hours on the 16 which is now the longest battery life ever in any apple laptop and the fast charging with magsafe is going to give you up to half battery in half an hour it's not bad and they also improved the speakers and the microphones on both laptops which i'll have to give a shot when we get them here and test them out but they were both already really good on the last ones so could be even better yeah it's just this these these are the laptops that a lot of people were waiting a long time for so yeah i've told you guys already like ever since i started editing 8k video from these red cameras i haven't edited any videos on my laptop i've given it a shot but that workflow's been really constrained and there are plenty of other workflows that have been really constrained on laptops too even if you do get a high performance laptop it's not going to be smooth running after effects running cinema 4d with those big projects and lots of layers that's still not fun so we end up going to the desktop most of the time but this could be a game changer this could be very different it seemed like every time apple showed any sort of numbers or comparisons in this keynote with especially m1 pro and m1 max look pretty good i mean m1 pro should be awesome m1 max should be even more awesome and with all the optimizations are on mac os and promotion it should be a pleasure also to use in just regular use if you're not in your creative workflow but yeah to me these these laptops finally really feel like great much better pro laptops for professionals and i keep saying that word but for people who have a workflow in some way that really takes advantage of this stuff and i don't know even even a lot of the little details it's there like even with the headphone jack supporting higher impedance wired headphones that draw more power that's something you wouldn't ordinarily see they just want you to use airpods max and get it over with but people who are actual pros will use their own wired headphones and will want to plug them in and we'll get more now out of that with the dac so stuff like that it's stuff like the hdr display and obviously 16 by 10 aspect ratio now lots lots of little things on top of the redesign and the sd card slot every every pro i know uses an sd card slot in some way i'm recording audio to an sd card right now love that and also the fact that you can max out basically the 14 inch or 16 inch to be the same best version of the computer same chip same storage same memory at the highest end of both is pretty sweet so you're basically just choosing a size at that point there may be small differences due to thermal efficiency but that's pretty cool too now they're expensive of course you could have probably guessed that halfway through the keynote we were all thinking oh god these are going to be very expensive machines so it's starting at 19.99 for the 14 inch and starting at 24.99 for the 16. that doesn't surprise me at all we knew it was coming but note that the baseline 14 is also a cut down eight core cpu and 14 core gpu so you have to spend 500 more dollars for two more cpu cores and two more gpu cores now i am a little bit surprised that we didn't also see more m1 silicon in an imac like an m1 max imac or or mac mini i was surprised there weren't more m1 max max oh wow that's a tongue twister but you know that's just something we'll have to stay stay tight for also i am i am trying to be very patient for the eventual apple silicon mac pro that's that's the the big one that i'm eventually going to be probably most excited for but that's that's all future stuff but either way shout out to apple for listening to how much we hated almost everything they did with the laptops for the past three years and giving it back fixing it making it way better us pros really appreciate that either way that's been it stay tuned for the reviews and a lot more coming because it's techtober you already know thanks for watching see you guys later peace [music]
