hello everyone and welcome mole one annual protection so this is an oil that they claim will last 20,000 miles and i think one of the big challenges for us as consumers is you walk into a part store you see all these different bottles all these different claims and it's very hard to know what testing has actually gone on behind the scenes to know whether or not you can trust those claims so i've worked with mobil 1 in the past talking about this product and i reached out to them again and said hey would you guys be interested and actually showing all of the testing the formulation what goes on behind the scenes so that we can actually get a glimpse of you know why you make this claim how did you come to the conclusion that this oil can last 20,000 engine miles and next thing i know i'm spending two days at mobile ones engineering and research facility got an exclusive look at what goes on behind the scenes much of the testing that goes into this and so that's what we're gonna be talking about in this video is the process of you know reaching this marketing claim and what goes on behind the scenes so super cool i'm really excited that we're getting this kind of behind-the-scenes look into the world you know the engineering world the test world which i came from which goes on behind the scenes that rarely you as a consumer actually get to check out now something i think that is extremely important to understand initially is that engineering doesn't just you know dump a product in a bottle throw it to marketing and then say okay put some stickers on it make some claims very much so the opposite happens so marketing does their research they determine what product they want to develop and they tell the engineering team hey can you guys make an oil that lasts 20,000 miles and then engineering decides to you know they formulate a plan they create that oil and they they work through their plan to determine whether or not it can actually meet the marketing claim that the marketing team wants to make so that leads us into how the rest of this video is going to play out so it all starts with marketing saying hey we want you guys to develop a product that lasts for 20,000 engine miles then formulation engineers spend time you know trying to create that perfect formula which they think we'll be able to complete that task that marketing desires then they use that formula they put it through some lab screen tests basically these are more cost effective tests to chew then measure whether or not they should perform additional testing or if they should go back to you know their formulation some tweaks and see if they can do better in these lab screening tests then you get into much more expensive testing so you want to be kind of sure of yourself before you get into that you perform engine testing you perform outside dynamometer testing which they call mads testing and then you can perform field testing and then once you have all of this data from all of your testing you can say okay did it actually last for 20,000 miles or did it not you've got all that data to prove your claim and then you can come out with that marketing claim so we're going to work through each of these the formulation through the different levels of testing and how they reach that marketing claim so my first stop at the engineering facility was the formulation lab and essentially when you look at a bottle of oil about 80 to 90 percent of it is made up of base oils and then about 10 to 20% of it it's made up of additives now the base oil is what gives a lot of the important properties such as the viscosity of the oil how thick it is at high temperatures how well it flows at low temperatures and also its volatility so how easily this oil evaporates of course you don't want the oil to evaporate because if it does then it just burns off in your engine and so these are you know features that the base oil provides but the additives you can enhance the properties of this oil now mobil 1 essentially tests all the different additives that are out there in the market and then they choose percentages of each additive which they find to be beneficial for their formula so one of these additives is viscosity index improvers or vi improvers these are large molecules that prevent the oil from getting too thin while it heats up another additive antioxidants these are used to prevent the oil from oxidizing or from breaking down you can kind of think of it like blueberries or dark chocolate for humans basically these are trying to react with the oil to prevent heat and oxygen from degrading that o of minimizing that effect of the oil breaking down so it lasts for a long time and the viscosity doesn't change over time anti-wear additives these are pretty cool so what they do is they absorb and they react with metallic surfaces so they create a sacrificial layer that's constantly being removed and replaced so for example where you have your camshaft and your lifter which is used to open and close your valves it'll create a layer on that rotating camshaft and on that lifter that's constantly being removed and replaced that's preventing that metal from touching each other and creating anywhere so of course in mobile one annual protection that additive needs to be able to last for twenty thousand miles ash list dispersants are used to prevent sludge from accumulating so basically what these will do these dispersants will attach to sludge precursors or deposit precursors and they'll keep that sludge or deposit suspended within the oil rather than attaching to for example the pistons so that you can filter it out or drain it out so that you don't have that sludge and those deposits build up within the engine super important for piston cleanliness detergent somewhat similar to ash lyst dispersants their job is to keep the engine clean attached to deposits and prevent those deposits from forming on the pistons things like that however they're also used to neutralize acids so you have blow-by occurring from combustion and as those combustion gases pass by the piston and react with the oil they can become acidic and so the detergents are there to help neutralize this reaction and not have an acidic oil within the engine and finally we get 2d foments which as the name suggests among other things are used to prevent foaming so as that engine is spinning at very high speeds of course that oil is getting churned up and you don't want it to foam so that's what that additive is used for okay so now that we've got an idea of what goes on with the experimental formulation basically what happens next is they take the desired percentages of each of these additives and base oils that they want they mix them all together they heat them to 82 degrees celsius for one hour and now they have a test sample and so with this sample formula they move on to lab screening with that formula to determine if it can pass the test that it needs to now one of the many preliminary tests is called ts 33 c and this is a test which was developed by chrysler to help them predict turbocharger cleanliness whether they could expect with their engines using specific oils and so in this case the test requires a stainless steel rod and oil flows around this stainless steel rod and that temperature varies from 200 degrees celsius to 480 degrees celsius now it's not just a temperature difference which is occurring the oil also flows through a reactor vessel where it's bubbled with nitrous oxide and oxygen on top of an iron catalyst which is added to the prior to starting the test all to make this a test that's very challenging for the oil to pass so the oil flows from the reactor vessel to the test rod then back into the reactor vessel and the cycle continues now the test itself is made up of twelve cycles which are nine and a half minutes each where that oil temperature varies from 200 c up to 480 c then back down to 200 c and this is about a two hour test so you weigh the metal rod before the test and then you clean off the oil afterwards and you weigh it again measuring the deposits which have accumulated on it and you also weigh an external filter which is used to capture any deposits which may have fallen off the test rod and in order to pass this test you have to have less than thirty milligrams of accumulated deposits total and the example we are looking at here is about 20 milligrams on this rod which would be passing the test with the healthy margin left in there now two additional bench tests of the many out there or an oxidation stability test and a thin film oxidation test both of these can help you learn about you know how does this oil react over time will it last a long duration so the first test this oxidation stability test is a proprietary test developed by exxon mobil basically it involves heating the oil adding air as well as a catalyst to help that reaction be further degraded as far as how long this oil can last and you measure the viscosity over time as it's undergoing this test and so initially you know if they designed something which they notice that the viscosity raises too quickly over time then they reformulate it and they basically just try to extend out this viscosity curve as long as they can get it to go so that it can last a long duration without the viscosity changing and that's you know you're not going to have the protection that you mean your engine so initially actually if you look at their curve for their actual product mobil one annual protection dips initially and it's possible that a small drop in viscosity could occur from the oxidation of vi improvers but basically if any larger molecule were to break down than initially that would reduce the viscosity now eventually you see that as that oil oxidizes larger molecules start to form and these larger molecules are what are starting to increase that viscosity and then you can see eventually it gets into this kind of x rate where you start to get more and more larger molecules and you have a you know severe increase in viscosity so you want to make sure that the oil doesn't do this too soon you want to make sure that it lasts for the engines oil drain interval duration the second test here involving oxidation basically what they do is they take a spinning aluminum disk and you circulate oil onto the center of that disk and then it spins out on the disk and this oil is at a high temperature and the test is a very long duration and so basically you just keep running it and you start to see that the varnish will start to appear and then you know you can start have these deposits form on that spinning disk now as this carbon builds up this carbon acts as an insulator so for scenarios like for the turbocharger that turbo shaft you don't want carbon building up on it because it's not going to be able to reject that heat to the oil moving around it so carbon acts as an insulator so it's pretty interesting to look at the difference between a high mileage synthetic blend versus a standard synthetic and mobil one annual protection the standard synthetic and mobil one annual protection passing this test you can see some varnish on the standard synthetic but you know not a big mechanical difference it's still going to work properly and then not too much varnish at all on the mobil one and your protection versus looking at the high mileage synthetic blend this actually fails the test and you can see significant carbon buildup on it okay so at this point we have seen some of the tests which have gone on with the lab screenings and now they can move on assuming all is going well and their formula is working within these lab screenings to the next step which is engine testing the first of two engine tests which we're going to be talking about is agm turbo test and this is a test which you must pass in order for gm to say that your product is compatible with their engines and so this is using a 1.4 liter ecotec engine and you're basically analyzing the turbocharger for any you know negative effects that may happen with that turbocharger as a result of using it with a specific engine oil so this is a 500 hour test and it cycles from mid to high rpm and then the engine actually shuts off and it lets that turbocharger soak all of that heat soak into that you know you don't have flow anymore for that oil so that oil is just sitting inside of that turbocharger soaking in that heat now there's no coolant used in tests so the oil is there for lubrication and it's also there for the cooling of the turbocharger and basically as carbon deposits start to form within that turbocharger those carbon deposits act as an insulator and you can see this by measuring a temperature differential across the turbocharger so if you're not rejecting as much heat you could be building up carbon deposits within that turbocharger so there's very specific heat parameters which you need to be able to pass in order to pass this test measuring that temperature differential and looking for that carbon buildup now once the test is complete you actually cut the turbocharger in half and then inspect the part so you're inspecting the turbo chef the bearings the internal components and you're looking for where you're looking for varnish and you're looking for deposits and so this turbocharger that we're looking at here split in half is actually the one that was used when testing mobile one annual protection another engine test uses a toyota 2nr efi engine and this test is designed to examine lifter buckets and the you know the interaction between the camshafts and the lifter buckets which are used to open the intake and exhaust valves and to see whether or not any wear occurs on that lifter bucket where you've got that very high pressure interaction so this is a two hundred hour test and the american society for testing materials sets the requirements for this test and basically how it works is the engine goes from idle up to 4,300 rpm and it's doing this every six to seven seconds and it's cycling 24,000 times now on top of the engine there are two cooling jackets which pass through the valve train and the coolant is at a temperature of 20 degrees celsius and the reason this is done is to keep those valve train temperatures low so this kind of creates a similar situation to when you're starting your car and you know you're basically just have ambient temps so the starting of the car is where you're gonna have the most wear occur and so this test brings down those temperatures to help accelerate wear within the testing now after those 24,000 cycles are complete you measure the wear on the lifter buckets so they use a scanning machine which takes a 3d image of the lifter and it actually measure the volume of material that has been removed from those lifter buckets you can evaluate that material lost and determine whether or not it passes this test okay moving right along now that we've passed the engine tests we can move on to mads testing madd stands for mileage accumulation dynamometer stand and this is where the testing starts to get really exciting for me so there's eight outdoor dinos that mobil one has at this facility which they can run vehicles on so these are outside and they chose three different vehicles to test this on running them to 120,000 miles with 20,000 mile oil change intervals so the first vehicle is a 2015 lexus nx 200t this has a two liter engine turbocharged direct-injection and it uses zero w 20 motor oil the next vehicle is a 2016 ford fusion se which is a 1.5 liter ecoboost engine direct injection and 5w 20 motor oil and then the final core is a 2015 chevy malibu 2-liter engine turbocharged gasoline direct injection and this uses 5w30 so each of these using a different weight oil and you know all of these are turbocharged they're small engines they're direct injection and the reason for choosing these vehicles is this is basically where the industry is headed so you're seeing a lot of small displacement turbocharger high boost engines so these engines have very high internal temperatures and pressures and they're very hard on the oil as a result of being turbocharged so that's why i mobil one selected these for the testing now the test itself is a pretty severe test cycle where they simulate city highway driving up inclines and driving with a trailer and so the way that they can you know kind of simulate these inclines or trailers is by using a brake on the dyno so the car has to overcome the power to overcome that brake that's trying to slow it down now for all three of these vehicles every 5,000 miles the oil is tested and inspected and every 20,000 miles the oil and the oil filter are changed out the total duration of the test that lasts for 120,000 miles so six stints of you know 20,000 miles on the oil and on the oil filter now after the hundred and twenty thousand miles are complete there's a visual inspection of the entire engine all of the components so the engine is fully torn down and all the components are analyzed against industry standards now the technicians who are performing this analysis are blind as to what components what engine oils were used on these certain components so they're just looking at it they have no idea if it's a competitive product or if it's mobile one annual protection that they're looking at to make sure that there's no bias and their rating scale and so this engine that we're looking at here is out of the nx 200t torn apart and there's a rating scale which they use to look at varnish to look at sludge to look at carbon deposits and to analyze these parts so anything that the oil touches is analyzed so here we can see the block out of the lexus the crankshaft the crank bearings the connecting rods the pistons the camshaft and the valve cover now in addition to the engine teardown at 120,000 miles engine oil samples are taken from the vehicles every 5,000 miles and these oil samples are analyzed under various tests so two of the spectroscopy tests which this undergoes are icp and ftir so we're gonna be talking about icp or inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy now this device uses a plasma torch and it injects an oil sample into that plasma so the oil is converted to an aerosol and then vaporized atomized and finally ionized by the high-energy plasma now when these ions get excited by the plasma they emit photons of specific wavelengths to the left you can see a chamber and this is essentially a massive image sensor which records the wavelength of the light emitted from the oil passing through the plasma torch these specific wavelengths are an indication almost like a thumbprint for what metals are present in the oil now specific elements correlate with specific engine components so you can learn if there's various metals that are wearing too fast within the engine for example if you see too much aluminum you could be seeing some piston where if there's copper there could be where in the piston rings the bearings the sleeves if there's iron there could be where in the engine block and the cylinders if there's nickel there could be where in the bearings in the valves and and there's a long list of different elements which you can learn from and basically you want to see these all very well controlled and not increasing not massive amounts of these where metals within the oil samples to know that the engine is running healthily so it's pretty cool to actually look at the data see that the copper that the iron stay well within their limits for the duration of the hundred twenty thousand mile test now not only are you monitoring where elements during these five thousand mile intervals you're also looking at the viscosity of the oil and making sure that it remains within its sae grade requirements for those twenty thousand mile intervals and so if they did this with each of the vehicles and they all stayed within the viscosity requirements that they needed to even with a duration and oil change interval of twenty thousand miles also during the five thousand mile intervals you're measuring the acidity or measuring the base numbers you're measuring oxidation you're measuring nitration and all of these have to remain within tolerances for those twenty thousand mile intervals for one hundred and twenty thousand miles total and order for it to pass this test now they performed one additional tests on those outside dynamometer x' where they put half a million miles on a chevy silverado so once again using twenty thousand mile oil drain intervals and doing this for five hundred thousand miles now this was put on a highway cycle which is less intense but it enables them to put a lot more miles on the car in a shorter duration and see how it performs in that scenario now if any of the components which the oil touches were to fail they would end the test and an example of something which they did end up swapping out unrelated to the engine oil the transmission needed to be replaced at three hundred thousand miles but none of the components related to the engine oil needed to be replaced all of them last for five hundred thousand miles and then you know they pulled the engine out to tear down and it inspects at half a million miles so aside from the teardown they also did the interval testing with this vehicle as well where they took oil samples and they made sure that you know the viscosity rating it remained within sae spec for those five hundred thousand miles throughout the oil drain intervals with twenty thousand mile intervals they made sure where metals were kept in check the copper in the iron they all stayed well within limits and they also monitored for sludge in the deck so looking at that every hundred thousand miles to make sure that the valvetrain was performing smoothly that there wasn't sludge accumulating so a pretty impressive test and five hundred thousand miles put on the vehicle and then of course once it was done the engine is completely torn down they visually inspect all the components make sure there's not sludge that there's not excessive wear that there's not excessive carbon deposits which have built up so analyzing that engine after it has been torn down after those five hundred thousand miles now in addition to the mads testing mobil 1 actually owns 91 lucky cabs in las vegas so high temperatures lots of idling time things like that which they test their products they've been running that program since 2004 and the whole idea of this video is to kind of give you an eclipse and it's certainly not an exhaustive list but a glimpse of the testing that goes on behind the scenes which you generally don't get to see before they come up with these marketing claims of what a product can do now one of the big questions a lot of you were asking in the first video was are there actually oil filters which can last 20,000 miles and indeed there are so basically they're already filters lasting around 15,000 miles and mobil 1 was doing testing to determine you know do they actually last for 20,000 miles and they found that the media can actually handle it the filter inside can actually handle that 20,000 miles the one thing that they did need to have change for these extended filters that lasts for 20,000 miles is the actual rubber gasket that seats against your engine block so that material actually needed to be improved to last for those 20,000 miles but the media itself was fine to actually filter on for those additional 5,000 miles versus a 15,000 mile oil filter something else that i think is important to mention is that a year is a long time to go without looking at your car so you know they're certainly not saying hey you don't need to touch your car for a year if your car burns a lot of oil then you still have to replace that oil that gets burned off you know there are maintenance things that you need to address within a year so it's not you know wise to just you know you put in your one-year oil and you just let it sit for a year and that's the only thing you ever have to think about you still need to keep up with your vehicle also important if your vehicle is under warranty the oil drain interval is set by the manufacturer so you don't want to stray from that oil drain interval if your car is indeed under warranty so this has been a ton of information i hope you guys have enjoyed as much as i have getting behind the scenes glimpse at what goes on in developing a motor oil if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
