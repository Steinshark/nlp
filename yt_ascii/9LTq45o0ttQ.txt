hello everyone and welcome the dodge demon 170 has numbers that are simply mind-blowing over a thousand horsepower accelerates at over 2 g's never done before in a production car it generates cylinder pressures equal to the weight of about seven and a half dodge demons pressing down on a single piston the fuel injectors are capable of providing 164 gallons of fuel per hour for contacts that's more than four times the maximum fuel flow of a modern f1 engine which makes similar power so yeah okay surprise maybe the demon isn't fuel efficient but it throws down a 0 to 60 of 1.66 seconds a production car record and that's a number we can certainly trust right no of course not because as is increasingly common incredibly cool engineering must be viewed through the distorted lens of mislead leaving marketing the 0 to 60 is with rollout and if you've watched this channel you know how dumb i think rollout is the industry practice of deleting the first foot of acceleration essentially it's starting the 0 to 60 clock after the car has reached about six miles per hour you would probably call that a 6 to 60 rightly so but within the industry we'd call that a 0 to 60 with roll out and honestly most of the time we forget to say that last bit now i'm just some idiot on the internet right why should you listen to my opinion and truthfully you shouldn't my opinion doesn't matter don't listen to it but do listen to the opinion of the current ceo of dodge and what he said about rollout back in 2017 as it related to the previous dodge demon quote rollouts aren't a fair way to do 0-60 honestly a real 0-60 is from a dead stop wait what so in 2017 teen dodge cared about portraying their numbers in a fair way so when they gave the 0-60 of the 2018 demon at 2.3 seconds it was truly from zero no roll out nonsense but six years later you cannot even find the word rollout mentioned once on the public demon page or on the media page they admitted only when you ask and they won't provide the number without rollout the current ceo of dodge has been quoted saying rollout isn't fair and yet they won't even tell us what the number is incredible okay but this is still a really cool achievement so let's break down the numerous disclaimers that go along with this 0-60 and talk about what the real 0-60 might be okay so here we have what is the equivalent of top gear's cool wall except now we're looking at disclaimers for this car 0-60 some of those disclaimers are not cool some of them are very cool so we'll get into them and starting off with not cool there's really two big ones roll out and a prepped surface now i know some people are going to push back and say this is a drag car on a drag strip surely you know that's where rollout originates it makes sense to use rollout in this case now let's take a moment zero to 60s are not measured on drag strips they do not measure year 0 to 60. they measure your 60 foot but that is something different 0 to 60 is measured using a gps and then what they do is they delete the first foot digitally they say here's what the actual 0-60 is then they delete that first foot and say here you go public you can believe this number that has you know six miles per hour deleted from it it's crazy it makes no sense so that's disclaimer number one that isn't cool the second being a prep surface this is using glue it's on a drag strip you know it is a drag car so i kind of get it but when a car magazine when you open a car magazine and it says this car 0-60 is this it's on a road it's on a road surface right it's not using glue all the car magazines use is roll out and they don't believe you should be using glue for your numbers the only other car that's done it basically in recent history is tesla with the plaid it wasn't cool so motor trend did their own test and got the real numbers on a road without using glue so both of these not cool that they did it or at least didn't provide the real numbers so regarding real numbers let's look at how powerful rollout really is looking at some actual examples so these are some numbers from motor trend the tesla p100d was able to accelerate to 5.9 miles per hour in that one foot of rollout and it took 0.26 seconds laferrari rear wheel drive so kind of similar to the case here which is interesting to see also 5.9 miles per hour and it did it in just 0.19 seconds so you know it's real 0-60 time you would add on 0.19 seconds to get that with the number that includes rollout okay so tesla plaid 5.9 miles per hour again so it's kind of cool to see that there's this speed basically with one foot of acceleration on a tire you reach this maximum speed of about 5.9 miles per hour and the tesla plaid did that in 0.15 seconds so that was the rollout time that was deleted from its 0 to 60. so if we were to look at the tesla plan this is accelerating on average at about 1.8 g's the demon 170 is supposedly capable of 2gs so if you were to plug in accelerating from 0 to 5.9 miles per hour at two g's that would give you just 0.13 seconds now my own time in the previous dodge demon which was not good it wasn't that quick of a 0-60 but i accelerated in that first foot to 5.1 miles per hour in 0.25 seconds so my rollout was 0.25 seconds when i tested this car several years ago so the actual 0-60 for the dodge demon on a prepped surface is going to lie somewhere between these two numbers being added so a 1.79 to a 1.91 second below two seconds which i mean this is you know extraordinary and i'm betting that it's closer to this number than it is to this number because this was in the old demon and it wasn't that great of a launch so it's going to be a really good 0-60 on a prep surface and definitely below two seconds which is awesome to see so what else is cool about the demon well this is a genuine production car i think that's awesome there's going to be up to 3 300 of these built so good numbers of them built and this is a car that costs a hundred thousand dollars now as the name implies there's probably going to be 170 000 markup but it's a hundred thousand dollar vehicle right this isn't just some extraordinary thing like you know the remake navarra or the pininfrina batista where it's multiple millions of dollars and then they say oh production car record it's like yeah kind of i get yes but it's much cooler when it's something that's you know more within grasp of the public that isn't some insane number like you know two million three million dollars and that you know they're actually making it in decent production numbers also is this the first car to break the two second barrier zero to sixty it just may be now yes this was on a prep surface so that's the disclaimer that goes along with it but it did actually start at zero unlike a lot of those out there saying hey we have this 0-60 under two seconds and then they're not telling you that that doesn't include the rollout time so the reality is this is a car that has done it 0-60 in under two seconds also what's crazy about this is that the vehicle is rear wheel drive this makes a launch so difficult to hit a really good 0-60 we'll get into that later the fact that this is a thousand horsepower with a warranty that's incredibly cool it has cool features like the trans brake and power chiller which i have videos on if you're curious about how those work okay now two more really cool claimers that go along with this 0-60 of the dodge demon first of all it's on drag radials and you might immediately like what that's cheating but it's not they're street legal they took drag radials they put some grooves in them so they could make them street legal they did the work they're bespoke to this vehicle and and of course they are critical for that 0-60 and that's how you're going to get that extra grip for the incredible launch but they did it they put street legal drag radials on a production car are they going to be great in the rain probably not are they going to wear really fast probably do you have to sign a waiver to use them apparently so dodge tells me there's an agreement covering things like tires that buyers must sign so regardless like yeah it's it's an asterisk that goes along with this 0-60 but they're street legal so in my opinion it works now does this mean everyone from now on is going to be offering an option for their cars to come with you know drag radials in order to hit that 0-60 i don't know maybe but regardless dodge did i think it's cool all also to run maximum power the engine needs to have e85 so ethanol for the fuel in order to reach that 1025 horsepower it's less if you do not run on ethanol what's cool about this is that the system automatically detects what your fuel is the composition how much ethanol is within that and as long as the fuel is 65 or greater ethanol it will unlock full power and you can achieve these numbers you know with the given disclaimers and conditions provided here so it's a street legal fuel you know it's not as available as pump gas but i think regardless it's you know you can run it on the street they've got everything integrated so that you can run it without having to think twice about it i think both of these are very cool that they did it for this product okay something that's almost equally as important as tires in order for a rear-wheel drive vehicle to get a good launch is where its center of gravity is it is critically important so i'm going to explain why so if you're to look at a dodge demon and i'm taking these specs from the previous dutch demon which had a weight distribution of 58 on front 42 percent of the weight on the rear and you look at what is the maximum force that this rear tire can accelerate this vehicle with well that force is equal to the frictional coefficient of your tires multiplied by how much weight is on that tire okay so if you have a tire that's capable of accelerating at 1g well it has a frictional coefficient of one if you have a tire that has a frictional coefficient of two it's able to accelerate at two g's so in this case we know we're able to accelerate at two g's so we have our frictional coefficient of two now 42 percent of the weight of the vehicle is on that rear tire so the maximum acceleration we can have is 0.84 g's based on the weight distribution of this vehicle now we know it can do better than 0.84 g's right that's not all that impressive so how do we improve that well the way you improve it is as you start accelerating you have load transfer to that rear wheel so as you start accelerating the center of gravity you can pretend that you basically have a force that's saying okay now we're resisting this motion and we're transferring load from the front end to the rear end and where you position that center of gravity is critical if you want to achieve the maximum acceleration so in the world of engineering there's this principle where if you sum the moments about a point it should equal zero on a free body diagram so if we're looking at all the forces on our car basically we have the weight of the car resting on the two tires and we want all of that weight to be on the back tire so we're going to eliminate this front and then we also have the force that the tire is trying to accelerate our vehicle with right it's trying to push the car that way so you have this force which the tires are providing that frictional coefficient times the normal force in other words 2 times n so 2n multiplied by this distance y and we have the force of the weight of the vehicle on that rear tire so we've got the road pushing up with the normal force one normal force multiplied by this distance x to sum our moments about the center of gravity we'll get to the point of all this if this seems confusing but if you write this out what you can basically find is you have normal force times x equals two normal force times y in other words x equals 2y so this distance here has to be twice this distance here to locate your center of gravity so your center of gravity must be located on this dotted line i've drawn right here in order to achieve maximum acceleration what if your center of gravity was up here well what that means is as you start accelerating the car would simply just flip backwards right it would reach it wouldn't be able to reach two g's before it just starts to flip back what if your center of gravity was down here in this region well then you would never be able to reach that two g's your your tires would start spinning before that happened because you don't have enough load transfer going back to that rear tire so it's critical that the center of gravity falls on this dotted line so when dodge is designing it they have to make sure that it happens like that now you can have a little bit of a benefit from the springs right so as the front end lifts up that means your center of gravity also lifts up which gives you a bit of a benefit and helps you achieve this even if your center of gravity were say just a little bit lower than this dotted line but the critical point is if you don't have your center of gravity high enough well then you just do you know you spin the tires before you can reach 2 g's if you go above that if your cg is way too high the car just flips backwards that's not good right so it's it's really a delicate balance and it's a very cool thing to see that they're able to achieve this two g's and have that you know just have the tires lift up and then go on down the drag strip okay so for a rear wheel drive vehicle that has plenty of power there are two factors that are limiting your acceleration one is your tires and the other is the location of your center of gravity so this equation right here takes those two variables and allows you to calculate your maximum possible acceleration based on your tires and based on where your center of gravity is so if you plug in all the numbers for the dodge demon you get a maximum possible acceleration of two g's if you have a center of gravity height at about 855.5 millimeters now that's pretty high for example a toyota supra has a center of gravity height at about 500 millimeters but you know part of this could be that that front end is going to raise up a bit before you know you get full load transfer to the rear and part of that is help actually buy the front damper so the front dampers have a setting when you're in drag mode they have soft rebound meaning allowing the vehicle to lift up to pull away from those dampers very easily so it's a quick transition and then everything else is stiff the rear is stiff and compression is stiff but it allows the the front of the car to lift up very easily which can help with raising that cg which can help with load transfer so the cool thing about this equation is you can use it to calculate in the real world what's the maximum acceleration that this thing can actually achieve okay so here's the really cool part where we use math to predict real world numbers and this is going to illustrate why rear wheel drive is so challenging so on a prep surface knowing that we have a maximum frictional coefficient of two the average acceleration of the demon down that 0 to 60 was 1.5 g's absolutely bonkers which gives it a 0 to 60 of 1.8 seconds on a prep surface which we had calculated earlier compare that to the tesla model s plaid which is at 2.13 seconds on a prepared surface so significantly quicker than the plaid which is absolutely nuts however if we go to a road a public road you know a normal road a drag strip that hasn't been prepped and let's give this demon the benefit of the doubt and say this is the highest frictional coefficient of any tire out there that you can put on a production car at 1.5 the the real limit i believe today is somewhere around 1.4 but they have surpassed that with these drag radials so let's say it's 1.5 well that will give them because of the location of the center of gravity using this equation it will give them a maximum acceleration of about 1.1 g's meaning the real world using really nice tires but on you know non-prepared surface they're going to have a 0-60 of about 2.5 seconds versus tesla plaid which we know has already done it in 2.3 seconds so the second you go out into the real world this is no longer the world's quickest production car it's only on that prepared surface with a certain set of circumstances which it can achieve that number now just for fun let's look at some other circumstances and no you shouldn't be driving your dodge demon in the rain or the snow right like it's designed for the drag strip but theoretically if you were to you know what are some of the numbers that you can expect so if you're driving in the rain and you have a frictional coefficient of 0.8 the maximum acceleration that the dodge demon is going to be able to achieve is 0.44 g's giving it a 0 to 60 of 6.2 seconds compare that to the tesla model s plaid if you've got that frictional coefficient of 0.8 it's going to be able to achieve a 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds because it's all-wheel drive in the snow things get even worse so our maximum excel acceleration given a frictional coefficient of 0.3 is now just going to be 0.14 g's and our 0 to 60 is 19.5 seconds versus the tesla at 9.1 seconds so less than half so real world in basically every condition an all-wheel drive vehicle that has plenty of power is going to be quicker all right so quick summary on a prepared surface the 0-60 is somewhere around 1.8 seconds which is absolutely nuts in the real world i doubt we're going to see a 0 to 60 better than 2.5 seconds and then the other thing is you know once again this car is incredibly cool you don't have to be misleading about it to explain how cool it is so my advice to dodge is simply let out the real numbers release the real numbers let a third party test this thing it'd be awesome if you did thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
