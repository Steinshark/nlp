[music] hey what's up guys umhd here so we've had 10 million subscribers on this channel for a couple weeks now and it's been pretty incredible still honestly not really used to seeing that number there it's a crazy amount of people but this is a direct result of that you may have seen it before or maybe you haven't seen it or maybe this is the first time we're seeing it in all this detail but this comes straight from youtube with a note from susan the ceo and it's the award for hitting 10 million subscribers on one channel it's the diamond play button okay so as some of you may know youtube is one of the only platforms that shows its appreciation for the creators that make it possible in this sort of physical way maybe the only platform like they definitely don't do everything right and they might have a long way to go as far as earning everyone's complete love and trust but this is a genuinely cool thing that they do that you don't see instagram or facebook or tick tock or other creator driven platforms doing so this is cool to see but actually first there are some other awards for some other milestones that have changed over the years this is the original silver 100 000 subscriber award milestone that i got back i don't remember what year exactly but as you can see nice little frameable certificate this is one of the originals and then you get to adding a digit and then you get this gigantic million subscriber this is the gold play button award and they put the the logo from the channel down here and this is hangable as well this i got in 2014 and this is also one of the originals so i hadn't actually hung this up on a wall yet in the studio just because it's so heavy but as you could tell they have a pretty similar look to each of them but since then now they've updated it so there's two newer more minimalist ones still silver and gold but now they're frameless they're clean and they're probably also much easier to hang they switched over to that a couple years ago you know what i'm also going to link below the like button what's inside video where they toured the sort of mini factory the facility where they make these creator rewards but then we've arrived at this so this is the youtube 10 million subscriber diamond play button it's not meant to be hung up it's just a button this one as far as i know has been unchanged since they started making it and it also seems to be the most exclusive one aside from the custom 50 million and 100 million subscriber awards i think only pewdiepie has gotten but i feel like now that i have it in person might as well review it so without having it with you the hardest thing to convey or see on camera is how heavy like how dense it is spoiler it isn't actually a giant diamond but it is a solid piece of machined aluminum which is super heavy and then polished on the outside with this crystal embedded in the middle of it it's heavy it's hard to hold in one hand and if i actually put it on the scale it shows about 4 800 grams or about 10 and a half pounds that's about the same as a 2-liter soda or a large watermelon or maybe for you tech people three 13-inch macbook pros stacked on top of each other and then some so that is the number one thing that everyone will notice but then of course what you can tell is it's extremely shiny like it has all kinds of angles to it and the whole thing is very reflective which ultimately makes it a fingerprint magnet which explains the microfiber cloth that actually comes in the briefcase when you first take it out the box typically when something is a fingerprint magnet this much it's also slippery and you want to like cover it up but i'm going to say this is not something you want to throw a dbrand skin on you know show it off prop it up somewhere that's why it has the microfiber layer on the bottom of it so that you can confidently put it down and stand it up on its end because unfortunately unlike the other two awards there's pretty much no way to hang this one on a wall on the back it has the channel name and it says congratulations on passing 10 million subscribers and then the youtube logo and it's laser etched and then the crystal in the middle i think is pretty sick it sticks out a bit like a camera bump on the back of a phone but i'm not mad about this one at all and it has a bunch of cuts on the sides of it so the more you tilt it around in the light the more you get all kinds of different reflections and it looks sick overall design nine out of ten ergonomics i'm going to give it like a 7 out of 10. build quality is a 10 for sure and value is priceless seriously if you haven't watched the previous the the 10 million subscriber celebration video just know that this of course would not exist here without you guys and many of the things i'm able to do on this channel would also not be possible without you guys i want to say there the uploads are a little quiet in january just because there's not that much tech happening in january but the lineup for february is already super sick and i'm excited to share this stuff with you guys and it's because of you that this is all possible so thank you again for subscribing thanks for watching i'll catch you guys the next one peace
