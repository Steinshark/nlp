dear apple i use an iphone i've chosen to use an iphone over every single other option out there and that's because it makes my life easier i've got two full videos all about that up here but the reason that i'm making this one is that this could be so much more than what it is and you've already done the hard bits implementing these 10 simple things that the community is dying for number one literally affects everyone would take the iphone to such a level that android would struggle to compete so number 10 is every time i pick up someone else's phone it could be an android it could be an older iphone it could be a blackberry i'm constantly reminded of the fact that these sharp edges are not the way forward i can completely understand why they've done this flat sides look fresh and apple always wants there to be a clear sign that you've got the new iphone because there's a certain brag factor but the fact that my phone leaves a dent in my hand should be a fair indication that this is not human friendly design and thanks to rhino shield for sponsoring this video that does help number nine is apple arcade i don't talk about this much because i try and keep it as a personal hobby but i love games and i really think that apple arcade this five dollar a month subscription for premium games is a big missed opportunity the biggest draws right now are basically new versions of existing mobile games like cut the rope remastered or crossy road castle but there's a real gap for aaa console quality games could you even imagine a fully fledged iphone exclusive pokemon or an iphone exclusive spider-man game most of the time i leave home my iphone is the only gaming device i have with me and so i don't think i'm in a minority when i say that it would be incredible if there were meteor experiences we could sink our teeth into and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be appetizing the potential is here i mean this iphone 12 pro max is already more powerful than a playstation 4. and there are already over one and a half billion active apple users who have been shown to be hungry for paid content even if apple could get five percent of us to sign up for arcade that's 4.5 billion us dollars per year as passive income easily enough to justify the licensing cost of these big names okay it's about to get serious now admittedly i was never a huge user of voice assistance but since switching to an iphone i've completely stopped except for that one time i asked siri out on a date no thanks the point is siri is capped by two main things a is apple's privacy-centric approach like if you think about it for a virtual assistant to get really good it needs to understand you but for it to understand you it's got to access and store as much of your data as possible and that's against apple's policies so in most senses siri is purpose-built to forget things and be less useful and what i'm saying is i think we can forgive this particular failing given how much people are now starting to care about their privacy however the other thing with siri is that it also just lacks the moment-to-moment intelligence of say google assistant it's falling further and further behind in terms of how well it can understand context it doesn't relate the conversation to what app is open right now or the last few things i said and this is something that can be improved and if it was siri would feel less like a speech-to-text translator to use for one-off requests more like an actual assistant that's responding to me right number seven it's not going to be news to anybody that apple has a very stringent view on customization i think their general approach to software is that if we give our users unlimited number of options then most people will pick suboptimal ones and that will just hamper their impression of our phone so we'll decide what's best for you and i do think that in 99 of cases they do make decisions that suit the majority but as a tech savvy user you feel the implications of not being able to make those choices yourself and a good example of this is live wallpapers we've literally had live moving wallpapers on android for over 10 years now but the best that you can do on an iphone even today is a static wallpaper that moves when you hold your thumb on the screen they've almost definitely done this because they know that if they allow people to apply full video wallpapers like this then everyone's going to do it because it's cool but then everyone's battery life is going to drop and they'll complain what i'm saying is that it's understandable but at the same time as part of a group of users who understands the implications of a live wallpaper it's frustrating to be patronized like this and you feel this lack of options even more when it comes to the lock screen on android your lock screen can look like this or this or this on apple it's gonna look like this there's no always on display like you get on android which okay fine that's one thing but more fundamentally we can't add widgets we can't change the clock we can't change the flashlight and the camera buttons we can't really do anything again what they've picked is fine it probably does suit a good portion of users but not everyone you see you can really tell when you use ios the apple has had to restrain themselves they're very aware that giving users too many options cannot just result in people making bad choices but it can also just be confusing for people who don't want to make those choices so they're constantly chipping away at things trying to make it as simple as possible but there is definitely room for a little tab in the settings menu called pro features which would allow anyone who does know what they're doing to tinker to swap that flashlight for a wi-fi toggle to make the font something that's maybe more readable for you and i can't believe this is still not fixed make it so that i don't need to manually swipe up after my face has already been scanned with face id like i probably unlock my phone 100 times per day that's 36 500 swipes that you could very easily save me every single year people have made sort of workarounds for this but if anything that's just a sign that they're desperate and that apple should step in and do it properly i totally get the hesitation here this attitude to control is the reason the iphones are so polished but there are ways of adding in options that don't obstruct the average user side note this is the same reason i stopped using apple's own keyboard it's bizarre because this is just an assumed feature on android but on iphones there's no option to add vibrations to your keystrokes for me that's just a must-have feature it makes typing more satisfying so i moved over to google keyboard but even google keyboard has been nerfed here because apple restricts how much space a keyboard is allowed to take up you can't add a permanent number road like you can on android i actually put out a tweet a few weeks ago asking what you guys wanted and there were a whole number of people who actually said that the one reason they don't use an iphone is because there's no support for t9 dialing or in other words a keyboard that can predict the word you're writing based on which number keys you tap very simple option to add but the biggest offender on this topic of customization is icon packs i'm using an ios 15 phone now and i love the updated safari the new ui elements and the fact that i can use portrait mode on facetime it's amazing but the way it handles icons is poor see with last year's ios 14 apple introduced the option to use custom icons for your apps it was a bit of a workaround it was janky even when completed and you had to create and apply each custom icon one by one and it took hours and sometimes days to set up your home screen using this technique but even then ios users sharing their setups became a number one trending twitter hashtag it was the perfect showcase for how ios users right now are starving for customization options and ios 15 was apple's chance to make it right but they didn't and i think it's on purpose apple takes great pride in their software design for them it's as much a part of the phone as the glass and metal it's constructed from and so they want people to be able to just see a phone from a distance recognize the iconic software and just know that it's an iphone it's the same reason that they've had the same consistent notch on every flagship iphone since the iphone 10. it's the same reason why their 2021 imac has a chin that would make waluigi proud it's a visual differentiator and they would lose some of that effect if they started encouraging people to use a pokemon icon pack you've got to remember that this doesn't apply to samsung or xiaomi or oneplus because fundamentally they didn't make their software they're just borrowing it from google they don't own it and therefore they've got less incentive to make it iconic or even think about restricting what you can do with it i get that but from a user perspective not being able to change icons quickly is one of the main things that i miss while using an iphone plus if apple made like an official store for themes where people could just buy them and apply in one tap that'd be a great source of revenue not just for developers but also them okay number four one thing that i've really felt the lack of with these new iphones is a fingerprint scanner and i get that technically speaking face id is better it's more secure it's even easier for the user it's integrated into everything but for people who wear masks which has been a reality since 2019 and who knows how much longer it doesn't work and the only evidence we even have face id is the enormous notch on front which contains the sensors for it i'm not saying that i think apple should replace face id it's an amazing feature but how awesome would it be if there was also a stealthy fingerprint scanner embedded in the power button could you imagine you could literally tap it once and be instantly and securely on your home screen you wouldn't even need to touch the screen right top three things now three changes that i think would make an enormous difference to the experience of living with an iphone and the first one is usbc simple what are you doing android phones use usbc macbooks use usbc ipads use usbc iphones have a lightning port it's just strange because when i moved from android to iphone as you would expect the iphone did work better with my existing apple products but then when it came to cables it actually added clutter instead of taking away from it when i used to use an android phone alongside my macbook it was great because when i used to go on a day trip i literally just needed one usbc cable but now that i'm using an iphone i need two sets of cables and two sets of accessories i'm not the first person to say this when i asked on twitter i'd say there were at least 100 people who replied with usbc as my main barrier against switching to an iphone even if they love your phone the average android user can't justify ditching their entire set of usbc accessories apple's had all sorts of consumer protection and environmental bodies coming to them like hey can you guys just use usbc like everyone else the only defense to this which tends to be roughly apple's response to it is that it's too late now it's this idea that given that they've been using lightning for so long already if they switch now then it's true there will be a whole load of lightning users who will have to ditch their lighting accessories and go and buy new usb-c ones so this is one of those situations where there isn't really an easy answer but what i think is more realistic and i'd say even more important is number two this iphone 12 pro max camera is phenomenal day or night portrait mode or ultra wide i just snap that shutter button and i know it's going to be good the issue is not that iphones are missing out on camera quality i don't think apple should start adding 100 times zoom lenses like samsung's galaxy s21 ultra has i actually think the choice of lenses here is pretty balanced and you almost can't expect more on a phone that's built for the masses it's never going to be as specialized as an s21 ultra which is solely made for pros but the thing that can be changed is that iphone cameras need to be more fun take the vivo x60 pro plus with its gimbal stabilization system all these cool zei style portrait modes different kinds of night mode and advanced features like eye and body tracking fundamentally yes the smartphone camera is a tool but i think it's equally and increasingly being used just as a creative outlet for people and i think apple focuses a little too much on the former and not enough on the latter like what if apple built augmented reality objects that you could just drop into your photos and videos with the quality of ar that you can get on these new iphones that could be incredible what if they had ai powered face adjustment features so you could swap out the color of your eyes or try out a new haircut for a certain photo that could be pretty fun what about just more interesting filters like ones that can do selective colorization or ones that can cartoonize your face there's so much room for apple to make their cameras more exciting and as we've seen it doesn't necessarily mean the camera is going to be more bloated or confusing you've just got to place these options such that you'll only find them if you're looking for them but what's the number one thing because you might be thinking oh it's probably going to be value or prices not really the way i see it apple makes a lot of profit yes apple phones are expensive yes but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're overpriced i really think that unless you're buying something crazy like that 170 000 gold phone most smartphones are delivering many times the value that we buy them for for most people your phone is probably more useful to you than your tv your laptop possibly your car those things go up to stupid amounts of money and so the fact that you can pretty much get the best smartphones out there for a thousand dollars i don't think that's a rip-off the fact that iphones do vary a lot by region and sometimes do reach closer to two thousand dollars is an issue though that i do think needs to be addressed but what i want to talk about here is something that affects almost every single iphone user regardless of region and it's the battery specifically the battery on the non-plus sized iphones see for the longest time the normal iphone's batteries have been pretty much selected to be just enough to last all day to start with but when you factor in that every year you use your phone the battery's going to lose some of its max capacity three years down the line it's often a problem and the difference between these phones and android flagships which are now starting to get very generous battery capacities is going to start becoming apparent as this generation of phones age this wouldn't be as much of a problem if you could just kind of pop the battery out and swap it but actually getting the cell out of an iphone 12 is no less than a 42-step process that's more steps than simba's grooming regime besides of all smartphone users ios users have the most to gain from better battery there's not a single other brand of phones that gets five to six years of software updates after launch that's incredible but can you actually use an iphone 6s in 2021 not without replacing the battery you can't and if apple did bump capacities by 10 to 15 then that would finally allow for 120 hertz refresh rates and the ability to reverse charge other phones which are both features that i'm regularly reminded that i'm missing out on versus the competition and just on the subject of battery this battery notification that takes up the entire screen and pauses whatever video you may be watching or game you may be playing is really annoying it's minor in the grand scheme of things but it's the perfect example of apple being too patronizing fine some users may benefit from a little warning when they hit the five percent mark but a all we need is a little pop-up on top that disappears on its own b this wouldn't be an issue in the first place if we were actually allowed to see our battery percentage up top here and see the majority of users are very aware when their battery is low and don't need to be interrupted on two separate occasions to be reminded when they've got both 20 and 10 left three two one okay the reason i'm confident doing that is because of something called shock spread it's the material that rhino shield uses on all cases and what they're saying is that this one material combined with the honeycomb lattice on the inside has all the protection of a dual aid case without needing two layers it actually means that the minimum safe drop distance while using one of these cases is 11 feet which unless you ate a lot of spinach as a child is more than the height you're going to be holding it from which i'm pretty sure is the reason you get a lifetime replacement warranty with every case but the thing that's really important to me is that it's coated in such a way that you can pretty much just wipe off stains like you know it's covered in dirt right now because well i threw it outside on the ground not anymore oh yeah and you can choose your buttons your rim colors your back plate there are literally a million different ways you can make this look everything from nasa to naruto and if you use the code mr boss you can get 20 off in the first week of this video going live to find out how many spy cameras are recording you right now i've got a video here or to see which tech company has the worst customer support that's over here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one
