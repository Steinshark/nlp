it feels like every day a new celebrity announces an nft project that you've just gotta buy they hype you up send you to a discord group and they promise you a road map riches in other words they promise you the world that is right up to the day of the mint but i want to know what happens after that after everyone buys in what happens to the thousands of fans who just invested into their favorite celebrity do they go to the moon and get rich or do the fans lose money that's what we're discussing today i've gathered 20 celebrity nft projects and i want to take you on a where are they now journey i didn't pick them ahead of time knowing which ones are doing poorly or doing well and let me say ahead of time this is not about you know what is a scam what's not and i'm definitely not endorsing any of these projects i just want to look at the facts like how are all these projects doing what was the price what is the price today and my hope is that by zooming out we can get a macro view of whether it's a good idea to invest in celebrity nfts in the first place and we're going to start with justin bieber who promoted a project called the inbetweeners which is a collection of bear nfts and it's the first thing you see when you click on his instagram with 254 million followers at an initial mint price of 0.27 ethereum the project has been pretty popular for the most part even though sales have dried up a little bit despite justin continuing to support it the current price is down about 30 which in this market is decent and can be described as not a total disaster which is more than i can say for our next celebrity example takashi six nine six nine is known for many things he's known as being a rapper in the most technical of census he's known as being a snitch in the most legal of senses but he's also known as being a serial nft promoter he's one of the few people on this list actually who's promoted multiple projects the first one trolls had an initial min price of two solana but trolls was accused of being a scam when six nine didn't deliver on the promises big shock and it quickly plummeted to one percent of its original price and even takashi 69 admitted it was basically a cash grab but that his next project called jean a would be different i know a lot of you guys are wondering what happened with six nine's last nft project i want to first start off by saying i apologize i apologize because i jumped in to the nft community without knowing what an nft was i didn't know what an nft was i didn't know what crypto was i wasn't well informed it was a paid partnership that i took advantage of and i said you know what let me get into something that i don't know that much about so to all my fans who joined that i extremely apologize for that being done what makes this so different what makes g a nft collection so different is that it's not a paid partnership this is my brand so with all that said was jean a different how did it do well not great the original price was .22 ethereum which you can now buy for .035 ethereum so the price has fallen by like 85 percent and things aren't going well it looks like more of the same now for the record the reason i'm using ethereum and solana prices instead of pricing everything in us dollars is because with crypto crashing i want to eliminate the fluctuations in the crypto market as much as possible i think it's unfair to say this nft cost four thousand dollars now it costs two thousand dollars without acknowledging okay well ethereum has fallen by fifty percent so the idea is by pricing everything in the currency it was bought and we can ignore these fluctuations and focus on actually how the project did and with that said let's talk about one of the worst celebrity nft projects this year lana rhodes kryptosis now we've kind of covered this in detail already cryptosys was a hot mess and not the kind people were expecting there were too many promises way too many disappointments and at a mint price of 0.1 ethereum the project is now down over 99 and what did lana rhodes do about it she accused her followers of being too negative and said they put her in a bad headspace and she's left the internet because of it but not all nft projects go poorly and up next we've got a good example of a project that's doing well we're talking about garyvee with his v friends and i've got to say he's kind of crushing it with stick figure caliber drawings proving once again it's not about how good your art is because these are five-year-old doodle-level drawings but they're selling for the price of an economy car with a mint price between 2.5 ethereum and 0.5 ethereum early investors are very happy their investments are up several hundred percent i think they're selling for like over six ethereum now and i think the x factor is obviously garyvee himself and the project's exclusive access to vcon which is an nft event he throws every single year now as a quick reminder i'm not endorsing v friends i don't think you should go buy one just because the price went up before doesn't mean it will continue to go up and our next celebrity is a great example of this reese witherspoon is a famous actress who promoted the nfc project called world of women with a media deal to produce movies and tv shows and at first glance it seems like a slam dunk promotion because at an initial mint price of 0.08 ethereum it's now selling for a lot more than that so if you'd invested early when she first tweeted about it you'd be doing pretty well however her biggest announcement came in the middle of february which is actually near the top of the price of world of women so if you had invested then you'd basically be down 75 of your original investment which makes this project a good example of it's not what you buy it's also when you buy it now keeping with this theme of female celebrities in crypto we're going to move on to our next example lindsay lohan she promoted something called the canine cartel nft which is a dog nft minting for .05 ethereum fast forward to today lindsay has deleted her tweet promoting it and the project is down 90 now this whole thing of delete and distance isn't exactly an original idea many celebrities have figured this out it's what john wall did who's a basketball player who created the baby ballers in ft which we've also talked about its website is now deleted but originally it was minted for 0.15 ethereum and is now also down 90 with most investors being unable to sell their nfts at all and this is just kind of a recurring trend athletes and bad nfts really go well together our next celebrity tyson fury follows the same pattern he had a collection that minted for 330 to 550 and it's unclear if you can even sell these now because basically no one wanted them in the first place only a few hundred sold so he didn't make a lot of money but you know who did make a lot of money floyd mayweather floyd launched floyd's world at a mint price of 0.15 ethereum and it sold pretty well but currently they're selling for less than one percent of their original mint price which judging from their onboarding video makes sense because this isn't exactly a high budget operation welcome everyone do you want to learn how to gain access to floyd's world it's easy just follow me honestly no i don't i think i'm good but we're gonna keep with this theme of bad nft animations for our next celebrity kevin hart who recently released a project called confessions from the heart which is part nft project part roku animated series which is supposed to promote it except the roku animated series is like almost indescribably bad for someone who has access to millions of dollars this is when i realized you just don't know who people are it looks like a college student's project or something and if floyd's animations are so bad they're almost funny kevin hart's animations are so bad that they aren't funny at all the only thing that might be funny is this project's current price it's down already 50 in only a month which it's just it's just rough i mean what did you expect guys mike tyson is up next with a personal nft collection which he sold for .15 2.5 ethereum not much to say here the prices are considerably down from its all-time high in september and i'm sure you've noticed sort of a trend here where projects have a boom and then a bust they initially get hyped they get sales and then over time the celebrity and the holders just kind of lose interest in the nft and that kind of makes sense it's hard to maintain that initial hype no matter how good the intentions and that's the lesson of our next celebrity steph curry who created a famous basketball nft collection called the 2974 collection and it was a big deal because he said that a hundred percent of profits would go to charity which sounds great but at an initial mint price of 500 the initial hype was high and now the price is significantly lower than that and sales are mostly dead so i guess the question is how do you avoid these boom bust cycles of hype and then disappointment well many nft celebrities have tried a lot of different things some like french montana a rapper experiment with real world utility french montana's project is called coke boys kicks which was pitched as a digital sneaker which is paired with like a physical one now this project just wasn't unique enough to escape the fate of many mmts before them and coke boys kicks are now down nearly 80 percent so it's hard to avoid the death of hype although some manage it better than others our next group you guys know i'm not the biggest fan of it's the nelk boys they released their project called meta card at an initial mint price of 0.75 ethereum and sold 23 million however even so the price has only dipped like 20 in the last several months which frankly really surprised me i mean i guess the nelk fan base just won't let this one die which fair enough neither will our next example stan lee's nft collection wow that's a bad segue let's talk about that though i mean what a disaster that was he released something from beyond the grave called choc reverse nft and obviously it's not his fault it's some like greedy corporate estate which released it in its name and at a mint price of 200 for crappy art i imagine the marvel's exacts are pretty proud okay maybe that's a cheap shot at marvel studios but then again you know what else is cheap these nfts now they're down 75 from their initial mint price which again is just sort of the norm across these celebrity nfts regardless of where you look most of the nft market tends to do worse after the mint it's just how it is even so-called real artists like grimes will release stuff like you know this earth collection she did originally it'll cost 7 500 and now it's selling for 200 asap rocky faced the same problem with his project which initially sold for 2 000 and is now selling for 400 and that's not even to talk about all the cash grabs going on you also have things like little uzi vert with his eternal beings nft which initially minted for 2.5 solana and now he's abandoned the project and it's basically become unsellable these abandonments happen all the time too because you have people like jake paul he releases the sacred nft project or partners with it and now he abandons it and it's down 90 so not only do you have to worry about the general problem of hype dying you also have to worry about your celebrity just abandoning the project in general and i know this has been a lot so i kind of want to summarize a lot of this information i just gave you let's kind of recap how these projects did i've shared 20 of them with you and of those 20 only two of them are still above mint price the friends and world of women another two of these projects were at least close to their initial mint price maybe within 20 or 30 percent while the rest are down nearly 90 to 99 and are basically worthless so what's the lessons well firstly celebrity nfts are definitely not about the arc the most successful project is a series of scribbles so if anything i learned that nfts are just about building and maintaining hype and the truth about hype is that it's easy to build at first because you can just promise people anything but it's hard to deliver on and maintain in the long run the other lesson that i learned which i haven't talked about much is that there's an asymmetric risk to buying nfts because while the average investor of these nft projects has lost a lot of money all the celebrities who delivered on them made money i mean it's very easy to make money selling in nft because you can make them for cheap and sell them for hundreds to thousands of dollars which means that while it's a big risk for you as a buyer it's not a risk at all for the celebrity which might be why they like them so much and for these reasons and the general risk of scams and rug pulls and the fact you'd be relying on a celebrity for your financial well-being i'd have to say celebrity nfts are a bad bet i jumped in to the nft community without knowing what an nft was i didn't know what an nft was i didn't know what crypto was i wasn't well informed which i guess did i really have to prove that in the first place no you probably already knew that but i think it was interesting taking a look at the life cycle of these different nft projects and i hope you've learned something
