this is apple's most expensive flagship oh holy cow and this is samsung's i hate this i hate this i hate this oh my god so we have just surgically smashed both of these phones we've applied the same amount of force to the exact same spot on both for a reason because we can now test the repair processes both bs have had the exact same thing done to them so we can find out who's going to take longer to repair it who's going to charge more to repair it and who's actually going to repair it better all right let's see who's going to service me the best huh let's start with apple tell me how can i help you today i broke my iphone i see you're calling from an iphone is that the same iphone you're calling about no different iphone great thanks in a few words it's not great just impaled my phone sorry hello welcome to apple support my name is m hey it's aaron i appear to have impaled my iphone this morning it's a very interesting case on a can you tell me which device it would be yes it's an iphone 14 pro max so when it comes to the phone itself is it bent a little bit i'm going to say it's flat he's very attentive he's definitely trying to fix the mess i've course there are lots of long periods of silence on this call i love how simba is just politely waiting outside okay so when it comes to options obviously about getting it repaired we do have the reservation into door we also have the sended option so we'd rather post it that's okay yeah yeah i mean by all means yeah okay that's brilliant okay let me quickly get an estimate for the correct screen it would be an estimated price of including tax l 47424 for the screen yes for the crack screen right wow okay we'll go ahead with it as soon as i make the payment the repair process starts yes yes then the box will be shipped out to you from once two business days yep yep okay great thank you l 474 half the price of the phone i mean the guy was very thorough he was clearly trying to fix the problem and even going above and beyond like very much making sure that i'd backed up my stuff like i'd secured my accounts and all those kind of things the price is insane and it also seems like they've got a lot of processes in place like that was a 30- minute call please samsung be faster thank you for calling samsung please hold the options to speak to a samsung expert samsung expert galaxy s23 press one so it's very quickly trying to get details about the phone i'm calling about to to channel me to the right person which is good good afternoon to the speaking can i take your name please hi it's aaron i can't hear you very well i'm so sorry that better now a little bit better yeah thank you so i've managed to sit on my samsung phone and the screen is shattered for you sorry it would be out of volun due to the damage of the des that's okay just before i do alam can i go ahead and read out short gdpr statement please yes got to love gdpr can i get you title please mister a lot of heavy breathing happening down the line she's doing well though so far it's only been 8 minutes and i think we're getting there the first option i can give you is a deep deflection where deep de reflect the device from the next working day wow brilliant so they'll take you to the repairer the engineer will assess the device they'll send your priz quotation to email that would be great perfect is there anything else you like to husand today no thank you very much can somebody buy that lady a better microp but aside from that she was great the whole call was 12 minutes she managed to book the collection for tomorrow they've not taken any money at all and they're going to get back to me with a final quote without me having to do anything where is apple is charging up front and then they're also saying that that might not be the full fee we'll find out when they inspect it let's wait for collection i guess oh just remembered i need to actually pay apple 47424 i didn't have to wait long for some action literally the next morning is this for samsung i couldn't believe they're collecting it already that is insane and then just one day later a little box is just coming from apple this is going very smoothly so far wait a second place your iphone in the bag oh so not in the box that doesn't make any sense but they've removed this it's like they designed this instruction manual for a past version of this packaging i guess i'll just do what i think makes sense so the bag has one label which means if i put this on the outside it's going to end up in the uk which kind of makes sense but then if i put the box on the outside then my package is shipping to china well it can't be both so i'm going to do what i think makes sense which is to send it to the uk office and then presumably if they decide that it does need a repair they'll then send it to china themselves to get that done but wow this needs to be clearer all righty we're doing it i'm not exactly reassured this is going to where i want it to the company arranging a collection for you like samsung did is just so much cleaner as a solution but hey at least both wheels are in motion now this is where the true test of customer service begins so we're currently toward the end of day four now and i still heard nothing from either company starting to get a little nervous that said samsung did say they'd give me a follow-up for when i first wrung them and that's going to be tomorrow so maybe i'll feel better after that i did not hello yeah hi hi i can see that the repair was unable to be collected it has been reassigned yesterday the device was collected next day how would it have not reached the service [music] center one second let me have a look okay it was collected in a samsung box so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pop you in a brief hold and i'm going to call the 7 center just so we can be sure that's not great they're very confused like samsung shouldn't be the one asking me what the reference number of the collection that they arranged is have you heard about bix have you heard about bixby yes i've heard about bixby sometimes i wish i hadn't hi thank you so much for holding aon i have spoken to the service c they have definitely got your device okay there was a mixed up with the service solders so they are repairing the device as we speak right and when would i expect that to be expecting to get that done within the next two days thank you very much right slightly scary that they didn't seem to know where the phone was or that it had been collected at all but we're on top of it now and this is apparently according to them still going to schedule so it seems like while samsung prefers to go for more of the call approach apple is more of a texter so they've sent me three text messages one was as soon as i had the call to say we've heard you one was when the shipping box was on its way and they just now sent me one to say that your product reached apple will start your repair now i'd say generally in life i actually prefer calls cuz it feels like you're more direct and you can get stuff done quicker but that is technically wasting less of my time like i just spent 15 minutes on hold with samsung this is kind of crazy i just got an email from apple support saying our technicians have successfully prep your product and are preparing it for shipment will let you know when it's on its way it's only been 2 days since i shipped it but it actually kind of got better in that same day they' not just received the product and repair the product but also shipped it from their warehouse i mean yes i did nearly gag when they first told me the price of repair but this does slightly soothe that burn just like it would if you subscribed so we can overtake apple we are actually closer than i thought we ever could be and before i knew it on day six it was back with me but we're not going to open to check it until we have both phones together so i just come back from a weekl long trip in america done a 4-day trip in a cabin doing absolutely nothing which was great by the way but the samsung phone is still not here okay so i found the samsung chat support page track an existing repair smartphones sorry i could not find the repair status information but i've definitely typed it in right samsung what have you done why is this so difficult i just want to call somebody hello and thank you for calling samsung oh thank goodness does anyone else hate the fact that companies are constantly trying to offload call center stuff to help us improve our service to you we'd be grateful if you could spend a couple of minutes after your call today to tell us about your experience of our colleague i think it's best for you that i don't i'm just want to check the status of my repair looking to return the device without repair say the repair quotation was declined do you need some kind of response to the service center no i haven't they should have sent an email in some form of a quotation around the repair i don't remember seeing an email okay interesting i mean i can second that i'll spell itally is good wait did you say s for sierra yeah it should be mc okay i apologies they do have my number right they do have your number for the should call is one or the other so they'll always attemp by if don't he respon should have call any other question then have miss time no that's good thank you i mean he was helpful he was very apologetic and i don't think this is his fault but samsung is kind of screwing up here so they noted down the email address wrong but then even then if the email wasn't being responded to they should have tried to call me but they didn't it does also feel like the organizational structure isn't quite here like the service center only works monday to friday 9 till 5 and then it seems like the entire rest of the company isn't able to communicate or adjust orders based on this so they're not keeping track of what's happening in the repair center it's a completely separate process that you have to yourself contact separately so i've just woken up to a very unfortunate text message it's from dpd and they're saying we will deliver your samsung parcel today they've not repaired it back to square zero i'm pretty sure this is my samsung phone but is it repaired or is it exactly as i left it oh my god i'm so nervous no that's still cracked so we started the process again new call for collection new collection new set of forms we filled out and even when it all went right this was still not a good experience okay we finally have a link to pay 223 no way and then they're saying that if i decline to pay that i pay l15 charge i guess because they've taken the time to look at it less than half the price of apples right money paid question now is how long it takes them to repair it and get it back to me yeah i can't believe we're nearly at the end of this process now all right so it's now been five full days of it just saying pending repairs there's been no calls there's been no communication and i'm just thinking if this was my actual main phone being repaired that had my sim card in that everyone used to contact me on what would i do for these 5 days but even the tortoise eventually finishes the race oh man after all this time all the emails the online forms the support calls i can't believe we're actually here i guess we'll start with the samsung nothing feels better than unboxing your own phone for the third time it's all properly sealed up very nice why do i always do that i'm actually slightly nervous i think i'm just scarred from the last time i opened this box it's done it's repaired shining new samsung again and i can tell it's my samsung not the replacement because i sent in a really specific red variant of it the glass looks completely perfect there are zero dead pixels on the screen this is seemingly a fully successful repair can't wipe the smile off my face so so apple which is much more reasonably sized package considering it's just got a carry a phone w this is the iconic apple your product has been repaired box and we're repaired we are golden thank goodness for that completely spotless from the back i think they've given it a polish as well that's very nice them there we go the bootup screen so what does this mean well apple charged us a lot of money they charge it up front they charge it without even checking the device but at least for that the phone was back with me 5 days after i first made the call samsung was more affordable but every part of the service experience reflects that 29 days is far far too long to be potentially without a phone so honestly neither of these was a reassuring experience and it just makes me want to go to a corner shop and pay 50 in total then i have lost over $700 making this video but it turns out i can get myself back that amount in discounts just by using paypal honey i was in the us recently for a trip and while i was out there i was browsing the market for tvs more cuz i was curious how us prices can compared to uk prices but then i noticed something crazy i added this one to the basket honey popped up and it was just like no don't pay that for that tv you get the exact same thing for significantly less money if you just buy it here instead and then when there isn't a cheaper website you
