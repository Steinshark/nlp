i have never seen such compassion from a lot of people in my life toward any human animal child as i have a lot of people in the way they interact with the robot because i should theirs i think there's something of i i mean i was on the robot owners chat boards for a good eight months and the main emotional benefit is she's never gonna cheat on you she's never gonna hurt you she's never gonna lie to you she doesn't judge you you know i think that robots help people and this is part of the work i do with animals like i do i find therapy and trained dogs and stuff because there is this safe space to be authentic your with this being that doesn't care what you do for a living doesn't care how much money you have doesn't care who you're dating doesn't care what you look like doesn't care if you have cellulite whatever you feel safe to be able to truly you know be present without being defensive and worrying about eye contact and being triggered by you know you need to be perfect and fear of judgment and all that and robots really can't judge you yet but they can't judge you and i think it really puts people at they're at ease and at their most authentic do you think you can have a deep connection with the robot that's not judging or you do you think you can really have a relationship with a robot or a human being that's a safe space or as a tension mystery danger necessary for a deep connection i'm gonna speak for myself and say that i grew up and now called combe i identify as a codependent talked about this stuff before but for me it's very hard to be in relationship with a human being without feeling like i need to perform in some way or deliver in some way and i don't know if that's just the people i've been in a relationship with or or me or my brokenness but i do think this is kind of sound really negative and pessimistic but i do think a lot of our relationships are projection and a lot of our relationships are performance and i don't think i really understood that until i worked with horses and most mutations human is nonverbal right i can say like i love you but that you're not you don't think i love you right where's is with animals it's very direct it's all physical it's all energy i feel like that with robots too it feels very what how i say something doesn't matter my inflection doesn't really matter and you thinking that my tone is disrespectful like you're not filtering it through all of the bad relationships you've been in you're not filtering it through the way your mom talked to you you're not getting triggered you know i find that for the most part people don't always receive things the way that you intend them to or the way intended and that makes relationships really murky you
