i've just wasted $450 on one of the most elaborate scams in existence and for some reason the uk government was promoting it 5g you've heard about it a thousand times already you might love it you might be kind of interested but just a bit bored of hearing about it or you might be in the increasingly vocal community of people who hate it i've seen with my own two eyes people who say that 5g is being used by the military to control us that 5g is what's caused the virus that's going around and even that lockdown is just the government's way of installing 5g towers all over the place without people being able to stop them but fear not the 5g bioshield is here to save us using none other than proprietary holographic nano layer catalyst technology i'm sorry what a proprietary holographic of nano layer a catalyst it sounds a bit like someone just jumped two random pages of a chemistry textbook and picked the first words they saw but i gave him the benefit of the doubt i spent a full day in fact reading through everything this website had to say they say that in our modern world we're surrounded by emf or electromagnetic fields and this is true there are electromagnetic fields everywhere everything from your smartphone to your microwave contributes to this but that's pretty much the only correct piece of science on the entire website they go on to say that 5g makes these fields much stronger to the point where they're dangerous and that you need to use their product to shield yourself so the way this apparently works is you plug it into your computer and it creates a 40 meter of force field around you and if that doesn't already sound ridiculous enough they claimed that even without power even if you're just carrying this in your bag with you it can still create a permanently protective and i quote plasmic shield of 8 meters now where if i heard of plasmic shields before oh yeah stalls the shield apparently uses can't even make this stuff up quantum oscillation to restore the coherence of atoms and emit lifeforce frequencies the false star wars i feel like a link is forming and if is that around this point that i thought goodness sake i've got to try it i've got to make a hundred percent sure that this is in fact the pile of garbage that it looks like so i ordered one and the purchase process was about as jd as the science behind it is listed at 283 pounds but the second you add it to the cart you quickly realize they're going to add sales tax on top of that companies don't usually do that in the uk and when you factor in the additional twelve pound shipping fee this ends up at 350 one pound 16 and of course the only way to pay is a direct bank transfer which has zero payment protection so stomach - i thought this is 350 pounds i'm not expecting to see again but a sub to the channel would be amazing miracles do happen in two weeks later little package rock through the door i picked it up i immediately know what it was i sprinted to the studio ripped open the box and smashed it into my computer wow this is the best thing i've ever seen in my life and thanks to quantum nano particle the electric forces and you can get the effects just by watching through your screen you're welcome okay no it is exactly what it looks like this is a usb stick and in fact the only surprise i had here was the fact that its total capacity maxes out at 128 megabytes they've even been so kind as to drop a full twenty five page document on there which includes a before and after health summary from people who've been using the shield it says but most users report reverse aging by' years so according to that i'm about to turn seven it makes these definitely real reviews of the product a little suspect i'm thrilled by the science on which basis the device has been created i'm not a physicist you don't say but i understand partially with my intuition daniella says the people i work with seem to be more happy and laugh more thus i could believe and this one's my favorite the item you have created is not only ingenious but exquisitely beautiful and design all of this speaks to me about the people you are so i want you to know that i appreciate you as well as what you're doing namely contributing towards a new heaven on earth right let me try and put some perspective on the ship's cupidity of the words being written here heaven on earth it's a usb it registers as a usb and guess what it took me five minutes to find an almost identical product on aliexpress it's the same color it's got the same poor build quality it's three dollars and you wanna know the best part that one was more storage the single difference between this product and that listing is a sticker not anymore but you know what's worse is that this whole operation is run by two scientists my assumption when i first came across by shield was okay this is obviously stupid it's probably run by two people who don't know what they're talking about people who didn't understand the science and people who themselves were just convinced by their own theories but that's not what's happening here these guys more than likely knew exactly what they were making here and even if they somehow believed the stuff they've written on the site to start with then surely surely at the point when you're on the purchasing page for a three dollar usb stick which is actually what you're about to send to customers something must have clicked this is not people being delusional this is a very deliberate scam but wait there's more i know kill me now it turns out the glastonbury town council in the uk the official government-funded body they set up an advisory council for 5g and they recommended this product their exact words where we use this device and we find it helpful it does one thing and it does that one thing's so poorly if i wanted to fit this one video file on these bio shield sticks i need to buy 250 of them it would cost me a hundred thousand dollars in what world is that helpful it looks like what happened is it was just one person who said i've used this i can recommend it and nobody else batted an eyelid but come on i mean it doesn't take a genius but probably the weirdest part of this scam is that compared to most schemes like this where companies make a quick buck by being super vague about what's going on this company has answer for everything a group of people called the pen test partners they took one of these things apart and they said to the company look we can see it's the usb stick what do you have to say for yourself i could believe it a spokeswoman from the company actually replied she said we're in possession of a great deal of technical information with plenty of backup historical research as you can understand we are not authorized to fully disclose all the sensitive information to third parties ah yeah of course the secrets stay with you and the glastonbury 5d committee and the directors of star wars they've got an faq on their website and someone's asked can i use an electromagnetic field meter to be able to test that it is in fact producing the radiation it's a fair question using a meter would be the best way of testing if it's actually doing anything but they actually had the audacity to say no your meter only measures the intensity of the emf which our device doesn't change our device only changes the form of the emf and oh my god guess what only they have the tools to be able to measure that how do we know if it's on and working great question as see what they say it is always on and working that's why we used quantum nano layer technology oh yes it makes sense anyways i spent three days in total just looking into this stuff and while it did start off funny i think by the end of it i was actually a bit worried it turns out 5g bioshield is just one of many many schemes like this there are anti 5g blankets there are watches and believe it or not underwear i even found a company called vortex who's selling anti 5g charms it's genuinely on the same level as wearing a piece of garlic around your neck to keep the vampires away and if you thought we'd already hit peak stupidity then you'd be wrong a very quick search on youtube shows videos that claim to use a certain vibrational frequency to shield you from 5g genius so i'm going to finish this video with a very simple message if anyone you know is considering buying one of these tell them not to if this ever pops up on an instagram or a facebook advert which it might well do after watching this video don't buy it please don't buy it and without being said my name is erin this is mr. he's the boss i'll catch you in the next one [music]
