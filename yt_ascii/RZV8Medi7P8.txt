welcome i will be your coding assistant today 
okay okay it's just me and no i'm not going to   be your coding assistant today but i am going 
to share with you some of my favorite ai coding   assistants that will help you build faster more 
efficiently and you can even utilize if you are   not a coder meaning if you are a business 
owner project manager any kind of leader in   the digital space understanding what developers 
are working on or a little bit about code can   really help set you apart so whether you are a 
developer digital leader anyone in between these   tools will really help benefit you all right 
let's get into some ai coding tool assistance   foreign speaking about using technology to 
monitor and manage different solutions i   want to share with you about pulseway i'm sure 
you can relate to this have you ever needed to   be in multiple places at once to manage your 
it systems this is where pulseway comes in   you can try pulse way which is the ultimate 
it monitoring and management solution for it   professionals so with pulse weight you gain 
real-time visibility and control with all   your systems servers and applications from 
your fingertips you're able to stay ahead   with instant alerts and resolve problems on 
the go with our intuitive mobile app so this   really allows you to boost productivity 
minimize downtime and supercharge your it   operations with pulse way and the best part is 
they are offering you all of my viewers a free   trial and special savings that i link down 
below make sure to go check them out [music] one of the most useful applications of ai 
coding assistance is to use it for code search   so no longer do you have to sift through the 
documentation sift through stack overflow you can   utilize this tool that's implemented right within 
your code base now for this i would say one of the   best out there right now is github copilot also 
if you disagree i'm curious to hear why and leave   other tools that you love for this down below with 
this you are able to describe in human language   what exactly you are searching for or looking to 
implement in the code and in turn it will give you   some suggestions so let's go through an example 
of this let's use github copilot so as we know   it's trained on millions of lines of public code 
and it can rapidly scan all of these lines of code   and find answers for you okay let's use this 
example say you are building a web application   and you're using flask and want to implement user 
authentication and login so instead of searching   online our old way of something like a flask login 
code samples or how to implement authentication   and login with flask you can simply write a 
comment with github copilot so let's pull it up   on screen here maybe it would be a comment such as 
authenticate user login with flask and what github   copilot will do is share with you or generate code 
such as this which really goes through the entire   step-by-step process and also to leave some really 
nice comments number two is get ai code completion   suggestions as you're typing code ai assistance 
can suggest completions to really speed up the   process and this doesn't mean similar to using ai 
for writing or creating different content it's not   as though you have to take it for exactly what it 
spits out to you but you can take that and modify   it to your company's coding practices if you're 
allowed to do something like github copilot of   course don't just use ai tools without confirming 
with your manager and taking that piece so that   it spits out for you and altering it or modifying 
it to make sure it fits properly within the code   base but it is a great way to really code at a 
much quicker rate so as you can see on screen   here here's an example on github's copilot website 
actually that does just this you are typing and it   will suggest some code for you number three is use 
ai to help you generate boilerplate code this is   another way that will save you a lot of time when 
you are coding and also help you generate files   that are kind of consistent or repetitive tasks 
such as say you are building a config file or a   test ai can really help generate the boilerplate 
or the boiler yeah the boilerplate code to get   started now i want to take a step back from github 
co-pilot because i know we've been speaking a lot   about that i'll share different ones throughout 
this video this one is called cody and it is by   sourcegraph now cody can do a few different things 
uh it's i've been tinkering around with it it's   pretty cool but in terms of what we are speaking 
about for point number three you can input with   kodi to generate boilerplate code for specific 
files and it will spit it out for you on another   note though i have to share with you something 
that's pretty cool i'll put up on screen here   i was going going through cody and different 
examples with it one that i can totally relate   to and maybe you can as well is around regex 
and specifically when someone on your team is   has written a regex and they don't comment what it 
is for and it's this long crazy string and you're   like what is going on here i used to always input 
it into google and search up on stack overflow or   use different regex tools that are supposed to 
tell you what is going on but it's just like a   whole puzzle i thought this was really cool you 
can simply highlight it and say cody what is going   on here or explain to me what this regex is and 
it will explain to you in simple terms that would   have saved me so many hours to think about the 
fact that the majority of my coding career or my   developer career i should say was done before ai 
was really popular it's so frustrating i missed   out on so many time saving tools coming in at 
number four is refactoring code this is a great   way if you want to really standardize code across 
your team or even if you are building something   on your own and ensuring that you are doing so 
with best practices and a way that this could be   done if you're working on a team is of course 
you're all using the same ai tool and having   it implemented or customized i should say 
depending on what tool you're using that when you   say you know refactor this code it refactors it in 
a way that makes sense and flows with other team   members codes and this is across all different ai 
tools that can really do it in this example i'll   still lean on cody for it because you know i'll 
do two examples of each and i think cody does a   really good job of it it sounds like i'm talking 
about a person i keep on saying cody cody ai does   a good job of this which i'll share on screen here 
okay this next one is probably one of my favorite   ways which is using it to implement automated 
code reviews now for this this is a great way   especially if you maybe are learning how to code 
or building something on your own and you want   someone else to review your code having ai do 
it could be a good way to go about it just use   it with a grain of salt or cautionary depending on 
what tool you are using there is the factor of the   human touch still but for this example let's 
use claude and you simply can input your code   or a piece of your code into the ai and then it 
will suggest for you different areas of feedback   or improvement it also might help you identify 
future or potential bugs that are vulnerable   in your code there is nothing more i hate than 
writing documentation and coming in at number six   is utilizing ai to help you write documentation 
here's how you do it now this is a huge time saver   i don't care what anyone says even if you're 
against using ai which honestly at this point   i think you need to embrace if you want to grow 
your career but using ai to write documentation   can save so much time even to have a template for 
writing the documentation yes you'll have to go in   and probably change some things on your own but 
having that starting point is huge i don't know   about you but i have so much trouble starting 
uh pen to paper if you will or whatever the   technical jargon is for that keyboard to screen i 
don't know but to start something like where do i   begin so using ai to at least write a template 
for this documentation is such a great way to   really build faster and more efficiently now for 
this this tool i absolutely love i'm just typing   it into my browser right now actually it's called 
swim and i've shared with you before about swim   obsessed with it it creates code docs it finds 
the docs syncs with docs it's next level i've   played around with them in the past before but 
i'll share some videos with them on screen here   they do so much more than what i'm using this 
example but it is honestly probably the best   tool for generating documentation and keeping 
it up to date foreign this is something i haven't   heard as many people talk about but it's really 
cool and it might not be perfect but it's a great   way if you are learning one programming language 
and always already have experience with another   to understand what is going on with that code now 
depending on what language you are translating to   another language this might not always work but 
it is a really interesting exercise to kind of   tinker around with and for this there are you know 
endless tools to use i don't know for something   like this if i was tinkering around i'd probably 
go back to something like claude ai for example   where it's you know a free tool that i can easily 
input my code into and get an explanation for why   and what it translated to like why did it what is 
going on with this code that was translated into   another coding language i haven't seen number 
eight spoken about before which is utilizing ai   to help you with coding tutorials create coding 
tutorials and this isn't just asking ai to write   code for you let me explain now this one can work 
with really any language that you or any ai tool   that you using but it's such a fun way to if you 
are onboarding say a junior developer or wanting   to make your own coding tutorials leaning on ai 
not to write the code for you per se but to kind   of if you have this project or you have these 
chunks of code how to break it down in a way   that viewers or readers whatever the situation 
is i would best be able to learn from it and   it's just kind of like a way to work in parallel 
with what feels like almost a coding buddy or a   coding someone who knows code as you are working 
on these tutorials with it not being a real person   but it gives feedback and suggestions which is 
always helpful number nine is using ai to help   you summarize blocks of code this can be super 
helpful if done right another tool that's really   great for summarizing blocks of code would be 
tab nine now i haven't had as much experience   with tab 9 so i'm curious if you have but i've 
heard really great things about it and i think   i haven't played around with it as much because 
it is i believe you have to pay well starter for   one user so individuals is free which is good 
but a lot of companies use tab nine it's more   geared towards companies enterprises larger teams 
but it is a great way as well a great ai tool and   it does all of what we've been speaking about in 
this video including summarized blocks of code   coming in at number 10 is if you don't have a pair 
programmer like i do aka mr mugs you can use ai to   help you pair a program what do you think about 
that mugs you'll never be replaced by ai and this   is something that we've really been talking about 
throughout the entire video or alluding to which   is it is kind of like a pair programmer it can 
review your code in real time as you are working   suggest other pieces of code to you moderate 
camera just died being really real here let's   summarize though at the end of the day any of 
these ai tools can really help you in improving   your coding workflow being more efficient with 
your time and also to generating new ideas of   how to write code you might be stuck in one way i 
mean we all are at the end of the day and seeing   different ways that ai is suggesting for you to 
write code might actually be very beneficial all   right i hope you enjoyed going through the top 
10 ways to use ai coding assistance to help you   in your workflow and be more productive what did 
i miss what are some of your favorite ai coding   tools or just ai tools in general i know some 
of you who watch my videos aren't specifically   developers don't even code but i think these tools 
to varying degrees can still really benefit you   even if you aren't coder for the pure reason 
of i mean tinkering around and understanding   code is really kind of fun in my opinion and even 
if you are a project manager and you don't quote   on a day-to-day basis having an understanding of 
you know being able to use these tools and type   in okay what would this code look like or getting 
a sense of what developers are working on on your   team or if you are a business owner how to kind of 
think of these problems from a coding perspective   could be very helpful leave down any questions in
