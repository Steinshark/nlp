so graphene is a kind of graphite? how, what's the... graphite, graphite looks like that that's a big slab of graphite. i can by using the scotch tape method peel pieces off the way i think of it is that a single atomic layer of graphite is graphene. i knocked it around a bit this be? single molar mono layer by layer graphene where you've got two layers held together by these van der waals forces that's got slightly different electrical properties and then you've got tri layer and when you get up to 50 layers the graphene starts looking black it's you seem to note that one model layer of graphene over a wide part of the electromagnetic spectrum absorbs about 2% of the light intensity incident on it so it's very transparent and that makes it an interesting material as well because you got a transparent conductor amazingly the absorbance of graphene is given by the fine-structure constant times pi. now, if any of you up to sixty symbols, you know, i'm fascinated with the fine-structure constant you could see a sixty symbols video on that andrei guymon costume novoselov isolated graphene from a lump of graphite and for some electrical contacts on and so that had some very interesting electrical properties they made a little transistor out of it what we're waiting for now is to make lots of transistors out to reverse a much more difficult job that it's very difficult to switch off the channel because of a bit of quantum mechanics that the electrons in graphene of this curious band structure graphene does not have a bandgap like silicon or germanium or gallium arsenide a band gap is a gap in energy if you want to get the electrons flowing, you've got to put the fermi energy which tells you the energy of the energy of the highest energy electron you don't want that in in the middle of in the middle of the gap because then you don't get any free electrons or free holes so you guys are gonna push the chemical potential down into the valence band or up into the conduction band they stand bandgap is crucial for being able to turn off your silicon or gallium arsenide field effect transistor because in the band gap between the conduction band and the valence band any electronic state so you could get in there and you can't put them in there by putting in some impurities. those states are evanescent they decay very rapidly in space. so the electrons can't propagate through it when you're in the conduction band about above the bandgap of the valence band below the bandgap the electrons or the missing electrons call the hole called the holes can move very very freely and had pretty good velocities, especially in something like indium phosphide or gallium arsenite that's faster than silicon but silica has got this fantastic property you can oxidize its surface and make silicon oxide now in addition to that, of course in the latest bunch of transits he's not using silicon oxide as the barrier you want a higher dielectric material so you got like a hafnium salts and oxides that can that can push up that and you get more more electrons in your channel for a given gate voltage. what's so exciting about graphene from my kind of looking forwards point of view. well whereas silicon or germanium or indium phosphide or gallium arsenide has a structure like this it's a very rigid structure basically, the diamond structure for silicon silicon is just like diamond except the silica is replacing the carbon atoms. it's a very rigid structure and the electrons can move freely in all three direct dimensions the surface for mosfets the interface between the silicon and the oxide or the hafnium oxide at that surface you've got to be very careful because once you break these bonds and you're changing the chemistry at the atomic level and you can have charge on those on those surface states that charge can be very adverse in principle. you can scatter electrons scattering electrons randomize your momentum so if you're trying to get them to move down a channel with a high current as quickly as possible to make if you wanna switch a device class off if they zigzagging and knocking off impurities and so on till they take longer to go down the device their mobility as it says is reduced so you want it's nice to have a clean surface now the point about graphene. is that graphene? this is a lump of graphite it looks very black. of course but you could take graphite and thin it down by exfoliation using the scotch tape method and i i just did exfoliate a little bit of graphene earlier this surface underneath the sellotape. it's not beginning to look a bit dirty. and those are layers of multi-layer graphite it's not necessarily single layer graphite. they may be five six ten 20 layers, but amongst all that there will be a single model layer of graphene, so having it thin that's really important well having it thin is is interesting from a physical point of view because now we've got the electrons moving in a single mono layer and they move first of all at a very high speed about five times faster than they would in gallium arsenide or indium phosphide three of three to five times faster anyway at a 10 to the 6 meters per second which is actually one 300 through the speed of light curiously enough, which is pretty fast. the problem is that things like silicon germanium gallium arsenide and so on these have a energy gap between the conduction band and the valence band any electron in that gap which are many because there not many states in the gap those electrons tell you get stuck now with graphene there's no energy gap. it's a problem for switching off a transistor. you can't you can't switch it off with a conventional potential so what the manchester group decided to do? they decided to go vertical so by combining what you need to do is two switches current off so this you make a vertical tunnel transistor and a key element of the vertical tunnel transistor is by getting a sister material to graphi and colleagues agonal boron nitride it's got exactly the same crystal structure as graphene except that alternate atoms if all of these are carbon atoms in boran light or this one it would be boron, this will be nitrogen. this will be boron this will be the nitrogen and so on going around here and that creates a very very strong barrier very effective and powerful barrier a barrier in fact at six electoral votes so six times the value of the electron gap in the energy gap in in gallium arsenide and so in this device the graphene layer has put on top of it boron nitride and then on top of that we have another graphene layer and we mount that on silicon silicon oxide and use the silicon as a gate electrode and you use that to control the tunnel current through the layer and using that device we were able to make a transistor in which you could switch off so we were very excited about that that work was published in in science and we were even more surprised and pleased that six weeks off i think six weeks after our paper came out the samsung group came up with a very similar concept and they managed to put about a hundred of these transistors on a chip so i think at that point everybody thought wow, these vertical devices are gonna take off but things do seem to have that doesn't seem to have happened. i think the technology is very difficult we to remember that it took you know many beers decades for silicon to go from just an interesting lab based material into a field effect transistor and then into these incredible integrated circuits with all these transistors on a single chip it takes a lot of time and it takes understanding the physics and understanding the material science but in parallel with with all this work on graphene, i want to emphasize the graphene is one of a large family of similar two-dimensional materials in which you clinics which can be exfoliated and there are about i believe it around the thousand of these materials and one material that we are working on here in nottingham and manchester interesting as well is indium selenide molybdenum disulphide is none materials remember your mali slip used to probably put on the gears of your bicycle on the gear wheels that's a similar material because the molybdenum disulphide sheets can slide over each other with almost no friction so this isn't that very hot material as well now those materials have got an energy gap and an energy gap that depends on the number of atoms you make the crystal out of the great thing about these layered compounds. is that when you break them apart you break the band of ours bonds these these bonds don't get charged don't trap and don't become defects it looks as if you know the electron just doesn't get scattered off that so that's that's an interesting aspect of these devices that people are playing around with and indium selenide this is again a manchester knot in collaboration we produced a feel effect transistor that has some really very good very very nice properties and that was published a few years ago and people that that indium selenide 'sister coppers are making quite a big impact at the moment people are working away on it because it's like gap semiconductor and you can combine it you can switch it off with using a field effect and you can also put make or a nitride barriers and not only that but then take one band of ours crystal and then it take another exfoliation one on top of it and make a multiple sandwich structure with lots of layers and bread and butter and so on and they're all sleeping between properties that these materials could have good ab, so could be the em facility, but not no no, no no silicon has got years to go heist i quite like when i my phd i was spent ages trying to put good electrical contacts on silicon and eventually the french colleague put very good contacts on and we were a very nice paper on the electronic properties in bulk silicon but that's forgotten in the history of silicon, but back in 1971-72 we looked at bonito photon resonance. oh, i love silicon. i've got very got me interested in the field really and and curiously enough i yes. i've almost forgotten this gc and plessy were making very primitive feel effect transistors they were blimburn and reliable and we got our hands on some of these and we did some quite interesting quantum experiments on the very first uk feel about transistors we couldn't get them from germany or america, but dc and plessy were making material that materials. so no silicon is a great material. i'm not going to do it done now i've got the token so i can lay the value in add the bay leaf emerged or into it and store it back and hand the target and now i've got the token again i can load something into it into my register add something onto it back and pass the token on and i've got it so i can load the value in add the value from a register story back
