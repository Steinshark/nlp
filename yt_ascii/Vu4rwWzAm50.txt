we got a lot of questions i mean a lot in 
the last 24 hours we got over 100 questions   i can't make this video go on forever or maybe 
i can that length of time i mean i could but i   feel like i would bore you because as you know i 
get very passionate about answering each question   moral stories we are going to be answering 
we who's we me i tiffany i'm going to be   answering your questions today enough of me 
talking let's just do this let's get into it what was that i bought a new i 
had way too much coffee today   okay i'm going to start answering some questions 
and these are questions i ask for you to leave in   my community tab here on youtube so it ranges 
from tech career coding personal you know me i'm   an open book but how i'm going to answer these 
is i'm going to look at some of the top rated   meaning the most thumbs up questions and kind of 
work my way from there question number one i know   there has this is from happy happy happy happy i 
like your username i know there have been a lot of   layoffs in tech recently is this making it harder 
for self-taught programmers to land their first   job that is a great question and i think it's 
something that's been on all of our minds the   amount of layoffs there has been in tech and if 
you turn on the tv or go on the internet it's no   surprise that we all have this kind of fear in the 
back of our minds as the great it started with a   great resignation earlier this year everyone was 
quitting their jobs and then it trickled into   everyone was getting laid off of their jobs so how 
does this affect people who are learning to code   or really even if you aren't a programmer getting 
their first job landing their first job in tech   and i think this is i think this is kind of 
a two-fold and as you know me i'm a bit of   an optimist but let me explain why i think this 
doesn't have to be a bad thing or discourage you   yes there are a lot of layoffs happening 
and that will will pass through that and   it will get back to the hiring cycle and 
demand for programmers i mean there are   there is still a very high demand for programmers 
but what i think will happen is if you are someone   who is job hunting you can feel more reassured 
that if this company is hiring and hiring at quite   great lengths hiring a lot of people they're 
definitely not going to be laying off their   employees right away they're not hiring them on 
the back side of things laying off employees i   mean never say never i'm not saying this is a 
perfect kind of way of looking at things but   that's a great way that i look at it the company 
is really actively hiring and growing most likely   you are pretty safe to interview with them and if 
you decide to go with that company so to answer   your question you it really shouldn't impact you 
at all i would continue to learn you are learning   a skill that is so in demand and will continue 
okay question number two does the tech boot camp   you attend affect your employment and honestly 
the quick answer to that is yeah it really does   and that doesn't mean though if you went to a boot 
camp that maybe wasn't that great or isn't really   helping you out with employment now that you can't 
find a job or you're totally screwed not by any   means but if you are considering going to a coding 
bootcamp it really does coding or any kind of tech   whether it be ui ux design et cetera it does 
matter what boot camp you go to how come because   the support they will offer afterwards and 
their reputation will really affect you   in your job search and this isn't to say that 
if you end up going to a boot camp that isn't   you know ideal and you discover it as you are in 
the process of a coding bootcamp that you can't   get a great job because it comes down to you as a 
person but getting your foot in the door at that   first company after the coding boot camp or tech 
boot camp it does matter what coding boot camp you   went to and i just want to elaborate a little bit 
more on that i'm not trying to scare you by saying   you need to go to this grandiose expensive boot 
camp because they definitely can go to whether   it's self teaching or a coding boot camp and get 
a great job and land a great job at the end of the   day it really comes down to you as a person and 
your willingness to keep on moving forward because   job hunting when you're looking for your first job 
in tech it's hard it's really difficult once you   get your foot in the door that's a different story 
but the initial getting your foot in the door   it's tough let's be honest here and i don't want 
to discourage you if you do go to coding boot camp   or any kind of tech bootcamp that you're like 
oh i wish i would have gone to a different one   you can still get a great job but i'm just saying 
if you are looking to go to a coding bootcamp or   i keep on saying coding then tech bootcamp 
but for any kind of bootcamp definitely take   into consideration what their support what 
support they have for after you graduate   for example i went to a boot camp many many 
years ago and they did not have any support   after i graduated it was literally like shake your 
hand say bye and your good luck and it was a very   difficult process to do on my own and 
i would not recommend it for anyone   okay another question i got asked from 
betty boop i love betty boop great name   what is the hardest thing you've had to face 
when learning to code how do you continue to   be motivated to learn this is a great question 
and i think the initial answer or the answer   some people might think that i would say is 
well learning you know the basic fundamentals   of javascript or python or maybe learning 
sql and about databases is the hardest thing   it actually the hardest thing about coding 
for me when i was learning how to code   wasn't actually the code itself oh man i forget 
to turn off my phone that wasn't actually the code   itself but rather the mental block that comes with 
learning how to code and what i mean by that is   it's very easy when you start learning how to 
code to go online and there are these it's what   feels like this infinite number of resources to 
learn from so-and-so is telling you to learn this   another person is telling you to learn this where 
do you actually begin and it's so overwhelming   alongside that tech is moving so quickly so it 
can often feel like you will never catch up that's   how i felt anyways so to answer your question the 
hardest thing about learning to code that i faced   was the mental blocks that i put on myself the 
self-doubt the self-worth am i good enough am i   smart enough for this and it took a while for me 
to step back and realize that i wasn't being kind   to myself i wasn't speaking to myself as i would 
speak to others i was being really harsh to myself   while going through the process of learning to 
code my biggest advice for anyone who is learning   to code is to be kind to yourself if you're having 
a day where you're frustrated or stuck take a step   back you don't need to keep on pushing forward 
sometimes if you feel like you've just don't   have the energy and another thing alongside that 
if you can find a community or a mentor to support   you i mean that's the whole reason i started to 
contact was to support others in their journey   but if you need more of a one-on-one finding that 
mentorship but really recognizing that sometimes   we are our biggest blocks in learning something 
new and then when you kind of look at it from that   point of view it really helps excel things where 
did i graduate from and what course so i went to   university for graphic communications management 
at ryerson university here in toronto and honestly   the course itself was four years long and it 
was a little bit of everything so it was a bit   of graphic design a bit of communication a bit of 
been a bit a bit a bit of management and it was in   my last year and i'm sure a ton of you have heard 
the story before but it was in my last year that   it was required to take a very basic coding course 
from there i ended up going to a coding bootcamp i   went to brain station and i don't actively share 
where i went to a coding bootcamp because i went   so many years ago that i really don't know what 
it is like now so i'm not going to sit here and   suggest something that i am not familiar with 
and that's why i kind of always am reluctant to   share with you what coding bootcamp i went to 
but i did have a great experience at the time   yeah is age a barrier to learn web development 
and i'm going to speak to this broadly not just   web development but tech in general no there 
is no barrier as far as if you are too old if   you can break into tech or learn something new i 
think one of the great things about tech is it's   evolving so quickly which means you need people 
who are willing to continually learn and grow so   don't put a limit on yourself based on your age 
of course it's important to recognize as you get   older as we get older different obstacles come 
in our way so i'm not saying it's necessarily easy   as you get older but it's definitely possible and 
there is definitely space for you in this industry   what are my music tastes oh this is like the 
most difficult question to be honest because   if you just looked on my spotify or my sonos i do 
sonos a lot so i can listen throughout the house   in different rooms but it's honestly mostly 
just jazz i don't listen to a ton of music   which is really weird and i feel really weird 
thanks what does that say about me as a person   but honestly it's when i'm working i listen to 
i just google or not google search in spotify   different kind of playlists around jazz otherwise 
i don't really listen to music unless we're out or   whatever and that's just kind of whatever music 
is playing so paul i listened to a lot of music   that paul my boyfriend listens to but it'd be rap 
um we're really actually into like electric music   recently i've been listening to a lot of old 
school well not too old but like mgmt that kind of   stuff i don't know that's a really great question 
but it's probably the hardest question on here   but curious to know what is your favorite kind 
of music leave in the comments and let's see how   many similarities we have what is better at the 
beginning of your career freelancing or working   at a company oh this is a great question and 
one i have when i started out i think it really   depends on your personality for me i was someone 
who i knew i needed some more direction at the   beginning of my career some mentorship a lot of 
mentorship and i wasn't ready to take on working   alone finding clients on my own and not having 
that sense of mentorship that being said though   you can find mentorship if you are freelancing 
you just need to actively seek it out so i think   it really depends on what kind of personality 
you are are you someone who's comfortable from   right out the get-go being able to just not know 
really what's coming up you know you're completely   new to the industry you're finding clients 
or you know if you are someone who maybe   wants a bit more stability at the beginning 
of your career starting out at a company is   a great way to go honestly i would gear 
more towards starting out at a company   but once again there's always the exception 
to the rule well this isn't really a rule but   really starting at a company will build 
up your network will build up your skills   so that you can start freelancing on the side and 
then eventually go freelance full-time okay those   are i mean it was just seven questions that i 
answered out of a hundred i would answer more but   i know i'd be here all day i try and answer less 
questions but more in depth for you that being   said if you have questions or if i didn't answer 
the question you have leave it down below in the   comments and i will make sure to answer all of 
your questions down below in the comments if you   haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe
