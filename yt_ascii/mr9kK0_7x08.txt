[music] hey what's up guys i'm kbhd here and welcome to the sequel to the previous video so the part two which is the mini factory tour with elon i want to preface it just with the intro by saying first of all it is really difficult to shoot good video in that factory as you'll both see in here it's extremely loud and extremely busy so this is more of just like a walking around and having fun and checking things out it's it's actually probably just like 15 or 20 of the actual model s and x factory process it's not the whole thing it's mostly just elon showing us around and in fact i didn't even really say much during this interview was more just like a i was kind of like a kid in the matrix just kind of absorbing everything and then it also kind of cuts abruptly at the end when elon basically gets pulled into his next meeting but i still thought it was a ton of fun and worth sharing and also i should mention this entire video shoot this production would not be possible without my buddy john from the tld channel and his crew who helped with audio who were the muscle with the steadicam he has an entire behind-the-scenes video of this process on his channel i'll link that right below so if you want to check that out after watching this in part one feel free but until the next one this is your mini tour of the tesla factory with elon enjoy one that loops back and like i said just gives gives us access to the central corridor yeah so it's really just like lifting it up and over so the car that ends up here came all the way down this previous yeah yeah exactly so like these robots are really just to give us that like through through access okay yeah so so it's gonna pick it up and transfer it to the other robot yeah but i think like you know like a design improvement we should do is like really just the one robot just passes to the other robot just pick it up yeah there's a third one above us yeah it's like it puts it on a table the table rotates it's like like you would do is if we did the sofa we would just have that giant robot pass it to that giant robot fair yeah hand off yeah it's like thousands of like little things like that that help improve production general assembly kind of operates in kind of a use so it goes cars coming over there go all the way down here and then way that way and you can see the car get progressively more complex as it goes down the general assembly line what does it look like when it starts this side of the assembly line oh we can go there there you go there let's go should we start there so at the beginning but here you can get a good sense for there's like like general assembly is what i was talking about as being really well suited to people okay because you got a lot of weird things that you got to put together like you know like look at some of these you know assemblies they're like like it's pretty hard for a robot to like connect this on that makes sense yeah it's you know like depending upon how it comes out of the box it could be like in a little different position but it's pretty easy for somebody like oh it's like i just need to move it like an inch you know bolt it in it's probably really hard to write software to kind of know to adapt in all these different ways yeah so you try to order if you try to have the robot do this you gotta have like a complicated vision system and then like the vision system folds out it's like it's not quite right that's the hard part we have a robot in our studio that moves the camera around and the hardest part is when it falls yeah you need a person there to know what to do exactly so hopefully that doesn't happen much like for parts that are that are complicated and friendly like wiring harnesses are especially difficult you see how like the wiring harness kind of needs to snake through the car yeah it's certainly like like winding like a snake through the car yeah you gotta like poke it through holes and and do diverse things that's super difficult for a robot see like how they're like putting the there's a part of the air conditioning system there right so you use like a little bit of mechanical assistance with the winch and whatnot but then it's pretty straightforward for the guys to just like get that in there and then like if they see there's an issue with the part then like they say oh this product's got a problem like we'll put it over here for to you know to get fixed like this is like semi lines like moving slowly yeah so like moves along and then if you know it gives people like time to get things done like you can like stand on this and i think you mentioned like the the speed of the car coming out the other side is like one mile an hour or something like that yeah it's super slow you want to speed this up right yeah it's not even one mile an hour it's even slower than that right now but for sx but for for three it's like getting close to a mile an hour okay okay but walking speeds three miles an hour so it's like only one third walking speed at one mile an hour all right but you can see like when you look on the inside of the car you see like how many little complicated little pieces there are a lot you know the things that are meant to for installation corrosion protection airbags road noise like it's all the stuff that gets put in here yeah you can see like these are like the side airbags here okay i must feel i think it's like pretty cool like most people never see like the inside of the car yeah there's a million things you never see driving the car every day this is like sorry guys starting to rough [music] if you don't mind being on like on like you know the internet and stuff is that cool all right youtube's small i actually don't interrupt your work but you know it's like you see like how like there's like a lot of tricky pieces and like if for a person like this is like doable straightforward yeah you know it takes a bit of training out of speed whatever but like once once you like basically like like a pro human can do this super well and it's like hard for the robots to do that but when we go to the like the body welding i'll show you like what's like what's a robot good at and you'll see like there's tons of robots like tons of people here tons of robots there but there's so much complexity and variation here you gotta grab those wires when it comes through especially here at this door so so like this is the car with like less stuff in it and then it goes it's you know and we'll see the beginning of it right and then that then it goes all the way around gets more and more stuff added and does it end at the end well general assembly ends probably somewhere down there yeah okay so but you can essentially see the car get progressively more complex as we add more parts to it you know this place used to employ like about 5 000 people and now we got like we could we got 10 000 people just in this location yeah so what we do is we have like tons of shuttles and like three cars ride sharing yeah we got the barrier rapid transit station finally like went went up so just like trying to get people here is is a big challenge yeah what is this oh this is actually like this is one of my favorite dumb robots okay yeah i'm a fan right now it's pretty cool so like there's a lot of fancy robots that like but they have like lots of issues they break down all the time those these little guys are super great but like they follow this magnetic stripe see basically it's like super easy to program you don't even need to be a programmer because you just like lay down the the mag stripe and it'll follow it yeah just follows the back stripe and then it's got proximity sensors in the front so if if it sees an obstacle or seems like something in the way it just stops and then as soon as something moves out of the way it just keeps going you know just like there's this like little thing all day long like a little train like you're talking about robots faulting out and one of the it's like that's like where like actually doing things manually can can actually be more more efficient because if you have like a lot of complicated robots particularly if you have a 24 7 operation like we have with model 3 then if robot faults out you're going to have 24 7 like advanced robot technicians make sense and then if the robot like accidentally crashes and like breaks a fixture then it's like man okay now right now we've got the line we've got lined down that's what i have to read alert and then i get pulled on my cell phone at two in the morning and it's like not a lot of time i fly apart in from germany it's like we literally had that two days ago do you have to when you get new robots do you build the robots or do you order them in and program them so there's like different classes there's many many different types of robots so the like the giant robot they were still lifting the car yeah it's like that's that that is a catalog item but then we have to program the the motions right and then and the end effector is that it's custom so the interface that picks up the car drops it off that's a custom made thing okay so it's kind of like you kind of like buy this like powerful arm but it's just like having an arm stuck in the ground and then you're like okay what does the arm do you got to tell it everything to do yeah okay and then you got to put sensors on it and put fixtures but that's like kind of like that robot over there that's also one of like the ones that picks up the car oh by the way these are like named after x-men oh yeah i forgot about that just x-men i feel like like marvel and x-men is like gotta start to run out of names yeah yeah actually turns out a lot of x-men yeah okay so you can see like this is like quite a beast of a robot you can't just buy that robot in this case it's a fanuc robot and you can buy the robot but then the end effector that's carrying the car is something that's custom and then you gotta do the programming and the like wire in the sensors and that kind of thing so to the the level of precision of this massive robot is it to like as far as repeatable action is it literally the same path everything yeah plus or minus an inch oh no it's a centimeter it's better than that for a big robot there's a little less precision than a smaller robot yeah but say a medium-sized robot will be accurate to 0.2.3 millimeters oh okay what is the most popular paint color coming through here that's black black yeah it actually varies by country like watch out there's a dumb robot coming through oh yeah this guy's like pretty pretty cool like what [music] all right this can go wrong i don't know you trust him more than i do yeah okay okay all right good job good job robot yeah i see a lot of silver and i see a lot of white model x just in new jersey black and white are the two most colors are too much popular colors okay the white micro are like black slide is is slightly more popular than white in the us but in like europe it's way more popular like white is a very rare color in europe for a car okay in the u.s it's like it's it's about even with with black black and white the two most common colors yeah and here you can see battery pack this is like to be like a mating station for the battery pack oh this is literally connecting the battery to the car here you can see it's like a combination of manual automatic so it's like they're lining it up it's like yeah exactly it's so it's it's done primarily by the robot system by the automated system but then you've got a person just making sure that the fine tuning is there gotcha how do you feel about matt matte or satin colors about that a lot i actually like the aesthetics of matte it's really tricky to to repair a mat so like yes you can polish it out with that if you get like a little ding it's really hard to then rematch the so it looks like an even mat yeah you can't just like you know that's fair point yeah so it's it's doable it's it's something actually we would like to do that in the future but like right now for example like the paint shop is really operating at full tilt so adding any complexity to the paint shop we're definitely wise right now but right i think it'll be a cool thing to do in the future but these are the sub assemblies so you can see like the front rear drive units being bolted up and the self assemblies then feed the main assembly line these are a long assembly line oh yeah well it's and it's it's integrating snx okay and it's making about 2 000 cars a week is model 3 entirely completely separate i guess yes inside the same building but separate whole process the only place where model 3 and snx come together is in the paint shop so the paint shop is processing s3 and x simultaneously down the same line but otherwise general assembly is separate body separate yeah everything else is different so just the paint shop where they come together you've mentioned you've slept in the factory to be able to immediately like diagnose problems and hands-on fix what's not right what type of things happen that you can immediately fix or immediately take action on actually last last three months last year i mostly spent at gigafactory trying to help fix the battery production it's a module production and it's just it's a lot of little things like looking at at each at each little little tiny part each process say is the process necessary it's like because the best part is no part best part a process is no process and occasionally at the design level you think something's necessary but then turns out it's not so just like making sure connect connecting between design and manufacturing make sure to make sure we close the loop on that just saying like hey is this if it let's say it's a it's like it's a lot of real simple stuff but it's like times times a thousand yeah so if we have like a automated vault driver going in like what's the rpm the torque settings for the vault driver can we make that go faster usually usually can unnecessary movements like like for example i actually don't really like the fact that we lift the cars over and and back ideally that would be a robot handoff getting rid of a middle stage yeah exactly because the middle side what's wrong with it's like putting it on a turntable and then the tune table is rotating and the other robot's picking it up it's actually the problem is like sometimes the tune table breaks down wow and and so okay so it's like okay let's eliminate the turntable and just have a robot go to robot and then you don't have like turntable breakage to consider so it's a lot of minimizing things that can go wrong and maximizing the efficiency of these simple things i guess just like like design necessity of every part of it and every process yeah just the speed at which especially the robots are going other are there any is there any unnecessary movement in the production line that that isn't value-added like we're actually doing something yeah like replacing elements of the production system that are not not needed or redundant
