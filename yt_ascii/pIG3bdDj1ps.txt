i want to continue a bit about data mining but maybe from a way that you haven't thought about data mining before so data mining there's huge amount of data you know fair enough lots of number crunching that's that's good that's difficult but one thing but actually a lot of our work these days is what i would call more the modeling side of things where you need to do data mining but you need to do it a bit differently and here's a really good example of something we worked on and something you're probably familiar with so this is colored over the border crossing where the uk border agency and the uk border force are trying to prevent people to illegally cross in particular we're talking about people who are hiding on lorries so the kali and dover crossing is actually the main crossing from the uk into europe where all the lorry and car traffic goes through every year more than a million lorry goes through there are many million cars it's almost like a motorway really but obviously there's the sea in the middle it's also one of the main entry points for illegal immigration in the uk where people are trying to hide on lorries trying to get across without the right papers without the right visa and so on they do this by usually at night climbing onto the lorries hiding between the pallets of goods between hiding between water bottles or whatever they can find and it's the uk border forces job to try and find people hiding there so they actually operate on french soil together with the french police and the french port authorities briefly a map of the poor just give an idea so you know loris will come in here sort of snake through there and they go through passport control and they go through some french controls and then they come to ticketing system they come to the british controls where again they need to show passports and eventually there's more controls by the british and then you finally park and go on to the ferries so on the french side you have a number of technologies that are being used something called passive millimeter wave best showing a picture really that's probably the easiest it looks something like this so a lorry will slowly drive through here and cosmic race will deflect off that screen into this container i want to show number one on and what you get from that is something a bit like a low level x-ray picture and you can kind of make out shapes in the lorry and obviously if somebody is sitting there or standing there you can probably see somebody there but this doesn't always work because if the lorry has hard sides that the the rays aren't really strong enough and all of the people are hiding really well you can't really see them so other technologies that are being used is this one called the heartbeat detector it can't literally detect a heartbeat but it's really really sensitive so you attach it to three points of the lorry the front the middle and the back and you basically just see if the lord is shaking ever so slightly which it would do if there's somebody on there moving there's a strong wind yes or the driver forgot to switch the radio for somebody slamming the car door or it's not perfect technology or you've got this one here which is something called a co2 probe which has got like a ski stick attached so you poke the stick into the lorry if you find somebody you know but if you don't then you can suck up some air and from there you can see what's the proportion of oxygen to carbon dioxide carbon monoxide these sort of things and you can compare it to the outside air and if the proportions are the same then probably nobody's believing on the lorry but if your proportions are different then maybe somebody's breathing on the lorry or maybe the lord is transporting paper or trees or goods which produce oxygen and again it's not perfect also you've got some dogs which are quite good but at higher very easily none of them is perfect and the the reason we've been working with the uk border agency is because they asked us okay so we can give you lots of data and give you a whole year's worth of data of what we've checked and what we found how can we improve our process how can we find more people with the same resources do we need more resources we know what should we do so it sounded like it's a classic data mining problem unfortunately there's a big big problem here which is what they're really after is something which is unknown we don't know how many people are hiding and we also don't know how many people are getting through all we know is how many people we're finding so if you're trying to optimize this system and you're trying to say okay if you put more checks in will less people get through but you don't know because you obviously don't know how many you go through the first place you don't know how to get through now so you can't do your classic data mining on this one because it it's unknown you never know how many people are going to hide you never know how people are getting through you only know how many people you're finding so you're finding more people does that mean you're doing a better job maybe it's just more people hiding what we do for something like this is we build a mathematical model off the port this will lead on to a simulation this is perhaps a surprise to some people so data mining could mean number crunching but it can also mean something like a simulation of a system because we actually need to understand what's going on and if we understand what's going on then we can optimize it so to understand something like this what we build is a computer simulation which first of all means we have to make a more abstract model of it so we have like house to float through the port exactly what are the different stages what is the probability you go from here to here how many lorries exactly are branching there how many have hard sides how many have soft sides how many going to this check and so on and so on lots of lots of things like this and from this we can build up a simulation of it so you recognize this is the map of the port you've got lorries coming in as they would in real life and they go through different checks here they go to passport check they go through a heartbeat check they go to passive millimeter wave ticketing and they also go through the uk where they would go to different jets and we can look at these lorries in great detail yellow lorries means that there's nobody on board red law is with me mean there's actually somebody hiding and we can follow the lorries here and we can check okay if there's somebody hiding where is he being found are they being found where they're not being found and what's underlying this sort of more pretty simulation is actually a more abstract computer science simulation which looks something like this you've got a logical flow through the system you can see exactly at each moment in time which of these stations is busy where is the lorry right now who's working on the lowry who's checking it and i've got all sorts of parameters here i can change how many lorries we're searching how many people are hiding i can change how many have soft and hard sides all the sort of important parameters in the system and from this i can then generate lots of output again which is like given this scenario this is the output given that scenario this is the output and then i can do my data mining and all these different outputs and from there i can build up an understanding okay what's the likely number of people hiding really where are they more likely to be found and from there i can then finally come up with an answer which might say okay what you should do for example maybe you want to change how the queues work or whether you're changing the other search by this method about that method some checks take longer than others so if you send everybody through the check that takes a longer time you get longer and longer queues and that's not acceptable because eventually the lorries will miss their ferry so at what point you tell them to change from this queue to that queue for example and so that unknown we are solving for it like in a mathematical equation would you say is it kind of like that it's not exactly a mathematical equation what you do is you do different scenarios for each scenario you get all the outputs and then from all the outputs you do a data mining and you might establish there's some systematic rule that's going on you might be able to draw something it goes okay right the optimum point is here so it's more like more like a graphical solution one of the questions you always have for something like this is are you going to check everybody are you going to check some people more thoroughly or how are you going to do it with limited resources i mean if you check everybody for a very long time then yeah you're going to find more but the queues are going to become ginormous and nobody's going to catch their flights or their ferries anymore so the option of this really so when you have limited resources limited time you need to do your searches selectively and if you do that we have shown in the simulation that actually you can find more people than if you search everybody for a little bit of time it got very very political this one you get so many different stakeholders and they all want different things i mean the port authorities that want things to go through as quickly as possible of course the police want everything to be checked as carefully as possible the french want to find people maybe on one part the british want to find them on another part it's very political
