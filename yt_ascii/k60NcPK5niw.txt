when you think of the worst version of windows ever you might think of vista which performed sluggishly out of the box or 98 which was so ridden with bugs that microsoft was forced to release a second edition or even windows 8 in which microsoft axed the much beloved start menu and instead tried to shove a mosaic of gimmicky live tiles down our throats it was very uncomfortable but aside from these greatest hits one windows version stands head and shoulders above the rest as a monument to failure windows millennium edition better known as windows me or windows me for those who refuse to buy into the cheesy marketing but why was it so bad microsoft had plenty of time to learn from common gripes people had with windows 95 and 98 the biggest one being how often the os would blue screen or straight up crash to be fair to microsoft they did have a pretty good solution to this move home users onto a version of windows built on the much more stable nt kernel which of course they eventually did with windows xp key in 2001 however microsoft originally wanted an nt edition of windows for home users before the end of 2000 but due to how much development time was required windows me was released instead in june of that year it was the third major windows release in the 9x series and while it was designed to be easier for home users it was somehow worse than its predecessors due to how unstable it was but with windows 9x already having a bad reputation for stability how was it possible for microsoft to allow windows me to be even more frustrating we'll tell you right after we thank jackery for sponsoring this video this year jackery is celebrating its 10th anniversary and for this special occasion they want to give back to the community with a hundred percent win rate giveaway you can win prizes like coupons a jackery solar generator 1000 pro or the jackery 10th anniversary gift package the giveaway takes place until november 15th so make sure to enter take a look at the link below and help celebrate jackery's 10th anniversary by winning some great prize the biggest problem with windows me was probably that it didn't really know who it was although it was firmly part of the windows 9x family microsoft tried to drag windows millennium edition into the new millennium by stripping away some of the ms-dos components older versions of windows relied on but not all of them the idea was to improve boot times but many applications that relied on dos just stopped working even if you weren't running any dos based programs though there was a very good chance you'd have hardware that would start acting up although windows me had higher minimum requirements than its predecessor windows 98 they weren't that much higher meaning that many users thought they wouldn't have too many issues installing me without upgrading their hardware unfortunately though enough had changed under the hood with windows me including a restructured registry to give thousands of users massive headaches when their old windows 95 and 98 drivers simply would not work with the new operating system what was really infuriating is that microsoft faced similar issues when it is customer upgraded to windows 98 from 95 yet again they didn't adequately ensure enough driver support when me hit store shelves complicating matters further was the fact that me attempted to handle two different driver standards one from the windows 95 era and one from the windows 98 era and these drivers had a tendency to conflict they don't like each other and while it was possible in some cases for tech savvy users to find workarounds the problem was that windows me was specifically marketed as being microsoft's first ever entirely home oriented operating system meaning that it was supposed to be simple and reliable for the average joe or jane at home and i'm pretty sure booting up and having multiple pieces of hardware and software simply refused to work is the opposite of simple now let's be fair windows me wasn't all bad it introduced some important features that have held on to this day including system restore automatic windows updates and generic drivers that enabled the os to recognize any usb flash drive as soon as you plugged it in but considering the fact that windows me was an overall nightmare for home users it wasn't a surprise that microsoft finally pulled the plug on the old windows 9x ecosystem in 2001 and now it's time for us to pull the plug on this video i've got nt kernels in the microwave can't wait hey that's it for this video guys thanks for watching like the video if you liked it dislike it if you disliked it check out our other videos and comment below with video suggestions but don't forget to subscribe and follow techwiki because you know that's what we we need you we need you to do that
