hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about how the dodge challenger srt demon is able to achieve a 0 to 60 time of just 2.3 seconds as a rear wheeel drive vehicle now before we get into it and exactly how it does it i want to read a quote from dodge's press release on this vehicle because i think there's going to be some confusion as far as how capable this vehicle is in different scenarios people are probably going to complain that you know it can't take corner as well so just listen to this quote from the press release the main mission of the 2018 dodge challenger srt demon is to cover the quarter mile as quickly as possible so from a design standpoint this vehicle was designed to be the fastest production car across the quarter mile and that's what it did it hit a quarter mile time of 9.65 seconds at 140 mph it was designed as a drag strip car not as a track car so from a design perspective that's what it's going was so of course it's not designed and going to excel well in other areas it pure purpose is to be a drag strip car they have the dodge viper or had the dodge viper for you know the track car that was designed as a track car this is designed as a drag car now how does it do that well in order to have the maximum force at the rear wheels to accelerate this vehicle you need two things the maximum force that this vehicle can apply is equal to the amount of weight resting on that rear tire multiplied by the frictional coefficient of that rear tire or the rear tires both tires the rear axle and so you need to maximize both of those you need to maximize the amount of weight resting on that rear wheel and you need to maximize the frictional coefficient of the tire so you need to have super wide super sticky tires so how do they get the weight to all rest on that rear tire and they actually do do this which is pretty cool so what they've done versus the hellcat they've lowered the spring rates in the rear by 28% lowered the spring rate in the front by 35% lower the anti- rollbar down 44% in the rear down 75% in the front and so what this does by lowering these spring rates is it allows the vehicle to arch back to kind of prop up as it launches and have that allow that weight transfer to occur to go towards those rear wheels the other thing they've done with the dampers is they have firmed up the rebound and compression in the rear they have softened the rebound in the front and they have firm compression in the front so what this means is it's going to be stable in the rear in the front it's going to allow it to lift up that's going to be your rebound compression is when you compress the shock and so it's going to allow it to lift up get all of that weight on that rear tire let that center of gravity pivot back as you're accelerating so all of the load is going to be on those rear tires and it actually will lift up the front wheel it's the first production car to do this i think they say 2.92 ft is how long they can carry the front wheel in the air so they're able to transfer all of the load of this vehicle onto the rear tires which is super cool and part of the way they do that is through the suspension design versus the hellcat now once you come back down and you let off full throttle they're actually going to stiffen up that front rebound so that the car is more stable but while you're at full throttle they're going to leave it soft so that you can have that vehicle you know tilt back lean back and get all of that weight as much as possible onto those rear wheels now as far as the tires these are street legal nitto drag radials so kind of crazy this is a production first for production vehicle to have drag radials they're 315s over 40 the compound and sidewall construction completely unique to this vehicle super cool you can see kind of the tire twisting as it's launching like you see in nh top fuel cars if you ever see the slow-mo videos of their tires so super cool to be able to see that it's got a 15% larger contact patch versus the hellcat it's able to achieve a 40% greater launch force and supposedly has over two times the grip of the hellcat with these tires so super sticky drag tires put on there and they are claiming a peak geforce of 1.8 gs at launch the highest of any production car now we're going to talk about why this number right here this 1.8g it sounds stupid impressive it is stupid impressive but it's for a very very short duration so i don't think it's all that significant to talk about analyzing the g forces here so looking at the 0 to 30 time of 1 second if we take the average acceleration that's equal to the difference in velocity divided by how much time that takes so 30 mph equal 44 ft per second divide by 1 44 / 32.2 ft per second that gives us 1.37 gz that's a pretty good three speaking of pretty good drawing i think this is the first time i've ever drawn a vehicle that i think i could you know tell someone what vehicle is that and i think most of them would say challenger so i think it's pretty cool that it looks somewhat relevant to a challenger versus the rest of all my drawings anyways moving on 1.3 7 g's 0 to 30 0 to 60 2.3 seconds that is equal to 1.19 g's when we do the math as far as acceleration remember they're saying a peak of 1.8 and here's the thing this is excluding one foot of roll out so it's actually going to be a little bit longer than that and it's actually going to be a bit longer than that so how do we measure the amount of time it took excluding that roll out well if we look at the 30 to 60 time that's not going to have any roll out included in it and it's able to do 60 and 2.3 30 and 1 subtract the difference is 1.3 seconds so if we do the math 44 ft per second in 1.3 seconds that's going to give us a gforce of 1.05 g's that's the average gforce that the car is accelerating from 30 to 60 mph so dodge is claiming a peak geforce of 1.8 gs that's right at the initial launch it's kind of this shock of acceleration right at the very beginning very brief moment and then you can see the average geforce is going to be much lower you know still extremely impressive the fact that it's accelerating over 1g from 30 to 60 m per hour is pretty insane especially for a rear wheeel drive vehicle so very cool what they've been able to do with these super sticky tires and the soft suspension to get that rear axle loaded up looking at the quarter mile time the tesla p100d which you know would be the closest competitor as far as the 0 to 60 time of 2.3 seconds is able to hit the quarter mile and 10.5 at5 mph this is hitting it at 9.65 seconds at 140 mph the tesla is actually quicker to 30 mph and i was looking at motor trends data of which they published on their article and they had a peak gforce shown slightly over 1.4 gs so again that's why i kind of question this 1.8 g's i think a lot of people are going to be saying oh this car accelerates at 1.8 gs and sure it may hit that on a drag strip in perfect conditions for an extremely short moment of time but you're not going to be in the car just driving it down the highway floor and experience 1.8 gs you'll experience 1g which is very cool but not 1.8 so either way it's an insane car very cool what dodge has done i mean it's it's a passion project it's meant to build hype from a marketing standpoint about the brand dodge and it's certainly doing that it's cool to see a company just you know let's throw everything we have at the world's fastest drag car and just go for it and they did it they achieved the results and i think that's cool to do if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
