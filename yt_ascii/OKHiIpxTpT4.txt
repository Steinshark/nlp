a little over a year ago i decided to commit to my youtube covet experiment and started posting weekly content i'm not really sure what i expected from it but now looking back i can't imagine not having started it's not an exaggeration to say that youtube has completely changed my filmmaking career both in terms of opportunities and money and in this video i'm going to break down why i think every filmmaker out there should have a youtube channel of their own and why even a small audience can have a huge impact one of the main reasons i think it's working so well for me is that i've built up a system so that i can create weekly content while not letting it take over my life and i'm going to be getting into the breakthroughs that i've made in my workflow so that you can see how it's possible to run a profitable channel while still having time to develop your own projects and have a personal life in fact during one of the biggest periods in my channel's growth when i went from just over 500 subs to over 5 000 in just a few weeks i was actually living in a tent and shooting my first feature documentary not sitting in front of a laptop at 3am looking at analytics finally at the end i'll go through a breakdown of what i earned in the last last eight months and how and what sort of brand deals and free gear i've been able to get my hands on through the channel so let's get into it hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer first off let's start with why i wanted a youtube channel in the first place when i've already made it as a cinematographer and director well like with so many other things during that weird time it was all because of covid when the world shut down it wasn't a great time to be an international documentary shooter and for quite a while there was absolutely no work coming in that showed me that i really wasn't in control of my creative output and that i was actually reliant on other people's permission to work if you're anything like me that is not a good situation because i start to go a bit crazy if i'm not making stuff i chose this job because i love it and it's not like i secretly want to be doing something else so when it all stopped it didn't feel good at all i also realized that i was spending a lot of time on youtube as a viewer much more than i was on normal tv and so it seemed like a logical move i could add to the conversation instead of just consuming content and at the same time give myself a creative project that no one was in control of but me the other reason why i think youtube is so important for all filmmakers is because these days it is so hard to stand out from all the noise and competition a website used to be enough but now i really believe that a strong youtube presence is the single best way filmmakers can promote themselves and the work they do and maybe more importantly get their work out into the world where it might be noticed i really don't think there's a better platform out there when it comes to building your filmmaking brand and my only real regret is that i didn't start it sooner it might look like youtube is really crowded these days and it is but if you approach it the right way it is absolutely still possible to make something that has a meaningful impact on your life and with a much smaller audience than you're probably expecting don't listen to the people who tell you it's too late to start because that's all based on a scarcity mindset that is rooted in fear if you put in the work and stick with it youtube can still change your life for me personally i didn't really have much in the way way of expectations and to be honest i really didn't think it would be all that successful but the point for me was just to make stuff and so i went for it anyways i'd love to say that it was all smooth sailing from day one but the start was really awkward like really awkward youtube what's going on welcome today we're going to talk about everyone's favorite depressing topic failure i made a few terrible videos and then stopped and deleted them but i liked the process enough to want to keep going but i also knew that i'd need to find the right system if i wanted to create regularly and not have it take over my life i didn't want to become a full-time youtuber i wanted to keep my filmmaking career going and make these videos so i needed to find a more efficient system spoiler alert i did find a system and that's exactly what we're getting into soon so about a year ago i started up again and with this new system in place i started a weekly publishing schedule for a while not much happened and there was pretty much no growth for months then in june of last year one video did well out of nowhere and everything started moving now the channel is at nearly 17 000 subscribers and i've gotten over twenty five thousand dollars in free high-end gear and for the last five months or so i've been paying my rent and then some with cash generated by the channel on top of that i've made a ton of professional connections that have led to paid assignments and a bunch of new collaborators but most importantly it got me creating i made my first short film in years because of this channel and created a bunch of cool bts footage from that shoot starting this channel changed my life and that's not an exaggeration and looking back it was one of the best decisions i've made in a long time now you're probably sitting there watching this thinking oh well that's all well and good but how and i'm going to get into that soon but first i want to talk a bit more about the main requirements i had when i started this channel and that's that i needed to be able to run this channel part time and not be a slave to it i like my career and i want to keep doing it so youtube needed to be manageable in under 10 hours a week and even less if possible thankfully i did end up figuring out how to make that work and these days i'd say i spend well under 10 hours a week on making weekly content actually if i wasn't building courses and writing newsletters and all the other stuff i branched out into i could probably keep this channel going in about five hours a week which isn't bad at all but you really do need to approach it the right way to make it work and just to repeat you do not need hundreds of thousands of followers because i've literally been paying my rent and locking down multiple paid jobs through this channel with under 20 000 subs so it's really much more achievable than you think before i get into the hard numbers though let's talk about the keys to building out a youtube system of your own the first massive breakthrough i had was when i started spending more time on planning and scripting my first few videos that i've since deleted or just me trying to talk in front of a camera on some subject and they were pretty much a disaster unless you're peter mckinnon just riffing and being entertaining doesn't come naturally to most of us at least not to me so instead of spending three hours talking just to get 10 minutes of usable footage i started spending one to two hours on planning instead i'd write out a detailed outline and sometimes even a fully fleshed out script so then i knew exactly what i wanted to say that was a game changer because that two hours of planning meant that i could bang out a 12 minute video in about 20 minutes of recording time instead of two to three hours like it would take me when i tried to ad-lib it it also meant that the videos were much more coherent and focused and i think slash hope you guys appreciate that the next thing ties into the first and that's when i realized that making one video at a time was a big mistake setting up my studio to shoot these videos takes almost an hour and i don't have enough space to have it set up full time so by setting it up and taking it down every week i was losing a ton of time also switching between scripting and editing and shooting constantly made it really hard for me to get into a rhythm the answer is batching so instead of doing one video at a time i do three or maybe four so if i look at a typical month i'll spend the first four days of week one on scripting i'll sit in a coffee shop for an hour or so each day and create a solid script and then do that every day until i have four scripts this number can go up or down depending on whether or not i have travel plans and need more videos stockpiled but this is the way i generally do it then only when i have the scripts ready i'll set up the studio and record all four videos at once and since i've spent the time scripting i can usually knock out four videos in under two hours which was impossible when i just tried to talk to the camera without a plan then i tear down the the gear and put it all away and actually get to have a livable apartment again for the month then you can switch into editor mode and roll them out one at a time being able to get into an editing workflow is also much easier when you have batch content like this at least for me i can get through a well-structured video in about four to five hours of editing usually and when you don't have to shoot and script at the same time as you're editing it's not all that bad when you're constantly bouncing back and forth between planning shooting and editing it feels a lot more frantic and it's hard to find a rhythm getting into this system was huge in terms of keeping the time manageable and the consistency up and since then i haven't missed a week in over a year and the whole time i've still been traveling and working alright so that's a very basic version of the system and there's obviously much more to it to that like how do i find new ideas week after week and how do i run the business side of things and actually bring in sponsors cash and free gear i spent the last year refining the system and it's too much to explain in a single video so i've actually decided to put everything i've learned about how filmmakers can leverage the power of youtube right way into a one-on-one kickstarter program this isn't a generic how to make youtube videos course it's an intensive one-on-one boot camp specifically for filmmakers who want to create a sustainable channel with ambitions for long-term growth and profitability after thinking about it for a really long time eight weeks is about the fastest i can teach all the parts of this system well so this isn't for people looking for a quick overnight solution unfortunately and because there's so much personalized interaction involved because of the one-on-one calls and the custom exercises and video feedback i'm only taking a really limited number of people at a time like i think i'm actually only going to consider five filmmakers at most for the first intake so when i say space is limited i really do mean it it's going to be split up into four modules covering everything from branding planning idea generation production gear and the business aspects of running a channel and each module will include a one-on-one one hour call so we can make sure it's all working for you by the time you're done you'll have launched a channel you'll have an idea creation system so you'll never run out of topics and a roadmap the future this isn't a plan for me to make millions because obviously that's not going to happen with just five students at a time and it's going to be a huge time commitment on my end but i feel so strongly that this youtube system can be a game changer for the right motivated filmmakers then i'm going to do it anyways we'll have to see how long i can keep it up but this youtube channel literally changed the course of my filmmaking career and i'm positive it can do the same thing for you so i wanted to give it a try but because it's going to take so much time to create a personalized program for each filmmaker i'm also going to require an application and an onboarding call first to make sure we're not wasting each other's time this approach 100 works as i'm living proof of but only if you put in the work and do it properly so if you've been thinking about starting a channel of your own and you're really serious about doing it the right way check the link in the description and we'll set up an onboarding call even a small channel managed the right way can have a massive impact on your career and finances so if you're ready to commit i'm ready to help okay so now let's look at the hard numbers and what i've actually gotten from this channel the secret of earning money on youtube is that comes from a variety of different sources and the more the better adsense or the money coming in from youtube each month is probably the smallest of all these sources and it can really vary depending on the month so it's also the least dependable i'd say you get about three to four hundred dollars a month from adsense depending on the month which isn't nothing but it's clearly not enough to live on the same thing goes for amazon and other affiliate marketing links those are just the little links in the description that people click on to buy products and every time they do i get a little cut it probably also make about three to four hundred bucks a month from amazon which isn't a ton but when combined with the adsense revenue it's starting to add up next source of income for my channel is sponsorships which are the 60 second or so ad reads in the middle of videos i try not to do more than one or two of these a month but these are great for bringing in income i can typically charge about 500 to 700 per sponsor plus whatever i generate from the affiliate links that go with it which is probably another 200 bucks or 400 bucks a month so let's say an average of about 850 a month from each sponsored video if i do one a month and then factor in the adsense and the amazon we're getting up to almost 1500 bucks or so next are the consultation calls which i only started offering after my channel hit about 10 000 subs because once you have an audience of that size probably at least one to two percent of them are going to want to talk to you in a normal month i'll do maybe two to four of these calls which is another 400 to 800 i really like giving these calls because i genuinely enjoy talking to people and teaching but what you can charge will depend on your experience level add to that whatever we've made from the other sources and we're over two thousand bucks a month which is actually real money and once you've got your system in place your channel is just gonna keep growing and over time all of these numbers go up and up i'm hoping that in about a year from now that number can double at least and then we're starting to get into a really interesting position where most of my base expenses are covered by the channel then i can start to be really selective about what jobs i take on so obviously based on these numbers i'm not getting rich at the moment but also keep in mind that all of this growth came in the last eight months and that's around 2 300 bucks a month i didn't have before and that's all with a channel with under 20 1000 subscribers and only publishing once a week so just imagine what happens if you keep it up over more time or publish even more regularly the sky is the limit and that's what makes youtube so interesting on top of that are the paid jobs i've landed because of having this channel jobs that came in from people who found me on youtube or else jobs that required a social media component and then the channel was my proof of capability so far there have been three of those one for a development agency one for a political organization and another for a commercial brand i can't say exactly what those jobs were because of legal reasons but in total they've been worth about twenty thousand dollars i won't count that as part of the monthly income exactly but it's a huge bonus of the channel it's amazing self-promotion and is better than any website you can have lastly is the gear which isn't the same as cash but it's earnings in the sense of not having to buy equipment i have a policy of only agreeing to gear mentions if it's actually something i plan to use in my professional work so i actually end up saying no to around three quarters the offers i get but what i do say yes to has been really useful high ticket stuff like tripods or large lights or expensive v-mount batteries sliders high-end backpacks at full retail price the value of the gear i brought in is well over twenty thousand dollars and because i only take gear i actually need to use all of that stuff is stuff i didn't have to buy so look i'm not trying to pretend i'm getting rich from youtube because obviously with a small channel that's not how it works but i am paying my rent and then some and i haven't spent a dollar on gear in months and all of that is making a very real impact on my life and filmmaking career my only regret with the whole thing is that i didn't start it sooner so if you've been thinking about it at all my advice is just to go for it if you're ready to take it seriously from day one you can apply for my filmmakers kickstarter program using the link below but even if that's not the right move for you at the moment i really hope you'll just go for it on your own because i truly believe that every filmmaker out there needs a channel of their own these days okay that's it for this video hope you found it helpful and that it inspired you to finally launch your own channel if you want to see more youtube breakdowns like this let me know and i'll get on it but whatever you do just don't let fear get in the way of you starting your own channel because there is so much potential out there
