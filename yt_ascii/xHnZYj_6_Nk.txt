in this video i'm going to give you the fastest way to break into the tech industry and actually land a job now in 2024 looking for a tech job sort of feels like dating as the average guy it feels impossible to get anyone to give you a chance and there's a few guys at the top getting all the opportunities now that might sound disheartening to you but let me just tell you why that can actually be encouraging the thing is the reason why 90% of people fail when it comes to dating or looking for a tech job is not because they just not born the right person or whatever but it's because they simply haven't developed the right characteristics yet to be what employers are looking for i have landed jobs as some of the biggest companies in the world and this was after hundreds and hundreds of hours of trial and error of figuring out what works what doesn't work in this video i'm just going to give you everything that you need to know so you don't need to go through these hundreds of hours and waste your time as well what might surprise you is that these steps are actually not that complicated it's just that most people don't know about these things so they just random throw their resume around without realizing that they're actually just doing everything completely wrong and if they just did a couple of very simple changes everything could be different for them so as your first step everything starts with simply building your programming skill stack so what do i mean by skill stack well as a programmer there's obviously a lot of things that you could be learning like different programming languages different frameworks and different skills are more in demand than others and also different skills sort of work well together with other skills so we want to be aware of in this day and age what skills are compan is actually looking for so the way you would do this from first principles is literally go on like linkedin for example and you can look for software engineering jobs or programming jobs or whatever and to search for jobs based on different keywords like jango python javascript and see which technologies have the most demand aka which one of them have the highest number of job postings now this is going to be the most strong fire way to find exactly what is most in demand in your area but if you want a general idea usually learning something like full stack development using languages like python or javascript or go is going to be a good bet in almost any area after you have done that what i would do is just pick one programming language and learn the programming foundations using that language aka you simply learn the basics of what is a loop what are variables how does the general programming logic work and after that you want to pick a specialization aka you want to pick do i want to specialize in the front end in the back end in devops or whatever so once you have chosen your in demand programming skill stack you just want to focus on this one skill stack of course you can go out and learn a bunch of things but the most efficient way is just to get really good at one thing rather than spreading your attention into many different things i made this mistake myself when i was first learning the code because i was so excited about all these different kinds of programming i was learning mobile development ai all this kind of stuff but really if i wanted to be as efficient as possible and get a job as fast as possible i should have just pick one thing and really get good at that one thing before we go into the next four steps which you can obviously just go out there and implement on your own based on this video i want to talk about a program called course careers which is essentially designed to take you through all of these steps and essentially do a lot of this stuff for you like help you landar a job directly rather than having to do all of this manually how do they do this well it has a couple of components first of all we're going to go through is a full software engineering online curriculum there's a lot more practical than even a computer science degree or something like that you're going to learn programming fundamentals which is taught by tech and then after that you can choose a specialization based on what you're interested in like front end devops back end so this is going to give you the first step it's going to give you all the ind demand skills that you actually need but alongside this you get support of mentors so these are people who have actually done what you want to do who work software engineering jobs will help you hand in hand but what really makes course career special is that they have essentially provided this full platform and this is not guarantee or anything but you will be able to land a job directly bya their platform so how can they do this you might ask well they have created what's called the employer platform they reach out to companies and they pitch them like hey we have these top candidates who we have taught with our curriculum you can come to us and we will provide you with top candidates so you don't need to spend time searching for great candidates which is why people like max for example managed to land a 70k software engineering job after just 12 weeks of going through course careers directly via course careers without applying for a single job themselves if you're interested in course careers they've actually provided a free software engineering fund mentals course that you can go and do right now down below in the description and after you go through that you can decide if the program is right for you so if you're interested in that go check that free course down below in the description and thank you for course careers for partnering with me on this video with that said let's talk about what the next step is that is going to be to build a complex project now most people think that it's enough to just learn programming but that's really not enough because if you don't have a computer science degree or even if you do what companies are really going to be looking at is can you actually know how to code and you just telling them like oh i know how to code that's is not going to be enough you need some kind of proof how do you give this proof if you don't have an experience well what you can do is simply give yourself experience by building complex software engineering projects with these skills that you're learning for example through course careers or even if you're not doing course careers however you're learning them what you then want to do is apply these skills into some real piece of software that you're building i cannot stress how important this is it's not even just about building something to show your skills this is actually also where you're going to become a really good programmer because when it comes to learning the code you can't just learn it by studying it or like reading it from books or watching dumb videos like this what you need to do is actually put your skills into practice that is when you actually learn how to actually code something real so what you want to do is pick something that you really want to build that's a lot more complex than you probably think you can build and then just start going through it step by step like one little step at a time you start building up this complex project and that is going to be your portfolio your project your resume project you can build a couple of these that's slightly simpler or you can just build one super complex one the key here is that you want to build something that is easy to understand that combines multiple pieces of software engineering together in whatever area in your skill stack you have chosen and then after that you're going to put that into your resume which brings us to our third step this is again something that's going to sound very obvious like oh have a good resume but i think you'd be surprised how few people understand actually how to make a proper resume so one of my previous jobs i was working for a really big company but because it was a very small office within that company i as an intern was actually tasked with the task of going through the rums of people who had sent their applications basically for like an internship position at this company and i was going through these resumes one after the other the other and i was shocked how terrible 95% of these rums are like it's like they didn't even bothered to do the very basics right now obviously they were obvious to me because i had gone through like hundreds of visions like so many people had reviewed my resume i've read literal books about how to make a resume like it's a pretty deep concept but i'm just going to give you the couple of basics that if you just do these things you're already going to be ahead of like 95% of people by the way if you go through course careers which i mentioned before they are actually going to have a like a template inside of their platform where you just fill in a couple of details the course career software is essentially just going to spit out a pdf resume for you that is already fully optimized that is already like the perfect template and everything like like that but if you don't want to do that then here the couple of basics you want to be aware of first of all you just want to have the basic sections right you want to have your personal information you want to have whatever technical experience you have that is in any way relevant to technology and then most importantly you want to have a section for the technical projects that you have built you want to put all of that in the resume in order of relevance let's say you have no technical experience you just put your projects at the top because that is going to be the most relevant thing that you done the next thing is just formatting just proper formatting like most rums that you see look like this or this this is just absolutely terrible to read like when i see a rume like this i don't even want to read it literally just go on google look at proper resume templates either canva google docs or whatever just pick one of those don't try to make one on your own it has to be something where you're not just filling it with text like you need to understand when a recruiter looks at a resume they don't have too long to look at a resume i think on average they like look at it for 3 seconds or something like that you want to have white space you want to be as efficient as possible with everything that you're putting on on the resume the way you do that is with the third tip use action verbs you don't want to start your bullet point saying something like oh i was responsible for blah blah blah you want to say what you did meaning you implemented programmed built these action verbs stating exactly what you have done that is what you want to start every single bullet point with because that like shows that you have actually contributed something to the companies that you worked at or the projects that you built or whatever if you just do those things you're honestly going to be above of like 95% of people when it comes to rums so with that out of the way let's move on to step number four which is to apply for jobs properly so when most people apply for jobs what do they do well they just apply online they spend 30 minutes filling out some dumb application form for some stupid company that's not even going to look at your application and they do that over and over and over and over and over again i made this mistake when i was applying for jobs for myself i would just like grind sending application after application after application i was sending like hundreds of applications and i was wondering oh why is no one getting back to me but the reality was that these companies get so many applications even if you have the best application in the world there's probably a pretty low chance that they're ever even going to read your application because they'll just go through them they'll see like 200 and some recruiters looking at i don't want to read through all of this as soon as they get to one that's sort of good they just invite every an interview they don't even look through all of them so essentially what you want to do is find a way to essentially bypass the application system apply for jobs in a lot more efficient way so how do you do this well the easiest way of course is again shameless plug if you use course careers by their platform you might be able to actually get course careers to connect you with companies directly again not a guarantee or anything but it can happen if you do really well but if you don't do that there are two main ways that are a lot more effective and both of them are essentially about like finding a way to reach out to the actual humans at these companies who make the decisions about hiring for example when i worked for one of the big companies that i worked for before what we would always get is people on linkedin or email reaching out to us just for a coffeee because they just wanted to learn about our jobs they just wanted to make themselves the best candidate and you'd be surprised how willing we were always to do that and this is actually a very good strategy from the applicant's perspective why because it gives a human connection that you have at this actual companies even if you're not speaking to the direct person in charge of hiring or anything like that what will happen is that inside of these companies they have these referral scheme so if i working for a company refer someone who ends up getting a job at my company i'm going to get some kind of a bonus so i'm almost incentivized to help you land a job at my company if you reach out to me for a coffee or something like that and the recruiters will be happy about that because that means they don't have go and read through all of these stupid online applications because they don't actually want to do that so that's the first way reach out to people who actually work at the companies that you want to work at and just genuinely be interested in them make a human connection the other way is to just attend networking events although these companies are going to have networking where you can go and meet make these human connections over there or you can reach out to recruiters directly and you don't want to reach out from the perspective of oh can you please give me a job you want to reach out from the perspective of hey i saw you work at this company i'm really interested in it i'd like to learn more about the job to see if i might be the right fit just approach him from the perspective of i want to learn about your job i want to learn about the company so that i could become the best candidate that you want your last step is going to be to pass the actual interview of course which means that you want to master interview skills it's not enough to just be a good programmer to even have a good resume things like this if you don't don't know how to play the game of interviews and actually passes interviews consistently now again this might sound scary to you programming interviews are not fun they're kind of intimidating even for me these days but again it's just a skill that you can learn so how do you do this well there's two kinds of interviews broadly the tech compan is going to have one is sort of the more practical interview where they might for example ask you to build something on the spot or they might give you like a take-home assignment or something like that to see if you can actually physically build something with the technologies that they use smaller companies will use usually have interviews like this and then you have the dreaded lead code style sort of coding problem interview where that's very common at the big companies like google's facebook and things like this but this luckily for you is a very sort of proven road map and like step-by-step path you can just learn all the problem solving skills and the data structur and algorithms topic that they actually test in these interviews so the simple way to do this is just just learn what you need to learn and then you learn all those topics now you might be asking yourself well how do i learn these topics how do i know what to learn well that is exactly why i actually made this video where i go through all of the steps that you would need to go through to master the data structures and algorithms which are the exact topics that companies like google facebook amazon etc test in their interviews so if you watch this video and then you learn all of this in this video you're going to be absolutely unstoppable and you are going to be able to land any job that you want if you don't think you can do it just know that you can always learn it so go watch that video next i hope you enjoy this video leave a like i'll see you in the next one
