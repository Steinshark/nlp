today we're talking about the hot hand in sports, particularly basketball. i grew up watching basketball, the new york knicks. we knew whoever was on a shooting streak should get the ball because the chances are that they would make the next shot. people are more likely to make a basket given they've made a whole 
stream of them, this was what we believed. from a math perspective a hot hand usually means that you have a higher chance than usual of making a basket, given that you just made a whole bunch of 'em in a row. think about it, you have some life time - see it as an average or some average for your game or some kind of base measurement, and then all of a sudden you've made a whole bunch of shots - maybe you think the chances are that the next shot is going to be a winner or higher than your baseline average; because you've got confidence, because you're doing great, because you're throwing that ball well. that's the hot hand.
- (brady: you're in the zone.) yea- oh yeah in the zone and of course it has implications for strategy, right? because if a guy's on a streak and if he's really doing better than his own usual you're more likely to want to feed that guy the ball. so this is a tale with a long history; in 1985 a team of three scholars, including famed psychologist amos tversky, published a study. two professional teams were involved: the philadelphia 76ers and the boston celtics; and also some cornell varsity and junior varsity players. and what they did was something that scientists do a lot, they challenged conventional wisdom. they looked in shot strings of hits and misses and asked the question, from a statistical perspective. is there a hot hand? so what they did specifically, imagine you have a string with zeros representing misses and ones representing hits, and you could look and see after a player or a team has made a bunch of shots is the next shot more likely to go in than say after an equally long string of misses? that's exactly what they did. tversky was a very very big basketball fan so i'm sure he was- brought his passion into the study, but i think he was looking at the strings of zeros and ones and found no hot hand. this paper's published; it's got thousands of citations. and it had two very interesting effects. one was the non effect in the sporting industry; those who thought they knew better than scientists shrugged their shoulders, this is not right - we know there's a hot hand, we see it, we're experienced. and then there was the field of scholars who thought this was pretty interesting and started doing more studies. different teams, different time periods, different sports - there's a big hot hand literature. launched a thousand academic ships but got a shrug of the shoulders from professional sports. if you search for hot hand fallacy on the web you're gonna find tons of hits. it's not universally agreed, because as usual with a scientific experiment there could be lots of different ways to do it. maybe you use a different data set-
- (brady: what possible different) (data set could you use other than the
ball going in the basket?) well you could use a different team, you could use a different season or you could look for streaks in a different sport. you can do all sorts of things. you always make a lot of choices in experiments and it's easy to forget, when you have a conclusion, that your conclusion depends not just on the hypothesis you want to test but also the way you implemented your experiment. 30 years later two statisticians, josh miller and adam sanjurjo, published a paper. how did it differ from the enormous literature on the subject in a really important way? it challenged the original result; not by saying maybe we need a different experimental design, maybe we need a different idea for what a hot hand should be in mathematics - it said these guys did their study wrong. so i was really stopped in my tracks when i saw this-
- (brady: the equivalent of saying) (they they made an addition mistake or) (something?) 
- it is like that and especially when you consider a scholar of the importance of amos tversky. so just a little background on tversky: he's a psychologist, as i said in israeli, he's a psychologist. he's partner of daniel kahneman who went on to win the nobel prize for their joint work. tversky died of melanoma in 1996 and did not then 
receive the price, because it's not awarded posthumously. but the work was all about how people make mistakes. so here's tversky, a connoisseur of human error, and he it seems has made a mistake or so say sanjurjo and miller. this gets to the question of the most basic kind of hypothesis testing that statisticians do. so it always goes pretty much the same way; there's a concept of the ordinary and statisticians, for better or worse, call this thing a null hypothesis which may be off-putting to some but all they mean is what's typical. put a metric of what's typical and then you look at your observation - maybe it's a drug effect or maybe it's whether you've just made an unusual- your your probability of making a shot is unusually high compared to a notion of typical; and then you say well is there an effect or not an effect? that's how hypothesis testing works. and so there's a lot of art and science in deciding what ordinary means, maybe not everybody agrees. but the mistake that was found in this paper, that sanjurjo and miller noticed, was in the concept of saying what the null hypothesis, what the ordinary was. and it was particularly related to the fact the data; even though mathematicians like to think in terms of infinite strings or infinite number of observations or laws of large numbers, very often are dealing in practice with small finite samples of data and small stuff does not need to behave like big stuff. it's pretty simple actually; if you see three things happen in a row you think, wow maybe a trend! that's a small sample error, right? maybe the fourth one's going to be going in a different direction; but we are very quick to find reasons for things, to find trends, to find patterns - we're 
wired this way, okay. so we know about this, and no one knew it better than amos tversky, and yet he had a small sample of data and he treated that small sample along with his co-authors as though, as though it were an infinite set. maybe the best way to start is with coin flipping, okay? so this is like a toy example of the sort of thing they were doing, coin flips could be like hitting or missing shots: heads, tails, hits and misses maybe. so here's the kind of thing we're thinking about because, after all, we're looking at the probability of making a shot given that you've just made some shots or making a shot after you've just missed some shots. so we want to look at what's happening after something else happens. so we could play a game with a coin and we're gonna think that we have a completely unbiased coin, 50% heads 50% tails, and we're going to think that my flips of the coin are independent. so what happens on the next flip has nothing to do with what happened on the previous flip or anything else in history. we're going to flip the coin three times and we're thinking we're looking for what happens after something. so here's the game: i flip the coin and then we're going to write down what happens after i flip a head. so if i flip tails we don't think about anything, then i flip the heads we become alert, then flip something else, we write down an h if it's a heads or a t if it's not a head. so we're gonna do this three times. and so the question is what do we think before we do the experiment is gi- given this is an unbiased 50/50 coin and my flips are completely independent you can ask what do you expect to see on the piece of paper; like half heads and half tails, why not? because being cued by a head shouldn't have any effect on the next, on the next flip. but in fact it did. i can write down all the outcomes, there's only eight of them; so i think i got all eight of them. and let's look at what we would have written down if we were keeping track of what happened after heads. so ttt is a non-starter. tth is also a non-starter because even though you got a heads here we don't know what happened afterwards, because we were only looking at streaks of length- total length three. okay, so tth we don't write anything down. so you could already see something funny's going wrong because out of my eight cases two of them have already been problematic. the next guy is not problematic because here's an h right in the middle, so you flip the t you don't get do anything flip the h it's right in the 
middle - you're alert. then you get a t so you write down a t. in this next string htt; h starts off right away, gets your attention. you write down a t. here in this string you start with the t, don't write anything. then we see an h, we become alert, we get an h we write it down. okay and then we're finished; this h would have queued us if we were doing strings of length four but we aren't. here hth so the first h tells us to write down the t, the second t tells us to do nothing then we end with an h which is kind of dangling. here hht. so the first h tells us to write down what happens after, which is an h. second h tells us to write down what happens which is a t, we don't do anything when we see a t. and here finally we have hhh so the first two h's each tell us to write an h, and we don't get to do anything after the third. in the first two cases we write nothing in the last six cases we write something; so let's see what fraction had heads. so in the first one the fraction is zero; and in the second one the fraction is zero; and the third one the fraction is one. again we have a zero. here we have a heads and a tails, half the time we saw heads half the time we saw tails - that's 0.5. and here a hundred percent of the time we saw heads again so we have a one. so we take these numbers, their average represents expectation. so i add them up i get 1 plus 1/2 plus 2, that's 2.5. the average is equal to 2.5 over 6, which is definitely less than 1/2. 6 is the number of examples that i'm averaging over - so don't forget we're asked, what do you see what happens given that you have a head? and so here we never- the first one
we never had a head at all; in the second one we had a head at the end but we don't know what happened given that we had that head so those things are out of the sample. this is exactly how you would have treated a sample with heads being make a shot and tails being miss a shot, if you were doing this for basketball strings. so if we were happening to look at only three shots, bringing this back to basketball, we would have seen that there was a bias downward from the 1/2 that we would have expected to see given the fact that the coin is 50/50 and that the flips are all totally independent. now importantly if we looked at longer strings that average would have tended toward 1/2. and if we looked at very long strings, even not all the way infinite, it might have been so close to 1/2 that this difference didn't matter. but in fact what we're seeing is that in data, in this finite data set, the reversals were more likely than the continuation; and that is a finite data a small sample effect and this was not considered when the original hot hand scholars made up their sense of what was ordinary. what- we can now ask, what happens when we look at really high-end basketball players of today? take the original experiment but put in this correction, allow for the fact that we're looking at finite data sets, small samples; which effectively lowers the bar from 1/2 or whatever is the right number down to what ordinary looks like in a data set and see if we do find hot hands. so this is an experiment that we did. so the way we did it, i'll tell you a little bit about our experiment; is that we took some basketball players, i'll tell you about them in a second some well-known basketball players, over the 2016-2017 season and playoff game by game, and we looked their strings of hits and misses; and we asked the question in each game, were they having a hot hand or not? were they more likely to make a shot after a string of shots than they were after a string of misses? that's the question that we asked. following the original researchers we have to set up a concept of ordinary - no effect. and then look at the observed string and see if it's different from ordinary in an important way.
- (brady: so if steph curry gets 10 shots) (in a row there's a chance that 
was just luck,) (he just, you know, if he was a 50/50) (player he'd get 10 shots in a row 
sometimes) sometimes, right? could be like somebody's got to be on top, right, is that luck or skill? it's exactly the same sort of question and it's great to
see that people in england know about steph curry. he's one of our star players, one of the featured players of the golden state warriors, which is the team we looked at and also one of the featured players in this hot hand study that we did, we looked at two warriors. so the warriors were the champions, nba champions, last season and we looked at two actually three of their star players: steph curry and klay thompson, who are known as the "splash brothers" for very good reason. klay is- thompson's probably the streakiest of the sh- the shooters; and then we also looked at kevin durant who is undeniably the heart and soul of the championship win. so if you take a string for the player, it's got some number of streaks in it, suppose the player takes 20 shots and makes 11 of them or something, right; and it's got some zeros and some ones in it this is- we did this per game. and then what we did was we looked to see in that string what was the probability of a hit following two hits, and a hit following two misses; but to see if there was any difference in that string. and then we took that string and we scrambled it, did a random permutation, and made the same calculation. think about it, scrambling that thing ruins the order. all- no, no streaks - i mean whatever streaks emerge emerge by chance, even though you've got the same fraction of hits and misses. and we did that thousands of times. and each time we scrambled it we looked to see what happened, so we're kind of mimicking randomness. and we looked at all those outcomes over the scrambled string and then asked whether the observed string was unusual; could have been
in the highest corner of hotness compared to all of the experiments we did. and you can see that there's no asymptotics, there's no 'what happens if i had a longer string?' that doesn't even come into the discussion, which is why this type of experiment which is more and more commonplace in- all throughout science, called a permutation test. this experiment automatically accounts for the size of the sample. [cheers] so on december 6th 2016 klay thompson, one of the splash brothers, one of our featured players, scored 60 points in a game. so if you don't know basketball, typical score in a game is like a hundred points or 110 points; he scored more than half of them all by himself. the warriors won that game by a big amount. and here is the sequence of ones and zeroes, one being a shot he made and zero being a shot he missed. he hit 31 of his 44 shots, we just strung together the free throws and the field goals, the two point and the three-point
shots - we didn't distinguish in this sequence. and the question is, did he have a hot hand? now everybody in the audience thought he had a hot hand; i thought he had a hot hand - it was obvious that he had a hot hand. but if you go to our permutation test where we scrambled that string, which after all does have a lot of ones in it, and look at what ordinary is - this odd shape is our null hypothesis, it's our concept of ordinary. unusually high streakiness is this red zone over here, and klay's observed strength was down there. so according to this measure of hot hand he didn't have one.
- (brady: so from all) (the ways he could have shot 31 from 44,) (in terms of hot streaks or cold streaks,) (or just like normal-ness;) (he was actually at the colder end of) (things?)
- he was, he was indeed. and so this is what we saw game after game. of the 99 games the warriors played; curry played 96, thompson played 95. we looked whether there was a difference between what happened after making one shot and missing one shot, that's what we call our conditioning set depth. making two shots and missing two shots, making three shots and missing three shots - we looked in how many games did we see an unusual effect. and so for curry, if we looked what happened after one shot we saw hotness in 7 out of 96 games. if we looked at what happened after two shots, 2 of 96; and after 3 shots in 3 of 96. we turned to looking at the team as a whole and looked quarter by quarter. so these stars shoot like 20-25 shots in a game - the team shoots like 20-25 shots in a quarter. and so it was a kind of a comparable length, and we found that of the 396 quarters that were in the 99 games, again we did not see a high fraction of these, so different from 5%, showing significance. here i've used a 5% significance level, which is fairly common. what we saw is that while there was an occasional bout of hotness, not at all outside of what can be explained by mere chance. it's pretty consistent. when we add superstar kevin durant; he played fewer games than the others because he was injured for a long stretch, and showed no particularly unusual hotness either - only rarely.
- (brady: i walk away from your office) (today now thinking there's no such 
thing as a) (hot hand, being on fire - being 
in the zone) (on the basketball court is a fallacy.) well coming back to what we were saying right at the very beginning: a study is both a test of what you're trying to test plus your own implementation of it. so this- we've looked at many variants on this, but we haven't looked at all of them. i'm pretty sure there's no hot hand in these data - if you formulate hot hand as we have formulated it. but there are other formulations and one really interesting source of information, that we haven't paid attention to here,
is timing. maybe when you're hot you're doing things faster. we've just looked at strings, we haven't looked at how quickly they've occurred. maybe we've missed a piece of data like that that's really important for understanding a true phenomenon hot handedness. but another explanation, which- for which there is mounting evidence and which could also be true, is that people are not very good at understanding randomness. that there's much more chance out there than we think there is and while we are seeking for patterns and explanations, as we look backward, we're not giving a fair shot to the explanation that this was just really a random event.
