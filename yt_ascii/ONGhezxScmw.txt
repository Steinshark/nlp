okay so explain to everybody who's watching and listening how you're involved right from the place where the uranium is still in the ore in the ground like what has to happen at each step along the way so that the fuel actually gets to one of your reactors and how how is your company situated to make that happen and where are you in that process so starting at the very basic uranium mining you mentioned this scatch from deposit so you you you mine the uranium but the ore is effectively not very useful for anything but you you you subject that ore to a leeching process and you create a yellow cake which is essentially more concentrated uranium that then would be shipped off for a conversion where we sit in that is that we've actually reached out to central asia where almost the majority of the world uranium is currently being mined it doesn't have to come from but say there are big in like wyoming and skatan that are not producing uranium readily now in enough quantities to meet the demand and so it is coming from abroad i believe those domestic deposits will be built up now that the uranium price is rising because like cop 28 announces trip they the necessity to triple nuclear energy by 2040 or whatever it is so that that is having an effect on the uranium price which is encouraging mine development but the problem with mining is that it can take five years from a green field deposit to get to a to a mine and so you always have that lag and if the lag if during that lag the uranium price drops and that could even hit that might even even coming to commercial production so it's it's there's a lot of risk associated with you know not having your own domestic facilities in place so we have reached out to them we do have an ability at the president's office within certain countries in central asia to source uranium directly if we and we've even talked with the largest uranium materials broker in the world to make sure that we have a supply of that because no business wants to make wants to like have the risk that you have all you build all these facilities and reactors and manufacturing facilities but the the raw material that fuels all this isn't there so that there's that component to it too well do you worry do you worry that you're dealing with these like say central asian see again it it i bring it brings me back to the same thing well if you could have a resource in wyoming or let's say in saskatchewan that seems to me to be a lot more geopolitically stable in any real sense than trying to source something halfway around the world in countries that are definitely not politically stable and so so why were you compelled to go seek out suppliers elsewhere well the the it's the immediacy of supply like they are able to supply material now and that is a major advantage over we have a mind and it's that even feasibility level you still need to put the mine works in place the processing plant in place processing plant from uranium operation could be quarter of a billion dollars and take three years to build and so we want to make sure that does it have to take three years to build i mean you know because things do move a lot they could move a lot faster now than they once did and i'm you know i also wonder are there improvements in technology that are in the pipelines that would make it possible to do it in like a year instead of three years if people actually decided they you know i mean germany built new natural gas importing terminals in months when they needed to so like we can actually move pretty quick if we decided it was a good idea so okay so you said immediacy of supply that's what drove you to central asia but it would be better perhaps if there were domestic supplies that were at least in the pipelines let's say domestic supply from saskat aing would be would be a lot better of course they would there's there there's no geopolitical well there's less geopolitical uncertainty and like for instance even in central asia like they do supply china and russia still with the uranium that they need for their own programs too so you're competing against other countries which are potentially hostile to the states or canada or places like that and if they're looking to wage an economic war will look for more exclusive contracts and so you then are in a competing position for material you control right seems like a bad yeah like from a geopolitical perspective that seems unwise let's put it that way so i can understand why you guys are doing it commercially because as you said you can't afford the delay and fair enough okay so now do you have a stable supply fundamentally can you get can you get moving with what you're doing you can so the the the good part about what we're doing now is we've we've ensured that we have broken enough good relations with certain countries that we can source the materal if you want it we we're not in the business of enrichment but we could do things like conversion and get it into a uranium hexafluoride gas which can go to a licensed enrichment company like arano or centrus and they could enrich the material for us and once from gas so what's the relationship between the gas and the yellow cake so what you want to do with yellow cake is what once it's been concentrated by that leeching process is that you it's easier to enrich a gas then it is say say yellow cake which which you could use a centrifugal system but but gas is certainly lot easier to maneuver and so if you would take the yellow cake and you would expose it to several chemical processes to turn it into uranium hexafluoride and it's actually the enrichment companies will enrich uranium hexl to produce well whatever you want want so enriched enriched to whatever level the customer needs it but at that point it actually needs to be deconverted back to a solid oh yeah so our company actually wants to build out that infrastructure for the country too so take that uranium hex fluoride convert it to dioxide hydride sorry uranium dioxide uranium hydde uranium metal whatever the the market will need so that's one element and then fabrication facility to tailor it for the specific reactor so essentially fashion it into dimensions composition mold it with syconium whatever they want and then and then sell that and the final part of what we want to do is build out a transportation company so we can actually transport that around north america too how would you transport it so we've actually been spending about a year doing this but we've got a patented technology now for a c system that can transport the most amount of enriched material so halo material so it's enriched up to almost 20% around north america and we're just in the process of getting that license now with with the regulat okay so okay so that's okay so you you've been working on solving the transportation problem and so what are the problems associated with transport that you've had to solve and how did you solve those so the fundamental problem problem with transport is that you canot have uranium critically configured what i mean by that right if you if you uranium is only actually really radioactive if you push it all together which is the basis of a bomb really if you push it together then it be it triggers itself more and it sets off a chain reaction and it's the reactivity creates the heat so effectively for road regulations you have to you have to store the material in a structured way to make sure it's not pr but it doesn't end there there's a lot of other regulations surrounding that so is it going to be hit by a plane or misfire or is it going to fall underwater or is it going to fall what are the heat conditions can it be cold can it be warm and you got to all these safety scenario so designing a transportation ck that fits within a truck that can move a lot of material by road is a bit of an engineering challenge but i don't think it's that that difficult but it's certainly something that has not been in place previously because for smrs and micro reactors the uranium is enriched slightly more and because it's enriched slightly more you need a completely new ck system and so that's where we thought oh we'll jump on that and build that out and that way when the industry does take off the smr micro ac we'll have the transportation able to move fuel for all the okay so does that mean i see so that means that your transportation system in principle is not only designed to service your micro reactors but to be expanded to service these slightly larger reactors the smrs yeah the good part and that's the plan yeah that's the plan so we don't i mean we we're not in the business where we want the other competitors to fail if they win we'll win right yes yes right absolutely yeah the right number of competitors isn't zero no exactly yeah and also we want them to succeed because they'll build out the infrastructure they'll generate more money within the country for this industry and we'll be we'll be beneficiary of that too and they want to move fuel we'll help them move fuel they want to fabricate fuel we'll fabricate it for them even if they outsell our reactors it's fine like right so you can also be in on you can also be in on their success in that situation too as okay so that's cool okay so you said you've got a supply at least at the moment in central asia that gets reduced to by leeching to yellow cake the yellow cake is transformed into uranium hydro hydro what's the name of the gas yeah hexafluoride hex fluoride uranium hexif fluide that can be concentrated and then converted back into about 20% you said uhuh and so why 20% and then and what and you can transport it at 20% and you can do that safely and you can do that by rail by ship by car or or by by by train and and so now you have the 20% enriched material what do you do with that when you get it to where it's supposed to go so depends where it's going so if it's going to if it's the 20% enriched uranium hex floride that'll need to be converted into uranium dioxide hydride whatever fuel form you want effectively oh so are you transporting the gas we go well we don't want to i don't want to speak preemptively okay that well that's fine yeah but actually no it's fine we do want to branch take our ck and modify it so it can move gas i see okay okay anticipation is that currently we are building out a deconversion plan to be able to convert that gas into other forms and then when they're in other forms it's easier to fabricate into the final uranium form that the customers might want [music]
