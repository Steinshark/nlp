hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by mobil1 we're going to be talking about how you can determine if your engine has hidden damage and to do so i've taken oil samples from my engine after a 3 000 mile road trip the purpose of this video is to help show what you can learn about your engine and vehicle by having an oil analysis performed there's actually a surprising amount of information these have and even brought up some red flags for my own car now it's worth mentioning 3 000 miles is not a lot for modern engine oils this video isn't about when you should be changing your engine oil i'd recommend consulting your owner's manual for that information instead we're talking about what can we learn with an oil analysis so for this test i took 12 total samples at three different intervals for my crosstrek so we start off with fresh oil right out of the bottle i took a sample of that then put that oil after changing the oil in my crosstrek put the new oil in the car let it idle for 15 minutes and then i took another sample so this makes sure anything that was left behind in that engine we know what our starting point is with the fresh oil in there and then after driving 3000 miles i took the final sample so we've got our before and after with these three samples to get those three thousand miles i did a nice scenic road trip and checked out the grand tetons as well as yellowstone national park and a bear was kind enough to check in on our mileage count about halfway through i happily reported to the bear progress was going well so at each of these intervals new 15 minutes of idling and after 3 000 miles i took four samples and then i sent out a set of samples to mobile one and then because this video is sponsored by mobile one i set out another set of samples to a third party lab to independently verify the results now i also took a backup sample at each interval and that's the samples that you see in front of me here just in case any of these were to get lost in the mail i could have another option that i could send out so what can we learn from an oil analysis well i spoke with mobil 1 engineers who manage the oil analysis for large trucking fleets and they told me how they go through one of these sheets to look at information regarding your engine's health as well as how much remaining life you have within your engine oil we'll go through this based on four main themes first what's our engine health second what's our oil health third how did the third party lab results compare and fourth what were the red flags that came up for my car starting with engine health mobile one engineers stated the first things they look at on an analysis are the wear and contaminant blocks both of these blocks are measured in parts per million or ppm meaning the quantity of these metals present out of a sample of one million parts as we look at the data throughout this video note that the first column represents the first oil sample fresh oil the second column represents the second sample after 15 minutes of idling and the third column represents the third sample after 3 000 miles of driving worth mentioning molybdenum is present in the oil itself so you're looking to see if there's a significant increase with all the other metals the starting point is essentially zero and if you see a significant increase it can be indicative of certain engine components wearing for example a spike in aluminum could mean piston block or cylinder head wear copper could mean worn bearings iron could mean worn cylinders crankshaft or camshafts and i've provided a fairly generalized list of what certain metals could mean for how engine components are performing the only and very slight increase on wear metals from the mobile one analysis was iron at four ppm starting at zero not enough for it to actually matter yet and that matches with the third party results for both aluminum at 2 ppm and iron at 4 ppm after 3 000 miles aside from wear metals the other part of engine health is looking at contaminants potassium and sodium can be introduced through the engine coolant seeing a noticeable spike here could mean that engine coolant is making its way into the engine oil and this could be indicative of a head gasket failure level one says if this number is over about 75 parts per million that's when you want to start being concerned the good news is for my engine it was well below that silicon which will commonly come from sand or dirt ingress into the oil can help indicate how well the air filter is functioning this is a particularly important metric to focus on if you're running an aftermarket air filter which might not filter out contaminants as well as an oe filter silicon is very hard and abrasive so if you get a significant amount of it in your oil it starts to chew up your engine internals in speaking with a company that operates in the rally space they said their biggest challenge was finding air filters that could properly hold out dirt from getting in the engine which then chews up the cylinder liners you start to get lots of blow-by and oil consumption and ultimately ruin the engines silicon can also come from rtv and engine sealant used in assembly and finally regarding engine wear mobile one reiterated the importance of changing out your oil early on the very first time when you're breaking in that engine to make sure those initial contaminants and wear metals that are present when the engine is being built are removed quickly and taken out from that initial break-in period it's not the synthetic versus conventional debate that's important for break-in though i use synthetic for my cars but rather that you change the oil early the first time to remove contaminants from the initial manufacturing and break-in period now that we know the health of our engine we want to check the health of our oils so this lets us know whether we can continue using the engine oil or if it needs to be changed out so we have a block on our analysis dedicated to the lubricant first up is fuel dilution obviously you don't want to see fuel mixing in the oil it's a sign you're potentially running rich or have excessive blow-by possibly a fuel leak and this will thin out your oil now i have an alert here from mobile one we'll get into the cautions at the end but after 3 000 miles mobil 1 reported low fuel dilution and the third party said no fuel showed up next we get to total base number or tbn so as you have combustion occurring blow by gets past this piston and can cause contaminants to enter within your engine oil here in the crankcase so those contaminants can cause acids to form to counteract acid formation you have calcium and magnesium in the oil as you can see is present in the additives calcium and magnesium neutralize these acids so your tbn is basically telling you how much acid fighting power the oil has left in it as it gets lower you need to replace the oil the third-party lab says you want your tbn to be above 1 and after 3 000 miles again not that many miles the tbn value measured was above 1 by both mobile one and measured by the third party now viscosity is obviously an important metric for motor oils it's the big numbers you see on the side of the bottle so in this case at a hundred degrees c our hot rating is this sae 20 grade and so an sa 20 grade oil should have a viscosity between 6.9 and 9.3 millimeters squared per second and our mobile one results show that happening so it's starting off at 8.6 and then ending up at 7.4 if the viscosity measurement is too low it could be indicative of fuel or water getting into the oil if the viscosity is too high it's likely a result of oxidation meaning the oil is no longer usable and needs to be changed which leads us to oxidation which is one of the biggest factors in determining the health of an oil so oxidation is oxygen mixing with that oil and degrading it and it's going to happen no matter what your goal is to simply delay this process as long as possible oxidation causes the oil to thicken forms sludge and deposits and accelerates the degradation of the oil antioxidants are used as additives to delay this as long as possible but once it starts happening you'll notice the viscosity of the oil can start to change and this can happen quickly once it starts to get bad obviously you want to change your oil before it gets too thick in this case after 3000 miles there isn't any noticeable oxidation nitration is a somewhat similar idea to oxidation except in this case it's nitrogen that's mixing with the oil that nitrogen coming from nitrogen oxides which are formed during combustion then making their way past the piston from blowby and mixing with the oil it causes degradation to the oil and in this case our measurement shows a small increase in nitration but not enough to warrant changing the oil soot is a collection of carbon particles that form from incomplete combustion and if this soot gets into the oil it can shorten your oil filter life and also act abrasive to the engine also too much so it can overload your exhaust emissions equipment since this is a port injected gasoline engine soot really isn't an issue but for modern direct injection gasoline engines as well as diesel engines it's definitely something you want to monitor in our case measured levels were very low finally you want to make sure your oil doesn't have any water or coolant content this can reduce the oil's viscosity and thus reduce its effectiveness at protecting your engine thankfully both mobil 1 and the third-party analysis did not find any coolant or water in the oil now as mentioned i wanted to make sure i could trust all the results so i sent samples to two labs and for the most part both lab's results matched well especially when you consider the tolerances of some of these tests now i did want to provide the third party's assessment of the oil after 3 000 miles and what i found a bit surprising about it was just how light-hearted and happy toned this analysis was i mean this is you know an oil analysis we're talking about but they seem pretty amp pretty passionate about it so that was excited to see anyways they say jason we're glad this oil is still in use because 3 000 miles was no sweat for your crosstrek universal averages for this type of subaru engine show typical wear after about 6 200 miles of oil use you haven't gone that long on this oil yet and where metals are much lower just as one might expect no internal issues stand out in this data and there isn't any indication of poor wear low silicon and insolubles show the air and oil filters are both doing a good job and no fuel or water showed up the tbn is good at 5.7 so add another two to three thousand miles to this oil very nice how about that happy excited oil analysis worth mentioning third-party labs don't know what type of oil you're using so they're unlikely to recommend a change interval longer than the manufacturer recommendation mobile one's testing has shown these oils can last as long as 20 thousand miles and i have a video showing the validation testing involved of a long life oil if you're interested in checking it out now that is not to say that there were not any cautions brought up mobil one had two things that they noted to be concerning first of which was fuel dilution as a percentage of volume at 7.62 percent so that is pretty significant all things considered now this was after just 15 minutes of idling so the engine was cold it idled for 15 minutes warming itself up before i took that sample but then it says the fuel dilution was 7.6 so if there was that much extra fuel being dumped into the cylinders and then making its way into the oil i think there would be other signs that that was occurring so it may just be that this was a misleading data point either way at the 3 000 mile mark the fuel dilution was not anywhere near what that measurement was and so as a result neither a third-party lab nor mobile one seeing a significant amount of fuel in the oil at that 3000 mile mark so i don't think that one needs much concern there was one more caution from mobil one in the oil viscosity mobile one measured this at 7.4 and the third party at 7.31 so similar results after 3 000 miles now you could expect to see a small drop in viscosity from shearing viscosity modifiers these are large molecules that are additives and if you break up these large molecules then you're decreasing your viscosity the important thing is you don't want to see the oil fall out of its sae viscosity grade and in this case it does not speaking with mobile 1 they believe the initial viscosity drop is normal where the viscosity will then plateau and then slowly increase in viscosity as it reaches the oil's end of life so while this is generally expected behavior i did take a look at some of the potential causes for a viscosity drop just to make sure everything looked in order it could be that the fuel injectors are leaking or running a bit rich and fuel is getting into the oil slowly decreasing the viscosity that said i have checked my fuel trims and air fuel ratios and things seem to be normal and i don't have any engine codes so it's something to continue monitoring with more samples and more analysis it's something i can figure out if it's actually the beginning of a real problem or nothing to be concerned with and that's kind of the whole point of this oil analysis right you're looking at the health of your engine the health of your engine oil and you're monitoring things so that you can catch things before they become more serious problems you can look into things and make sure hey my engine health is good everything's going as planned or if things pop up address them as needed so this was my first time doing an oil analysis and i found it quite fascinating so i hope you enjoyed learning about this as well if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
