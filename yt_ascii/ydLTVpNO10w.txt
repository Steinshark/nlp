man spends entire career mastering crappy code base this sounds like most people's life okay this is by the way your life as a software engineer is usually trying to figure out what's why someone else did something that's stupid and guess what you end up rewriting it in about halfway through the rewrite you realize why he did something stupid and you do the stupid thing too okay that's just how it works all the time it's it that's how life works every time you think someone wrote stupid code go ahead why don't you go give it a try why don't you give it a try a tough guy guess what you're right that same stupid code every time this week software developer arthur west book announced his early retirement at age 58. nice westbrook spent 35 years in a code base that allegedly powers some sort of medical software somewhere it's it's definitely are we sure where okay this reads just like we're about to read an onion or babylon b article at any moment during his tenure he contributed 100 lines of code 35 how do i get that westbrook once touched legacy code without ending the company westbrook believes he grasps over four percent of the entire code base a former colleague called it the war and peace of wingdings oh no the company westbrook was known as one of the programmers on the team his manager noted arthur had a knack for working hard without learning transferable skills he is dearly missed ill it'll take two junior level two junior devs and a keurig to replace him oh oh no oh no your legacy as a developer will be two junior devs in a keurig okay i hope you know that right sucks to suck but that is your future in honor of his decades of service one of his co-workers will take him out for drinks sometime next month nobody on his team responded for comment first retirement westbrook plans to dabble in street performance and dumpster diving he also plans to hone his culinary creativity soylent mixed with whole foods premium adult cat salmon mix damn that's the article you all sent me why would you do this to us okay first off i wasn't really excited about this article okay it was a great read epic article but i don't want some foreboding feeling of what my future looks like okay i don't want to be dumpster diving and drinking soylent mixed with premium adult salmon cat mix okay i don't want this i know it's the future but i don't want it okay so i hate seeing it you know you hate looking in the mirror you hate what you've become because you know it's gonna happen and chad jiffy is only going to make this problem worse okay because there's gonna be more legacy produced at higher rates like nobody can ever ever imagine the amount of code that's going to be produced in the next 10 years is going to take 5x more programmers to wrangle it back into like something that's usable the amount of programming jobs is going nowhere but upwards it is the greatest time in the universe to become a programmer okay and anybody that thinks ai is going to be taking the jobs you should watch people write code with ai you should just watch it just go ahead get your get that junior that just kind of that just kind of did school never had a side project sit him down with your company code base and just watch him jab chat jeopardy and co-pilot his way to great success and then afterwards you will understand why you you too we'll be drinking soylent and adult premium cat food the name is the private jade
