because there are these sort of elements of seduction in the conversation between the serpent and eve yeah but the bible functions like that like the bible also will not say something like the serpent slept with with e but because of the structure of the conversation you understand that she is submitting herself to him like she would to her husband in a way that suggests a kind of sexual union without necessarily having to like go into the idea that they actually united sexually by the way this happens all the way through bible and in positive ways too where for example christ when he meets a samaritan woman the entire structure of the conversation is one of christ taking her as a wife but we know that he didn't marry her and he didn't have he didn't sleep with her but it's to signify the meaning of the of the relationship so we we have to be careful not to fall into the same kind of materialism that we're criticizing when we read these stories but rather be attentive mostly to what they're trying to help us understand of what's going on and let's say the structure of meaning rather than just wondering like okay so did eve really sleep with the snakes like that that's not what it says in the in the scripture but but you can understand that that's what's going on in terms of a relationship [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so hello everyone i am here with father stephen deyoung who i know needs no introduction to the people who are watching my channel father stephen is a priest in the antiochian church but he is also the host of the lord of spirit podcast of which you know we're all huge fans of he's also written several books and he is key in helping people re-understand the ancient way of thinking kind of coming back and bringing back an integrated cosmic view and so we really appreciate father stephen coming to talk to us a few things to say father stephen is going to be speaking at the symbolic world summit in february we are so excited that that he is coming it'll be great to everybody i think there'll be so much like buzz in the room with father stephen there and then everybody there it's going to be quite quite crazy and he is also he's also submitted an article for the symbolic world journal which we will be publishing very soon and that is partly what we're going to talk about today so father stephen thanks for coming back yeah it's good to be back again the everything is you know you have the the lord of spirits conference coming you publish your recent book apocrypha things are just steamrolling ahead with your your project yeah there's i mean i i don't want to give the impression i'm churning things out but that's you know that there's i'm in a period of my life where i'm i'm blessed to be able to be very productive so i'm trying to steward that well because i'm sure there will come times in my life later where i won't be able to be as productive as i am right now and so before we start the actual conversation i'd like i want to hear from you what you think if you've seen because now lord of spirits has been going on for a while with like two years or a year and a half three years three years man time just flies like crazy and have you seen a difference let's say in people's perceptions like have you kind of seen a marked change in the way that people perceive the world also perceive scripture perceive their place in the tradition since you started the podcast i i think so the the thing i've always liked most right to be the most flattering thing has always been like in in my ministry as a pastor has always been when i see someone saying something i said and not crediting me for it and the reason it's important that they don't credit me for it is that they're saying it just from their own heart and mind right meaning it's it's sunk in and they've sort of made it their own and so with lord of spirits the thing again that that makes me most happy is not when people sort of fall on over lord of spirits or you know whatever but when i see people talking about orthodox christianity talking about religion and you could tell that it's been shaped by sort of the topics we've been talking about you pick up phrases but they've internalized it in a way you know that they don't need to give me a footnote that he's really becoming it's kind of becoming their own world view and and that's what you're hoping yeah yeah that it's not well lord of spirits said this right but that you know they say this is what's really going on you know so that's that's heartening to me because that's nothing i do and i'm sure father andrew feels this way too has ever been about me trying to raise my own profile or get fans for me or impress people with how clever i am it's always been about trying to recover you know in english speaking anglophone orthodoxy is so impoverished in terms of how much of the orthodox tradition isn't available to us in our language and so it's always been about trying to recover those things that aren't really lost it's just we're still kind of in the mission field stage of orthodoxy and trying to bring those things out and it's great you know a lot of the you know a lot of the keys that you've been offering you know all these the kind of cosmological keys that that you've been offering have been really helpful to people and i'm seeing it you know richard roland and i we just started this course on beowulf you know and just reading reading the first lines like the early line just in the the inter when the they set up grendel as the as the monster like right in the first part you know it's like you can just see the world that the the anglo-saxons were living in and it was really they were lived in a kind of this kind of cosmic vision of the world and they you know the obviously grendel is is a descendant of kane he's a he's a monster he's a giant you know and and the whole book like actually the beowulf is in a larger book which has like where the manuscript was was in a larger book which had all these monster stories in them and it was like you know the the letter of alexander to aristotle there was a legend of saint christopher and that was that it's bit it's in that that book and so you could just see that it's it's making us notice things that people did the people people didn't notice before and realizing oh like this this vision was is the one that the ancient had whether you lived in constantinople or if you lived in england you know it was the cosmic world they lived in yeah yeah and this is a place where we are sort of impoverished by modernity where there's been this this reduction right which didn't have to be the case scientific understanding could have been additive right it could have been we have this that we already understand now we have this additional deeper level of understanding of this part of right the universe in reality but instead it was accompanied with this rejection and idea of replacement that we can replace this spiritual wisdom accumulated over millennia with scientific insight newly gained yeah you know yeah but it but at that time is is over i mean it's it's over but a lot of people don't realize it i think it you know they were still running on the fumes of the 19th century it seems like very thin fumes but still we still are but we're at you know we're on people that are talking about the things that you're talking about or i do think that i'm talking about in some ways are on the strange leading edge even in terms of you know i don't know if you if you followed some of the conversations i've had but i'm in a point now where i can talk to secular you know cognitive psychologists or secular scientists and talking about demons and angels and talking about worship and talk about god even and they just kind of nod along because they realize that these the question of agency you know of transpersonal agency for example has become inevitable to deal with like we it's actually even from a materialist point of view the idea that agency exists only at the human level and doesn't if it scales down into animals but doesn't scale up into higher organizations it's like it doesn't even their own system actually it's it's like there's this weird superstitious thing and they're thinking to make prevents them from wanting to see agency kind of coming down from above and so so you're you're in this situation where you know even like i said even people who wouldn't call to say they're believer wouldn't even believe in god or like yeah well we kind of have to acknowledge that there are these these intelligences that are acting on us yeah i i think there's always been a sort of intuitive knowledge of it and then sort of a denial of it yeah right then you act as if but then if you ask me if you believe it like no no i don't believe that but it's like strangely enough you still act as if that that was true in in a lot of these actions you still act as if these these things coming from above are real yeah i've never i've never read i mean i've read plenty of history books by outright marxists who are insists they're doing completely material history but it always reads like a story yeah okay it always you know and if you ask them they'd say well yes to some extent you know my book is a false construct right because they have to like deny their own right they see there are things that work here that there's a pattern and they're bringing it out through their work what they know based on their views there shouldn't be yeah so they're in this performative contradiction where the very the very like decrying of the pattern like this revolutionary trope is itself a story that's as old as you know the cosmogony and so the idea that that because they're introducing this revolutionary kind of it's a destructoring destructuring trope in there think that it's not a story it's like well it's another myth you know it's like cat you know saturn castrating his father that's what you're doing it's not it's not a big it's not a big surprise like it's not something you know and so you you're stuck they're stuck in the religious world ultimately you just don't realize it yeah yeah and and it's just sort of known and denied rather than unknown all right so the thing i want to talk about today is something you know you you keep handing you these amazing golden keys in my own work i mentioned before that one of the keys that you handed me was for years i wanted to mention traditions that were kind of enokian traditions but i knew that the fathers had put that aside but i also knew that there were some aspects of it that were really useful and i knew that the the problem was like the demon and angel the demon and women problem and then when you handed me the ritual part of it where you said you know these are just rituals it is it is true it is actually happening but it's happening through ritual proxy and that is how these things get embedded in the world i was like oh my goodness you just handed me the best key even for my own work and since then i've been like willing to talk about these things more openly but now you've handed me another like key which is that okay so so so i want you actually you i want you to lay out your theory because it has to do with a very difficult not difficult but a a weird passage in the book of genesis when after the flood you know ham discovers his father's nakedness and and i want you to lay it out and then we can talk about it because it's for me it's like a massive key yeah yeah so there is and it is weird right it's it's this episode that comes after after the flood stray is basically over and it seems in certain ways at odds with the preceding story because the emphasis of course in the most of the flood narrative in genesis six through nine is that noah is this one righteous person from his generation and then after the flood you have this whole story with him becoming drunk and and these other things unfolding part of the reason it's so weird is that it's kind of bodilarized in all the english translations so we weren't getting sort of the direct and because most english readers aren't as familiar with the rest of the torah as maybe we should be so genesis really is the prologue to the rest of the the torah yeah and that's one of the very basic keys to interpreting and understanding genesis if you don't keep that in mind when you're reading genesis that this is leading up to exodus right this is leading up to the rest of of what's in the torah then you'll sort of end up misinterpreting it and so there's there's a theme here this is the place where i go to kind of lay it out because this place where it's most complete but it's a pattern that repeats in genesis and the patriarchal narratives that make up chapters 12 through 50 of genesis so what's described if you just read it in english is noah plants have vineyard he gets drunk in the vineyard and his son ham sees his father's nakedness his father's nakedness is uncovered and goes and tells his brothers sham and japheth shem and japheth go and cover their father's nakedness and then when noah sort of recovers from his inebriated state he curses canaan the son of ham who is the fourth son of his third son and disinherits him so he disinherits the fourth son of his third son yeah so definitely already there's a massive narrative problem and it's a narrative problem that we gloss over and i've done it myself we gloss over it by saying that ham is the cursed one but that's not what's written in the text right right and there's all kinds of bizarre and even racist theories about the curse of ham yeah and ham is not cursed that's right yeah so in order to kind of figure out what's going on here we have to understand sort of what uncovering the father's nakedness means and if you go to leviticus chapter' leviticus chapter 17 through people cut it off in different places 22 or 23 is what's called the holiness code and has regulations covering holiest leviticus' is discussing sexual immorality so that's where the commandments are about about sexual morality and that takes the form because we're in a patriarchal society that takes the form of telling men primarily who they're not allowed to sleep with because they of course were the ones making the decisions regarding that culturally and one of those commandments is you shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife for this is your father's nakedness and something similar is actually said about your father's daughter right this is and so this idea it's like all the incest laws are are are portrayed as un uncovering your father's nakedness i think it's even like like your aunt and like yeah you know your father's sister yeah yeah and so this phrase of uncovering the nakedness right is this reference to sexual relations particularly that are forbidden right and you can see why that would be right the idea is that the father the patriarch right within the family is is the one who is charged with safeguarding in the case of the daughter in the case of the sister right and even his own wife safeguarding sort of protecting them from sexual exploitation from right and so it belongs to him and it's his job to cover it right it's his job to right sort of protect it so once you have that in mind right and we go back to this story in genesis what ham is doing here sort of makes sense right so we can now understand when it says he you know went into his father's tent right this is talking and uncovers the negatives of his father this is him having relations with his mother and then when this comes to the attention of noah we see him disinheriting ham's youngest son and why would he need to do that well kanan ham's youngest son is the son he bore who his his mother bore him yeah so if the child conceived through those illicit sexual relations and the covering of the nakedness is talking about protecting that again so the other brothers once they find out this is going on move to stop it right move to protect their mother from from him their brother ham right and so the question then becomes sort of why would ham do this right aside from just maybe perversion right like why would he why would he do this this is actually i don't want to call it an institution but or a practice but because it was not well looked at right in the in the ancient world by the asian world and in other places in the scriptures we see what's called family usurpation the idea here is that what ham is trying to do is he's trying to bear a son with his father's wife who replaced his father right to replace his father and then that son would become the heir and so he would be effectively taking over the family structure yeah it's a it's a kind of revolutionary it's a revolutionary move where he's trying to take right take he's replaced his father in terms of authority take his body like take his take his wife take his and then also take the inheritance and take the take everything away from his father while his father is still is still alive right right and and this becomes especially clear when you know how inheritance and the right of pretty much editor worked right the ancient societies which was first born son inherits everything yeah and then can choose whether or not to share that with the other right brothers yeah the others become dependent on him like they become subsidiary to the older brother right he takes his father's place when his father passes away and they have a place of the extended family only insofar as they're connected to him and maintain relationships with him and this is true throughout the ancient period so even in the gospels we find someone comes to christ it says teacher tell tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me right and christ says you know you know what don't worry about the inheritance come follow me right don't worry about the money but even there you see how there could be problems when first word son just says nah i'm i'm just going to keep all this and you guys can buzz off but so ham would not have inherited anything unless he you know maintained this relationship and remained subsidiary to his older brother he then enacts this plan to try to displace his father and and take over and that's why then noah has to disinherit this child and and reject it and maybe you can tell people because obviously it's like okay if father stephen just pulling this out of his hat here you know in genesis itself and then later in in the bible there are examples of that exactly happening again and so there are places where this type of behavior is is is repeated right and and this is just sort of a clear case of it but there are other clear cases i mean later in genesis reuben is going to sleep with one of his father's concubines to attempt to do this and that's at a sort of an especially shocking case because reuben actually was the firstborn son yeah so he's sort of tried to user jacob while he's still alive yeah right and reuben was disinherited because of that he lost that firstborn status because of that it ends up passing to judah because there's also there's also absalom yeah absalom does this with david's wives and concubines during the period where he yeah you serve david's power but absalom actually did this publicly he made a public display of it right to signal to everyone i'm the i'm the head that he had now taken over this is something that was an attempted one of the first places where we see the office of queen mother in the old testament is with solomon has his mother bathsheba and thrown into his right hand and the first person to come to her and make a request to the king through her is trying to do this he requests now that david is gone that he be given one of david's concubines as a wife and solomon said uh i i know where this is going right so so this is an epic so this is this directly is a pattern in the sense of other people doing this in the context of a family use or patient you also see that pattern in other places less literally yeah right so one of the biggest examples is in genesis 3. now there's this stuff it protestant circles it's called the serpent seed doctrine but there have been gnostic sex that thought this and stuff too yeah the thought that kane was like literally the son of the son of the devil yeah that's not what he says that's not what it says in the bible though right right we'd have to be really clear but that's not based on nothing because there are these sort of elements of seduction in the conversation between the serpent and eve yeah yeah but the bible functions like that like the bible also will not say something like the serpent slept with with e but because of the structure of the conversation you understand that she is submitting herself to him like she would to her husband in a way that suggests a kind of sexual union without necessarily having to like go into the idea that they actually united sexually by the way this happens all the way through bible and in positive ways too where for example christ when he meets a samaritan woman the entire structure of the conversation is one of christ taking her as a wife but we know that he didn't marry her and he didn't have he didn't sleep with her but it's to signify the meaning of the of the relationship and so we we have to be careful not to fall into the same kind of materialism that we're criticizing when we read these stories but rather be attentive mostly to what they're trying to help us understand of what's going on and let's say the structure of meaning rather than just wondering like okay so did eve really sleep with the snakes like that's not what it says in the in the scripture but but you can understand that that's what's going on in terms of a relationship right right that there is this sort of seductive element and that after all is what the serpent is trying to do it's it's an active user patient yeah and then in that case it's because he can't create right and so this this idea of user patient whether it's directly in this family context or outside of it right is over again sort of the opposite of it what it's what it's a sin against is creation creating something putting something in which is putting something in order and filling it with life right so you look at abraham right he builds this family unit right which has structures people have roles right within this extended family which includes not just biological family members but sir his servants his herdsmen his right this whole unit that he's built and he's filled it with life in the terms of i mean most directly in terms of reproduction right but also it's sort of the prospering right of of everyone and and everything involved and sort of the shortcut of that is no i'm not going to build something of my own i'm not going to participate in continuing to build this up and fill it with life and keep it in order i'm going to try and take it over i'm going to try and make this thing that someone else created in mind yeah and that of course is what the devil is doing right from the beginning god created it your insight is perfect so you can understand that the image of usurpation itself or the image of the pride of satan who wants to you know even like whatever version of the fall of the devil you you take you know whether it's a kind of miltonian or virgin or the the the the the more ancient one of of the fall happening at the at the creation of adam right in some ways the idea is that the devil wants to become our god you know like the devil wants to be for us what is god and then take over take over creation and that becomes in some ways make trying to make creation his wife right it's like that's what the devil is is always trying to do and that's what every single temptation that you face is trying to do for you right so it's like with every sin that tempts you is trying to make you its life you know it's trying to is trying to come up above and master everything underneath and and use it as its body in order to be able to to grow and to have more power in the world so it's like a it's a fractal thing that happens at every level of reality this idea of of something which wants to come up usurp and then take the body for itself yeah yeah and and it's important then to also have the positive side right of we're called upon to create right to build to put in order right to fill with life and it's interesting in in sort of the the popular zeitgeist like you look at hbo shows you have game of thrones and then as soon as it ends you have succession which is all about children trying to use serp and it sees some kind of power something that was created by sort of a previous distant father and all kinds of chaos and mayhem and murder and destruction taking place in that context rather than anyone trying to build anything create anything right bring life to anything yeah yeah okay so i so then the next step and this is the one that i don't know what you think about this yet i kind of wrote you an email proposed a little bit because one of the reasons why this story in particular had my my fascination was also because i noticed a pattern in scripture which has to do at the beginning of something and it seems like when something begins we always find in some ways a we could call a pattern of incest that is there at the beginning it seems like in some ways there's the it's like the sin of the beginning seems to be incest and the sin of the end seems to be something like confusion or going to the strange woman or that so you we have these two extremes you could say it's like you know solomon's saying don't go to the strange woman because basically you'll lose everything like everything will kind of give be given to the stranger but then if you look at this the pattern you see this weird pattern of incest as the scandal of the beginning so and that's why when i was looking at this story i was like that seems to be what it's referring to but i i always thought that it was that it was like a like a homosexual relationship between ham and noah but i was like i don't want to talk about that because it's just like i and the reason why i see it is because i want to give people the examples it's like in genesis after sodom and gomorrah you have lot who sleeps with his daughters then you have at the at the when god reveals himself to abraham you find that abraham also is married to his sister like his half-sister which is which would be which would be a sin like which would be a something that would be prohibited in the in the law later and then when you when you so you so you have noah you have lot then you have abraham right right there in genesis these three iterations of the beginnings of worlds where there seems to be this this this trope and then when you bring it into genesis then you have it right at the beginning and now it's like obviously it's not it's not a sin at this point but you have the idea that you know eve is taken from adam and his his own is his own body basically it's like it's him that is that is taken out out of him and so and so now when you when you say when you bring when you mention you said no it's it's really based on the law what you see in the law which is that there's a relationship with noah's mother or noah's wife and then the descendants of that occurs i'm like yeah then that it fits it even better with the way that i saw it it kind of kind of makes this a pattern that repeats all over all over genesis so i don't know if you've noticed that or what do you think about my perception yeah so part of there's also another corresponding trope on the other side and that is so if incest is too close yeah right it's sort of joining the same with the same right yeah then you also have the trope with esau right where they go and you know abraham is very concerned with isaac that he not marry one of the people of the land yeah right yeah even in even in abraham you have the same thing where he wants to find the right distance so for his sons he wants his sons to marry like a cousin or like a second cousin or something yeah then it will it will basically take all your strength away into the stranger if it's too close then it creates this weird internal loop that it will that will cause absolute chaos yeah it brings about this sort of chaos of destruction and so both of those right you see set out as these as these polarities yeah and that really goes back to adam and eve right and the whole idea when eve is created as in hebrew the eights are connecto and conego really it means fits together like puzzle pieces right you know there's a literal very literal material biological yeah sense like puzzle pieces but it goes beyond that right it's not limited to that and so the idea that yeah she is not she is bone of adam's bone and flesh of his flesh but at the same time right she is full in the places he's empty right and right and so that is the place where there is this sort of the sort of perfect connection right that then is able to sort of produce life and produce good order yeah right so in the incestuous relationship can produce life but but not order yeah it's a new supreme because it actually creates confusion and this is technic it's technically true like it it because the world has an order of manifestation right it's like a father with a mother and then children and then you know the father has relationship like sisters and brothers at this level and then the children come down but if a child has a relationship with someone that is you know at the same level as their father either their father or their mother or some or like an uncle or whatever then then the relationships become actually confused the identity of the people become confused because what is the child the child is the child my brother is he my son is he my is he my uncle like what is this child it's it's it's now creating confusion in the the order of reality itself it's like it's it's literally doing that when you when you when you break the normal order of causality of the world right and and you end up destroying what you're trying to user exactly that's what you're trying to gain control of yeah which is the very pattern of revolution itself you see that that's what that's what happens like in the in the cosmogony you have a very powerful image of it which is that you know it's like you know saturn castrates his father but then he has to eat his children because he's created now a confusion of order that makes it that he's not afraid of his own children because it's like they are they are not in the right relationship with with him they're going to come to get him and he doesn't know what to do and so you have this you have this this confusion that that yeah that self basically like that self-destroys at some ultimately yeah yeah and it becomes again rather than producing life it becomes parasitic yeah it drains it away yeah so so and and it's interesting because my my brother mentioned this in his interview with jordan peterson like how he said all the scripture is about that like all the scriptures about finding the right distance like the right wife you could say like between that which is too close and that which is too far right the the the the stranger that loves you ultimately you could say which is not as not a stranger that's so far that they'll kind of swallow you up and if you take that trope now that we mentioned and we see that it's there this idea of you don't want to go to the strange woman because she'll bring your gods in and then you'll be usurped also in that way but you also don't want to be too close because you create this confusion of identity in christ you have this weird transcendence of all these things you have this way in which it all kind of gets expanded and collapsed at the same time first of all the samaritan woman i think seems to be a direct reference to this question because one of the things christ does is first of all he talks about the well and the the fountain which is the image that solomon uses when he talks about this strange woman he he he he says like keep your fountain to yourself don't let it run into the streets and and he uses this images of wells and and the fountains to talk about not going towards the strange woman and then cries basically is the is the only one who can marry the strange woman but not be taken over by her right he can go to the ends of the world he can go all the way to the edge but he's never subsumed by the strained woman well that's and i think the reason for that is the incarnation part of the theme when you read the prophets and they're describing the relationship between god and israel and why that doesn't work is that they're too different they're too far apart and you look at the analogies there the way israel is described it's always as sort of this foreigner you know who god finds in the desert you know and and mary's right but it's it's too far apart but this is why calcene is so important right christ is is consubstantial with the father according to his divinity and consubstantial with us yeah and you can see that in some ways it's it's because one of the things that i've noticed when we did this whole seminar in exodus and in the seminar at exodus you can see the problem constantly of mediation that god is constantly conceding mediations but he like it's almost like he knows that this is going to cause problems in the long run it's like oh you know you know you want aaron but then aaron makes the golden calf you know okay so now you have all these laws and it's complicated and then you see you know and then later in samuel he's like oh you don't want a king like why would you want if you want a king all this mediation is gonna is gonna turn against you but in some ways god's constantly conceding it because he knows that it's inevitable because of this problem of distance then ultimately christ ends up being the the key to the whole problem from the beginning of mediation right and so and so christ can make that marriage work yeah and so that's why so pentecost is like so so when prophet say you know one day the spirit of god will be poured out on all flesh it's like you can imagine how weird that sounds even to people who now have been told to not marry the strange woman to not go to the stranger to not but they it's like they know that ultimately at some point you know this marriage will be a universal marriage will be a married with all of humanity but then how is that possible considering this problem of of distance you could say yeah yeah and so humanity has to become bone of god's bone and flesh of god's flesh yeah like eve was to adam and so then this is this is to me because this is something that i've seen us a few like writers try to take on because when we look at the symbolism of the mother of god in in in christianity we have this weird thing going on right which is exactly the symbolism that i'm a tr that i'm talking about which is that she's represented both as christ's mother and as christ's bride so you have this sent in which it's suggesting a weird like ancestral thing and but then when you realize what is actually happening even if you use the image of the samaritan woman as the example you realize it that christ is in some ways he's beyond that dua like he he doesn't have that problem he's kind of he's kind of transforming the whole question you know and of course i'm not suggesting in any way that there was something inappropriate between jesus then right and mary what i'm saying is that the symbolism that's being kind of expanded is that ultimately those two you know in in in christ are kind of that problem is is transcended somehow yeah and part of part of the problem with that frankly is the modern american and maybe broader western sort of obsession with sexual relations like proper the material sense yeah well that's why we can't see the the pattern if it's not like that's why i people will struggle to say well the serpent is trying to seduce eve and it's like i'm not suggesting the serpent slept with even some weird material way but i'm just showing you that this these patterns they have different iterations you know yeah but this is and this is this is the problem with the augustinian treatment frankly of human sexuality is that it fails to see physical sexuality as the material signifier of a spiritual reality that remains regardless of the presence of that material signifier so what i mean by that is and i've said this to people in marriage counseling a lot right if you have a a you know 23 year old couple who just got married and you have an 83 year old couple that's been married for 60 years right the 23 year old couple is having a lot hotter sex right that's a lot more often probably yes but the 83 year old couple right has a relationship at a deeper level that goes far beyond that yeah right far far far beyond that yeah in some ways and also kind of in in that physical aspect of it let's say kind of fading away they capture the pure the pearl like they they're they're they're moving into the into the deeper part of what of what it is that they were moving towards in the first place and those two are not unrelated exactly they're directly related yeah right but the one is this sort of material signifier yeah right of the of the deeper reality and so but every time we think about any of these concepts our contemporary minds move immediately to just the material signifier right it's just you know titillation and you know oh you're you're talking about sex like no we're talking about the reality behind that right yeah and so in some ways what it requires of us is really a complete reversal of the way we think of what is real you know and it's not a because we tend to we tend to and you see it most people today even you know they tend to like oppose oppose normally the spiritual and the material they oppose it and so either they fall into one or the other either they wanted to to kind of you know poo poo the the the material practice and the material world and want to live just in the spirit you know like people who say i'm spiritual but not religious that kind of that kind of that kind of nonsense and then on the other hand you know we have people who think that that you know this material world is so real like that's what we need to chase after but both of those are are a mistake you know ultimately to see it in this scale of hierarchy where the physical materiality is the bottom part and the most the most let's say immediate but ultimately has to move us into what its height or what it's not hiding in the bad sense but what it what it holds in its center like what's holding it together what lies behind it yeah yeah and again what lies behind it is there even if you want to try to deny it like people who live very promiscuously that does things to your heart and to your soul over time yeah because you can't be intimate with people physically and not also have developed intimate connections in other ways yeah like leave some part of your soul like with that person yeah so because they're so intricately bound together yeah and and you know and i think that it's not the the way that the church represents our union you know is not arbitrary and the way that the reason why we insist on marriage is not just some kind of moral finger wagging right it is it is and you can see like people who live prom with promise q with a lot of promiscuity in their life and especially people that that you know obviously don't come to repentance they don't come to kind of a transformation you know they they they end with bitterness like it's hard not for that not not to happen yeah and repentance again is not like feeling bad and and whipping yourself or pens is being healed yeah from the damage that's been done you know and and yeah so there there sort of is there is hope for that yeah and and part of that part of the problem with the way we talk about marriage now is that we've got this very modern idea of the nuclear family behind it yeah and that conception of marriage and family leaves a lot of people out and has caused us a lot of problems so i'm a big advocate as people who listen to lord of spirits to know i describe it as arguing for the abolition of the nuclear family just to get everybody freaked out but that we need to come back to within our church communities and things a more robust idea of family like the kind of families we see in genesis of extended family you know that includes a lot that is is able to include a lot of people it's able to include an adult who for whatever reason has not gotten married yeah because it doesn't mean like i i understand what you're saying but the the the the nuclear family should i would see this i'd rather see it as like the nuclear family should be just expanded into this right for an expanded family to exist you need someone to have been a strong nuclear family and then be able to like expand that like breathe out and to include the uncle that like you said didn't get married or like whatever someone who got divorced or some you know someone who died and the child gets up ends up kind of going to their brother or whatever like that has to be something that has to in order for us to to be able to live in that more expanded way definitely yeah i think the older the much older what what family meant for most of human history yeah has just been ground down to the nuclear family definitely you know and and i think right now so much effort is put into trying to preserve that little bit that's left that we really need to redirect into rebuilding not just trying to preserve what the culture and society has left us but build out build back and build out from there again so i i have another question that just to get back to the to the noaa story and everything do you think there's do you think or do you see a relationship between the way that also you're interpreting first of all the sort of noah then also the the the story the way that we talk about the fall of the the idea of the nephilim and all this question that when saint paul talks about the covering you know that weird that weird sentence when saint paul says you know that that women should wear coverings for the sake of the angels do you think that there's a relationship between this idea of uncovering and and the the union let's say in that sense yes can you help us work that out a little bit yeah yeah because we all have that intuition but it's fuzzy like it's a fuzzy it's a fuzzy thing yeah we're gonna get into all the really wild stuff here in this one video so there's a phrase that saint paul uses in that context that's often translated in english symbol of authority so the word there i'll go ahead and say it the word there is the greek word for scrotum yeah i didn't want to know that so and so part of what's going on there is saint paul seems to be referencing greco-roman medical tax so the understanding in roman medicine and you see this if you read how saint john chrysostom deals with this path the larger passage you can see it reflected in what he says too but if you go and read like the hippocratic corpus they believe that hair served as sort of a receptacle for male seed that it was sort of drawn up into the body by by hair okay and therefore so a woman who wore her hair long and exposed was presenting herself as sexually available and likewise a man who wore his hair long culturally was considered to be presenting himself as sexually available to other men and that's why i say paul says having long hair is a shame right to a man and you're going well wait a minute what about nazarites instead right he's not referring to that he's talking about this thing in this context right and so because of that essentially a woman's long hair was seen as a genital structure that's why he can use that word right to to refer to it and so to have that exposed in worship right would be presenting oneself as sort of sexually available within the context of worship he's writing this to corinth where to be super blunt most of the religious festivals were accompanied by orgies right and saying there is there is no place for that within right to the christian worship context and then is referencing in terms of the because of the angels is referencing back to the idea of the nephilim yeah right which proceeded as you mentioned earlier out of this ritual context yeah which is happening which is a ritual context in the worship like they are in the ritual context there and so there's like a conclusion placing yourself as available to receive the influence of higher states but not being properly covered so that you could become like a you could become like a receptacle for the wrong like for for the let's say for the yeah for for for the intermediary beings you could say it that way maybe right this is and this is the ability to bring life into the world is a power that women possess yeah that needs to be protected because of how powerful it is yeah and so i mean it makes it it's complex because it's working it's working on mall it's working on all these multiple levels at the same time because in some ways we can understand it something like if you were going to be very boring about it we could say something like if the woman is uncovered in in this in the in this in the context of worship in a religious ritual she is opening herself to influences that are that would be kind of these free-floating intermediary influences you know that aren't right god himself that are kind of like this kind of intermediary world that's messy and and full of mixture of angels and demons or whatever and that and that in some ways that would be dangerous for her dangerous for the church dangerous for yeah right and and noah's sinned then in the case is not just oh he got drunk and embarrassed himself somehow he got drunk and did something embarrassing which you know you shouldn't do but in terms of like severe sins right not probably top of most people's list his his sin is being drunk and inebriated right on on the good things of this world and failing to protect right the the the his nakedness right yeah yeah the team is there because lord gets drunk before he before it before it's right he passes out and yeah or his daughters and so there's like a there's definitely a narrative relationship between the two and and i think that it's because iconographically like we represent it straightforwardly and so if you if you have an iconographic representation of the scene you will see you will see like a vine you'll see noah drunk asleep and then you'll see ham like pointing at his nakedness usually and then you'll see like the two the two sons walking backwards you know with like a sheet or something and i think that it's it's completely appropriate to kind of take it at the first level especially if we're going to represent it visually but if you want to understand how it relates to the rest of the bible and how it relates you know to all these these moments of beginnings and all these moments of transgression all the way into christ and we have to see that it's more than just this kind of like this kind of weird thing because if you think about it like you know it it's like anything right you you think okay so all of canaan is cursed like the whole not just the sun but like the whole descendants of canaan is cursed because his father saw his own father naked it's like man that's rough that's a that's a rough thing but that's also see that's a so the the father-son thing yeah in scripture is always talking about repeating the pattern yeah right so the canaanites had come and laid claim to this land that belonged to god and that was not their inheritance it was someone else's inheritance that's right yeah so it repeats it in the in the context of the two peoples right yeah and so that that that pattern repeats yeah in the lock case the the idea of him failing to protect his daughters is really brought out leading up to that because if you read closely in the story he had betrothed both of them to men of sodom that's right yeah and he basically he proposed to basically like to throw him out there man right to give them to the mob right and and so yeah that final episode right is of this has this really it's a reversal of outgrowth for sin like it's like it's almost like it's a pendulum where she was willing to give his daughters up to these these destructive men and that was like the sin of the too far you could say and also this this and then finally turns back on him and then he becomes the father of his own grandchildren you know right right yeah abraham is so concerned he wants to find isaac a wife from his own people whereas lot is just like a couple of the guys here in town you guys can marry them that's why that's fine yeah well and especially in that sense because you also see in the in they're already in genesis you have this image where would it have more who wants to marry into jacob's family and says if we marry their daughters then we'll basically take them over like it'll take a while but you know at some point we'll just take whatever they have because we'll just keep taking their daughters and then we'll overwhelm them and then they'll they'll basically disappear and stop sort of assimilate them yeah exactly you know and so it's like that's the image that solomon tries to bring about when he talks about marrying the strange woman or the idea of the strange gods like you you have to find that balance so that you're not swallowed up by the by the outside yeah i don't want to sound like i'm making this trite but you can apply this at every level of structure that we're involved with like i say you you have any kind of team you know it's like and you're doing something like if you just constantly circulate within yourself like you know it's like you're just constantly everybody is always with inside the team in a way that at some point you know just becomes circular you're gonna break down like if you do that for a while it's gonna break down at some point you won't be able to but if you just like go on the street and just hire anybody just go out and like oh you you you you you're not doing anything why don't you come work on our team then you run the risk of becoming you have to find that balance between you know what we're doing and innovation or new or new blood and and so you have to kind of find you're always trying to find that balance between that which will invigorate the team but won't you know basically take its identity away in the long term yeah well i think it's even i think it's even true at the level of the human soul we're very much now able with the internet for example to put ourselves into an echo chamber yeah where we only ever talk to people who endorse everything we ever say do and think you know who agree with us about everything right right now that's exactly right you know and the solution to that is not the opposite is not to just expose yourself to everything and be completely credulous and believe anything anyone tells you and sort of sell everything out but there's again the the middle distance yeah right yeah and you can see when you don't do that what happens like there's a the this is a weird example but it's the one that comes to my mind which is that there's an interesting debate online among debate between it's like matt tabi and i forget i forget his name and like malcolm gladwell right and yeah i've actually heard that you see that it's about media capture and you can tell that the malcolm gladwell side was so much in their echo chamber yeah that they didn't even understand the arguments of the of their opponents and so they kind of they were just in this illusion of their coherent world and then their world just got shattered on stage like smashed into visas and they lost the debate by the the biggest margin anybody's ever lost a monk debate and they don't they still don't understand why that happened because it's like they're so into their own like and so you can actually see it it's like it's actually even as a christian let's say and if you just have these weird like internal things like that you're just talking to other orthodox christians and all you talk about are like divine energies like all day and then and then you haven't ever you haven't encountered anybody from the outside you haven't discussed with with anybody outside then at some point when you when you're challenged you'll just you'll shatter yeah there's no there's no creative power in that yeah that's never going to go anywhere produce anything new right give life to anything yeah anything living yeah yeah exactly all right this is this is wonderful i mean we really went right to the edge there if i was keeping yeah i'm pretty sure you were going to try and monetize this so that's probably good it's like that i i didn't expect you to use you to wear use the word scrotum in our discussion but there you go that's that's how it goes and so i and so thank you for your time thank you also for everything you do and and everybody i am also you know and i'm really excited to have you talk to us at the symbolic world summit it's going to be it's going to be amazing and don't forget people also to look out for this mock world journal which will have his father stephen's exposition about this very question in printed in the journal so so a lot of great things coming on the horizon is there something you're working on that you want to give us a peek on or well lord lord willing the next book i've been doing this big project on saint paul so sort of from an orthodox perspective so that's probably the next thing in print you'll see coming all right that sounds cool that'll probably be sometime next year wonderful all right thank you father stephen it's great to talk to you
