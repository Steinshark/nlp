hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about two shaft turbos so what in the world is a two shaft turbo well it simply uses two different types of compressors within one turbo packaging and so it's going to be using an axial compressor as well as a radial compressor so what are axial and radial compressors well an axial compressor simply means that the airflow remains in the axis of rotation of the compressor that's just a fancy way of saying that it goes straight the air goes straight through much like a jet engine a radio compressor that actually changes the direction of the airflow so it then curves out this is what you see in turbochargers and centrifugal superchargers used in automotive applications so a two shaft turbo is going to be combining these now before we get into two chef turbos i want to talk about an axial radial turbo i found a sae article talking about these turbochargers from 1990 and it said the goal of it was to increase the pressure ratio in a compact form and so what does that mean increase the pressure ratio well the pressure ratio is the ratio of the pressure coming out of the compressor divided by the pressure that's going in and that's going to be some number that's greater than one so for example if atmospheric pressure is one bar and the pressure ratio of the turbocharger is two to one then you would have two bar coming out of the turbocharger getting back to the goal of this axial radial turbocharger there was a quote that i particularly enjoyed in the journal article about it they said of course no matter what horsepower is being developed someone somewhere can think of an application for 10 or 20 percent more power now i don't know how many of you spend your time reading sae journal articles generally they're a lot like my videos in that they're very dry and void of any resemblance of humor so what i enjoyed about this was that they actually kind of threw a little somewhat ounce of a joke in there where they said you know people just like horsepower people want more of it that's what we all crave and so that was the goal of this project and cool that they included that little note in the article so how does this turbo work well this one started off very simple so you've got your exhaust portion of the turbocharger here you've got your intake portion of the turbocharger here there's a common shaft of course which that compressor shares with the turbine there and so as this is spooled up it turns both of these compressors here they're on a common shaft and so you have an axial compressor which is going to pressurize air somewhat before getting to that radial compressor which then compresses it further now it was weird to me that these seem to be on the same axis we'll get into that later on with this honeywell design here but basically they were saying that with this axial compressor they could compress the air with a pressure ratio of up to 1.25 to 1 before the axial before the radial compressor right here and as a result they were seeing 20 to 30 percent improvements in the pressure ratio overall with the same mass flow through the exhaust so certainly an improvement they were able to increase boost levels with you know the same amount of exhaust flow so that means this overall had a greater power density so it actually extends the turbocharger in length they were saying by about two to three inches 60 to 80 millimeters but the width of it stays exactly the same so from a packaging standpoint it's not much of a sacrifice and yet it gives you a significant increase in boost and so that was the benefit of doing this now as i mentioned looking in this article i didn't see anything that was saying that these rotated separately it seemed they were all paired on the exact same shaft and i thought that was a bit strange which led me to looking into other solutions and there was a patent in 2006 by honeywell honeywell which of course designs garrett turbochargers very popular turbocharger company so they had this patent which was explaining a two shaft turbo the main focus of this video so how does this two shaft turbo work well you have two separate shifts wow what do you know i like the name explains and so you've got one shift which has that axial compressor on both sides so it's driven by the exhaust and then rotates it here on the intake side just like this one except it's on its own individual shaft and then you have the radial compressor on its own shaft after that initial axial compressor so you've got those two stages there of compressing it and then you can complicate things further by adding in variable vanes so they've got variable vanes on all sides so for the intake and the exhaust between the two compressors and then they also have variable vanes this right here is a lot like a variable geometry turbocharger i'll include a link in the video description talking about how this portion of it works in this video we're going to talk about these but i do have a separate video covering why you might want veins right there that's the whole thing behind variable geometry turbos so what's going on with these variable guide vanes right here well the idea is is that you can change how the flow enters into this axial this radial compressor right here from the axial compressor so this is trying to push in air to this guy right here and you can change how that airflow enters using those veins so at low flow the idea is you can create a swirl with the air and help out what this is going to be doing with that air because it's going to try to rotate it but you're basically helping that out initially using these veins and this axial compressor before it enters into it so the idea there is that you can improve the low flow area of this turbocharger so the low rpm regions where you're not getting quite as much exhaust flow then on the high flow end you can straighten out these vanes right here and just allow for the maximum amount of airflow through it and so overall honeywell claims that this design right here will give you improved packaging and a lower cost versus using sequential turbos so is it better than using sequential turbochargers well from a cost and packaging perspective according to this patent according to honeywell yes i don't see it used in today's production vehicles at least that i am aware of there probably are some examples that i just don't know about but you do tend to see twin turbo setups and sequential turbo setups more often at least that seems like a common thing within the industry i don't hear about this as much but perhaps it's out there and i'm just clueless and don't know about it so the whole benefit of this over you know just using a single radial style compressor with a turbocharger is that you're increasing its flow range so on the low end you have these veins and you can help create swirl to aid this second style compressor in creating boost and then on the top end you're using this axial compressor here to increase the pressure before it enters the radial compressor and so as a result because you've got boost already right here that means you've got a higher air density and it allows this to take things another step further so you've already got some boost and then you put it in this stage compressor and that takes you further so you increase on both ends of you know with just the purple alone you're going to be in this range and then by adding this secondary style compressor you can increase the range at which you have good flow so the useful boost that the engine can create is is a wider range of rpm so a great useful thing to do and have a pretty neat design again i don't know about current cars or or engines that are using this but it's pretty fascinating to think about so thank you all for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below and i will include some relevant links to other style turbo chargers if you're interested in checking that out
