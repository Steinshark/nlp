have you recently received a new tech gift we're going to help clear up some misconceptions that you should be aware of let's start out with one of the most coveted items for gamers graphics cards we've covered them quite a bit on this channel but here's a concern some gamers have expressed that has nothing to do with how they actually perform could a gpu be so heavy that it damages your motherboard should you shy away from buying the high-end gpu you've scrimped and saved for for fear of it collapsing before your very eyes certainly we can see where these worries come from there are plenty of photos online of pci express slots that have been straight up ripped off of their motherboard due to a heavy graphics card just collapsing and the largest consumer graphics cards these days weigh around 5 lbs which certainly isn't light by any stretch all that cooling that high-end gpus require can make some cards pretty chunky but here's the good news motherboard manufacturers are fully aware of how heavy graphics cards can get and slots are designed with the card weight in mind lots of these horror stories you've seen have been on older boards or when significantly more forc than just the weight of the card was put onto the slot this can be the result of someone trying too hard to insert or remove a card or neglecting to remove the card before shipping or otherwise relocating the pc where extra force can be put onto the slot if the pc gets bumped or jostled around you should have secured me as long as you remember to screw the card into the case and don't put extra force on it you should be just fine even with the heaviest of cards although some larger cards do come with anti- sag brackets because sagging can pose a risk of damaging the card if the sag is severe these are more important if you're moving the system around a lot they aren't necessary to prevent your pcie slot from breaking off if you're keeping your computer in one place let's step away from graphics cards and talk about a hot ticket item for everyone right after we thank the sponsor of this video nexigo whether you're conquering the work from home work world or joining virtual meetings nexigo

more at the link below all right this tip is about none other than the venerable tv specifically we're going to talk about high dynamic range or hdr a feature that was once only found on high-end models but has now trickled down to even budget tvs but are you actually getting a good deal if you buy a discounted model that prominently advertises hdr support the answer might be no you see hdr is a hyped feature because it can make the image on your screen look more detailed especially in darker and brighter areas where traditional tvs often struggle assuming of course that you're actually watching watching content recorded or mastered in hdr but for hdr to make a real difference the screen has to be capable of getting bright enough to reproduce these details accurately this doesn't mean you need the highest end panel on the market but most cheap tvs just can't get adequately bright in fact some of these budget models that technically support hdr don't even get bright enough to produce a good non-hdr picture in a bright room so if you want a decent hdr experience our opinion is that you should find a tv that can put out at least 600 nits of brightness and definitely don't go for anything under 400 nits some models will list how bright they can get on the spec sheet while for others you may need to hunt down a review on a site like ratings buying a really cheap tv just because it has hdr support is like going to a $15 buffet because they have unlimited steak it might be technically true but are you really going to enjoy gnawing on a piece of meat that resembles shoe leather if it tastes good finally here's one for anybody who just got a new pair of headphones or earbuds a common piece of advice you see on some headphone enthusiast forums is to burn in the headphones for a certain amount of time we're talking 40 hours or more of playing music white noise or frequency sweeps through the headphones before they're ready to listen to the theory is that burning the headphones in will soften up the internals and allow them to respond more quickly to inputs thereby producing a better sound kind of like breaking in a baseball glove until it becomes more iable but think about this a softer headphone driver also won't stop moving as quickly which would result in worse sound quality if you follow this burn-in logic furthermore independent testing has already shown that various enthusiast grade headphones showed no perceptible difference in sound quality after lengthy periods of burnin any perceived difference is likely due to a placebo effect or a phenomenon some enthusiasts call brain burin which is much more dangerous this is the idea that after using an old pair of headphones for a long time you get used to their sound so when you switch to a new pair the new ones don't sound neutral leading you to think that they need to be burnt in when the reality is that you're just not used to a different sound signature so the takeaway here is just to go ahead and start enjoying your headphones as soon as you take them out of the package you got to take instant gratification in life the rare times you can get it and i am instantly gratified to
