[music] hey what is up guys mkbhp here and well welcome back to techtober the event that we are waiting for just wrapped up which means i'm not allowed to share that my daily driver for the past couple days has been the brand new oneplus 6t so this phone's had a lot of hype leading up to it we started seeing those specs and a little bit of design leaks and basically got a lot of people waiting for this phone so the oneplus 6t is in the purest sense of the word an incremental update most of it is the same as the oneplus 6 that we're already familiar with that i liked a lot and then you could consider this a bit of a design refresh a couple months later so they took the oneplus 6 which is already a pretty solid and well-liked phone and they made some upgrades and some tweaks to things that they felt could be better and they took it up a notch okay there's your notch pun for the video so there are conveniently six new things with the oneplus 6t so first of all the new display it's bigger it's a 6.4 inch display and still your 2340x1080 optic amoled they've been on for a while and it's still pretty great it's bright it's colorful and has a built-in adjustable color profiles obviously i'm a big phone person and phone screens keep getting bigger and i still love it also slightly smaller chin than the oneplus 6 not drastically smaller but you can see it when you put them side by side so the display is definitely an improvement and that brings us to number two as you can see the teardrop notch up here at the top everything oneplus wanted to do with the fairly standard notch on the oneplus 6 they are still doing in the smaller notch on this 6t except for the notification led so up here is the front-facing camera the earpiece and the proximity and ambient light sensors no fancy face id dot projector or depth sensors or anything like that but just a pretty solid basic couple things they can still do their super fast facial recognition with the rgb camera that has its pros and cons and the speaker is slotted way up here at the top but it wasn't doing a whole lot anyway so we're not missing out much by shoving a tiny speaker up there and for a lot of people including me this is an improvement larger screen closer to the bezels and more room up top for notifications and info but you can still hide the notch with software if you want to the only weird feeling i got about it is like how curvy it is just i mean that's quite the curve from left to right if you remember the essential phone that notch had probably about the same volume and total size but it was pretty rectangular on the sides this one is all slopey and then it just it just touches the top of whatever app you're using in the middle it's interesting but you get used to it just like any other notch okay number three is the fingerprint reader underneath the display something again a lot of people were looking forward to happy to see this slowly starting to become more common in mainstream phones so that one plus six couple months ago had the fingerprint reader on the back that's now gone and it's moved the logo up a little bit in its place and you can now unlock your phone by just touching the glass i've left it enabled the entire time i've been using it and i'd say it's it's faster than that first gen from the vivo phone i first tested a couple months ago but still slower than the gold standard of like touch id or a lot of the physical fingerprint readers it's just somewhere in between it's not instant but it's just a little beat of you unlocking your phone it's it's getting there you can't really just touch your finger to the screen and then remove it quickly and get to using the phone it'll still tell you you're going too fast but if you leave it there for a beat you're in pretty quick the animation is pretty corny i think and there's two others you can pick from in the software but the thing is they all happen at full brightness that's part of how the tech of this optical fingerprint reader underneath the screen works it involves shining a light on your fingerprint so even though it's an oled and they can keep all the pixels black and the clock is dim to save battery the fingerprint reader when it reads your finger goes to max brightness and at night that can be kind of annoying basically i was hoping there could be an even more subtle animation than the three that were provided also that means that unlocking the phone at night or when it's dark specifically is kind of annoying i know it's definitely nitpicking at this point but think about it i have both face unlock and fingerprint unlock enabled at night when it's dark the face unlock camera which just uses the rgb camera doesn't work very well so you have to use the fingerprint and then when you use the fingerprint it shines that full brightness light that kind of bleeds around your finger into your face which is kind of annoying just i know that's again super minor but this is the kind of stuff you notice when you use a phone every day so i'll mention it number four is the new battery so while the phone is pretty much the same size this is oneplus biggest improvement on paper going from a 3300 to a 3700 milliamp hour battery that has been awesome in practice for the endurance of this phone the six was already pretty good but i'm now getting pretty consistently five plus hours of screen on time one of the days i had nearly six hours with 10 left so it might not be a 4 000 milliamp hour sell like it isn't the biggest number on paper but this improvement thanks to the 1080p oled and pretty clean software has this basically my battery champ this year so far and it still has that incredibly fast fast charging so that is impressive then number five it's true the headphone jack is now gone on the 6t even oneplus is getting rid of the headphone jack a moment of silence for its loss so yeah it's 2018 pretty much only samsung and lg are left still riding that headphone jack train and it's kind of interesting coming from a company like oneplus who we know to usually be first to listen to what users want so when i asked them what their reasoning was for not having a headphone jack because i got to ask them directly they said it's the larger battery and the fingerprint reader under the screen both take up so much extra space in this same size phone that they felt it made sense to get rid of the headphone jack so that's their words and the number six new different thing is probably the best news this phone starts at 128 gigs of storage now instead of 64 and for the same exact price as the last one 549 so you get twice as much storage for the same starting price and this whole new design so oneplus is sure sticking to their guns of competitive pricing and then that's it everything else about the oneplus 6t in the software on the surface under the hood materials and build it's all the same as that one plus six same oxygen os on top of android pie with the new gestures and all the new features oneplus has been throwing in same smoothness and a plus performance that i was so happy about a couple months ago that drew me away from the pixel same snapdragon 845 and six or eight gigs of ram so i expect it to continue to be smooth same colors so it's launching with this midnight black or mirror black which means you may still want to toss on a skin from our sponsor dbrand this matrix black they have happens to look pretty damn good and now you won't see nearly as many fingerprints so kind of a win-win there and oneplus still took the shortcuts they took last year so no wireless charging for example even though it's a glass back phone and it's the same exact camera the hardware sensor and lens and everything as the oneplus 6. so you can see photos from last year's phone they are going to start to look better with each round of software updates they're learning a lot from pixel and iphone's hdr techniques and building them in here plus a new night mode is here that does more with longer exposures and dark scenes but of course all these changes are also coming to the exact same oneplus 6 camera since it's just a software change and they kept of course one of the most important things about the six which was a starting price easy recommendation this is a great phone now it's also coming with verizon compatibility and they're gonna start working with t-mobile you'll see it in t-mobile stores i'm assuming so this is going to be making its first big push into carriers in the us which is pretty cool yeah there's a lot going for this phone it's continued to impress me even though they got rid of the headphone jack which is a bummer for a lot of people but it's been impressive how much they stick with the fast and smooth mantra through their phones these have been consistently the fastest phones i use for the past couple years which is great and that's a function of how much they care about software so i have no problem recommending oneplus 6t this is just the oneplus 6 in a prettier higher tech package with a bigger battery for the same price can't really go wrong there so that's been it what do you think is this your next phone let me know thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace
