ladies and gentlemen it's currently february 2024 and the chess world is on fire now that might be a headline for basically any other month and any other day because it seems like we can't go a moment a single moment without drama in the chess world but i'm being very serious the topic of cheating in the chess world has grown tremendously over the last few months and years really all of this began in a high-profile case which was carlson and neeman but since then everybody at the top level of chess is talking about cheating whether it's online whether it could extend to over theboard how much of an existential risk it poses and over the last week in particular basically everyone is saying everybody is a cheater so in this video i'm going to give you multiple examples of what i'm talking about different players talking about cheating in the game today i'm going to show you a couple of games which happened this week with people who are basically being indirectly accused of cheating and then i'm going to look at the big picture so of course vladimir karnick hiar nakamura if you haven't heard about that that started in late november but since then vladimir karnick has been on a rooll he started posting on twitter after he was muted on ch.com he's been posting different player names basically every day like if he loses a game to a player or or if he just goes through games and he starts posting people's accuracies like essentially he is posting people who he claims should be investigated he posted daniel nitzki he posted blue bomb he posted jong he posted an international master from from russia i believe he posted lawang lim i mean the list goes on and on and on demetri and drake and on and on on like i vladimir's page in and of itself i could go on and on and on like i can't even begin to fathom how much damage this is potentially going to do to people's careers he's going after young folks who are like he went after a 12-year-old who he posted should be investigated this turkish kid who's a strong chess prodigy i mean it doesn't even begin to this is a whole this is crazy then fabiano kowana went on a podcast he went on to levid of levov is a great chess channel primarily does content in russian i'm going to just just listen to this okay someone in the top 10 has has cheated at some point i would i would bet a lot of a lot on this i'm taking that 5-second clip slightly out of context but it was a long interview but fabiano kowana essentially in that interview said he would bet a lot on the fact that a player has cheated in the top 10 not right now like he's not saying if you go look at the top 10 right now somebody's cheating right now he's what he's saying is cheating doesn't stop at any level it doesn't stop at 2500 2600 he's willing to bet that somebody that's been top 10 in the past has cheated at chess which is nuts okay that is i mean that's what he said and fabiana also said that every title tuesday 11 games he thinks he plays two cheaters and a lot of grand masters recently have been saying stuff like this but what happened this week is even crazier than that the next thing that i'm going to show you really really inspired me to make today's video and it was this it was yan pishi going to twitter and writing i couldn't do much and why did yan pishi do that and then he wrote more which we will get into yan pishi wrote that because he played jose martinez technically jose eduardo martinez alcantara also known as who plays a lot streams a lot and they played in the chessable masters which is a which is an online event and they played rapid they played 10-minute games against each other josam is a 3,000 rated blitz player on ch.com this was an italian game and yanomi played you know it was a very solid opening yan took the center everything was going fine this was their very first game i believe and then something interesting thing happened on the 20th move of this game it was balanced jan proceeded to put his rook in the center of the board okay and then sacrifice it that's what yan did so yan put his rook and he he gave it up he didn't blunder it that he's way too strong of a player but he he sacrificed it for a big attack right they're playing 10-minute chess so jos pum takes and offers a queen trade because otherwise he's going to lose the knight so he offers a queen trade jan says no and then yan begins building up a massive attack that's why he sacrificed the rook also if you look at the time discrepancy it's 5 minutes for white and 2 minutes for black right so like there's a big attack here there's a big attack coming and jan is attacking you know obviously his his weaker opponent like jan is a world championship contender top three player in the world and jan builds up this you know gargantuan attack and jpam is down to 22 seconds 454 to 22 all right that's what's happening so yan is outplaying his opponent he he's pounding the pavement he's you know he's he's he he's he's attacking and and jos b only has a limited amount of time to save himself jan goes bishop d2 which as we can see is the incorrect approach he can play knight f6 in this position and he can try to get his rook back computer doesn't like that for whatever reason you know it thinks that the knight is too strong it it thinks that you know he he should do something else but this is life and yan you know continues to attack and now jpam with you know 13 seconds on the clock finds this nice idea knight to d4 and the idea is basically that if you trade off a bunch of white's pieces white will not be able to attack you and jan goes completely allin and jos with 10 seconds on the clock you know puts his king on c8 and is just winning like he's just winning he just has more material than than yan and yan lost yan lost this game like yan you know swarmed and and and and went for the win but he got made it like he got made it himself and you know what happened in this game is yan was up what is what you know the biggest time advantage 4 and a2 minutes on the clock right like this is crazy but he never had a clearcut win and he lost this game and then they played again and this time you know yan losing with white is a big deal because he needs to play for a win with black and he plays a very provocative opening right he plays like in a very provocative way like when i when i say very provocative i really mean like no development of the night i mean like again if i play played yan in this he might beat me but long story short you know jose plays e5 which is kind of like the move that he's supposed to play right and and and and then dde take take and within the first 15 moves jan is basically completely like he's on an insane attack b takes they trade everything and remember jan has to win so jan is losing the match he has to play this position for a win and his king gets walked into the center of the board and and made it like he has to take some risk he ends up losing so jose martinez stronger master very good at blitz plays in a lot of like gets top five and title tuesday a lot lo he beats nepo and then nepo tweets i couldn't do much which a lot of people you know obviously we like wow he's messaging this right after and this is what the chess world is now the chess world is now you know we lose and this is what we do i'm not saying everybody's doing this but i'm saying everybody is talking about cheating we have karnick literally just publicly throwing 30 names at the wall 50 names nitzki hikaro all these all these players and then this now this was 1:23 p.m. an hour later okay an hour later he posted this and this was wild yan pishi posted a dm this is a direct message but that's why they use double elimination it's a dm that says the only disappointment with the josam loic matchup is that there can only be one winner yes that's unfair now jan also posted this on his instagram he was very passionate about the subject and if you actually click on this image that's you can't see on this overlay but yeah you can't see it zooms in a little too much so let me zoom back out that's maxim vra that's mvl now my first thought was did yan ask to leak a dm publicly players can listen two people in the world can have a one-on-one conversation about somebody they think might be a cheater like it could happen in any sport you can talk one-on-one privately about most things so long as they don't involve god forbid did something horrendous right like murder but this i was like did he even ask for permission or did he just like go to social media and post this so mvl essentially in his message is saying the only disappointment between jose jose martinez who just defeated nepo and dennis lvic who's the bell russian grandmaster is that there's only going to be one winner now dennis lazovic literally has a video on the chess.com youtube channel an interview with him his mother from toronto from the champions chester finals that says the chess phenom wrongly accused of cheating you know by by who else by vladimir karnick vladimir kramnick one of his earliest posts was saying that dennis lavic who is a very very positional solid player should be investigated basically because he has a very high accuracy score now dennis lavic draws a lot of games that's and he played over the board in toronto he didn't win the event but like he held own he definitely overperformed and the other thing about dennis lazovic is he played well at the world rapid and blitz like i think he's a 2650 strength player and he's over 3,000 online so you have the top players in the world having a lot of private conversations and suspicions about the performances of these players like dennis lavic like jose martinez and well now you have nepo just straight up posting it like again i i i really hope he asked maxim permission cuz if not if i'm maxim te i'm pissed off like i'm pissed off you know i don't know it's like being a top athlete in the sport and telling somebody you know like i think that that person might be on steroids and then here they go you know posting it anyway my point is and i will show you by the way i'm going to show you a couple of games that that that dennis played dennis beat hikaro in this event and it's you know hikaro didn't go posting anything it was a he i mean it was it was it was fair game like they just played and dennis won and that's that and you know one more thing before before i i show you this game and then before i i talk big picture jose martinez actually posted and he said per is that is that how you say which basically translates to very happy i'm very happy i can understand like 90% of this i did not lose my spanish from school very happy with today's performance resisting the attack and i survived two games a little bit worse but sad and bitter because of the constant accusations or suspicions of many and then and then you know some video was posted and again i i'm not one to spread conspiracy theories immediately people started because yan tweeted this people started tweeting uh people started posting like what is jose martinez looking at when he played and you know he was basically saying i was looking to the side because i could see my opponent reaction and it helped me you know find a winning idea because i could see that you know he was in a bad mood right that's what he said and today yan you know play just to triple down jan said a forgotten feeling when the opponent also commits mistakes so today yan played a match i think it was in the in some in the other bracket and that's what he said now dennis loz for the record beat hikaru so like i want to feature dennis lavic because he's really good i'm not featuring dennis lvic because of the accusations or whatever like dennis lavic has been getting accused of cheating for well over a year watch that video watch that video watch what karnick posted about him he plays as well online as he does over the board and we're gonna talk about all of this because again i really so i have some i have some thoughts about all of this this was a game this was hikaro versus dennis and in this game hikaro played a very provocative english and dennis just kind of swarmed in early and hikaro had to be very careful from the opening which he wasn't and dennis just got a fantastic position knight to b3 attacks mate and threatens the rook i mean it's just a tactic like hearo obviously you know saw some of this stuff coming i would imagine and decides to go for counterplay gets really aggressive you know leaves all the pieces back but dennis just defends i mean dennis is a rook up of course he can beat hikaro up a rook right hikaru blunders in the opening he tries to create some complications but like at the end of the day one guy is a grandmaster and he's upp a rook against the other guy you know maybe i would lose this position to hikaru but there's a reason dennis is in the event and i'm not as you can see he has an extra rook so he wins cu that's that's the way it goes and you know hiar obviously continues to to fight and create some counterplay but it's all for not i mean you know dennis converts what happened in this game is karo played a very offbeat opening and he played e4 which is which is a very provocative move like you know e3 is very solid he decided to to play into the sharp line dennis found bishop to g4 and then he found this idea to put the knight here and you know he just developed his pieces like i don't know you look at a game like this and it's kind of like you know you begin you begin wondering okay knight b3 right i mean i'm you know kikar obviously saw this this is what he calculated or i don't know maybe he blundered but something tells me it it would be a little bit shocking if he did and so they had to play again and remember now karo has to win just like the jpam situation when you have to win obviously you are going to take more risks okay and hikaro plays a very aggressive setup which is what he you know he plays this a lot in blitz this very very aggressive type of approach but this line is just like you know if you know what you're doing with white you push black backwards and then remember dennis doesn't have to win dennis can make a draw and knock out hikaru so what does dennis do trades all the pieces like dennis just plays in a very solid way it is hikaru who sacrifices the rook hikaru doesn't have to do that so dennis beats hikaru twice but it's because hikaru has to l has to play for a loss he has to play for a win but in doing that he has to create losing chances for himself and what happens in the game is they get into a tactical skirmish and right here dennis basically offers a draw he plays rook e8 rook d5 rook a5 rook d5 and rook a5 and he's just trying to make a draw so he's not even trying to win he's just trying to win the match and hikaru plays you know he he has to like he can't draw and he loses he's just losing because because of this so dennis beats saru twice right dennis went on to beat anish giri how did he beat anish giri he beat anish giri by making four draws and beating him in the armageddon okay i'm going to show you if if if if i can all right so dennis laic and this event is still going on by the way all right this event is not over this event is still going on ch.com is laggy a little bit so bear with me if i can't get it to load okay there's a server overload amazing yeah chess.com has been like i'm it's a miracle my positions here have survived but i'm recording this in the middle of chess.com having a full meltdown which you know anyway so the summary of all of this right the summary of all of this the summary of basically top grand masters all having suspicions against players karnick on a daily crusade fabiano's been talking about it a lot and he by way i'm not i'm not adding karana to like the group of like the paranoid and and so on but fabiano has been speaking about cheating a lot a lot recently and he's worth listening to i think he's the most objective of everybody but here's the reality okay i look at this and maybe this is wrong so i would love to hear your thoughts in the comments i look at this very simply the last few years chess overall historically especially like over the last decade let's say has been topheavy very topheavy top level tournaments most mostly invitationals so players getting invited to play in these top events right and they all play each other and that was how it works classical chess was the most prestigious rapid chess 15minute chess 3 minute chess you know nobody really cared about that that much but then we have the world championships now but mostly it was classical the last 5 years like 2020 to 2024 where we are now a lot of the world has changed social media is exploding like everything is like so many industries have changed and chess is one of those industries the gap is closing over the board chess is completely different than online that's my theory now there's probably a limit like there's probably a limit to how different it is but i think it's actually quite common for players to not have a rating an elo rate like reflected in their over theboard physical performances yet because they can't play as many tournaments and maybe they are good at rapid and blitz chess and it's mostly online now is cheating an issue 100% like i think cheating is 100% an issue but the chess world is like having a crisis right now because top players clearly think a bunch of grand masters are cheating like a bunch maybe in the top 10 maybe in the top 20 maybe in the top 50 maybe in the top 100 and nobody has any idea if they're accurate about their paranoia or not like if if we find out somehow that a bunch of people were cheating and all this paranoia was correct well then i mean that's going to be that's going to be insane to discover but the alternative to that right it's one of two things it's either the paranoia is justified and cheating is rampant or the gap is closing and the paranoia is completely unfounded that's where we are right now it's like does your online performance match up to your over theboard okay chess.com makes you have two cameras look i got my i got my i got a webcam that just sits on my desktop you put you put a camera you put a camera back there you you do screen share you're playing is there a blind spot is there another way to cheat i don't know i i i have no idea i'm not in the interest i i've got no interest in in attempting it maybe i should for content but like seriously i don't know and this is where we sit we got we got social media posts every every single day basically being like cheating is completely out of control the biggest online platform in the world to play and especially prize money events chess.com right they they they claim they they have a pretty good grasp of the whole situation but there's tons of doubt being thrown around every single day i got no idea what the resolution is i have no idea they they they talked recently about sending people to sit in the room with you to watch you play i love that let's do it oh oh yeah for sure and if a grandmas says no well sucks to suck right but that's wild that's wild that that's what we have to resort to cuz the statistics the cameras none of that is satisfactory for folks i mean we we live in a wild time we live in a wild time everybody thinks everybody else is cheating we see how this can have an impact on especially on guys like jose martinez on guys like dennis lazovic if hans nean is innocent on guys like hans nean obvious viously hans nean has that whole thing with the stuff when he was younger he said it himself but but you you might have people who are 100% clean you might have people that never did anything when they were 12 years old or 16 years old like the story of hans like dennis lvic is apparently 100% clean despite getting accused by as you can see everybody literally everybody what a crazy time and there's no punishments there's no repercussions there's no there's no nothing you just go to social media you can pose that you think some guy you you lost to is you know is is probably cheating and then then that's that that's just what the world we live in crazy absolutely crazy crazy scenes it's crazy scenes i i mean i don't know what to make of all of it are they justified are there is there more cheating going on than we think is there way more cheating going on than we think is everybody just paranoid in the gap of these online generational type of players just closing in on the top no clue no clue i'm excited to read your comments though i like videos like this cuz the comments are always like 50/50 a lot of you write like very intense stuff and very pro one side or pro the other side so chess world is is melting down everybody thinks everybody's a cheater february 3rd 2024 we'll see what happens in the future until then get out of here
