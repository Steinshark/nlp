okay so what you're seeing right now is video footage from quite possibly three of the best smartphone cameras you're gonna see this year we've got the huawei mate 30 probe iphone 11 pro as well as the galaxy note 2 n plus and let me know what you think - the audio quality of each of these three devices we're off to a pretty good start kicking things off with these standard wide-angle cameras all three phones can record 4k video at 60 frames per second and you can probably tell yourself in terms of the actual quality there isn't all that much in it iphone has the most natural colors whilst huawei and samsung they push up the vibrance just that little bit although this isn't necessarily a disadvantage what i would say though is that while weighs dynamic range is not quite as good as the other two in harsh situations you'll find the shadows it doesn't expose them quite as well we're also gonna be scoring these smartphones won't score for every single category and if you want the full explanation for the scoring system is in the description but long story short more points equals better always mate 30 pro has a pretty massive three times optical zoom more than the two times of the other two flagships and what this translates to is not just being able to get closer to subjects while keeping things sharp but also while this lens produces some pretty nice cinematic background blur now also with the huawei mate 30 pro the companies introduced a brand new ultralight camera they call it the cinema camera because of how its specialized for taking video but whilst this is gonna come in handy later in most day-to-day scenarios you're just more likely to notice the fact that it's less white than the other two as opposed to but actually recording anything in higher quality also the iphone is the master of consistency here between its three lenses the color profile remains pretty much unchanged whereas on ultra wide huawei and samsung really punch up the contrast on a bit of a side note i'm also launching a massive iphone 11 giveaway with philip from everything apple pro all the info for that is can be in the description below anyways both huawei and samson can also do portrait mode video although as an effect i personally don't think this is reliable enough to be something i'd actually use but in terms of which one does it better its huawei the galaxy note 1000 dirham the ability to zoom into an object and hit directional audio from whatever is in frame it's done well but not hugely important in the scheme of things stabilization is something i've been itching to test ever since i first saw them 8:30 pro but one thing to clarify when you're shooting standard one time zoom video we're not actually using the new cinema camera because that's an ultra-wide but even then the stabilization is absolutely fantastic on all three if we scale this resolution down to 1080p then stabilization only improves across the board each of these devices has its own super steady feature and they work also in this test i'm adding a new category ultra wide stabilization as i'm just starting to see more and more of this camera being used for video so actually none of these cameras have oh is but part of me was expecting hallways to come out on top considering that this new cinema camera was exactly for the scenario but to be honest they're all really good thankfully what was slow motion is outstanding in all aspects has been given a huge leg up from past generations so that means it can now record continuous slow motion at a higher quality than before higher than both other phones but also it has the ability to capture 7680 frame per second slow-mo i've got a lot of thoughts on this it's so slow it practically stops time in its tracks completely unprecedented on a phone but there are a few caveats first of all if you look closely you can see that the subjects that are moving they're not sharp in every frame which means that always using software to fill in extra frames plus it is so slow that you'll have to time your slow-mo impeccably to not miss what you were trying to capture iphone is the only camera that can also take slow-mo on the front camera or as they like to call it the slow fee the quality is good all things considered but i think you're much less likely to want to slo-mo yourself than whatever is happening in front of you now for the big one and in fact the category i've placed the most weight on daytime all reasonably well lit photos because that is the majority of what people use their cameras for long story short there isn't much in it each phone has its own style its own colors its own sharpness levels but they are all great even actually if we crop into this shot 20 times you can see detail is pretty much identical the main difference just being that samsung uses a stronger noise reduction algorithm which makes images a little softer but have less grain you can switch the huawei taking 40 megapixel shots but generally this isn't a lot better and restricts what you can do with the camera the iphone 11 pro has a very slight edge when coping with difficult dynamic range scenarios but yeah very close if you were wanting to capture objects that are further away then you probably guessed it huawei is going to be better it's just got more optical zoom there's not actually a lot to it this is another one of those examples though where you can see how well the iphone retains its color consistency as we go here from two times to ten times huawei and samsung they both completely shift the way the image actually looks the story with ultra whites is not as straightforward if we crop into the ultra wide shot then you can see that this new cine camera on the huawei is marginally better than the other two but it comes at the cost of range the field of view is so much smaller on the huawei and whilst this does mean a little bit less distortion it also means that i think the shots are just a lot less dramatic that said macro shots on the huawei are fantastic combining a close focusing distance with a wide aperture is a recipe for tasty looking natural background blur and speaking of background blur portrait mode iphones have always won this category and i don't think that's changed here apples effect is generally subtler but that often works better this picture is a good example of what i mean apples colors are warmer and more natural-looking and if we crop into my face you can see that whilst it has missed the mark a little with edge detection it's done the more important job of making sure my face is sharp it is great to see that all three allow you to take portrait mode photos on both wide-angle and telephoto lenses which does mean on the wall where you'll be getting a whole three times closer samsung still has a few issues with not working from a distance okay this is a big category night mode photos the 11 is the first time the iphone has ever had a night mode and it really makes a difference huawei has been a clear leader in night mode photography ever since the p20 pro but all of a sudden it's got competition that can trade blows with it in many aspects there isn't one consistent winner here but there are a few consistent trends huawei always does a better job with disguise i'm guessing it has something built into its scene recognition that seriously polishes night skies up i took this shot with all three on a tripod and whilst the note is seriously dark and the iphone grainy huawei's photo is crisper and punchier although i'd actually think the sky was purple when i took it mind you whilst it might look here next to these other two the galaxy note templars is not at all bad at nighttime this is just a seriously dark environment also massive shout-out to star trails mode on the may 30 probe if you have a tripod it's an absolutely amazing feature and better than trying to achieve the effect manually now we're going to start to see how the meets new ultra wide camera comes in it's a little bit hit-and-miss but whilst both apple and samsung see a big drop in clarity when switching to ultra wide and in fact apple's night mode stops working altogether always can still look spectacular this shot right here was literally all three ferns hand-held pointed straight up at the sky and it was so dark that the iphones ultra-wide literally picked up nothing samsung's a tiny bit but the difference is jaw-dropping in contrast whilst huawei can zoom in more optically the night time quality of these shots is not really any better than the iphone or the galaxy and in fact samsung has the best dynamic range when zoomed in i was getting a lot of requests about flash quality as well and it's great on all three chloe's is a little brighter but the end result isn't as out there as some rumors were suggesting even capturing objects in motion is about on par with the other two you probably starting to see a picture here the mate 30 pro is really good in low-light this trend continues into video using the standard wide-angle the iphone is grania and the note a little softer but the only caveat with huawei is that it's not as good as the iphone apt controlling really bright spots within the dark as you probably guess then when we switch to the ultra white as with photos was the apple and the samsung completely tanked huawei maintains itself able to still capture sharp details in the curtains in this scene if you take this into ultra low light they're all pretty crippled but still the mate noticeably less so weirdly though every single time i tested it zooming on the iphone in low-light video resulted in actually less degradation than hallway all right so just before we start tying this comparison to a close the galaxy note 10% it strength lies in brightening the face whilst keeping the image fairly sharp but as soon as we get to middling or high amounts of light i prefer the iphone 11 pros result shots are more realistic in terms of skin tone and the new wide-angle lens captures even more than notes already white camera i also just prefer the way the portrait mode looks on the iphone it feels a little bit more natural and generally speaking edge detection is better with video if you were thinking of vlogging for example while it is still left at 1080p on the front which is fine but at the same time it is a quarter of the 4k resolution that the other two friends can do the iphone has the widest angle and is also less prone to overexposure than the other two and the galaxy note tim plus has the most stable footage and just before we wrap this comparison up audio or a microphone attest this is actually one of the most important categories now testing smartphone audio starting with the huawei mate 30 pro i've got the iphone 11 pro let me know if you think that is better and finally the samsung galaxy note 10 let me know which one you think is best in the comments below and that leaves us with the final results we've got huawei with 813 iphone with 769 and the galaxy note m+ with 751 so here's the takeaway the three phones you're looking at right now these are three incredibly well-rounded top-tier flagship camera phones but the conclusion is this during the day the iphone 11 pro is the most consistent and usually the most impressive camera but because this lead is not that huge and because it loses quite significantly in zoom and other low-light conditions huawei it just about takes it on balance if you enjoyed this video a sub would be amazing and don't
