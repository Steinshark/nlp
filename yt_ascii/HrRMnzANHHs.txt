it's... pi day! pi day. gotta get down on pi day. so for the second year in a row i'm going to try and calculate the digits of pi without using any kind of calculation device. in what is now i guess technically an annual tradition. (don't judge!) this time i'm going to use an infinite series. (yay!) i'm going to add and subtract a lot of fractions to try and get more and more digits of pi there's the classic infinite series that leibnids(?) gave us-
