hey so i need a lot of $1 bills for a funeral and so i was just wondering could i exchange $1,000 for ones today we're gonna be buying a car using only $1 bills and then surprising my brother with the car should be a lot of fun you guys will get to meet my brother and you know let's do it so before we buy the car using only $1 bills i'm at the dealership where i bought the car with pennies i don't want to tip the accountant here $1,000 for you know counting them because it's kind of rude of me to make them count the pennies and i thought they could just put it in a coin machine but apparently they couldn't and so they had to count it which kind of wasn't fair to them so i'm gonna go in here and i'm gonna give their accountant a thousand dollar tip just to hopefully semi make up for it because i'm really sorry for making you count all those coins i thought you could have just used a coin machine but apparently they couldn't i thirst you know in here yeah okay do you mind if he fills so we actually we had a guy call up here from canada and asked if we would do something similar with james or him yeah like let him come yeah i want to know what youtuber was that trying to do it that find out those are all $1 doodles there's another there's another wheelbarrow with them recycle it's better than the hundred people had to take the change so what do you think of this this is just one of them ladies hey i said i've been doing this 20 years it's the first time i've ever seen i mean it gets a kick out of it's real i believe it's true all right boys i don't know what's gonna happen we get every strip club in north carolina $17,500 tell you something bro joey is gonna hate you [applause] the lifestealer should have had to count like a million pities this should be pretty easy it's just $100 a day i think you need to stop making accountants angry the accountants of america asia this is my use for managing eh is there a small 17,500 by the way i asked my brother a couple weeks ago by car he wanted and he told me he wanted the camaro so he probably forgot i asked by now but this is what he wants hey guys see this picture frame enjoy there appreciate that all right guys we're only using $1 bills but i'm gonna expose myself we had to put a tarp under it so it looked fuller because we didn't have that many $1 bills full disclosure there is a tarp under here but this is still 17,500 $1 bills expose see these steps they're coming out of my wallet no sponsors so if you want to allow me to do more nice things for people by the merch it looks pretty good hey are we in your way
