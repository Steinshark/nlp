[music] what's up i'm kbhd here and this is the newest red camera this little guy right here it's called the red komodo this is one of the things i was looking forward to most at the beginning of this year now you know 2020 has gone a little bit sideways and a lot of things didn't go how we thought they were but i will say cameras especially in the last like month have been insane we got the 8k canon r5 and the r6 came out the 12k blackmagic camera was revealed and the sony a7s iii just took the world by a storm and by the way almost that entire tesla model y auto focus video was shot on a 7s3 so if you want to see that footage that's there so now this this fascinating little red camera it's the most probably the most niche i'm sure 99 of people watching this probably have no intention of getting a red komodo but for me for a lot of video creator friends like me this is maybe the most exciting of those cameras because its potential is through the roof so okay let me just start with this what is red komodo it's red's mini cine mini cine camera it's their mini cine camera the whole thing is essentially a two pound four inch by four inch cube it has a 6k super 35 sensor a canon rf mount it has a small built-in touch screen up at the top it has auto focus and it shoots to cfast cards and it'll cost right around six thousand dollars but the most important fact is it's not out yet this camera is not done yet it's basically in beta so matter of fact every komodo you've seen out in the wild has been some custom color whether it's blue yellow or even the one they're starting to make more of now the white stormtrooper one which i think looks sick or this pretty sweet looking matte black everything mkbhd edition red komodo thanks red now i still paid for it i still paid full price for it but you know thanks red for the the little logo custom engraving and the map like everything touch that's nice it's pretty on brand good look so i think we'll start here with everything that makes the komodo just like other red cameras and then we'll get into everything that's different from other red cameras and potentially better so the areas where this camera is most similar to other red cameras are some of the most important which are the image the types of files you're going to be working with and just the overall look that you can get out of this camera it is a smaller sensor and from that i've noticed the image is a little bit more noisy but in general komodo footage will look and feel and grade and work like monstro and helium footage in fact and i was gonna wait till the end of the video to say this but just so you know this entire video is being shot on komodo i have i have two so the komodo is shooting this the komodo i'm working with and you can see if you can tell the difference i don't know if you will i think by the time it goes through youtube and hits your screen it'll be a little harder to tell the difference but it should still look pretty good so this whole video is komodo test footage but yeah on the upside you're still getting 6k r3d raw files or 4k prores if you want it you're getting the in my opinion awesome red color science you're getting that hefty 15 stops of dynamic range which is a few more stops than even the r5 and the a7s of the world and it puts it much more in the world of other cinema cameras you're getting global shutter there is no in-body image stabilization but not having rolling shutter again puts it up with cinema cameras instead of mirrorless cameras and you also get some of the other weird little quirks downsides of red cameras too one of the big ones is you don't get slow motion at full frame anytime you want to change resolution it crops into the sensor and you max out 6k full frame at like 40 fps so if you want to shoot 60 or 120 you're gonna be cropped in that's something all red cameras do but from that point on it's very different from other red cameras and it's much more of a hybrid feels like between the red cameras that i'm familiar with and the mirrorless cameras in that whole world that you guys probably all know about and that's kind of on fire right now first of all it has the canon rf mount so the same mount as the eos r and the eos r5 that whole family which is really interesting and i'll get more back to that in a second it also has dual battery slots on the back for off-the-shelf canon bp series batteries i've been shooting with these bp 975s which you could easily go with the smaller 955s when i get my hands on them but just these two batteries by themselves you can shoot for well over three hours and since there are two they're hot swappable so it runs down one battery at a time and as soon as one of them gets kind of low i can replace it and it starts off on the other that part is sweet and then it shoots to cfast 2.0 cards like i mentioned in the beginning so no proprietary ssds no mini mags just cfast cards that you can buy off the shelf in b h somewhere i still wish there were dual card slots like there are dual batteries but there's only one here and that's kind of a bummer i really like when we see dual card slots in the mirrorless world so how does that translate to actually using the camera well a lot of the biggest fundamental things translate perfectly just having a smaller lighter camera that you can throw in the corner of a car or in just smaller spaces or even on a gimbal i could never fly a monstro camera on a ronin-s for example this you could it's only two pounds so that's been awesome but the actual experience and performance of using this camera for me so far has been a really mixed bag and that's because this camera is in beta like the software is in beta and just the whole camera is in beta so rf lens support is actually still a work in progress for this lens so right now if you put an rf lens on the camera it doesn't communicate any info electronically yet and actually included in the box when i unbox the komodo live you might have seen on instagram you will find an rf to ef adapter so you can adapt a whole canon ef mount collection to actually communicate with this camera through the adapter the menus are pretty basic and i think they'll mainly stay this way but they have room to improve as far as responsiveness goes again to feel closer to that mirrorless world and right now there's not a lot of officially supported accessories yet like these one terabyte cf cards i have that i'm shooting to every time i boot the camera it gives me a warning about how they're not official media and how i should be very very careful and then autofocus autofocus is maybe maybe the biggest indicator overall the state of this camera so red cameras in the past and many cinema cameras generally don't have autofocus or any sort of autofocus system you would rely on but with komodo plan on it but it's in beta and from my experience that just really means it's a very rudimentary very simple seemingly contrast based autofocus system there's no eye tracking there's no subject tracking or anything fancy like that it's mainly just tap on the screen and hope it focuses and so so far it's worked decently well depending on the lens you're using so you can touch something on the screen to focus and it should shift and sort of rack focus relatively quickly but depending on what lens that can involve a good amount of hunting or missing focus or non-response which would of course be unacceptable in the mirrorless world from like an r5 and also like i mentioned doesn't work at all with rf lenses there's no electronic communication so it's all happening through an adapter so i guess bottom line is it's it's not as reliable on main shoots as i would want it to be if i wanted an autofocus camera which is kind of a great pun because we're considering shooting maybe our next auto focus car episode video with komodo but again for those videos we rely on autofocus so it's kind of a toss up maybe weigh in in the comments if you think we should try it but think about this think about a future where you can use any canon rf lens any canon lens even with an adapter and the native autofocus just works and it's amazing the thing about those incredibly advanced eye tracking and all those autofocus systems with sony and canon and everyone else is they didn't happen overnight those take a long time to develop and work on and get better at and reds never really had to do that so we'll see how long it takes them and whether or not they can make a good autofocus system but imagine that future and that's really kind of a big point for this camera as a whole imagine a future where there's a whole ecosystem of competitive third-party accessories instead of just the hyper-expensive first-party red stuff that's been a barrier to entry for so many people for so long where i've never really been able to recommend a red camera for anyone despite how much i love them because you don't just get a red camera you also have to get the red ssds you have to get the red monitors you have to get the red modules and all that cost adds up over time but with a camera like this if it's out for longer and starts to get traction well then you start to see the wooden cameras and the small hds and the cages and all these things start to be more popular even the batteries and the media so for people who do like the look of a red camera and the image quality but haven't really been able to get into the world maybe maybe over raven maybe komodo maybe this is that new entry point i feel like i'm personally a proponent of better image quality in general people love saying i focus on the cameras too much in like smartphone reviews but i can't help it i want people to be able to record and make the highest quality stuff and the better cheap cameras get and the cheaper good cameras get the happier we can all be and all that is not even to mention the already pretty impressive remote app control with very little latency thanks to the wi-fi antenna right on the side of this camera so let me end this by just answering maybe the most frequently asked question i've heard from some of my creator friends which is should i buy should i get a red komodo right now honestly probably no and that's not just from the stuff like that i don't like about this camera it's been a few weeks and these are my impressions but there are some things i don't like like i don't like that there is no hdmi only sdi for video out i don't like that the shape of the camera is a box but it isn't as modular as some of the other boxes like they could have made it more ergonomic like the shape of a mirrorless camera for example since there are no modules i don't like that the display is fixed up at the top it's almost unusable for a lot of angles that i like to shoot and something that feels a little more detached or even swivelly would have been awesome but it's not any of that i wouldn't recommend komodo because people buying a camera right now who really need a reliable camera with an autofocus system or just all of its features right now that's not what you're getting so i guess my number one rule about buying tech and i've said this before is don't buy a piece of tech based on the promise of future software updates you should buy it based on the fact that you like what it is right now i'll talk about that in smartphone videos and i think that the ceiling for this camera the potential of once there's an ecosystem of third-party accessories around it once it has all of its features once the menus get nice and fast once autofocus works and you can use this small little camera and get red video quality the ceiling for this camera is so high that once it gets anywhere near that ceiling then i would recommend getting a red komodo but there's got to be you know people like me willing to go out and test it early before that point so really that's pretty much it i just wanted to i know this isn't a video most people are going to care a lot about or watch but i'm excited about these cameras and i felt like sharing and a lot of you were asking so here you go it's red komodo thanks for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace
