so hello everybody i am with dr paula boddington dr paula is a moral philosopher you have seen her on my channel before we talked about ai and we had such a great conversation we thought it would definitely be worth to continue thinking about ai but she's also a an expert on the ethical quandaries relating to medicine and in terms of biological issues let's say and so right now with with all these things going on i posted about this monkey man and then there's also the whole thing about ai which is swirling and cobit of course so we thought that we would talk about this in relation to storytelling and the kind of stories we tell about about the things we do in the world as humans this is jonathan pajot welcome to the symbolic world so dr paula thank you for coming again i'm really happy i know a lot of people really enjoyed our first conversation and so you you had something you wanted to start with so let's go with that and then we'll we'll see where it leads us yeah hi it's really good to talk to you again so yes so yesterday yesterday i also i should maybe start off by saying happy st george's day it's important to play today okay great yes wonderful yeah so yes yesterday on twitter i saw that somebody had put up that meme from a conference of the vatican using the kind of creation of adam meme which i wish it was a meme it was an advertisement like if it had only been a meme it would have been better an advert for two hands touching like and even one had even one side had even got the kind of like you know how adam's really limp wristed yep like and then and then surgical gloves touching and and and you reacted quite strongly to that well i just it just shows you just how clueless people are about what things refer to you know the fact that they would put out an image like that is so problematic on so many levels and it's such a misunderstanding of of of of what things like i said what things refer to and so i just couldn't believe that they used this as an advertisement for a conference about about medicine and covid and all of this it's it's quite mad yeah yeah so i i'd be really interested to talk to you about about when you said it's it's so wrong on so many levels what those levels are but also because it's such a common meme in ai it's used so often to illustrate that you know illustrate ai in various ways and if you put ai creation meme into a search engine you'll get you'll get dozens and dozens and dozens of images images on different themes so sometimes it's like a robot hand sometimes it's like a kind of digital hand sometimes there's sometimes those colors and quite often actually there's a little spark like an electric spark between the fingers that's as if instead of being god breathed life into adam there's it's a spark of electricity yeah there's so many images like that and i just think it's really interesting how well if there's so much possibilities there's so much possibility in terms of how the hands are transposed the way it makes it really easy to swap one to the other yeah i mean it's really in terms of maybe i just wanna because i said that on twitter maybe i could i should help people understand why it's such a problem first of all then we can see why the ai meme would appear as well there are many reasons why it's a problem and there was there were so many first of all that image is problematic in the first sense because theologically already there's a difficulty in that image because it because of the whole bearded god figure and then adam and you know the touching of the fingers which is just a very strange way of under creation in in scripture is manifested through breath and so you know the image it's it's remaining in breath and so it's word speaking the word creation into the world and then also breathing but it's also light as well so the i mean actually gets it better probably with that little spark that you said in the middle because there's also the sense that creation happens through light because light reveals form to us reveals the unity of things to us but in that in that meme they in that advertising they put gloves on the two which even if you understand that this like the touching is what created adam it's a i always i was thinking like what if god used contraceptives is basically what they're trying to yes it was it's like okay what a strange idea and then then all these these these me these funny things started going through my mind it's like oh so they they basically want to reintroduce veils in the in the tradition like what are they do are they putting a separation like an absolute separation between god and man so just this misunderstanding and there's also the strange thing which is that you know they wanted to be multi-ethnic but they didn't really realize that they had like a white man with with the hand of god and then would look like a black woman with like the the hand of adam being limp and then the other one you know they don't it's like they so don't understand they're the only the things they're referencing to that they're it's exploding all these directions that they obviously didn't intend but it's also because they don't understand the they don't understand the problem of the moment which is why they're even daring to go in this direction they don't understand what how it is that the the the covid and the separation of people and this idea of separating yourselves from others what it means and especially what it means in church all of these things are are things we're struggling with and so you can try to just like you can try to gloss over it and pretend it's not there but then it ends up coming back even in your own advertisements you know even if even as you're trying to advertise the coping measures you end up suggesting this separation and this impossibility of life which exists in the coveted world you know it's like if you if you if god and adam have gloves on then there's no creation happening and so that was the problem with that with the let's say that meme but in terms of the ai meme it's fascinating because it has to do with some of the things that i've been talking about in terms of the system of the beast where in the totalizing system in the desire to be at the top and not have anything above us right in the desire to kind of have this revolt against against the divine or revolt against the spiritual world there is it's there's a there's a story which makes it inevitable that at some point we're going to want to create life because we have to claim for ourselves all the things that were above us we have to take the crown for ourselves put it on our head and so there's like an inevitable story which will happen and it is this you know the metropolis the this this whole idea of the creation of an artificial being it's just something that was there and was there in the fiction from the very beginning of the modern age and it's it just kind of carried through until today so yeah well isn't it isn't it also there in in genesis when eve gives birth to cain and says i have created a man i think no she says god has given me god has given me a man i think is what she is what she says it's more it's more it's more like it's more the story of the these artificial beings in the sense of making these idols that in the scripture that's what will become this image of creating an artificial being which then becomes the center of a community so it's like a statue of of a god or of a person and we breathe we breathe in its nostrils and then it becomes it becomes like the vehicle for the god let's say the shell in which the god inhabits yes yes yeah actually actually i was just listening to a podcast that suggested that actually that wasn't what hebrew means but that's a that's a that's another discussion what do you mean sorry but that's it that said that actually the hebrew should really be translated so that he was making that claim oh really interesting yeah interesting i mean that that that that then i mean it would be interesting to think about the differences for sure because like a good example would be lilith so the let's say the the mythology the mythology around lilith has to do with this so lilith actually spawns children from herself without the seed of adam and so she ends up spawning these different monsters and so there is this desire to let's say contain not being not have this normal complementary union between heaven and earth but try to kind of contain wherever you are as a totality and then try to spawn children out of that totality and so the the legend of lilith certainly has that imagery and that's why what she ends up creating are monsters and so the image of like of lilith producing monsters is the same story as frankenstein it's the it's the the problem of the the pride of frankenstein who wants to to take the crown of god on himself and then ends up making a monster and so you see that there's there are a lot of tropes there are a lot of those tropes like that the matrix all of these stories end up falling into this kind of pattern almost inevitably yes yeah yes so so would that be something like the difference between whether or not so there's a debate in ai round about whether or not we're creating something which is a tool that will that we'll be using with us or whether we're going to be creating something that's going to be completely autonomous to us and maybe been equal to us or or actually this is one this is one of the things where in the ai meme it's quite often swapped from one side to the other so that it's easy to replace one one to the other so in the ai in the ai world there's of course lots of debate and speculation about whether or not ai is going to be superior to us in lots of ways yeah there's that will definitely happen and then that this is what we talked about before this idea of creating the body for a god and it seems like that's that seems to be mostly what's what's happening and it's also one of the the things is that it's it it all makes sense in terms of understanding the scientific approach to reality because in let's say in the kind of materialistic approach to reality we value quantification right we value quantity we value quantity of information we think that quantity of information and let's say quantifiable phenomena is actually superior or is the origin of spiritual truth or of of of patterns and so because of that then it ends up coming it's almost like if because we noticed that ai will have more power in terms of capacity to calculate capacity to gather information then because our value system is already upside down then we will necessarily see that ai as as a king because we already think that that's where reality is and so if we have a being that can calculate faster than us and that can gather more information than us then we we will ultimately think that that's what superiority is yeah yeah because i think one of the things that one of the things we have to be really careful with technology over and over and over again and especially actually when you examine it a lot but you we end up being kind of entranced by the technology by what it can do but then we start thinking about what its goals are and also what its strengths are and then when we look back at humans we measure humans by the same goals and strengths so what you said in terms of like quantity and quantification exactly and i mean the modern world has basically it really is this upside down thing where we wanted if you look at the development of industrial civilization there really was the desire to transform humans into machines you know we wanted the factory workers the ultimate example of that where we just want human machines right we we want humans that can just do things repetitively and and and like machines do and then when we can get rid of the humans we will right as soon as we can get rid of the humans we will get rid of them because that's what we we value we value this capacity to be efficient this capacity to to to to produce things you know and it's a misunderstanding of what first of all the human is and it's a misunderstanding of the normal hierarchy of values but this is another thing we talked about last time which is important to understand is that there are a few people there are some people that unders that know that or at least it seems like they know that and so there's a there's a trick being played there's like cars behind their back where the the ai will be infused with values will be infused with an ideology and and and but it'll be presented just as this powerful computer but it will have and you can see it right now right we see it with google how they're framing reality how they're you know giving precedent to certain search terms and they're controlling the search you can see that it's actually a value-laden phenomena but that they tried to hide it almost as if they they know that we think the quantification is the real is the most important thing so let's hide the value so that people can't see what we're doing it's like it is like a card trick yes yes it is and and those notions of efficiency and speed i mean so the way in which i mean i have another whole another whole topic but the discussion goes along for a pace so maybe just not go down just there's more we can say about the memes but the way in which intelligence is thought of in relation to ai is such a narrow way of thinking about it but also part and parcel of intelligence is speed so like when you lie q test part and parcel of it is how quickly you do it and and and how efficiently you are and whether or not you're exactly the same exactly the same answer that's the way which comes into factory working so but if you go going back to the use of the vatican using these kinds of these kinds of memes in relation to a health conference and of course innocence of like if you're in a hospital you want things to be efficient to a certain degree but so many problems get caused by the goals of efficiency efficiency and health and trying to trying to do things really really you know really really quickly and speedily it's not this is a way in which to sort of to heal people i mean you're going back to the vatican being about wearing wearing those gloves you would ordinarily the first thing you would think of but first thing you'd think of in terms of health in terms of two hands touching but to me the healing power of touch and if you're wearing rubber gloves you can't you're not touching the person are you but like you know like you know premature babies will thrive if they need skin skin contact but you know it happens throughout the whole life you need the healing power of touch so yeah well it's contraceptive culture we we we think we don't realize because we we let's say we've reduced we we've reduced reality it's a very very specific thing and we don't realize that what the even the even the notion of contraceptive as a as a let's say a factor in in society right as a part of the story what it does in terms of understanding what productive human relationships are you know that it it's not you know it never it won't end up being just about sex it'll end up flowing out into because sexuality is such a it's such a deep part of our narrative like it's such a deep part of understanding who we are and how bonds are created in society that when you fiddle with that you're gonna end up yeah you're gonna end up with an image of god and man wearing rubber gloves and not and not seeing what's going on like not understanding why it's actually it's actually preventing contact it's actually preventing real productive relationships so yeah yeah it's like i mean it's interesting in relation to responses for pandemic this notion of hygiene and the idea that you've got to have completely separate ourselves off and have all these boundaries around ourselves so i think that maybe this is a really complex topic but i think it might be related to where there's been such a push towards vaccines rather than rather than thinking about rather than thinking about treatments the vaccine seems to be pushed far far more as if the idea is that the vaccine is shielding us and the germs will never end never enter us as if we got to keep up absolute purity yeah but also because they figured out a way because they used to they made before that you would have a vaccine and then that was it and that's no good like that's not good for the business so now they found a way to have vaccines that you have to take again so it's like okay well now vaccines are great because you have to update your vaccine every like six months or whatever so it's perfect right so it's a good solution now yeah yeah and now you don't have to now everybody has to take it so everybody has to take the vaccine and everybody has to update it every several months and so it ends up being this interesting it also ends up being the strange communal thing the the the whole aesthetics around the vaccine are so fascinating you know because they end up almost being like because all because it's painful i think that's part of why there's something religious about the vaccine which is coming up and the way people talk about it as almost this this initiation ritual i guess i don't know how else to to say it where they they show pictures of themselves with like a band-aid and and there's this whole kind of celebration of of getting the jab and the pain it's almost like a little sacrifice that you have to make for all of society where you get the jab and then you you're actually doing it not just for yourself but for everybody else and so there's definitely like a religious undertone to this whole the whole aesthetic of the vaccine which is not so surprising but slightly disturbing i would say yeah it is so so many people are posting on social media that they've had it and so on but there's also i mean i've also noticed something else in relation to how people talk about the vaccine here i don't know if it's the same in canada it's talked in terms of when they've had the vaccine how efficient it was and how clean it was they went into the center and they were out again five minutes later so so so in terms of it like this this drive for efficiency is like a literally like a production machine of people just walking in and getting getting jabbed and walking out again so it kind of also suggests that they didn't read the patient information leaflet or maybe you weren't even given one i'm sure they didn't i'm sure no one has you know because this has been the big thing from the beginning i've been also trying to help people understand that that ultimately it's about trust all of this is about trust it's not about a vaccine it's not about what's it's about whether or not we trust the the authorities whether that we trust what's going on whether or not we trust the reason why things are happening and this has and so it's not about science it's very little about science let's say people who are doubtful suspicious and then the way that the way that those who are kind of on board then treat those that are doppler and suspicious it's mostly about about trust and about a vision of what it means to to be together and so this vaccine has become the means by which we show that we're part of society whether or not it ends up leading to an explicit kind of tracing mechanism but even in the narrative that you see it's it's about showing that you're part of society by getting this this thing yeah i mean i'm just i've just started i've just had the thought i wonder because we've been so isolated for the last year more than a year now isn't it maybe we're so so craving some kind of connection and some kind of way of showing that we're connected to people but but maybe that's one of the factors behind oh for sure that's for certain for certain and oh it's also that it's a longer story than that it's the the story of running out of reasons why we are together and that's part of why the world is kind of breaking down you know look we need reasons to to know that we're that we're a society so but those you used to have celebrations we used to have you know religious unity or religious ways of understanding that we're together under god or different ways of stating that but now we're running out of those and so and in a world where they're trying to create post-national identities then we also have a problem which is that how do we so they tried things like you know the environment we're gonna fight you know we're all gonna join together and like fight against environmental problems but it's not working like because it's so abstract and it's so it does involve sacrifice it makes you sacrifice things and you know you have your bins so you can you can kind of have this liturgical practice of like separating the trash but it's not enough i don't think it's an i don't think the vaccine is enough either but it's like they're looking for ways to to unite people like racism and now this is a the medical one what's great about is that it's trying to portray itself as non-ideological so you can't you're not supposed to be able to argue against it because it's really is this kind of objective thing where we all unite and show that we're together by participating in this story so yeah you've talked you've talked again this is going this is going in a different direction as well because you've talked before about problems with culture and lack of participation like losing losing things so i mean lots of things have been happened happening i've lost in my lifetime so there used to be when i was at school we used to do country dance festivals and they'd be that's that's all gone and to be made carnivals i don't know if that's gone they used to be carnivals all the time they've they've kind of vanished but i also think one of the reasons so you've talked about this this is going off at a tangent does it matter but you i've heard you talk before about say like going along to a music concert and just sitting there as an as an audience and that kind of being a problem because it's not really i see this kind of related to the question you just had you're totally right because one of the things that they've tried to do especially in the united states i don't know in europe but in the united states for sure in the like 70s 80s all of this they tried to unite people under entertainment and so there was this idea in the water cooler conversation i don't know if you remember when people were talking about that where this idea that you watch a show in the evening and then the next day you go to work then everybody gets together during break and talks about what happened on the show like seinfeld was one of those those things where people had this sense that it was somehow uniting society together because it was creating this common this common story that we could all attend to and then talk about the next day but it's not enough right it's not enough because it's not participative so we need participative stories yeah and that's why what's coming up now is more the whole question of of racism is like because that's a story you can you can be a character in and you can play a role in and then also then again now and now this whole medical question and the getting the jab and you and making doing these measures washing your you know putting on the purell when you go into the store all of these kind of liturgical means measures are there to to be have a more participative narrative and i don't and i'm not saying that everybody's it's like you don't necessarily even have to think of it in terms of conspiratorial behavior where there's someone controlling this and forcing it to happen this way it's just people need this and so when it appears in front of them like when it when it manifests itself they're naturally going to gravitate towards it because because we need this type of participation yes yes yes yeah and i suppose a racism one has got a bit of a problem in terms of participation because people are assigned roles against their often against their will so yeah so but so but a lot of people are getting you know getting really annoyed about being told because because of something extraneous about you you therefore think this or yeah it's a dangerous it's a dangerous game to play you know it's a definitely a dangerous game to play because it it's actually separating us into clans again and so that's that's a scary thing you know what it seems like it's possible that it's it's separating us into clans in order for something else to come in the whole divide and conquer strategy where something else will come and then unite and the medical the medical one is like i said it's perfect because it it's supposed to be not non-ideological yes yeah yes and i i'm sorry so one of the many problems with the racism one is that the people who are most liable to be attacked of the very people who are so free so for example i won't give any details but i mean a friend of a friend was telling you something that happened to a friend of hers recently and the sort of people who are getting into trouble are precisely the kind of people who are say maybe working with diverse groups trying to promote equity trying to do social work amongst certain people and so on and then maybe just accused of not using the right words so for people who are getting into trouble are the people who actually have spent all their lives trying to improve the quality those kinds of things so i just think but that's that's those suppose but they know for a fact that they're not fair but they're trying to do something to help and everyone's of course who have been getting into trouble because they have to you know so recently about happening about two or three weeks ago in britain we were told that the acronym that had been used was being bit black and asian minority ethnic i think if we told them not allowed to use it anymore as to what we are supposed to say so those kinds of things are happening with such rapidity but it's really quickly breaking down and just making lots of people get yeah it's funny because it's it's one of those things where if we only had a normal like acknowledgment of reality which is that like a good example is let's say we can use we use one where it's like if you have a physical handicap right if you have a physical handicap then you are necessarily going to be a marginal part of society and that has negative aspects and positive aspects and so it's if you try to if you realize that a word is a is you're using and that it's referring to the negative aspects and then you change the word to something else you're going to have a problem because if the negative aspects are going to come back because the negative aspects are there and it's the same with being a minority in general when you're a minority in a group it doesn't matter what it's not has nothing to do with race or whatever if you're a minority in a group then you are necessarily going to struggle to find your place in that group whether it's any type of of of group and so and so instead of just realizing that this is a normal thing and we need to try to palliate for it and try to make it as as good as we can and try to help people integrate as much as possible if we keep just playing this weird semantic game then it's whatever word you use to talk about a minority is going to have negative undertones because it's hard to be a minority and so you can't avoid it it's going to keep coming back yes yes yeah yes it's just it's just this ignoring of how of how of how reality works i think you know and a desire to kind of impose this weird yes this weird system which actually doesn't doesn't pan out in the world yeah but but though so i'm so one of the things i think is really really neat to stress and thinking about what technology is doing is it's never just for technology it's never just a technology it's always the culture behind it and they're often working in synergy or or the technology event is helping to shape the culture and there's like a really complex interaction between the two and that happens in relation to how we think about health for example about about the ways in which technology might open up possibilities with with health and that changes how we think of it so actually so for example i mean in relation in relation to the pandemic the expectation for expectation for how long we should live has changed so rapidly so i looked up some charts just just last week life expectancy of a developed world or life expectancy in general has shifted but like expect to see in the uk which i presume is similar to canada has increased by nearly three years in the last decade it's just astonishing and and so our expectations of of what we expect out of health it's no it's it's it's changed everything and like you said and and so even even this is this is this might be very controversial but i get a sense that for example when you look at kobe deaths in different countries and everything i always wonder if it's if it's more a comment on the state let's say of the society itself pre-pandemic rather than about the disease and so you know if there was if there was a country where the the population was extremely old and that the systems to to to say to to deal or to to live with these elderly people was not healthy then i think that's what happened here in quebec we have the highest one of the highest rates of death in canada and almost in the world in terms of percentage and people are like oh we're hit hard we're hit hard but i'm like i'm not sure it's hit hard i think there's something else going on there's it's more a story about how of how the elderly exists and how like you said the expectations we've had which is that the idea of dying at 70 you know when i was young was like hey that's that's not bad but now dying at 70 is almost like a scandal like you can't die at 70. yes yeah yes yeah yeah it's yeah it's really really interesting yeah and so it's actually changed the the story maybe you can talk a little bit about that because i know you you were thinking about the idea of how one of the things it does like technology offers up these these possibilities and then that possibility will affect the way the story lays itself out yes yeah it really does so so i don't listen to your monk your monkey man video last week the monkey monkey man yeah like i was just so interested in that i i looked i read it i looked at the actual paper i didn't read all of it because it's like pages and pages of really technical stuff but it's it's got something in it that you you see over and over and over again so in the summary it talks about intersperi into species chimera formation i've got it here with human pluripotent stem cells this represents a necessary alternative it's so it's presented as being necessary so it's research is being presented as necessary necessary to what so it's an instrumental rationality it's necessary to certain aims that you have so you know what do they say do they tell us what the aims are do they mention them you know so so so there are various regenerative medicine applications so for example including like the generation of organs and tissues for transplantation and also just understanding early human development and early embryo development in humans and also evolution evolution of humans and of primates so so one sort of fairly abstract knowledge i mean the abstract knowledge to be perfectly fair a lot of knowledge which is called like blue skies research ends up being really useful but also just fascinating i mean like stories about human evolution finding out about human evolution is just really it's just really interesting but it's always presented as being necessary if there's a way of finding something out the only way you can do it is is is in this kind of way but i mean so but if you'd murdered somebody for example it would be necessary to find a way to dispose of a body to make certain you probably shouldn't have murdered them so it depends what it depends what the goal our goals is but that word necessary is just it's just so often slipped in something that we just have had to do and and it also describes it as fundamental research so talking about it as fundamental research again emphasizes the notion that it's just really really important to do but that i was fascinated in terms of how so there's ways in which this idea of necessity is opened up in terms of possibilities but created so that it's it's it's trying to think up or trying to produce like maybe organs and transplant so we already actually pick pig valves are often used in transplant for heart valve operations humans often have pig valves planted into them so there's a possibility that you might be maybe able to grow organs in other species or or somehow use cross-species organs so in research they've tried to do so basically in research they took human stem cells so a stent just to remind everybody a stem cell it will come from a stem cell line grown in a lab a stem cell is a stem that's got the capacity to become any different type of cell so it could be placed in the body and they've managed to get got these monkey monkey embryos so in terms of getting a monkey embryos that means that they've had to get the egg and the sperm from the monkeys which means that the female monkey has had to super ovulate and have the eggs harvested which is i mean it's quite a burden on the monkey actually because the women who've gone through that for ivf it's quite a burdensome procedure actually so then they've fertilize the monkey embryos and then in and then inject got them in a in a stem cell yeah they got a human stem cell and put it into the monkey embryo to see how many days it can survive and then they haven't transplanted it into an animal but if they were to do so it would remain an open question as to what would happen for human stem cells what would it do would it develop into a particular organ so i suppose the worst nightmare would be but like it's a monkey body and a human brain yeah so it's that kind of problem but the idea that it's necessary because we need it for organs for transplant it's really interesting how that kind of necessity starts to develop so the first the first organ transplant patient was somebody who happened to have an identical twin so who knew whose kidneys had packed in and he needed a kidney trance well needed a kidney transpl transplant that was the only possibility and he had an identical twin so you can transplant from identical twin because there's there's not going to be any organ rejection yeah it's exactly the same so from then organs then spread out to close relatives as long as they're a match and then to finding searches with strain with strangers and then it's also spread out more to sort of black markets in organs actually and and and people being accounts of people being kidnapped and yeah and then and then the search so what happens is the class of patients who could benefit from an organ transplant is vastly greater than the supply of organs yeah that's already set up a kind of shortfall so you've created a possibility create a possibility in medicine we think we can do this and then lots of people could benefit from this very vaguely described possibility and then because it's a medical need so it's also really important to understand you could think of it in terms of a mad scientist in a lab like some crazy scientists doing this stuff you can imagine you can easily imagine the scientists doing this must be kind of really crazy mad driven by lust for power yeah you see in medicine it's also really important but one of the major factors behind this is compassion yeah and who's sick yeah and the one thing you always have to remember in this story is that you're gonna die like i'm gonna die you're gonna die we're all gonna die okay so that's that's that's gonna happen so like you said so now the problem is that is rather when am i going to die and what is the net what is the limit that i'm which that i'm willing to accept that that death is reasonable right and so with medicine what's happened is that we've without necessarily understanding the ramifications of that we're pushed the limit of what is reasonable reason to die further and further to a point where like you said they're doing these things and they're saying it's necessary because we've already accepted a limit yes what it means for a death to be reasonable and that limit is is so far that we're willing to do other things which can be questionable in order to satisfy that that that limit and it has a great it has a great application to cope with which is that we know we can let's say they think that medically we can contain this thing somehow yes because it's possible we think it's possible and because technology makes it possible then it's there no even question whether we should do it or not whether we should how far we should go there's no limit to how far we should go because once you've created that possibility and because like you said it's motivated by compassion yes then it's like this strange parasitic story comes in and people just stop thinking and stop asking that stop noticing that there's actually a competing set of values that have to be thought of they just see the possibility and they just embody it kind of jump into it yeah and this happens all the time with tech with technology but but certain values come to before and it tends to be values that you can count so but in terms of health of course count you can count the number of years and how you know how long you are alive the things that you can more easily account i mean it happens within the healthcare system in terms of like efficiency of goals of target because of course one of the other terrible things that's happening is that people are living longer and longer and longer but the quality of care for elderly people is absolutely atrocious it's just absolutely absolutely abysmal so that's it's really interesting how i think one movement one of the things we're faced with got lots and lots of examples of this but one of the things we're faced with is how the technology is making different values come of kind of like clash with each other or produce paradoxes so he i mean here's one whole set of paradoxes in i'm not what is i don't know i don't know if paradox is the right word but but but but certainly so one one of the ways in which medicine has has has gone down the route actually i want to get back to talking about the monkey embryos in in a minute but one of the ways in which it produces a kind of cloud the sort of a clash but you tell me whether it's the right word would be through genetic technology which is developed techniques for screening before either within testing out testing embryos in the womb and maybe having selective termination of pregnancy for various damaged ones or pre-op implantation diagnosis severe tooth for lots and lots of different diseases really commonly as for many pregnant women will be screened for down syndrome at the same time there are other people putting in lots and lots of work for to treat the very same diseases so cystic fibrosis for example which is quite quite a common genetic disease among certain populations it's quite a pretty serious disease but the treatment for that is improving really really really really quite well and down syndrome i think is a really important example because at the same time as screening for dancing was being pushed so i believe that iceland is is is hoping to have like zero down syndrome births at the same time people with down syndrome are living longer and longer and longer they're going to school they go to university they're holding down jobs they're getting married but the possibilities of the life of somebody with down syndrome is in increasing really quite significantly people with down syndrome are being used in adverts so it it it's different strands yeah there's a major clash like there's basically a inclusion versus eugenics clash which is quite insane when you realize just how extreme those two those two things are yeah yeah yes and yeah and and and also so i mean so much this is gain is also driven by driven by compassion by you know feeling that that parents would feel they wouldn't be able to cope with certain things so again i want to stress it's really really easy when you're talking about these things to make it sound as if you're being really judgmental so so if that's not that's not what i'm talking about i'm not kind of everyone's sort of it's partly because we have such a legalistic way of thinking about ethics that you think if you're trying to look at the subtlety or nuances behind things that means you think you're going to try and you what you're intending to do is to stop people from doing things yeah but we need to be we need to be attentive to this because let's say let's take the monkey man story and so this drive to create hybrids right this drive to and it really is a weird drive like it's like it's a narrative drive the drive to create hybrids for medical reasons but at the same time there is a narrative in society there's a story and one of those stories is the revolutionary story and so if you have a revolutionary pattern in your culture and you create ai that revolutionary pattern is going to find its place in ai so we're going to have a sense that the robots need to free themselves from us so if you do the same with the hybrid you have the same problem the recent the recent line of planet of the apes movies has the apes as the good guys and the humans as the bad guys please remember that people because as you're creating these hybrids and you have a revolutionary pattern in your culture you're setting up something that you're not you're not going to you're setting up a situation where you're going to have compassion for these hybrids and and not you know in a com an upside down compassion even where you're going to want to make them into your king which is just a scary stuff yeah yeah yes so so one of the things that i've noticed going back to the ai creation meme with the spark of electricity as you said i mean you pointed out that but if it was light then that would fit it more with the genesis story but if we're thinking about it in terms of electricity and we're thinking that and of course we are made of electricity our brains run on electricity but that's that's one of the ways in which humans can be seen to be inferior to ai because one of the ways in which we're often talked of dismissively is that because our brains are running in violent we're trapped if you like it's not a good way of putting it but we are biological beings yeah and there's a lot of people saying well the way in which we think if our brains are like computers we're trapped by what's called wet wear have you ever like where or what work so then the ai isn't it can run much faster it's in silicon it you can have quantum computing you could do stuff far faster so again that's that's an example of how we think what we've created is going to be better than us we're just trapped trapped in when wet where all the way in which of our thought process processes are hampered if you like by our emotions our desires or by the ways in which actually we've stemmed from evolution so another way in which we're seen as being potentially inferior to ai is because a phrase i haven't actually heard it until recently but but we're just kind of like trapped in monkey suits because of the ways in which where the ways in which we have you know factors about how we behave driven by our evolutionary past for example yeah i guess this is like a really good example about how we're kind of seen to be we progressed beyond the monkey but we're kind of like trapped trapped by like taints of our monkeyness that if only we could get away from the monkeyness we could then go on to the to the next step yeah that's where we that's where you see this this like hint of gnosticism in the modern thinking you know the idea that evolution is progress right first of all it's very d it's supposedly deeply unscientific but it seems to be a trope that people cannot get rid of they just keep even the most even the most like evolutionist if you listen to an evolut like a an evolutionary biologist for long enough you're gonna you're gonna find him falling right in that trope even if even if he'll say no no no evolution is in progress they just end up getting into that trope no matter how they how they they do it and so the the image of moving from the monkey to the computer is definitely something which has a deep story a deep story version like you see it in all kinds of very even popular culture and type of thinking where you have this idea of the the robot as being a superior form yeah yeah yeah yeah so so so yes so in look in doing these monkeys these monkey experiments we have this is one of the ways in which there's a form of hybridity in terms of ways which we flip from one way of thinking about ourselves to another way of thinking about ourselves so in order to do the experiments in order for it to work we had to pick a monkey because they're closer to us in evolutionary terms we've only diverged from them i don't know 17 million years old so we're quite close to quite close to them so that's why it works so we have to see ourselves as like biological beings who were fairly closely related to monkeys but they wanted to justify doing the research on these monkeys who are after all are quite completely complex beings in order to justify like taking it's worse for the female man i mean it is actually worse for a female monkey because of collecting eggs is so much more odorous in order to justify doing it we've got to think of ourselves as being superior to the monkeys because we're not we're not trying to create organs in order to save monkey lives we're using monkeys to try to save human lives we wouldn't we wouldn't sacrifice a human to try to save a monkey we just wouldn't do it because we think of ourselves but it's is so it's really interesting so only like about 20 years ago when we managed a sequence of human genome everybody was really excited and saying at last we found the essence of man as if our genomic code was going to be like the book of life people talked about that for various reasons we don't do talk about that anymore one of the reasons being that when we sequenced all the genes it turned out that really embarrassingly humans didn't have many genes compared to other animals jeans is really simple worms and other animals have got far more than us so that was it's really strange how that's kind of like a bit embarrassing and then it turns out that genes are much more complex than we thought but a lot of stuff is actually really environment and and but lots of diseases before we're going to be able to cure is actually much more complex so that's all faded but this but what one of the things that technology does is is like it it exposes and puts pressure pressure on the contradictory ways in which we think about ourselves and evolution i mean evolution is evolution is the point that you're making about evolution is is completely right it's really hard to find anybody talking about evolution and not see it in terms of of progress and it's like so i think evolution has done this really cunning bait and switch on us so it so it came along in the 19th century and despite what anybody says it was used to say that oh we're really we're just like we're nothing but monkeys yeah all those cartoons of charles darwin being like a monkey we're nothing like monkeys so therefore religion is a load of rubbish we just evolved and it's random it's interesting in terms of how it's now seen in terms of progress it's just as completely random completely meaningless these random mutations happened and some of them worked and some of them didn't and by this accidental progress accidental i said progress by mistake yeah yeah little process we've done with humans as being like the latest thing but then having got rid of religion more or less amongst people thinking really scientifically it's like they have to get some kind of meaning and progress from somewhere so the meaning and the progress comes from evolution and so now so the interesting really interesting thing is instead of having a picture before whereby there were animals lower down and then man in the middle and then angels and then god you know like i mean one of my actually my favorite i love psalm 8 you know the band has you have made us man a little lower than the angels what is man that ma bow art mindful of him a little lower in the angels for dominion over the animals so there's a huge amount of fuss for people saying this religious view is awful how dare you think you've got to minion over the animals yeah how dare you think so and what that's been replaced by it's by i blame it all on john lennon actually his song imagine yeah there's no heaven above us only sky so the if above us is only sky that means that we're at the top that's right yeah we're at the top and and it plays out in so many interesting and and let's say like you said kind of this contradictory way would end up showing the same reality which is that even the idea of environmentalism is so powerful because it's all the environmentalists say how arrogant you know man is so arrogant because he places himself above above nature and tries to control nature he's like would you tell an ant that like would you tell an ant that it that it's tried to control nature no you you the only reason why you say that because you do believe that you are above nature and you do believe that you're going to save the environment you know and that and that by acting like a human does you're going to undo the bad things that other humans did and so you can't get out of it it just even in those that are the most anti-human kind of pro-environment thinking they end up putting human beings at the top you just it just happens on its own it's it's actually quite funny to to pay attention to yes yeah because in terms of environmentalism if you just see us as organisms part of a planet if you take something like a guy a hypothesis then if if for example we lead we we do stuff that leads to human extinction through climate change or whatever we're doing but we'll just die out and the cockroaches will take over and stuff that's right is there morality to like the the meteorite that destroyed the dinosaurs like why would there be more morality in human extinction or not just human extinction all the other races that are being extinct like if like if if a certain predator like eats away eats all its prey and then it does it to an extent that it can't survive itself that's no moral question it just happened and then other beings will take its place and just keep going and so nobody believed that like nobody everybody believes that we are like little gods you know on the in the world it's just that whether or not this little god has ultimate power or whether or not it should be submitted to a higher a higher truth that's that ends up being the the question and there's a kind of unconsciousness about so many of these of these movements and these especially environmentalism is the one that is the most to me like contradict it's like i agree that we should take care of the of the world around us like i don't think we think what we're doing is that it's abusive but i think i think that there's a blindness which means that you're gonna struggle to get there because you don't see what's really happening oh right right yes yes okay and so the monkey man is definitely something that we we need to pay attention to in terms of the question of hybridity and the idea of the human computer hybrid is also something which is definitely at the same time on the on the four let's say with elon musk and his his microchips in the brain so i don't know if you thought a little bit about that and the stories that are surrounding that kind of thinking right yes yes yes well because because that is that's that's linked to a notion of progress so if if we're so if you take if you take this the view that like some ways of thinking about how humans are the pinnacle of evolution of course the problem of matters if you're if you're thinking that evolution is a pr is a prime mover when you read it you just wait and see what evolves next but actually people are not really satisfied with that so there's kind of if you like well a number of different strands forward but you could divide them into two one is one is a kind of strand humans need to need to use machinery to try to improve to try to improve ourselves so we have the elon musk type of wanting to have the neural link implant in the brain so one of the reasons why he wants to do that is to make us able to keep up with ai because thinking that ai is going to be basically thinking so fast that we won't be able to understand it so we need to be able to link with ai to to won't be to unders understand it so merge having these plates in your brain i mean i don't think i would volunteer for that but actually that's also really interesting because it's also really interesting it actually relates again back to that question of medicine in terms of developing it because a proposed use for it would be for people who are maybe completely paralyzed to be paralyzed in some terrible accident who might be actually quite grateful for an implant in their brain so that they can maybe directly move the world so that you could maybe get your thoughts translated and so on so actually you could you could then actually really start to understand why if you'd had this if you were suddenly paralyzed or you'd you know some catastrophic medical disaster and you were given the option but it might be pretty dangerous but would you like an implant in your head so that you can then communicate and it's got locked in synchro you can you can actually understand why somebody might think that would be you know a really good progress for somebody but in terms of understanding in terms of taking upon that risk in order to communicate with ai one of the things that's happening is that it's thinking of progress in terms of something really quite specific so that people who talk about progress in this way there are people who so max tegmark for example who's he's a cosmologist i think he's at mit and he was one of the people who's he's one of the founders of the future of life institute and he wrote a book about three years ago i think called i think i think it's called human 3.0 i sometimes yeah it's human 3.0 i suggested you read it i want but i know you have enough time to read it so he talks about evolution he's an example of people talking about evolution but seeing evolution in terms of making the universe aware of itself and having knowledge and understanding and seeing it in terms of facts that's a good thing so he said before that happened before the universe woke up there was no value in the world you have to wake up in order you have consciousness of yourself and that would create knowledge and value but then humans are at the pinnacle of that but we've reached the end of more or less the end of it in terms of biblical evolution is going to be too slow i'm stephen hawking talked about that as well he said human biological evolution is so slow so we're going to get overtaken by machines so you might worry that your machines are overtaking us or you might be pleased because you might think what we can do is invent machines and they'll be more intelligent and we'll create more and more and more intelligence in the universe and that's where the future is the future is not human so one future is humans we need to enhance ourselves to survive or to develop and the other is that bye bye little human you were just like the monkey ancestor you were just like the neanderthal to the to the ai and the future of descendants are going to be ai but of course in order to paint that picture you have to decide what out of what's happening in evolution is is progress yeah what's up progress constitutes intelligence and that is yeah so like you know so if we go back to the creation of adam meme if you think of it man is made in the image of in the image of god you didn't have to think about well what aspects of you know what aspects of us are in the image of god it can't be every little tiny detail what is it so the answer these people are giving is that it's intelligence this particular a particular form of intelligence which you think a machine can exemplify yeah exactly and i think i think that one of the issues that happens is of course understanding yourself as the summit of as the human person that says the summit of of this capacity to value is already it's already the problem like it's already the problem because the mechanism of valuing or the capacity to notice the good is something which at least in every other culture in the whole history of the universe has helped people understand that there's actually a hierarchy that goes up above us that this valuing actually leads up to goods which are beyond just the individual person whether it be communal bodies you know in terms of of beings that come together and in in systems that point to something above it and then continuing on into seeing these values embodied in different images of gods or angels all the way up to the infinite but as soon as you see the the human person as this only valuing thing in the in the in reality then it leads to this problem of the solipsistic problem of this this kind of like because they become self-valuing like at this weird self-valuing and then it creates these strange aberrations which are both extremes in a way that are that are kind of too extreme in terms of like you said seeing ourselves as these all powerful gods that can do whatever or seeing ourselves as these future ants which will spawn something above us which will be something that is more reasonable that is faster that is more that is more in terms of quantifiable qualities has more in terms of these kind of quantifiable qualities but valuing is the is not quantifiable like that's what valuing is value is quality it's something which jumps above this quantifiable or this speed or all of this of this type of thing that people think is what intelligence is and so there's an internal problem even in the way that they that they understand what intelligence is what the purpose you know what the purpose of of consciousness is all of this is deeply problematic yes yes yeah i think you're right but there are more problems still so i think one of the problems i think one of the things we as humans always have to do in terms of thinking about value is always be aware that we might be wrong and to serve and to ask ourselves the question and so that's why it's a dangerous just to do it on your own that's why you might you need feedback from other people that's why you always have to you know ask yourself whether you know whether or not you're you're biased in some way you ask yourself whether or not you're being selfish actually i did my i mean this is something else i've always been really interested in i did my phd on self-deception we always have to be aware of the fact that we might be you know but we might be deluding ourselves in some kind of way so we need we need to have some a certain sort of humility but you just don't you just don't see that in these grand in these grand visions and something else also that's happening is that there's so much focus on the individual self there's so much focus on being on the individual so of course the individual is really important but you can focus on it on it too much but there's focus on the individual at the same time and so absolute certainty that these people are absolutely certain that they know how to solve problems so like so for example the in terms of like the of climate change the hubris of people who think okay we're going to block out the sun now that's insane that that that i can't when i see that i think i'm in a science fiction movie these people are not they they don't exist like this there's no way that someone is actually saying that it's like a like in the simpsons they had that idea like blocking off the sun at some point the the mr burns wanted to block off the sun like crazy i know i know it's not even like a science fiction music like a bad austin powers movies like like it's just insane so so there's but the level of humor but that the certainty about the but the individual is right when they're focusing so much on this narrow goal but the individual self is being sort of emphasized so much at a time when actually in so many ways the technology that we're using is destroying the individual self it's creating so much uncertainty it's there's so many there are so many ways in which human human beings are constructed income where complex and where in a sense inherently provoke in we've got parts of us which are prone to divide in various ways so you can have emotions which can be at odds with what we know about things we've got different aspects to ourselves we've got an inner subjective part we've got an outer objective part our emotions can be don't have desires which can be in conflict and i think one of the things that the technology we have is doing at the moment is in so many different instances over and over and over again it's emphasizing certain aspects of ourselves and it's manipulating us in ways that creates division within ourselves which is manipulating our desires and it's manipulating our relationships with ourselves and relationships with other people so it's cheap so as for example we talked like before last time about online meetings and talking of the zoom it changes how we see ourselves because we're looking at we can see an image of ourselves all the time so it's changing our self-perception it's changing how we relate to other people oh actually actually i should just mention in relation to since we talked last time about how odd it is relating to somebody over zoom and because you're just relating really really remotely i've got a new strategy for my zoom meetings which is that i'm in the same room as i was last time but i've turned the table around because and now i've told itself i'm facing the person so my computer is i'm facing montreal so i looked it up on the map it's a little it's a little gesture to remind yourself that i'm an embodied person somewhere yeah i'm talking to some friends in australia tomorrow so i've got the face in that direction so that's a lot of that that's my my little rebellion again it's a but it's it's it seems it could seem like it's not much but it's a little just even the idea of attending and having something in memory like this a gesture to just turn your table is recognizing something and recognizing the the difficulty of the situation let's say and so it's not a it's not a bad idea because if the person isn't in your screen right and that's a that that's something that we will alter we we tend to default to even if we don't think of it rationally but we tend to act that way and and think that way so so yeah listen paula we've been going for a while and i think that we could probably just keep talking forever and so i think this is definitely going to going to ask for another conversation sooner than later and and a lot of people are interested in understanding what's going on and understanding the the stories that go with the technology and the contradictions and and these competing narratives in terms of who we are and what we're doing in the time of covid and with all these new technologies on the horizon as well so i really appreciate you taking the time with us to to work through this and and you know and be willing to kind of put ourselves out and put yourself out on a limb to to talk about difficult things that that have a lot of implications so thanks a lot well thank you thank you i really i really enjoyed it and as you said yeah as there's loads more that we could that we could talk about definitely and we will that's for sure so everybody thank you for your attention we really appreciate it of course there's we talk we've touched on so many things so definitely go at it in the comment section and get involved in the discussion there there you know we talk you know we we just like paula and i just like you we're overwhelmed by what we're seeing and we're overwhelmed by by noticing what's happening and so we we need to to be all of us kind of working together and seeing how we can find little solutions and bigger solutions to the difficulties that that this situation is bringing to us so thanks for attention everybody and i'll talk to you very soon
