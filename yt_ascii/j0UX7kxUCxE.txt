ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the qatar masters 2023 this is an open tournament being played in qar shocking i know and it features some of the best players in the world magnus carlson hikara nakamura is there as well as a massive range of 2700 level talent this is the round six out of nine recap the race is heating up magnus carlson left his board today we're going to get into all of that and just a friendly reminder that it is currently october the 17th 202 3 so if you watch this video around the time it comes out we got two big fan book events here in new york city that you can check out you can be there on the night that the book comes out or you can get a free ice cream at dylan the ma ice cream shop known as catchin and that's that's all i have to say so if you want to go or get a signed copy of a book and an ice cream go ahead i know magnus wants one okay anyway my friends magnus carlson this is the sixth game g in this tournament he has played five indians not only has he played five indians he's played like five indians i've never heard of in my life and i'm not trying to disrespect them i know like 15 to 20 top indian grand masters vishan an i'm not going to list them all you know humpy conu haravali tanya sajev maybe i will ges prague right all those guys arger guys is going to be in today's recap i have no idea who adtia samant is not a clue i have known any of magnus's opponent actually and if you literally look up ad dtia samant chess this is a 17-year-old 2500 rated international master what three years ago in 2019 this dude was 2200 the chess revolution in india is unreal just completely ridiculous okay now magnus has had to battle several of them he's had to battle them with white and with black e4 by the way this guy has a rating around the rating of pesh a couple of rounds ago magnus made a draw against the grandmaster the teenage grandmaster they have the same rating magnus goes for e5 now that's surprising against pesh magnus went for g6 he played a very very provocative pierz i guess i guess magnus is not playing c5 because he doesn't want to play into an ultra theoretical position that's what i'm thinking because white could memorize knight f3 knight c6 d4 cd knight d4 knight f6 knight c3 pawn e5 knight b5 knight pawn d6 bishop g5 a6 knight a6 b5 knight right like magnus likes to play the fesn off sicilian but maybe white is just going to rattle off 25 moves so instead magnus plays e5 and he plays knight c6 he plays into a spanish now you'll notice right here magnus sat down played a move and and then he left he left the board man played e5 to make the game official and then he said you know he like sat down shook hands black starts white's clock e4 you know e5 and now he returned four minutes later i i i i don't know what he did i don't know how he could have gone to the bathroom that fast i imagine it's a big hotel or a big venue anyway and maybe he went he he he he just i don't know hopefully nobody else was wearing a watch i i don't i hope all the fair play measures oh my goodness some stuff just fell off my desk i guess i just shake the room when i walk because i got to go to the gym night to c6 magnus plays into a spanish meaning he invites whatever is coming it could be an italian or spanish and magna has played this with black many times in the world championship very tough to win with black so so let's see if he can work his magic a6 this is the main line knight to f6 castles b5 kicks out the bishop and now rather than bishop to e7 or rather that is actually exactly what happens here bishop to e7 rook e1 in this position something surprising happens you know what it is of course you don't i'm going to tell it to you normally what happens here is that black plays pawn to d6 white plays pawn to c3 trying to play d4 black castles and white plays h3 magnus carlson does not play the move d6 when magnus plays the spanish what he normally does is he plays castles c3 d5 he likes the marshall which is an opening where after e d5 knight d5 knight e5 knight e5 rook e5 c6 black has very good compensation and generally can kill the game magnus plays d6 that's big that means we are headed for a spanish that he normally doesn't play we are we are going for a closed ru lopez spanish a vintage spanish this is a position that has been reached millions tens of millions of times if not more no joke historically kasparov and karpov played so many games here the bishop has stopped from going to g4 and now pawn to d4 is the idea black can play bishop b7 rook e8 bishop f8 rook e8 bishop f8 bishop b7 black can play knight a5 and then pawn to c5 which is a very common idea there are other lines as well magnus plays knight b8 this is known as the brier knight a5 is a certain variation like i said bishop b7 is flor zitu like this rook e eight and then rerouting the bishop to g7 carpov used to play that all the time but we have knight undevelop itself black will play c5 in the future future he's going to put this knight on d7 he's going to put the bishop on b7 he's going to put the rook on e8 something's going to go back over there and watch as magnus begins maneuvering knight bd7 you may wonder why would the knight undevelop itself and redevelop to d7 from where it is more passive well that's chess all right so you know you you reroute you your your knight and you support the center pawn without supporting it on c6 you prevent any potential queen trades your knight can go to c5 if anything happens a little bit easier you could also play the move c5 and your knight doesn't actually have to venture out to the edge of the board and this diagonal stays open f should be7 white also rerouting his pieces in a way notice that white is not thinking a lot of chess can now be memorized rook to e8 played by magnus knight to f1 it's so difficult nowadays to force an opponent of yours into a position where they have to think on their own white now finishes all of this maneuvering probably now has to think on his own no he plays the move a4 white is not even thinking he's just not even thinking every move that white is making is happening instantly so now it's up to magnus who plays knight to b6 to force white to think he does seven minutes in this position black could have played bishop g7 he could have play played c5 he could have maybe even played d5 and we would have had this massive explosion in the center i think magnus deliberately here plays something that is maybe not the computer's top choice but a very good weapon it targets the pawn on a4 and now white has the option to kind of start exploding the center already white has to think take take take take take take rook a7 rook b8 you know and magnus makes his opponent think on his own and he does this both sides have now made 17 moves the pawns are frozen there are no b pawns and it's going to be a dance and what's going to happen it's going to be a dance of the pieces and what happens here in the center of the board white plays rook b1 look at the clock do you know how nerve-wracking it is to play against magnus carlson you finally make it out of a position look at magnus's time magnus's time has not got down at all like since he returned to the board after spotting his opponent some time in the opening because he was i don't know emptying his body it took him a little bit of time to decide to play the brier and then he literally did not hesitate again he played this idea a5 fixing white's pawn on a4 to potentially take it in the future white on his next move spend 32 minutes he spent 32 minutes moving a rook one square that is how difficult and nerve-wracking it is to play magnus cuz you don't know what to do you could play here to go back you could play bishop d3 to try to prevent anything from going onto this diagonal slow and steady bishop g5 he plays rook b1 can you really blame him no now bishop to g7 look magnus's time didn't even go below 116 he could have played a lot of different things here but i think mentally magnus had prepared for rook b1 remember he had 32 minutes so he goes here and now again white spends 20 he went from 125 to 30 minutes remaining in two turns that is a stag and i would know i know what it's like to play against people when i'm nervous it happens to me all the time this dude spent an hour making two moves can you imagine the agony that he was under he was sitting there going oh my god i'm playing against magnus oh my god oh my god i'm playing against magnus this is crazy like white could do a lot of different things he could play bishop g5 you know he could play bishop to e3 he could play bishop to b3 could play bishop to d3 he could maybe wait make a waiting move with king to h2 apparently you can even play h4 according to stockfish because of h5 the bishop lives on g5 forever so he decides though after this much thought to trade because he wants to remove the queens you see mentally you want to relieve the pressure right now he goes for a queen trade but now he's got to come up with a move again he plays rook b5 so this was his idea he spent 23 minutes he decides to take and says right magnus let's go for an end game and i'm going to go get your pawn on a5 magnus thinks and plays knight d7 instantly instantly look at this look at magnus just not spending any time at all he says you know dude you want my pawn go take my pawn rook takes a5 now magnus immediately zips his rook around you see taking on a5 was like an unclogging of a drain all right that pawn on a5 was ready to die because after rook to a8 black activates on that file now everything is the same two rooks two knights two bishops isolated c pawn efgh everything is the same how is magnus going to win this position look at white clock 7 minutes spent on this move apparently it was better to move the bishop to d2 to overprotect this and then maybe put something on a1 he plays bishop here knight a4 and now rook b1 now the crazy thing about this position is he spent s minutes moving his bishop and then after knight takes a4 he spent another 13 minutes but he knew that he knew knight takes pawn was coming it's i think it's all nerves and i mean ad sant would destroy me in a chess game like please don't even that's not what i'm saying at all it's just crazy like maybe if he says he wasn't nervous he's lying knight takes a4 he knew that move was coming and now he plays rook b1 he has 10 minutes on the clock magnus hasn't spent any any time at all just sitting there like it's amazing to see this type of stuff and another he's down to 4 minutes he has 4 minutes to make 14 moves bishop f8 rook c4 and all of a sudden white's rook is stuck 56 seconds on the clock now he has to move faster and all of a sudden bishop takes f2 check knight takes e5 and the black the the black position is looking very very nice now stockfish could still defend this position but white is desperately trying to hang on plays knight2 magnus advancing advancing and it's probably difficult to play a guy that has 50 seconds cuz you're like he's going to lose on time rook takes c6 knight takes c6 knight b5 check and in this position for a reason i will not really ever understand white went here and the idea of that move was that the rook is hanging and the knight is hanging but after rook to a6 knight takes c7 he missed this and now after bishop takes knight rook c5 is hitting everything so it's over but if aditia in this position had taken he might have drawn the game i mean this dude was so nervous he was down to a minute on the clock with 15 moves to play and he defended himself with a minute versus an hour against the best player of all time maybe magnus could have applied pressure a little bit better but he did literally everything that he could and aditia just did not take the rook he with a minute on his clock he went here and suddenly all of that falls apart and he loses the game and he resigns in this position position rather than prolonging it but that was crazy i mean he wasn't even that much worse crazy stuff i mean these indian players are absurdly strong hikaru nearby battling with the white pieces versus david parvon very strong grandmaster very good at a lot of he plays a lot online better known as a dropstone dp i've played him before i've actually defeated david parvan i think even twice in blitz he might be like one of the only 3000s i've beaten twice and i just into this whole spiel about how he's you know very strong but i think he just wanted to end up in a video anyway he plays what's called the semi tash the tage variation is is is like knight c3 c5 this is the semi- tage cuz you know it's kind of a semi and kind of a tage and a line that has gotten very popular recently is after white takes on d5 black mirror takes on d4 and then there's like queen a4 check bishop d7 queen d4 e d and then there's all these different lines lines but actually this game just takes a traditional approach knight takes d5 that's that's what they used to play before 2020 and then in 2020 somebody became you know deviant and perverse and started mirror imaging capturing on d4 but actually knight takes d5 and now there's a massive sequence which goes e4 takes takes takes takes bishop e4 takes they're just kidding bishop d2 takes takes bishop c4 knight d7 b6 bishop b7 knight f6 rook c8 all of this has been played thousands of times that's why neither guy has spent any time white enjoys a microscopic advantage black basically says you're trash you're not going to beat me plus l plus ratio you fell off queen f4 with the idea of queen h4 and e5 all right and you know in this position if you're playing with black you might experience a little bit of concern you know because it looks like you're getting mated and white has all these pieces it might feel a little bit like cly wobbles any of you ever had colly wobbles it it's definitely very scary right it's definitely scary but a a threat of a queen trade and then just a little h6 and it's it's really not that simple it is not that simple to do anything here you can play g4 and g5 and it looks you know like like you're going to get in there but but just queen f4 and then and yeah no we're not there there's there's nothing happening here but that's played h3 hikaro just making a preparatory move and the best way for black to create anything here is going to be on the queen side okay because rook to e3 rook to g3 you know you're trying to get to that king and and and and but but just just counter you know just david just doing his thing here and and now now david plays a move that i do not understand at all king f8 i mean i mean i i guess everything in his position is so good he doesn't have to touch anything so he just literally moves his king and i feel like he's going to move his king back at some point hikaro plays bishop to b5 and now an explosion bishop takes e4 hikaru gives away the rook to get the two pieces this is maybe his biggest chance of the game queen f4 the king now goes back to jade he's got two pieces but again like david just too quick on that pawn making it really really difficult to defend himself and rook takes c5 a nice little move at the end by david his queen goes down and hikaro actually has to force a draw here because if he doesn't then queen f6 like let's say hikaro tries to play for a win good luck it's really it's going to be really really difficult and then even this is a draw because you still have perpetual but you know you get my point so very nice game from david i i have to say he was under quite a bit of pressure hikaro might have had some advantage but a nice little lashing out with g5 aggressive counterplay and a nice classy sacrifice of the rook nice little defensive sack and david is doing well in this event now a player who really leveled up is is ruig makaron last game he defeated anish giri i have two more games for you anish giri is going to make a comeback in today's uh in today's recap by comeback i i i thought i covered him in last recap making he's making a return but i i did not this is one of the weirdest games that i have ever seen okay c4 all right and now we we we have just a very standard opening that's about to get really really uga bishop f5 arjin attacks the pawn on b7 pawn to b5 pawn on to c5 now start start stuff starts getting really weird okay a5 trying to play a4 not e6 and bishop b7 a5 knight h4 going after the bishop the bishop goes to its home square okay speaking of starters like starting square starters just going to throw the out there fire type was the best pokemon starter type i never understood anybody who would you know do like the treo or the mudkip like what are you doing it's all about blazin and infernape just little aside f4 and now the next move is just i mean this is if your children are watching cover their eyes okay this is basically an explicit nudity scene in chess this what you're about to is perverse in this position black plays knight to g8 get the hell what what i mean he they want me to cover this what what is this come on children are watching white has played all of the what the craziest part is look at the evaluation how is that possible how's that possible every just goes back he goes back because he doesn't want his knight hit for instance if bishop e2 black would play e5 attacking the knight and by the time you arrive back this is very unpleasant for white so he plays knight f3 how is this position okay well it's not apparently a4 was a wrong move black really needed to speed up his development he did it this way but that allowed arjun to play knight e5 this is one of the dumbest highle chess games i've ever seen in my life it does not make sense all right and when you have such advanced pawns all right you got to be worried about e4 and b3 all right and you know black's position here you know you're suffocating it's like hands on your esophagus you know or air pipe esophagus i don't know it's like you know it's like that does not feel very good all right bishop to g7 knight to h6 you're really restricted here you're doing your best i mean you're doing the best with what you got and by the way look at the eval it's equal somehow despite this complete absurdity ruik maron who yesterday defeated a 2750 2760 no disrespect intended to anish giri he has a very nice position and here he plays a very provocative move he is sacrificing this this is the type of position where because white has eyes on all of this a sacrifice could be looming and if you infiltrate the base camp you really could do a lot of damage knight takes c6 okay that's a really really tough spot and now knight takes c6 bishop takes b5 so two pawns are captured the knight is hanging the pawn is hanging did i say two knights are captured two pawns are cap two i think i said that anyway and a couple moves later bishop takes a4 my friends arjun arigi has all of these pawns and i got news for you he is going to move them and it is going to be very difficult for black to stop them the knight jumps to a4 and a couple moves later it's going to jump again and now he trades the bishop he trades the bishop because he going to go b b4 end like this but my friends look at the evaluation you can trade and as long as you explode the center ruik is beating eric iy it's it's mild i mean it's marginal it's really only beating if you know that this exists in a real game you don't got the eval bar right so queen to d7 b3 queen c6 and now he the the problem is he's moving these pieces that way and he's not actually opening the position by the time he does open the position it's too late and it's like yelling in the mountain it's about to get really ugly pawn takes pawn takes and it's over a4 b5 we go here to trade a rook we do exactly that and have you ever seen four connected past pawns yeah knight c4 a5 a6 kick out the knight rudic fires in with pawn 2 e3 but it's just not good enough you take the knight you take the queen and rudik promotes to a knight for the memes and eric icey takes and then probably er guy look this is one of the most absurd positions i've ever seen is up a rook and a bishop a rook and the bishop but white has four pass pawns he's just going to go a7 and there's nothing you can do doesn't even matter if you play rookie i have you ever seen something like this look how completely absurd this position is and i mean it all happened because rudik decided that this is how he wanted to play chess oh my goodness crazy stuff crazy crazy stuff and you know one last game i got for you it's a nice game this is a nice game this is belel bellaa he's i hope i'm pronouncing that correctly number one player from algeria he's a strong grand master also he looks exactly like logic go look up ble bellena and then go look up logic the rapper from like five years ago they look identical in some photos he does in some photos he doesn't but in my opinion i like he looks so much like logic the rapper it's ridiculous we play into a knorf sicilian which is something that anish giri knows very well cuz he actually has a course on the knorf sicilian e6 queen f3 and there's this very interesting and provocative line in the nidorf where white actually can sacrifice on b5 and you'll notice anish spent 25 minutes i think anish spent 25 minutes in this position because he was thinking what to get me for my birthday which is december 5th so anish you got a little bit of time and if any of you want to give a birthday present to somebody you know or to a friend about a birthday or anything else i have a cameo i have recorded hundreds of cameos at this point look at look at me promoting things all the time but you know before i show you the next move of this game i do just want to say sometimes i feel like i over promote like i've been heavily promoting the book because i'm very proud of it and it's coming out soon and you know me i'll be like oh free samples or new course or whatever but i frequently get questions like hey gotham how do i get a signed copy of your book and i'm like but i swear to god like i i i talk about this thing all the time people still don't know so forgive me if i'm overdoing it but if i'm overdoing it it's probably because you watch a lot of the videos which i'm not complaining about anyway b5 25 minutes spent white sacrifices his bishop crazy sacrificing a piece he gets another pawn and then he gets the pawn on d6 as well so he cleared out the whole board remember what happened in the area iy game did you did you forget about that you remember what that looked like with all those spawns maybe that's going to happen here too all these pawns are just going to fly down the board and we do in fact go to a late stage middle game early endgame anish plays knight to g4 because he's up material so he needs to find that balance between trading everything and not what do i mean by that if anish gets to that position right which he will this is not the same position as trading your knight for instance might be rook d8 knight b5 knight f6 not king f6 let's just say just i'm i'm very very hypothetical stuff here rook a3 take take of course this can take this but we're we're doing it this way king c7 knight b6 take take okay this is a very different position in fact playing with the bishop is better because it's a long range piece if we change this around completely like this might even be better for white in some lines because popping three pass pawns with a knight and a king might not be easy at all in this case we get the knight here but and this is instructive you can't trade everything white has a lot of pawns but you got to trade enough all right and anish plays g5 and anish here does his best halloween impression of the terminator halloween is coming up it's in two weeks anish has his costume already purchased he doesn't have my my birthday present purchased but knight e5 h5 h4 h3 bishop goes to f1 and puts itself on g2 and white resigns what yeah ble said i'm out it's minus one he straight up said i'm out he straight up did the spongebob meme he stra up did the you guys you know the you know the spongebob meme all right i'm my head out like he just straight up did that in the middle of a game so did magnus in in in in the first round i mean that's crazy he's not even anisha is not winning any of these pawns yet now is black better of course he's going to pressure bring his rugs but like what i don't you you could wait i but dude said you know is he going to lose the game in 20 moves yes of unquestionably his position's very very tough but that came out of nowhere black had nothing going on this side and then anish went i'm going to expand and he was like yes okay you're going to expand i'm not scared you're not good i resigned d just resigned poor guy anish just did his best impression of the terminator my friends these are the standings after six rounds this is the top of the leaderboard and we have a four-way tie for first with five out of six two olympic gold medal winners from usc and two very strong indian grand masters then we have hikaru param maku david parvan magnus carlson no abdu satov gukesh murali kikan pranav v with four and a half they're all going to play each other tomorrow you're going to get sorted by rating it's going to be great qatar masters heating up in the desert no pun intended and that's all i have for you today get out of here
