hey guys and welcome back to another youtube video i just want to apologize right away if my voice is a little bit raspy i have been losing my voice over the past week so just bear with me as i do this tutorial so for this video what i'm gonna be doing is i'm gonna be showing you some graphics in with python so pretty much if you watch some of my previous tutorials i did stuff with pi game i made a side scroller we did like some other kind of game and then i showed you some basic games just using the python ideally so this is kind of an in-between it's gonna be using something called the turtle module to pretty much move an object around the screen that's gonna be drawing something kind of like a pen and it's cool and it's it's pretty easy to start off with graphics in python so i'm just going to show a quick example here just by running the script that i wrote so just ask if you'd like to play i click yes or click enter and then you can see it lines up a bunch of turtles on the screen and then they start racing like this so you can see the yellow ones off to the lead and they just kind of randomly move up the screen now the reason they stopped here just because when i made the script is on a laptop so the screen was a lot smaller but you can kind of see how that works so that's like a pretty simple program you can make with the turtle module the reason i have all this stuff here is just because once i finished doing that i have it right out into a text file just kind of scoring how many wins each color turtle has so in this tutorial i may be showing you guys what is a turtle how does it work and how we can kind of move it around the screen a little bit and make some cool shapes and experiment with some different objects so the first part of turtle graphics is importing the modules so this is built into python you don't need to install anything all you have to do is just type import turtle like that as your first line in your program alright so underneath my comment here underneath the header edge putting import to now what we need to do is we need to create a new turtle object so pretty much the way it works is you create a turtle object and then you can run methods on that object to move the turtle around the screen to make it disappear to stamp something there's a lot of cool things you can do that i'm going to show in the next kind of tutorials so first we'll make a letter to objects so i'm gonna call mine tim i'm gonna say equals turtle dot turtle like that so the class for turtle is this and we're just referencing the module turtle all right and now we can set a few basic properties for our turtle so there have one called color so tim bob color on this can be like an rgb value as well but right now we're just gonna stick with basic colors so i'm just gonna put let's put red can do tim dot pen size and what this does is change the thickness of the line that's gonna appear when the turtle is kind of running around the screen and drawing and this four pen size i'm just gonna put its not in quotes what am i doing it's gonna put five and then we can do tim dot shape as well so these are kind of the three basic properties that i always like to start off teaching because you can do a few things them you can change them around as you move the turtle around the screen so tim now color tim type n size tim shape for shape we have a few different options i believe there's arrow circle turtle and you kind of have you'd have to look up the other ones if you want to see what the shapes are but the one i'm gonna use this turtle for now i'll leave a link in the description down below to the like turtle module manual i guess you can look at all the different options if you want to do that so let's just go ahead and run the program now and see what we've got going so you can see now what we have is we have a red turtle in the middle of the screen has it moved nothing's happening and this is our little turtle window it's gonna be different size based on how big your monitor your display is alright so now we want to do is we want to move our turtle around the screen so you can see it starts off facing right so let's start moving so the basic methods that we can use to move our turtle are forward backwards i believe it's back yeah i backwards like that and then we have tim da left and tim dot right now there is a bunch of other ones you can use to move the turtle there's ones like set position set x y go to here whatever right but the ones we're gonna use are just forward backwards left right so when i first want to do is i want to first start by moving my turtle 100 pixels to the so 100 is not that many but you'll see what it is and then after i do that i'm gonna turn to the left and inside of this parameter here it takes an angle so if you only if you want to turn left it's gonna go left and then the angle that you put it so if you put 45 it's gonna appear as if you're moving at 135 degree angle but it's because it moved left 45 degree angles from where it was so i'm just gonna put 90 to make sure that mine kind of goes like in a box shape i'm gonna go tim dot forward another hundred pixels and then i'm gonna go tim dot right 90 like that and let's just see how this looks right right now just by running the program and you can see we go up go boom boom and there we go and then we turn right like that so if i wanted to make a box i would turn left 90 and it would go like that so on all right now a few other methods that we can use here are one that's called pen up and pen down now these are useful when you want to move the turtle around not getting too complex but you don't want to see the line drawn underneath the turtle so for example if i get tim dot forward and then tim dot left 90 and i do tim don't pen up and then after here tim duck pen down and tim dot forward another hundred pixels let's watch what happens so we see we draw it lifts the pen up and then it draws another line to the right so that's another way you can move the turtle without it really appearing like you're moving the turtle you can help them also make the turtle invisible you can make it visible again you can change the shape all the stuff that i've done up here you're able to do while you move the turtle so for example he wanted to change colors before we drew this next line i would do oops actually since we're not drawing their blue tim dark color and then green just like that run the program and you see goes goes up and then draws a green line alright so let's see what else we can kind of do here with the turtle method with the turtle module so these are the really basic shapes are not shapes method sorry that you can use for turtle you can actually draw some pretty cool pictures with it do some different things and you can also have more than one term object at a time so for example if i wanted to make a new turtle object i could do dave equals turtle dot turtle like this and then i'm gonna set dave with a bunch of properties as well so i'm going to say dave color and i'll give him blue and then dave dog pen size and let's make his pen size 20 so we can really see the difference and then we're just gonna leave his shape as the default jade shape just to show you what it looks like now i want to start off by doing dave dog backwards i'm gonna move him backwards 100 pixels and yeah let's see what happens here when we have two turtles moving at the same time like that well we're an engineer here there's no actually backwards okay so it actually is just backward not with the s i always get that one mixed up and then you could see dave starts in the middle of screen and he moves back a hundred pixels like that so you can have multiple turtles if you wanted to move them at the same time it's kind of difficult to do that you would just have to do one command executed after another so if you wanted it to look like they're moving the same time that go tim go for 100 and then dave thought backwards 100 right after and they would kind of move quickly and one last thing you can also change the speed of the turtle so you do dave dot speed and you can put this at for example one which i believe is the slowest and so it still goes really fast for speed one but if you go speed five and you're drawing a lot of lines then it would go much faster so that's kind of been a really brief introduction to the turtle module i'm gonna move into making kind of like a game with it in the next few tutorials i just wanted to introduce you guys and show you what you're able to do with the turtle module hopefully you guys are excited for the next videos i know this one was kind of boring but you always have to start somewhere right so if you guys enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and i will see you again in the next one
