ladies and gentlemen buckle up if you're already driving i hope you are already wearing your seat belt what i am about to show you in this video is nothing short of absolutely sensational it is currently day number five of five at the superb rapid and blitz chess tournament being held in wara poland at least today it is whenever you are watching this in the future i hope you're having a great day going into today magnus carlson greatest player of the current generation and arguably of all time is behind in the standings by two and a half points with nine games remaining and the person in first place is chinese superstar wei and what i am about to show you will shock you fascinate you potentially inspire you or frustrate you because none of us we will ever ever get close to this level of greatness none of us not even close we could combine it it's not going to happen sit back relax and watch one of the greatest duels between two chess players who are trying to win a tournament i speechless absolutely speechless what has just transpired at some point magnus won 10 straight games 10 straight games against 10 different players not 10 different players but at least seven different players in a double round robin field has like it it's unfathomable absolutely unfathomable what has transpired they are playing 5minute blitz with 2c bonus time which is actually relatively long blitz his first first round opponent is kil chevchenko and we will go back and forth as magnus and wei battled for one of the most unbelievable photo finishes in a chess tournament in recent memory except maybe the candidates but that wasn't rapid in blitz so kil chevchenko originally from ukraine now playing for romania opens up against with magnus and magnus plays whatever the heck this is i mean this is essentially trying to take some punches right hiding behind the guard and and trying to lance some back so we have knight to f3 knight f6 magnus going for the queen side counterplay with the move b5 because it looked like white wanted to castle queen side we have a3 bishop g7 k goes for the dark squared exchange and then he castles queenside from the early opening it was only one man who could have an advantage and it was kel and he sacrificed the bishop to punish magnus's wrongdoings cb knight b5 oh my goodness this man magnus is on the ropes already his king is trapped in the center of the board and he's only in his underpants queen c5 like derrick lewis by the way anybody saw that that was unbelievable knight to d6 check king to e7 knight g5 he is swarming but you got to beat magnus three times in the same game to put him away you can try to just get aggressive and open things up but let me tell you something magnus magnus senses there is no more attack here white needed to be a little bit more accurate and suddenly white is down 2 minutes and that's basically 40% of your starting time queen e3 queen f4 there's no more attack in comes knight to g4 and it's only one man who is going to perish and it is the man playing with the white pieces kel keeps sacrificing queen f5 what a classy move you take the queen black's knight takes the white queen that is what we call a desperado sacrifice and when the dust settles all of a sudden there is a fork black has three pieces white would remain with two cal resigns this one was over in a flash it was bad for a moment it was very dangerous for a moment but he needed to make a significant investment in order to get to magnus and here what c had to do is just play it slowly he had to double his rooks build around this knight but it's really tough to do and ultimately it is complicated he tried to bulldoze magnus and yeah that's not that's not how we're going to get it done so a first opening win but waye w two magnus has nine rounds to cut a two and a half point gap that's really really really hard the only way to do that is to literally win every game you play all right so we're going to play a bozo indian this is actually called the bogo indian defense it's it's boo i don't know i but i like to call it the bozo indian defense because i because boo is like the best word ever all right call your friend a bozo all right in any case we have bishop to b4 check the bogo indian being played by prague and prague beat magnus so prague already beat magnus once in this tournament magnus plays knight d2 a3 takes takes we have d5 we have b3 bishop b7 bishop b2 right bishop b2 and very simple simple very very normal game very everything calm right a6 and here prague for some reason gives up the bishop for the night he does that to damage magnus's pawns but are are you sure about this clearly prague thinks he knows something about the position that we don't quite understand magnus castles he doesn't even play rook to g1 and it's bishops versus knights so prague pushes back the bishops he's looking to take one of the bishops prag has had incredible success against magnus in this tournament he is playing very well and now we have queens and mop versus queens and knights who's going to win i got to tell you probably the guy that has a two and a half minute time advantage in a blitz game queen c7 g6 now a4 uhoh uhoh uhoh it's like letting a guy get into his zone he's getting into his groove takes and now look at this bishop c4 now the queen has to go somewhere but the queen can't really go anywhere because this is hanging and if you go over there i have queen d8 queen e7 so he plays knight d5 queen c8 check black's position is spinning out of control he's stuck he has 8 seconds he goes here but queen a6 and the problem is if you trade the queens i have what's called an outside pass pawn it's the worst pawn to half like for the defending side because you you got to it's really really difficult to defend it knight b6 and magnus just does exactly what he does best picks up a couple of pawns bishop to b5 a5 and his king is safe and the knight is getting pushed back and the knight is stuck it can't move anywhere the pawn is going to promote queen e8 is a threat prague resigns that's two up two down for magnus carlson and i spoiled a little bit cuz he kept winning literally every single game he played but it was unreal the way he was getting it done now here's a game with the black pieces against nobec abdus satarov who is a world rapid champion nock is also the player that magnus constantly cites as the future of chess among others among some of the indian talents nock is the su second youngest ever player to win a world chess championship all right this one is a whatever the heck this is i mean this is like an early e5 he doesn't let noc play d4 so now we get into a slow and and and and maneuvering game this is a symmetrical english where both guys have moved their c and e pawns two squares so the corresponding squares on d5 d4 are going to be up for grabs it's going to be a big maneuvering battle and now look at this look at magnus he allows the pawn to go to h5 not only that he lets the freaking pawn go to h6 alpha zero style computer ass style he's like come get some come get some bishop f6 d3 both guys moving their queens out of the way of the pin we have a trade knight e2 and now knight h2 looking to target the bishop very close but but how's magnus going to break through he's not possible how's he going to do it f4 right takes pawn takes okay give a check so what king d1 he's safe a5 trying to anchor the knight nbe tries to kick out the bishop oo uhoh now the reason you couldn't do that on the last move by the way you couldn't play bishop f2 is because i would have stopped you and then i would have moved my knight and then i would have gotten your bishop but the second that you do it this way with knight f3 it's like you tied your shoes together and now the bishop is going to live there and that's all magnus needs he plants the bishop on that e3 square and now castles noc tries to trade the queens but now black is arriving and it's really really difficult to defend your position knight goes back to c1 magnus grabs the pawn on h6 the pawn that noahc had put there so long ago to take space away from the black position knight back to c6 and also today magnus was playing with faster so he has just sort of been a little bit slow and then ultimately gets himself into a situation like he said yesterday he's bad with low time on the clock but 53 versus 7 very winnable unless norb defends like a genius rook h1 magnus causing him headaches and problems all over the board rook to f8s now but but but nock fighting oh my goodness knight takes g6 here was apparently nearly back to equality but it was very very tough to spot and ultimately king a2 is played and i i guess nock just resigned cuz he was going to lose lo this pawn and then i i mean i don't know maybe he ran out of time there but that's where the game ends i mean ultimately magnus is up a pawn he's going to win a second pawn maybe not right away but because he would lose the pawn on g6 but in this position yeah king a2 was played and and and that's the end of the game so maybe nock lost on time maybe he resigned i don't know but three up three down three up three down you know who else was winning games we we we have a london from gukesh gukesh struggled by the way we're going to talk about that later he ended up in last place out of the eight players or 10 10 players he ended up in in in a last place spot despite having a lot of interesting games and it's going to be interesting to see how gukesh improves his rappid and blitz because the narrative around gukesh is going to be very similar to the narrative that was around fabiano carana when he was rising to the ultra elite classical status and contending for the world championship is can he play the fast time controls not only because you have to be a universally strong player you also need rapid and blitz to break the tie in the event of a tie in the classical portion of the world of the world ch championship okay so night2 h5 knight h2 bishop e2 queen e2 i think this korean c brew that i had is hitting different ed ed also i deadlifted 255 pounds today so if anybody's been watching any of my socials last week i did 245 three times today i did 255 despite being sleepy and having bad allergies but you didn't ask about that but you clicked on this video so you're kind of subjected to whatever i want to talk about 92 e396 and we ye was like a was like a surgeon he was like a composer i mean it wey manages his time really well he's creative offensively and defensively and he's so tough to beat like he controls the game look at look at the position on the 15th move okay both guys at 2 minutes relatively balan game and then by like the 25th move it's 112 to 27 and we is completely winning and he just puts pressure so well knight it look at the knight bro it went d5 f4 d3 and ges is down to less than 10 seconds his position is crumbling he loses a key pawn in his position rook e4 knight g4 and it's just a matter of time you take on e3 white has lost the defender over here and while magnus is going on that streak way's [laughter] like until they got p and i think the winner of this game is going to win the event i mean that's just what's that's right i i i don't think that's a crazy thing to say so magnus early on plays a ready very principled approach by wey we have e4 takes takes queen d1 rook d1 by the way small side note i'm going to look this up really quickly i don't think magnus and wei have played much because we is just i mean he's not not in chess all that often so these guys have played including all three games of this event they have played 12 games against each other ever so before this event they had played nine times that's it which is on which is crazy now magnus has a good score against wei he does but a lot of those games were pre-2020 they they played a lot in in random events but it was like 2016 2017 like we in 2016 like 17 years old right so they haven't played a whole lot right now magnus plays this game very slowly very positionally knight to d2 and wee castles queen side and from the opening stage it was it was black who might have been able to to argue that he has a slightly better position all right a5 wei played aggressively magnus played bishop b3 a4 knight bd2 and look at this we is just better with black now if wei played energetically here with the move f5 he might have capitalized on that f5 trying to destabilize the white center if pawn takes f5 black takes like this maybe starts fighting over here controls the center but we he played a little bit slow he played bishop f8 and sensing this hesitancy magnus completely took over and suddenly that's it dominance will be reasserted white is just going to march down that queen side get the win that's going to be that but wei starts fighting back protect his king creates counterplay suddenly magnus's advantage is nearly gone what it was like plus one yeah well apparently in this position after b49 d7 i i it's not even clear to me what magnus did incorrectly this doubling move apparently was wrong which seems very natural the computer just kind of wants white to hang out and not commit his rooks well i mean i don't know about that nobody really has any you know access to this to the computers in the games but rook a3 and suddenly wey it is is is fine he's protecting all the important squares of his position d five and but he is down a minute he's down a minute and now you're entering that final phase of the game that endurance phase that endgame sharpness face rook a8 look at this rook d8 defending himself magnus keeps asking questions but wei is right there playing defense kicks magnus's knight out of the position it's an equal rook and night end game king e2 and now we is up on the clock he's up on the clock and he plays f5 now f5 is a mistake but magnus doesn't punish it and now h4 bro this man we straight up playing for a win with black what he takes rook h8 magnus takes and plays rook g1 and now there's a very tense moment because you want to take this pawn if you're wei but how are you going to make it happen because rook g5 and now if you play king e6 i save the pawn and then i save my rook and i'm a pawn up i mean it's very ugly but it's apparently the right way to play but we should have gone for that instead he takes on h4 and now look at this rook f5 you can't take and i think this move move startled wei because he took on h3 here comes magnus and then right here just a disastrous mistake magnus creating seventh rank problems for black knight f6 knight e4 and here rook f6 rook rook g6 and they repeated once and i mean naturally you go king e7 here but then i guess rook d5 rook b5 so rook d6 rook h2 and my friends it took some 60 moves but magnus crashes through picks up a fork here because wy blunders he only had 5 seconds remaining and magnus wins another game and we had a set back here he had a setback against duda so magnus is roaring he is still going for first place this game is out of the way now it just comes down to will these guys beat everybody else vincent kimer versus magnus carlson we have a double fan ketto system by magnus d5 this is the critical approach trying to take space away magnus zips his into the c5 square c6 d6 very solid position but how on earth is magness going to play this for a win it's not winnable i mean you just white plays rook e one right no okay we trade queen d7 looking to go to b7 at some point there it is queen f3 look at vincent vincent's like yo i know magnus has to win i'm just not going to let him i'm going to trade his pieces he can't look at how's magnus going to win this position you can't win knight knight4 okay i can take it by the way i i will take it cu if he takes on b2 i'm to take on c5 and this a dead draw dead draw i mean white will just play like rook d3 rook d1 vibe right can't win this can't lose this not possible knight1 okay a4 solid whoa magnus gives up the bishop for the night he says vincent let's play a rook end game bud let's play a rook end game you know i like those i'mma plant that rook right in your face is what i'm going to do and in this position it's actually already kind of challenging to figure out how to even deal with this pressure rook b4 creates a lot of different problems and this is going to happen in black's king is going to get in pressure is building look at that move d5 giving up a pawn to play c4 and cb3 and now vincent has to be extremely accurate the pawn has arrived on b3 like a hydraulic press pushing those rooks back to the back rank rook c8 check rook c5 and magna starts cleaning up and suddenly he's up upon suddenly vincent has 4 seconds versus 40 takes takes it's four on four but black has an outside passer the engine might be able to hold this with perfect play but that guy sitting playing with the white pieces is not an engine his name is vincent kimer he's a very talented young man and now we just have chaos a3 takes takes rook a1 and now the black king marches to help hides behind the pawn rook b rook b1 rook b3 that's it i've made it my pawn's going to promote white is not fast enough with his own pawns rook e6 he sacrifices the rook he tries to create counterplay but it's simply too little too late by the way he didn't push because he would have just been stopped if anybody's confused rook f3 rook h3 rook g3 and that's it it's going to be checkmate if anybody's confused again i give you check i go rook h7 g5 vincent gets close but unfortunately not close enough and magnus carlson has won yet another game but despite losing to magnus we ye would not go away playing against anish giri he plays a yama london c5 e3 take takes called it jobava london but funnier to call it my way knight c6 all right we have a very solid game by black putting his pawns on the light squares wei also going a bit positional all right nice and solid game both guys just trading i mean anish giri didn't have a particularly great event but still always very dangerous this game was no exception he had a fantastic position and then here he went for a tactic knight takes a4 so if rook takes a4 black would play queen d4 and you can't take the queen because you lose your queen if you take the rook you lose like this so knight takes a4 played but b3 oh my that's a fork you take here whoa so queen is hanging rook is hanging knight is hanging what do you take take the rook of course but now the knight is hanging so the knight's got to go here but now i play rook a3 knight's got to get out i take on d5 and now we ye has to like he's got to pick up some of the stuff here it's all kind of loose kind of hanging rook b5 and he's he's doing a nice job here putting some practical pressure and he goes to this end game this is just winning because black has two major weaknesses and rook and these three versus knight and these three is winnable it's it's it's very winnable and there's a lot of problems for black on the defensive side so now it's just a matter of cleaning up so he's going to get to the other pawn as well it's it's you cannot stop it i mean you can you can yet there we go so he's going to get to the other pawn and now it's a question of is this a win or is this a draw and i think very quickly we find out the constant threat of the sacrifice you threatening to sacrifice the rook for the knight and win a pawn because three versus two is in a pawn end game king d5 rook a3 and you just dominate the knight you dominate the knight you constantly threaten to capture it you walk your king in and there we go that is the configuration you're looking for black is forced to make a pawn move and now black is just out of moves black is out of moves king to e6 rook a8 black can't move a thing you can take take you still can't move here rook g8 that's the major idea then i'll pick up the pawn on f5 and once i pick up this pawn you will lose the rest of your pieces is because on the next move you have to lose a knight then you will lose everything we was not done magnus was winning literally every single game he was playing that's not an understatement that's not an overstatement i whatever i under over back to magnus so we's winning also magnus is winning every game there's no way i mean somebody's got to stop this man right so we play c4 d4 magnus plays a reverse beno gambit this is this is the level that we're at again beno gambit with black c4 c5 5 d5 b5 black sacrifices the bna pawn in a queen's pawn opening to open up the bna lines very interesting opening very imbalanced i don't particularly love it because i don't like to just play down a pawn especially when i'm black but look at this same thing b4 same exact concept cb a3 boom same type of position so basically magnus is playing black but he's playing white so because he's playing white he's getting a tempo up in the opening because he's he goes first okay d3 e5 now he's going to wait a little bit he finally takes back we're not going to get a we are going to get a queen trade wow magnus is just down a clean pawn but he's just going to put pressure that's what he's going to do and basically he's going to say you can't guard me he's going to do this going to win a game and he's going to do the too small motion in basketball you know like when you he's too small you just can't guard me god can you imagine that would be so funny rook b1 rook b8 brings his knight a6 f4 look at that poking at the center looking to take and to take we have knight g4 by duda we have pawn takes on e5 dislodging a defender of the black center knight f3 and just slowly b5 okay very very important moment but look at duda duda's down four three minutes on the clock a very important moment here for magnus not to overcommit he's got to create practical chances for his opponent to mess up not to do something good rook d6 e3 defending maybe c5 is an idea you can't take because you're pin black plays rook c8 take take knight b5 okay now now magnus has a pawn up so the opening worked perfectly he won the pawn he's doing great now how is he going to win this position rook b3 friendly reminder if you go to an endgame like let's say knight d4 and you go to an end game you might lose this like this is a very losable end game because it's four versus three i have a pass pawn i'm going to slowly go up the board so black has to trade the right way one pair of rooks is fine and duda is defending duda is very good he is very good he's a very good defender he's very creative as well very practical all of that is to say he has 9 seconds on the clock and just like the the many men before him he might do something goofy you can't take that pawn by the way you cannot take this pawn because of rook to d7 and then knight e5 is a four can you win so king c6 he doesn't he doesn't blunder that bishop b6 rook a6 but again you can only do so much when you have no time rook d6 he wins this and now all duda has to do is win this pawn now with the rook he can trade it rook and knight versus rook is a draw but magnus is not going to let him trade it look at this and now he's going to put the rook on g6 well well d dude is still looking for a away rook here uhoh knight d4 knight e2 i mean that pawn is just that literally that is the only thing surviving in the position king e3 uhoh uhoh oh magnus gave away the pawn no he didn't because this but rook h3 but this is a counter check king f5 oh that's it dud has made it rook a5 rook a4 why didn't he take why didn't he take now rook f for check and rook and now you lose duda hallucinated he just hallucinated he he just forgot i mean he must have thought he was getting mated or something he must have thought something duda just he just went back to f5 and now magnus wins because you stop the pawn from being taken and you win black's pawn and now you win oh my goodness an unbelievable turn of fortune there no but i mean this is what happens i mean in chess you you earn your luck you know sometimes this is what happens there's just nothing anybody can do to stop you and guess what absolutely nobody could do anything to stop we i mean at this point they were just taking all his pieces like two games ago anish giri played in a way with black and and and and wei played in a away with white we like you just trade the pieces like you just you just go for a position where white can't do anything and here is no different they're just trying to play simple chess they're not trying to calculate that much they're playing a queen's gambit decline very solid arjun's like with less pieces on the board i can't lose all right can't do anything goofy just not going to let we get active i know we likes to be active i'm just not going to let him be active all right we meanwhile is just stalling by stalling he gets himself into a slightly worse position and now arjun has to pounce okay because you got to play the best move so he pounces right takes takes targets the pawn on c6 but now we we's got an open and active board to operate with we have bishop d5 queen d5 you lose the pawn on b4 but suddenly counterplay is being created knight f6 oh but this is just fantastic from arjun what arjun sacrificed his queen and i think what arjin had calculated was rook a8 rook c8 rook c8 rook c8 king h7 knight g5 king h6 knight f7 check and wherever the king goes rook h8 is made so take check here here king h7 knight g5 king h6 knight f7 king h7 rook h8 is mate and if king h5 rook h8 is made all of that makes perfect sense all of that makes absolutely perfect sense except knight f7 is protected by the i mean this is it this is what we're dealing with late in a blitz tournament you just deal with the fact that these gentlemen make the same mistakes we do and guess what yesterday there was m ones not being spotted and now now argent has to go here and maybe he thought he thought he was still winning maybe he thought he saw all of this one was like oh i'm i'm still winning because how does he stop rook h8 yeah he stops it in a very heartbreaking way the craziest thing is like knight h7 rook h8 i mean how do you how do you survive this position you survive this position because there is a sequence of moves that wins and the sequence of moves that wins if you play rook h8 is queen to e3 i take the pawn with a check and i win the knight and then there's no mate i mean it looks like it's it's game over black is completely mated no nothing can be done check whoops check if this or this you take and then you take if this you force the queen king up take and then you take and suddenly arjent realized he was losing this is just a losing end game and that's it i think they played a little bit more but arjent resigns unbelievable this was the position arjent was a clean pawn up up a minute and a half he gave up the rook the queen for the rook he thought this was mate he surrounded the black king and he completely didn't realize there's queen e3 and the pawn is w no matter what and so is the knight but it all came down to the efforts of one heroic man and that man the norwegian man magnus carlson gukesh magnus gukesh had an interesting game against magnus in the rapid i think he lost yesterday to him in the blitz bishop g7 bishop h3 and gukesh takes with this pawn this is all this is always what the computer recommends to use the g file and then f4 f5 i've played like this with white i don't understand it at all we get a closed position and now magnus you know has to win and the craziest part is in this position gukesh sacrifices the rook rook to g6 this isn't an unbelievable move rook g6 because after bishop after here here king e7 f5 is that's it i mean you resign this is made it's not made but you lose all your pieces so rook g6 oh my god both magnus and wei are under tremendous pressure now knight c4 by magnus you you notice he spends one minute i mean rook g6 is is is a lights out kind of a move a lights out kind of move black actually has to sack the knight back to enable the capture and then put his king on d7 actually this looks relatively reasonable but magnus plays knight c4 and now ges is winning if he takes the knight which is so counterintuitive because what about the rook yeah you just go back it's not going anywhere rook g8 rook g1 queen g2 all these moves so gukesh goes here tries to hang the bishop because if you hang the bishop rook e6 is a perpetual check by the way here here queen g5 not a perpetual but at least the king is surviving so knight e5 oh my god look at this knight e5 and now magnus finds this key idea gach plays rook back to g3 magnus very quickly trades all the pieces and says well at least now i can't lose rook f1 bishop to d6 all of magnus's pawns are on the light squares we're not going to count the a7 pawn king b1 he castles long king to b7 protects everything and gkas just doesn't have enough pawn mobility he's trying to do something with the pawns he's trying to do something with the pawns as you can see but he's down too many of them rook c8 oh but suddenly maybe some question marks queen e3 pawn takes on a4 but it's too little too late magnus cleans up three pawns up and he's going to get to the white king both pawns are running look at that move the king slides out of the way to enable the movement of the rook i mean what a back and forth game magnus and the blitz tournament by drawing his last two rounds that's all he needed even with the heroic efforts of oneway ye the final standings are 26 points for magnus 25 and a half for wei and then the rest of the field fantastic job by the way from yan kristov duda who was like the second or he was the third oldest player in the field literally by the way it's kind of nuts if you think about it it's like magnus and the niche magnus is the only player in this field above the age of 30 dinosaur anish is 29 also old af and then kel is maybe young 20s duda i think might be like 27 28 and we is 24 and then the rest of the players are like 20 and under okay i mean a couple of interesting story lines first of all wei is a is a chess god i don't know what's going on with this man but looks like he's reemerged we was the youngest 2700 ever so y'all may not know this about him because you don't you've only followed the chess world recently he reemerged recently he now won a classical tournament and he's gotten second in rapid and blitz he would have won this event if magnus carlson like rolled his ankle on the way to the playing hall i mean i it's unfathomable magnus himself started slow won the event 10 in a row just completely unbelievable unrivaled greatness seven tournament wins in a row 10 wins in a row in this tournament he does it for the content i mean magnus i would i would give you a hug all right if you were right here for the content because you start the tournament you're like in third or fourth and then you're losing games and you say you suck and then you win 10 games in a row i mean it's beautiful you give me the the bad and the good we is unbelievable prague just cooking everybody argent cooking everybody nck had a mid-tier result gues in last now you could hit the panic button here or you could say he has a lot on his shoulders to worry about it's classical chess it doesn't matter that he's not doing well in rapid and blitz you got to be a universal player though i really think that to be an ultra elite top five player especially once magnus starts leaving which doesn't seem like it's going to happen anytime soon you got to be good at all the formats so we'll see how gesh continues to improve he's obviously a monster in classical but he has room to grow in rapid and blitz hasn't played in a lot of these online events but we see we'll see if he will that concludes the first grand chest tour tournament of the year the story line is wee but magnus came in right at the end and stole the spotlight 10 straight wins seven tournaments one in a row get out of here here
