[music] all right guys welcome back to tech in turn today i want to talk about a question i get all the time and i recently got earlier today which is what projects should i put on my resume this question doesn't have a perfect answer i'm actually going to give you some real project ideas but before i get into that i just want to tell you guys a little bit about what's coming tech with tim coming on the show we've got jossie linde these are both guys that have been on the show on the podcast version we're gonna be uploading those to the youtube channel so stay tuned for that we've got another episode of the podcast that's being ported over about how my friend kailash automated his application process for finding an internship and he has some it's not just automating linkedin or something that you've heard a million other people do he's got this really really good idea that got him an internship so i think it's really fantastic for you guys to tune in and listen to those don't forget also there's a resume critique giveaway going on right now i am actually going to do tutorials on some of these ones that got me internships so those are going to be uploaded to this channel coming really soon too those include like automating instagram tasks and a smart mirror there's some really cool stuff in there you kind of have to tailor what projects you want on your resume for what job you want so if you don't know what job you want don't worry about it just go listen to all my suggestions if you want to do front end for example you're going to want to tune into my smart mirror tutorial where we actually build a whole front end and react basically you want to do projects that are in the fields that you want to to have a job i mean it's it's pretty straightforward right so let me just kind of go through it like the very first application i wrote that i put on my resume it was just an app which was like a meme generator which i made at kent hack enough which is a hackathon at kent state it's just this really basic application that like randomizes text and puts an image under the text it was pretty basic so the next one i want to talk about i made in second year it was this currency converter so i followed a tutorial on how to build a weather app in android studio but instead of building the weather app i built a currency converter so i took something a lot of other people had on their resume and i tweaked it just slightly and that made me stand out just a little bit more so here here comes the application that that kind of i think made me stand out a little bit it's called spotify to youtube mp3 now when i was a poor student i didn't have money to buy spotify so i did previously have a spotify account and i decided to cancel it but i was like i don't know what i'm gonna do with all this music now like i had these playlists i don't want to lose all of that so i wrote this application called spotify to youtube mp3 which is a set of python scripts that you log into spotify with and then it downloads all of your music on youtube now the the good thing about this one is it it's unique no one else has done it it's it's solving a real world problem and this actually got the attention of some recruiters now one recruiter was not very happy because he's like oh you're stealing i mean i guess he's right but you know i was a student at the time what are you gonna do so i've actually rewritten these scripts because i want to do a tutorial on this this one i i'm going to show you guys exactly how to build it the reason i want to do this is because we're going to use the spotify api we're going to go through the whole oauth flow to actually log into spotify and retrieve spotify user playlist so i think it's it's going to be really cool next thing i worked on i went to hack harvard i worked on this project with a few friends called tldl we called it which was an application that basically it's an app on your phone and well i did a lot of apps an app on your phone and you turn it on you sit in your lecture and it listens to your professor speak and it translates the notes and then it uploads them for you so that was another really cool application that one is that is less controversial i'll put my github in the description and you will be able to find all of these applications instagram scripts is another one i made i made this instagram script that would log on to instagram for you and look at your followers and then look at who you follow and then tell you who doesn't follow you back you know it actually ended up being quite a fun experience use selenium use python it was really fun so i also updated these scripts and i've already shot and filmed a whole tutorial series on how to do that and that is coming out in a few in two weeks maybe it's it's coming out really soon stay tuned for it but last but not least this is my biggest project this is the one that got the most attention and this is the one that got me into microsoft and that is a smart mirror now you might google or youtube smart mirror how to build a smart mirror and what you'll find is everybody does the same thing there's this application called magic mirror i think and they get one of these bad boys they get a raspberry pi and they you know they just download some software on here and then they run it and then they build some really cool frame and then they throw it up on their wall and that's not what i did i wrote the entire gui for it and then i also wrote a virtual assistant to go with it so you could speak to it i rewrote the scripts recently and it used to be in python the whole gui and i rewrote it to be react so you're gonna get some really like up-to-date you know useful programming frameworks like react on your resume and you're also gonna have a really cool project like nobody builds smart mirrors using code if you guys are getting value or if you like some of these ideas please comment tell me which ones you want to see so last but not least there's a project well there's a few projects actually i've built since i started working at microsoft the very first one is elite party which you've probably heard about and i'm also going to help people build features and lead party elite party is basically competitive programming on leak code it's a chrome extension you can actually find a video of me facing off against an uber engineer in the channel it's live right now i mean it's got 130 active users go ahead and give it a try and another thing i built was using machine learning a convolutional neural network that would determine if a picture was of a fully stocked shelf or if it was a picture of an empty shelf so that was kind of fun and it had some implications i figured that you know social medias could ask people not to post pictures that were fear inducing if if it wasn't true like if the whole food the whole store actually had food and they were just posting it at the toilet paper but other than that you know it wasn't actually used so the basically the best project i ever built was leap party which you can actually go try right now and the smart mirror which we're gonna build together now like i said don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you enjoy this content and let me know what you guys want to build like there's tons of stuff that's not on this list that i know you guys want to try different technologies maybe you want to get more low-level for all i know and i'd be more than happy to to whip up a tutorial to to help you get your next internship so thank you guys so much for for joining me today i really hope you have a good day and i'll see in the next video
