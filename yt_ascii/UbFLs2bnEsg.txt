what is up everyone welcome to the first part in a four-part series that i'm super excited about you've been asking me for bts content for a long time now and it's been honestly really tough because on all my professional jobs i sign a bunch of non-disclosure agreements and there is just no way they'd let me share behind the scenes on youtube so i pretty much realized that if i wanted to show you all that stuff i'd need to create the shoots myself and luckily the guys at art of documentary agreed to jump in and help make that happen but more on that in a second what that means though is that i'm finally going to be able to bring you guys out into the field into the real world and show you how i make documentaries this story is about jose who's a former soldier who lost both legs and his right arm in an ied blast in afghanistan and is now on a mission to become an elite adaptive surfer in this first video we're going to talk all things pre-production and the five steps i generally follow before i actually start shooting we'll get into how i choose ideas to develop the pitching process how to put together a deck coming up with a budget building out a team and some scripting at the end i'll run through the gear i'm taking on this one so for any packing nerds out there like me stick around for that pre-production is just as important as the actual shoot itself which means there's a ton of stuff to go over in this video so let's not waste any time and get right into it thank you okay so for me personally it took a long time to accept how important pre-production was in the filmmaking process i come from a photojournalism background where it's a lot easier for you to just go out and find a story in the world as you shoot so when i was starting out in video i pretty much did the same thing it took me a couple failed projects to realize that i needed to invest way more time before the shoot on things like scripting and planning if i wanted to come out with a real story instead of just a bunch of b-roll in an interview nowadays like on this project for example i'm spending a lot more time planning than actually shooting and we're going to get into why in this video this shoot is going to be just four days but by the time we fly out i will have spent more than a month planning it but before i get too deep into this stuff let me give you a little bit of background information on what this project is and how it started so i've known for a long time like i said that the only way i could really make the kind of bts content you guys have been asking for was to make my own projects that are totally independent from the big name production companies i normally work for that might sound pretty simple but when you travel as much as i do and also put out weekly youtube content finding the time to track down stories and look for funding for independent documentaries can be pretty tough then just before christmas i met up with the guys who run the art of documentary film school which i'm sure most of you have probably heard of through mark bones youtube channel and they told me they were looking for pitches for short docs because starting very soon they're actually going to be funding projects on top of teaching filmmaking super cool stuff and it got me thinking quick side note here i actually first got into contact with aod because i reviewed their course on this channel almost a year ago and they reached out afterwards to point me towards a few resources that i missed in my review i just made that video because i couldn't find anything about the course out there when i was thinking of signing up and i honestly never really expected that they would see it so that's a pretty cool example of how this youtube channel is opening up new connections so if you're thinking about starting a youtube channel of your own there are all sorts of things that can come from it that you might not expect so just go for it anyways in that video i said that i thought aod was the best online option out there for people getting into documentary filmmaking and i went through the course myself even though i have like 12 years of experience i was really surprised with the quality of the advice and even though like i said i'm pretty far into my filmmaking journey i still found a ton of value in it and as far as i know there's nothing else quite like it out there and let me just get this out of the way this video is not sponsored aod is funding the hard travel and production cost of this shoot but i am not getting paid a hundred percent of the money is being used on production and i'm actually reasonably sure i'm gonna lose money on this when it's all said and done so i'm just putting this out there this isn't about selling aod it's about deciding whether or not a year later i still think it's the best online documentary film school out there i signed up for the course and paid with my own money so i was recommending it way before i ever knew these guys if you decide you want to try the course out and want a discount there is a link in the description and i will get a little kickback from it in a couple of months or so but in no way am i being told what to say here okay i had to get that out of the way before i start getting comments about ftc regulations and being a corporate chill no no no no no no no no anyways when aod said they were looking for projects to fund i made a mental note to keep my ears open then a month or so later when i was hanging out with friends in mexico i found something and that's a great segue into the first step of this whole process that we're going to talk about how do you actually find ideas for documentaries and how do you know if they're any good so i was sitting in mexico talking to my friend eros in the desert who's a really talented photojournalist and filmmaker and he actually did all the onset photography for that insane battle scene in the revenant and a bunch of other movies and he started telling me about one of his personal photo projects like i said it's about jose a soldier who stepped on an ied in afghanistan and was in a pretty bad state of depression but when he started surfing through a rehab program he found something positive to focus on and motivate him to keep on living right away i was interested but we were on vacation and so i just made a quick note in my phone to ask more about it later and that's something i'd highly suggest doing yourselves set up a document in apple notes or carry a piece of paper or whatever but said up some sort of system to capture ideas when you first have them otherwise they'll slip away now even with just this basic information it sounded like a really cool idea but i wasn't sure if there was actually a story there or if jose was just a cool guy even though there was a lot of drama in his past i know from painful past experiences that that doesn't necessarily equal a story for there to be a story our character actually needs to want something and so a day later i sat down with eros and asked some more questions it turned out that jose did want a couple things first he wanted to help heal and inspire others who were struggling by being a positive role model of how much is possible even when things go horribly wrong also he wanted to compete in adaptive surfing at a high level and was training super hard to make that goal possible with those two things i knew there was a story not just a topic and that's going to be the first step in any pre-production process define your story we designed this whole shoot to be as small and as simple as possible because i wanted to show you what you can do with just a few friends in some basic gear as long as you have access and a good story we're not traveling to a crazy international location and i'm bringing very minimal gear just to make sure that you don't think you need like 50 pelican cases to make something good aod stresses this a bunch in module one and it's actually one of the reasons why i respect the course so much and i also know it's really annoying when people say gear doesn't matter while they're sitting on tons of professional equipment but it really is true the important part isn't having a bunch of gear or an fx9 it's having a story to tell which means a character who wants something or is going through a moment of change with that said we did get some really cool support from a few brands namely sackler tripod who's letting us test out their active tripod head system anton bauer batteries and zeppon sliders who all sent me a bunch of cool stuff to use on that one i'm really excited to use sackler's newest tripod head if you've listened to this channel you know i call the flow tech tripod the best documentary tripod out there and apparently this new head design makes that even better i also mentioned in my monthly newsletter last month sign up in the description below if you're interested in that that some of my v-mount batteries were starting to fail me and so anton bauer which which is the industry standard at the higher levels reached out and offered me to try out some of their titan batteries that i didn't have any power issues i'm not going to lie getting some cool gear is a really nice side effect of having this youtube channel and as a gear junkie myself i have to say it's pretty cool this stuff is going to make life easier so thanks to sackler anton bauer and zippon but it's not like we had to have this stuff to make the project work but let's get back to the story at this point it doesn't really matter yet if you don't know exactly how your story will end with the foundations of a character who wants something you can start building because of our budget and our time is limited we're not going to be able to follow jose for a year as he travels all over the place international competitions in hawaii or wherever and that's okay you don't have to have some incredible final moments secured before you start though it definitely doesn't hurt and if anyone else wants to give us some extra funding i'd for sure expand this project please would be nice but without someone who's undergrowing a change of some sort it's going to be really hard to create a narrative at this stage you also need to make sure you have the access to the subject matter because the best story idea in the world means nothing if people won't let you film it for this story eros already had an established relationship with jose so for me it was pretty easy but if you're planning to shoot total strangers i wouldn't go any further in this process until you've confirmed they're on board once you know you have a story and permission to shoot it the next thing i do is make a deck a deck is basically just a formal statement of your vision where you outline your story the characters the visual style it helps both to force you to clarify your ideas to yourself but also to have something physical to show others so you can apply for funding or try to sell your film and just because i knew the guys at aod it doesn't mean i got to skip this step i still had to put together a deck so everyone could be sure we were on track to tell a real story so let's pop over to the computer quickly and i'll show you the deck i made i actually used one of the templates from the iod toolkit which are super easy and look great so if you want to make a fast deck without any design skills they're pretty handy decks can get way more complicated than this depending on who you're pitching to and the type of project you're making but i think these are the main points you want to cover before you start i'd also recommend gathering as much media as you can in one central folder because you're going to need a lot of pictures for this i'm lucky because eros has already been shooting stills on this story for a long time so i have tons to choose from but i also use stock photos from various royalty-free sites wherever you're getting your reference visuals though get a bunch of them together in a folder before you start okay so we start out with this title page which is nothing fancy just a strong photo and a clear title we might end up changing this title or maybe not but the idea with the title page is to immediately trigger the curiosity of whoever you're showing it to after the title page are the director statements now this project has two directors so there's a statement for each of us here you want to give some of your background and why you are the right person to make this project if you want to know what i wrote i'll link to a downloadable copy of this deck so you can go through it and read it but the important thing to stress like i said is why you are the right person to make this then after the director statements we get into the really important stuff which is the character or characters we only have one main character in this story so you might need to do more if you have multiple mains but the next three pages are all about jose we start with a short catchy couple of paragraphs that give the big perspective on who he is and why this story is worth telling then on the next page we get a little deeper into his desires and goals and what the journey will look like finally we get into the back story which are the details that round out the profile and show me who he is as a person and where he came from after that we spend a couple of slides talking about the visual style of the film and this part for me is pretty easy as a dp i'm using a mix of eros's pictures and stock here but the point is to tell people what this story is going to look like if you've never done this before it might be hard to find the language to describe what you're talking about and that's why good stills are really important here our plan was to try and shoot all the water related stuff and uplifting moments in nice light and then the more difficult tough moments in harsh daylight spoiler alert though are underwater housing fell through at the last minute and we had to find a workaround solution like a day before but i left all this stuff in so you can see what our vision was even if it didn't work out exactly how we wanted now jose's life isn't easy and we wanted to visually contrast the freedom he has on the water with the limited mobility he deals with on land like i said this didn't plan out exactly like we wanted it to but the deck is where you present your vision of the project as you want it to be it's not a time to be super practical again this is a mix of eros's work and screen grabs so it doesn't all have to be original content i pulled most of this stock from upsplash so you could start there if you're trying to build your own deck lastly there's a quick rundown on the audience which is super important it's where you stayed who you think would be interested in watching this thing this is important for outlets and broadcasters to understand because if the audience doesn't line up with theirs there's not much point in funding it like mtv probably doesn't want to fund a project about sports and vice versa espn is probably not looking for music documentaries so knowing your audience makes it huge difference in who you pitch it to then after that there's a quick wrap up where i try and remind the reader why this is such a cool story and why they should be interested and then i end it with a thank you page which is really just like the title page and it's supposed to leave a strong visual impact to make this deck even better i'd add a rough script or outline of the scenes as well and if you end up grabbing the aod templates they come built in with those sections but i haven't had the time to really get into that yet so i cut them out for now okay so once you have a deck you need to figure out what this is all going to cost and i'm talking about a budget here because the first question out of anyone who's going to fund a project is going to be how much we're intentionally designing this shoe to use minimal gear and crew to replicate the small teams that i imagine a lot of you are working in so this budget doesn't have too many items on it it's just a basic spreadsheet and you can see i've got flights crew the gear we need hotels food and gas and these are my best guess as to what all these things are going to cost our mac minimum budget for everything here is five thousand dollars which can go really fast if you're traveling and you can basically see how we're splitting that up here i know five thousand dollars is a lot of money but for a six day international shoot it's pretty minimal the flights and hotels are the vast majority of our overheads and as you can see here it's more than half of our total cost if this was a local story we could have shot for way way longer on this money so try to find things close to home if you're working with small budgets we're using pretty much only gear that we already own and the grip equipment that's too bulky to travel with we're borrowing from a friend of eros is in california for crew neither eros and i are getting paid but we are paying richard who's going to shoot the bts and work as a general camera system for the whole shoot as you can see we've got a budget of a thousand dollars set aside for richard and i'm just going to go ahead and say it a thousand dollars for four shoot days and two travel days is not a great rate but rich is a current aod member and he's taking this job more because he likes the story and wants to be involved in the shoot rather than as a big payday so if you're watching we really appreciate it and while i'm on the subject that's also something i'd say that is pretty unique about aod the community i never really took advantage of the aod community when i was going through the course if i'm being honest but i'm learning now that it's really come into its own it seems super active especially on their facebook page and most people need to go to film school for that kind of network i'm not crazy active on facebook but i see all sorts of posts of people getting feedback on their projects and making professional connections and i know richard just went to one of the meetups and there were like 16 people there so it's definitely more than just pre-recorded videos and i'd say that's a major benefit of the course that i really respect the next step in this process would probably be to hire a crew but because it's just me rich and arrows here i'm not going to spend much time on it scripting though i'm definitely not going to skip because scripting is one of the most overlooked parts of documentary filmmaking in my opinion scripting might sound like a weird word to use when talking about docs because how are you supposed to script real life but a doc script is more like an outline of your vision of how how things could be rather than the way they will have to be i've made an entire video about this before but a documentary script doesn't have to be complicated it just needs to outline how the moments you're going to film are going to advance your story you might put a bit of a script in the deck but the main purpose of a script for a documentary is for you to understand the shoot almost more than anyone else how do you think you might open the film what scenes are going to create tension as we move through the story arc what's a possible resolution scene how are we going to talk about the past the more you can visualize what a possible edit might look like the easier it's going to be to know if you're getting what you need while you're shooting because at the end of the day no matter how carefully you plan some scenes just won't work and others are going to work better than you ever expected your script isn't a playbook that you have to follow it's a guide to make sure you know you're getting the moments that matter if you make the game time decision to replace one of those beats with something else at least you know you have that story point covered but if you have no plan and just start hosing everything down with the camera you might find you come out with 10 scenes that are all about the same thing i see this most often with stories about people overcoming really difficult challenges in their life like this story about jose for example people get so fixated on how hard things are they just shoot dramatic moments but when they start editing they realize they have nothing that shows the character's backstory or maybe that they have no real ending a script will make all of that easier even if the finished product looks nothing like how you planned documentary scripting is specially for a short doesn't have to be complicated i mean there's nothing complicated about the script that i'm working with as you can see it's just some bullet points in a google doc that eros and i can both edit all you're looking for is a basic framework to make sure that you can plan your shoot and come back with the basic elements to tell a story when you start working with networks and bigger budgets those scripts will get more and more detailed because everyone is going to want to know more or less exactly what you plan to come back with but for small things and for when you're just starting out don't make your life harder than it needs to be in commercials and movies where things are more tightly controlled taking the time to make a mood board or even a storyboard of how you envision your shot is a great idea and often even essential but since i have no idea what these locations or moments will look like i found that going deep into storyboards just isn't worth the time investing for documentaries at least for me if you disagree with this let me know how you do it in the comments for this project my script is as simple as it gets most good stories basically follow the same structure there's a main character who wants something and then goes through a series of challenges before either getting or not getting what they want so before i get on the plane i want to make sure that i have moments that will set up who jose is and what he wants and then illustrate the challenges he's facing on his way to that and then how i plan to show how he either makes it or doesn't make it or changes as a person in the pursuit of that goal the first step was to have a few conversations with eros and jose and try and get as many different ideas for potential scenes as possible and then just using apple notes in a google doc i organized them roughly into categories so introducing our character setting up the goal outlining the challenge he's going to face the moments that are going to show progress and then some sort of resolution like i said we're not going to be able to follow jose for years and so our moments and resolutions need to be simple things that we can get in a few days that speak to his larger story the point here especially for independent shorts with tiny budgets isn't to plot out your whole story from start to finish it's just to make sure that you're going to come back with the elements of a story and not just a bunch of b-roll you can check out the video i made about scripting if you want more but don't be scared of this step it can be as simple as just a few bullet points like i did here but the difference between that and just starting to shoot with the intention of piecing it together later in the edit is huge so keep it simple to start but don't skip this step alright once you've got a story access a deck a script and a budget the next thing to do is one of the most important in my opinion and that's to connect with your collaborators i'm using the word collaborators instead of subjects here because in my opinion that's what they are the best story in the world doesn't mean anything if the people in your film won't share it with you by now assuming you have the access lined up you've probably already had some sort of contact with your characters but i'd highly suggest that you deepen that relationship and let them in on your filmmaking aims there can be an instinct to keep everything to yourself because maybe you're worried they won't like the idea or that it'll seem invasive but in my experience you're much better off being open in the long run this doesn't apply if you're going after openly hostile subjects like a michael moore movie or super size me or something but assuming you plan on your characters taking part willingly you're gonna need their help to pull this off i made the mistake of not doing this when i was shooting my feature film this summer and because i didn't there was a major misunderstanding behind the scenes about what this project was all about a lot of the people got the wrong impression and were a little standoffish with me in the beginning and it took weeks even months to bring some of them back around some of them never got over it and didn't want to be on camera period which of course is their right but i can't help but feel like if i'd reached out a little sooner all of it could have been avoided this time i made sure not to make the mistake and got on the phone with jose as soon as possible to make sure we were on the same wavelength this step is all about bringing them into the fold sharing your ideas with them and seeing how they respond there's an entire chapter in module 2 of aod called your character is your co-director that does a great job of going deeper into this relationship and it's something they nailed in the course that i think doesn't get talked about nearly enough if your characters hate your scene ideas or the direction you're taking your story you won't get much out of them and it's better to find out during the pre-production phase than on shoot day most normal people are understandably worried about how they'll come across on camera so the more they trust in your vision the better the story will be now there is a fine line between collaborating and making puff pieces so you want to make sure that you're not just making stuff that makes people look unnaturally good but in my experience you're so much better off with a collaborator than a subject so set up a call when your rough script is done tell them what you're thinking the kinds of scenes you want to film and then listen to their feedback they might even give you ideas here that you never thought about and end up in your script and then ultimately improving the final film so don't skip out on this and that's basically it for the computer side of pre-production in a second i'll get into packing and the gear and show you what i'm bringing with me on this shoot so the sitting at the desk phase of this series is pretty much over if this was a big netflix shoot or something there would be tons of zoom meetings and paperwork and all of this would be so much more complicated but for a small project being made with a low budget and just a bunch of friends as crew if you do these five things you'll be in a good spot for when the cameras start rolling and then all of this planning goes out the window anyways because as important as pre-pro is it's just a rough plan and very rarely does the finished film come out exactly like how you thought it would but even though it's probably all going to change in the end having these plans in places more about getting your own thoughts organized than anything else so that when things get chaotic you have a vision to fall back on so don't just show up and start rolling even if that's the fun part and i promise you're going to be way happier when you get into the edit that's it for this video now it's time to head to the airport and head off to san diego to actually shoot this thing the next two videos in this series are going to go deep into the bts process of how we actually make these things everything from the gear we're using to handling people how we'll set up our interviews managing media and just the general fun of being out in the world making stuff so see you back here next week for part two and if you want to join the next cohort of aod yourself use the link in the description and save yourself some cash see ya okay so we're at the camera bench getting ready for the trip despite how clean it looks in a lot of youtube videos behind me it's usually a total mess i just push all the stuff down to one end when it's time to record youtube videos but this sort of mess is much closer to my natural state anyways i realized a couple days ago as i was packing that one of my v-mounts isn't taking a charge for this shoot i wanted to make sure we have no issues at all with power because we can only take a limited number of batteries just because we're not taking very much gear in general and we have to fly so i know from my work as a dp on professional jobs that most rental houses and hollywood movies and most of the top end people use anton bowers so i reached out to the guys at anton bauer and asked them if they could help us out for this shoot and they were nice enough to send me four of their titan 90s which are the largest ones that can still be legally carried on a plane these are super nicely designed batteries you can just feel their their premium so i'm only mentioning this one because i wanted to acknowledge how nice anton bauer was to send me these but two i'm about to put velcro tape on the backs of all these batteries right where their logo is so i just wanted to say thank you to anton bauer before i cover up their branding completely i just really need to stick lav mics on the back here so sorry guys but thank you for the batteries really appreciate it so the one other like fun new thing that we're bringing on this trip is this sackler active 12 fluid video head every professional tripod i've ever used pretty much works the same way you reach underneath and you screw in this thing and that's just how they've all worked since the start of my career and probably for like a hundred years or something sackler engineers have pretty much reinvented the way a tripod works and what that means is that instead of reaching under the tripod and fiddling with the knob every time you want to level it now you just have to pull up this lever so it might not seem like a big deal but the amount of times that you reach under there and level a tripod in a day having those extra six inches to a foot that you don't have to reach down is going to be great for your back it's just also going to make you work so much faster and because there's no big knob hanging off the bottom of the tripod anymore you can actually get the flow tech legs down almost completely flush with the ground you've heard me probably talk about the flow tech legs before pretty much reinvented the tripod as we know it and i think it's the best documentary tripod out there i'm really excited to get this thing down to san diego and actually try it and i'll let you know exactly how it works from the beach okay so it's the night before we're flying out i'm just going over one final check of the gear i'm going to show you guys what we're bringing this whole shoot is sort of designed to not be super gear intensive like i know especially for people who are just starting out or people who are you know interested in taking a course like aod you probably don't have access to 15 pelican cases worth of stuff so when we shot this i wanted to make sure we weren't bring bringing a ton of gear now i know i have like an fx9 and a bunch of high-end stuff but you don't need that to make a project like this and that's the whole point don't feel like you need to have this level of stuff we're bringing two checked bags total full of gear and two carry-ons i'll go through each of them show you what i've got let's get right into it we'll start with the bags that come on the plane so the bag that you bring on the plane with you is normally the one that i like to put all of the essentials for running the camera so no matter what happens whether your bags get lost or there's any sort of mix up you'll always have the bare essentials you need with you you might be a little inconvenient you might not have all of the equipment you want but at least you can get the camera up and running so when you land the shoot's not ruined so in this bag this is like an old manfrotto backpack that's very uncomfortable to wear but it's a great shape for carrying this stuff on a plane we have the fx9 and the fx3 which are going to be our a and b cams on this we've got four back four v-mount batteries for the fx9 because you can't check those you have to carry them on we've got basic grip handle for the fx9 the monitor attachments the top handle and the microphone shock mount underneath the camera we have the top mic which is a sennheiser mk416 sun shade for the monitor then we have the monitor itself which is the small hd 502 ultra bright this thing's super old i think this is five or six years old still using the same one so get a good monitor it'll last you forever and then also the stock monitor from sony you never know weird settings get changed in cameras and you and and you can lose a video feed to a monitor so bringing the stock handle so you can get into the menus if you have monitor problems is really really important i've had so many experiences where whatever reason for whatever reason your monitor goes black and if you don't have the stock monitor with you there's no way you're doing anything with the camera it's pretty much bricked so make sure you bring the stock monitor and then lastly the top handle for the fx3 for the audio so that comes on the plane i also bring this which is one of the icu so the internal storage units for an f-stop backpack i just take it out of the backpack and fill it full of the lenses so this is pretty simple we've got a 24 millimeter prime 50 millimeter prime sigma heart lenses both of them step up adapters on them so they're both 82 millimeters so that we can use the same filters on both lenses the sony 16 to 35 this will probably be used mostly for the water stuff because it's super wide and has great autofocus and then the fuji mk cinema zooms the' to 55 and the 50 to 135 these are for the fx9 only and these are probably my main workhorse lenses and cover me for most situations memory cards and this is sort of all the accessories for the fx9 so batteries memory cards little tripod plates the charger will go in there just to keep it all together so between in this pouch and that backpack which i'll carry both on we can get a and b cam up and running and powered and shooting even if we lose everything else this is the more unpleasant bag this is just a big patagonia duffel bag in here is hip belt and pouches these are great for carrying extra gear and also for a stable shooting platform on your hip this is the active tripod head i am not the most careful person with my gear i'm just putting it in this nice pouch because it's brand new and i can't bear the thought of just throwing it loose in this duffel bag yet but we're going to get there pretty soon for now though i'll keep it in here and pretend like i am kind to my gear we have the tripod flow tech 100 legs which i talk about all the time i love these things you'll see them in the field a bunch wrapped up in the yoga mat just to save some space this mountain smith waste bag is my go bag so like sunglasses snacks you know whatever all the stuff you want to have on you spare batteries that stuff will go in here and that can either be worn as like a shoulder bag or around my waist which again i can swing over to the side and gives me like a nice stable shooting platform so these things are great the f-stop backpack which later all the lenses will go into lastly we have this guy which is a new piece of gear this is a slider from a company called z pawn or zeppen i'm not quite sure how to pronounce it one of the weird things about this youtube channel as i get approached to talk about gear all the time and a lot of it i just have to say no to because i can't see how i'm going to work it into my regular working life you know and i actually don't really use sliders that much so originally when they asked if i wanted to try this thing i was a little bit hesitant because once you accept it then you kind of the deal is you're kind of supposed to talk about it but then this shoot with jose came up and i had an idea for a very specific shot that needed a slider so i told the company yeah send it through i'll give it a try it just so happens i actually really need a slider and this is it i haven't used it in the field before i've tested it out and gotten some first impressions and they're pretty favorable to be honest like the build quality is way better than i was expecting i think this is about 650 dollars so it's not exactly a cheap slider but it's also on the low end of professional stuff which can be you know thousands of dollars easily for something like a rhino slider or a syrup or something first impressions is that this thing is actually pretty solid and i think it's going to do the job well one complaint right out of the box is that these little legs don't fold up and down so there's only so much height adjusting you can do on rough terrain so i can see that being a problem but you know for for 650 dollars it seems like a pretty well made slider so excited to actually use it for for the shot that we were envisioning and i'm glad i took it so more on that later lastly is this roller bag from think tank i've had this thing forever it's just basically a super reinforced suitcase with camera dividers bulletproof i love this thing in here is everything else so this pouch is all gear all power management stuff so my laptop cables we've got a smaller mic for the fx3 the wind cover for the fx9 mic xlr cable tool pouch hard drives battery chargers in there a gorillapod here we have all of our audio so one two three four microphones tentacles time code boxes and lav mics all go in here plus a pair of headphones you always need to monitor the audio so just clip them on the audio bag so they're always around the matte box this is a polar pro base camp that i have abused heavily a dica pack this is a documentary about surfing if you don't know what these things are it's basically this fancy ziploc bag that you can put cameras in and are theoretically waterproof so we're going to use this to get some of the moody reflective non-action shots that we need what else we have the head for the slider comes in this really nice case carrying case but it's all just a lot really bulky so just take it out and put it in this little porter brace pouch save some space an aperture mc light these things are great for faking light sources like tvs and camera flashes and cop cars campfires stuff like that never a bad idea to have a tiny light and some gaff tape gaff tape and paper tape so this is sort of our admin pouch our electrics our data management everything is going in here that's everything we're bringing all that's left to do tonight is to shove some clothes in there and go to sleep early looks like a lot of little bits and pieces and i don't work off of a checklist i just i'm not that kind of a person i've also been doing this for so long that i just sort of visualize ahead of time when i'm going to shoot and i kind of just instinctually know what i'm going to need so i will actually spend a couple of days just sort of standing and looking at all of the gear thinking about how i'm going to be shooting and then just slowly you know 10 minutes here 10 minutes there add stuff and add stuff until i have everything that i need and i almost never forget anything important so if you guys want me to make a checklist that you can work off of i'm happy to do that let me know in the comments and i'll figure out a way to make something like that and make it free so that's it for packing we've got a really early flight in the morning so i'm going to try and get some rest just going to throw this stuff by the door for now and i'll see you all tomorrow foreign [music]
