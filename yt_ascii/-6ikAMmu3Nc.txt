[music] hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what i'm gonna do is talk to you about my favorite sub line text packages in settings now these make a huge difference they make it much more productive and easier to work in sub line text and they also do keep the minimalistic feel and look of the editor so i've made sure that when i've installed these for myself that i haven't gotten rid of that and i haven't completely changed sub line and you notice here that my editor may look a little bit different than yours but it's nothing major and in fact the features are very subtle but they do make a big difference now the features i'm gonna show you how to add here our first sidebar enhancement so this is a big one by default sub line text does not actually let you have all of these options and move files around delete and rename them from the editor so that means you need to leave the editor and then come back with this you never have to leave the editor when you're actually dealing with the files now the next feature is the ability to actually run code right in the editor so to hit control b that's the shortcut you can change that if you want and actually see your code script and run it down here and then you can hit escape and you can get out of that window then we also have the look of the editors you can see this nice font in my opinion this is my favorite font that i've ever used in any code editor i'll show you how we can change the theme and setting so it looks like this and then finally there's a few other packages which we'll get to you one of them is this github package and you can see that in the top left hand corner of my screen it showing a little green icon here and if you hover over it tells us the status of this are related to the github repository so let's go ahead and get started and i'll show you how we can add all of these features so the first thing i'm going to show you is how to change the theme and color of the editor so to do that we're gonna go to preferences and then from here we can select color scheme or theme so color scheme will actually allow us to pick between a few different color presets here we can see the one that i'm using is minh okay or something like that but you can click on 16 and you can change it to that or you can go ahead and change it to whatever else you want so i'll leave mine on that but that's how you change the color theme now what we can also do is change the theme now the theme doesn't change very much but you'll notice that if i go to adaptive that actually makes the entire thing dark which some of you may prefer but if i'm gonna go back to what i was using before which was this default now in terms of font if you want to modify the size of the font this is fairly easy to do you need to hold ctrl on your keyboard and then from there you can use the mouse wheel to scroll in or scroll out and zoom in and zoom out or you can use the plus or minus keys on your keyboard the next thing i'm going to show you how to do is actually build your code and execute it from the sub line text window so being able to do something like this now notice i have a while loop here and i've actually added a custom key extension or key bind here that allows me to break out of this so by default one of the issues with running code in sub line is that you actually can't stop manually executing the code you could hit escape to exit out of this window but it doesn't stop executing the python process in this case because i'm using python so we need a way to actually stop the build so we have to add in that key bind which we'll show you how to do in just a second so the first thing i'm gonna want to do to run your code is see if you can already do this so try hitting control b and if you hit controlled b on your keyboard and it brings up a window like this then you know that you're good to go and you can actually run your code all you have to do is add the extension now for some reason that's not working what you can do is go to tools build system and you can select either automatic or the specific language that you actually want to build with so in this case i've selected python but i was leaving it on automatic and because this is a dot p extension it will actually run my default python interpreter for me now the only issue with this is this is gonna use your default build system for any interpreter any compiler whatever the default one would be on your system that's what's up line text will run so in my case i have many python interpreters and i want to run a specific one so to do that i won't show you precisely but you have to do something with a new build system so if you have a specific compiler interpreter you want to run click on new build system and from here there's some specific syntax you can put in here to dictate where you actually want to look for the compiler or the interpreter now i'm not gonna be showing you how to do this here just because this is a very specific based on what language you're using what compiler would interpreter and all about and where that is but there is a way by clicking on new build system that you can select exactly which interpreter can pie you want to run and i'll leave it to you guys to look that up i just figured i'd mention that okay so now that we have the build system up and working what we need to do is actually add that keyboard shortcut to stop running the code so to do that we're gonna go to preferences keybindings and then we simply need to add the code that i have on the right-hand side of my screen to what yours will likely be an empty list so this is actually where you can define your own key bindings and you can change any of the key bindings from the default bindings so in this case you can see these are all of the defaults and any key bind that you add here will override any default key binds so you want to make sure that the key binds you're adding here is does not already exist unless you don't care about overriding that an example for me was i originally made this ctrl c to cancel the build and when i did that my copy command stopped working in sublime text so what you really want to do is add something like ctrl alt c and that will be the command that we use to exit the build so i'll leave this in the description for you to copy in feel free to change the key bind to what you'd like but notice if we go keys we put a list of the keys that we need to press for the shortcut what the command is which in this case is cancel build so you can add your own and again yours will likely be an empty list just add this dictionary inside of here and we'll be good to go so now that we have that i can actually go ahead and hit save so ctrl s and then quit we may need to restart sublime text but then we'll be able to use that shortcut to cancel a build which in my case was control all to see what i'm going to show you now is how we can actually install some add-ins slash packages to sublime text now that's what it's going to allow us to do these sidebar enhancements to get this github kind of stuff going on and i'm going to show you the exact packages that i use and you can pick which ones you want to install so the first thing we need to do when we're going to be dealing with packages is we actually need to install something called package control now package control is just our way and sub-line text of dealing with packages and managing them now fortunately this is really easy to install we don't actually have to leave sub-line text to do this what we have to do is go to tools and there actually might be a tool inside of tools here for you that says install package control if you see that hit it but if for some reason you're not seeing that go-to command palette start typing in all packaged and you should see a tool that says install package control now this is gonna look different on my screen than yours because i already have this installed but it should pop up here so if you start typing install package you should see something that says install package control select that and then hit enter now if that doesn't work for you i've actually had this link up on the right hand side of my screen and this shows you how to do the manual installation of package control so i'll put that link in the description and you guys can follow along with that if for some reason you couldn't install it with this kind of shortcut way so once we have that and we have package control installed we can start using it now you might need to reboot your sub your sub line for this to work so just restart the window but once you've done that there's two ways that you can access package control the first way is by going to tools command palette and then starting to type package control like that and you'll see that a bunch of different options pop up the other way is to go to preferences and then hit package control which is kind of a default tool here now you notice all that does for you is just boot up a command palette with package control already typed in but here you'll be able to see a bunch of the different options for packages so i actually clicked on i think browse packages or search packages and you can see there's a whole different list of packages that you can use now i personally don't really use any of these i'll show you the ones that i'm using but just note that you can go to package control dot io and you can look at the top packages and very easily install them with the method i'm about to show you so go to preferences go back to package control and then all we're gonna do is at least for me i'm gonna go to list packages and i'll show you the ones that i have so here you can see i only have a few i haven't gone crazy as i mentioned i've get get gutter kite subline package control which you'll have sidebar enhancements and then unicode character highlighter and unicode character insert now i don't remember actually installing these two unicode ones so i feel like they might come by default but i know that a hundred percent i understood sidebar enhancements and all of these other plugins so kites up line get gutter and get now get what this allows you to do is it just adds some features to do with github so in this case it shows us these icons here it'll tell us if something is staged if it's been committed if there's a new like pull request or something that can do and i believe it gives us some options in this sidebar here so open git repository and some settings like that now what get gutter does will actually show you any commits and history in the gutter of this thing so if you look at where the line numbers are the thing to the left is called the gutter and you'll actually see some like little logos icons and stuff here now unfortunately since this isn't like a proper git repository i can't show you but it will you will notice this if you have a git repository it will show you some meaningful things in the gutter here kite subline you can't actually install kite directly from the package control i believe but what this is is a kind of enhanced autocomplete for python if you want to check them out it's called kite comm you install it from their website and will automatically add it to sublime text and then finally there's sidebar enhancements so those are the ones that i use to install them is really easy you've probably already figured it out you go to package control you click on install package it will bring up this big list of packages just state to start typing the ones that you want and then you can pick that one so in this case since i already have these plugins installed you won't i won't be able to see them here but if you start typing sidebar enhancements that will pop up you can install that and i promise you you won't regret installing that package now the other ones that i had were to do with github there's a bunch of different github plugins you can try so get tools get ignore get moji and there's you know i think thousands of plugins for subline text so hopefully this kind of opens up the possibilities for you and now you know how to customize your sub line text editor so with that being said that's pretty much all the settings and features i wanted to show you i know this was an extremely detailed video and i didn't show you a ton of things but hopefully at least i introduced you to some new concepts and sub line text and now you know how to customize your editor and make it your own and the last trick i'll leave you off with is to go into full-screen mode like i'm in right now you press the f11 key that's if you're on windows if i believe on if you're a mac you'll have to hit function f 11 or something like that but that's useful i use that all the time and with that being said i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make sure you leave a like subscribe to the channel and i will see you in another youtube video
