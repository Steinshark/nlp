[music] this is exciting just a few days before the launch of the oneplus 60 i was invited to hq in china and in this video i've got four really cool things i'm allowed to show you from inside i even managed to go hands-on or with the 60 itself and in this video i'm gonna reveal everything about i can so let's get stuck in the first thing you'll see when you enter hq is this massive collection of oneplus products that you've probably never heard of everything from satchels to eco-friendly reusable cans there was a pretty neat-looking polo shirt a full-scale mousepad i mean this this stuff is either super limited edition only available in some markets or never actually ended up on sale so really cool to see it all together in one place as you might have guessed then i spent way too long browsing and kind of forgot why i was here in the first place they also have every one of their phones including the oneplus one in bamboo which i never had a chance to see before the oneplus 2 in carbon fiber and even the oneplus x it gets better because then i was taken to a secret room surrounded by frosted glass for a sneak peek at something i don't think many people have seen before i wasn't quite allowed to film the inside of the room but it was filled with oneplus prototypes different finishes that never quite saw the light of day so far at least after a bit of convincing though i did manage to take a few of my favorite finishes outside to get a bit of footage and to be honest some of them look incredible you've got one dark purple to black twilight option but also silver and red and my personal favorite this super glossy sunset gradient version i could definitely see some of these making it to future devices third the office base and pretty much every person in that building was working full throttle on the 60 planning the launch designing the website and testing for bugs kind of exciting to see it in person i managed to find the one-of-a-kind oneplus youtube silver play button and the pretty odd food cupboard which has some options that let's just say personally i'd pass on there's a games room which has a swinging chair a bear the size of me and musical instruments because i'm told there is actually a oneplus and and this is one of the places they practice in the view from outside the office was pretty cool too you can see a good part of shenzhen and if you look into the distance even a bit of hong kong now the last area that i got a chance to see was meeting room at number one the main event a room where a lot of important decisions are made for the company so of course we didn't use it for a little cherries in competition obviously oh yeah and this was where i got to go hands-on with the oneplus 60 so i was lucky enough to have a one-on-one interview with sahay who is head of european communications and asked him a few questions about the 60 while holding the phone itself and getting to play with it it is right here in my hand in this video but i just can't read the full details yet but what i can tell you is his answers which i paraphrased to the following the first question i asked him was what was the vision with this phone what problem were one-plus trying to solve - which sahib had three main points with the 60 the company has tried to build a firm that is number one intuitive number two even faster than before and number three one that is as stress-free as possible so i kind of followed this up by asking why make a tea device why create two flagship phones per year so he responded by saying that oneplus doesn't commit to doing a tea device they only do it if they think they can improve the experience enough and just the speed that tech is moving right now really helps the company because new components are constantly being developed while existing tech can become more affordable so then my last question to him was this the one plus six is already one of the fastest phones on the planet almost everything feels pretty instantaneous so where do you go from there how do you want up this further the focus of oneplus has always been how can we make the experience the best to work in real-life situations for example some cameras have hundreds of settings but all you want is the perfect picture so we've worked on that or you're a big gaming fan so we've made some tweaks to make your life better even our screen unlock we've tuned it to be the best in the industry and last but not least i actually then got to take the 60 out for a bit of a test run fitted with this super secretive case to stop anyone seeing the body of the device safe to say i'm excited to see your reactions to it and i'm prepping a very special different kind of video to drop as soon as the phone is officially announced so it would be amazing if you could smash that subscribe button and don't forget to tune in to the launch livestream which is happening on the 29th of october that'll drop a link down below for you to take a look at thanks a lot for watching my name is aaron and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
