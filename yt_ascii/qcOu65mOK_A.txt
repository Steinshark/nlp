ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates tournament of 2024 the winner of this tournament plays for the world chess championship later this year this is round number 10 and this is a 14 round double round robin tournament both sides the open and the women's are very closely contested at the top and nobody has been able to break through yet yesterday couple of players suffered massive defeats and one of them was grandmaster hkar nakamura who fell to 0 and2 in the candidates against the indian super grandmas vided gujrati and so today would be a new day hikaru with the white pieces taking on niat basov the lowest rated player in the field looking to score a bounceback victory and he would be taking some risks another massive matchup yanomi and gesh both in first place done with the white pieces would he put the pressure on the youngster going to show you all of that and more in today's recap and also there was a massive drama and ali resa fu's father was kicked out of the playing hall and gave an interview live on air insane amounts of drama today all of which i will summarize for you here we go hiar with the white pieces yesterday suffering a loss when he played black today he opens with with e4 and something very crazy happens already on the first move as a boss of plays e5 he doesn't play a sicilian which he has played in this tournament instead he plays the petro you see a couple of days ago yanomi played e4 knight f3 against ab bosov and ab bosov played this and hikaru learned something from that game and sometimes when players come to these elite tournaments with an opening in mind they play that opening for the duration of the event and after knight e5 d6 knight f3 knight e4 which is the main line of the petro hikaru did not play d4 and he did not play knight c3 which are the two most popular moves you will remember he played this way against nepo hikaru does this knight f6 and then they play an exchange french this is exactly what yan pishi did against abasov why would hikaru force abasov into the same thing that he just had abas of clearly studied it because he prepared it for nepo and he analyzed it after the nepo game and so bishop d3 and abasa plays c5 again exactly what he did against nepo and in that game we had castles c4 bishop e2 and then nepo played this move b3 well he caru does things differently he doesn't retreat the bishop to e2 he plays c3 and the idea of c3 is to meet the move c4 with the move b bishop c2 and as you can see over here he has very bad things planned now actually yesterday there was a game v shali versus tandi which looked extremely similar to this game black goes bishop d6 both sides castle and as you can see white's got a pretty nice attack brewing over here something could happen black meanwhile is going to try to use the queen side space advantage it's a very provocative position and from the opening it was hikaru who enjoyed a time advantage and then b5 was played and b5 is not a move the computer likes the computer much prefers rookie 8 and in general a plan of g5 and trying to kick out white b5 allows white to play rook to e1 and knight to e5 just scoring a very confident position and now black has to play rook a6 this is kind of the idea you combine this offense with a defensive move defending the knight and also protecting the sixth rank and now karu just begins building his position again the engine wants black to play g5 abasov doesn't do it abasov down 20 minutes in the opening hikaru with a beautiful position all the moves flowing queen f3 he's got so many pieces in the attack a lot of pressure building black plays knight to e7 and now he caru should consider rook e to but even the move b3 is great b3 slows down the black position forcing abos of into a move like this and now he's got no attack at all he has no attack he doesn't have a pawn coming in the only thing aosf has in a distant distant world is this week pawn on c3 and maybe if hikaru falls asleep at the board the rook going down to b2 but in the meantime hikaru is going to continue to make preparatory moves he plays knight f1 another possibility he could play rook e3 but he plays knight f1 and abasa plays a3 again just kind of fighting for this it's all he has rook b1 hikaru takes the b file hikaru has abasov completely shut down but now abasov makes a mistake and this this is the first moment in the game the engine was screaming for karu to play knight e3 and plop the knight on the f5 square not the easiest move to play because you got to deal with moves like bishop 2 a5 but this seems to be the right idea rook a6 and then you just can come back breathe and begin reapplying pressure hikaru doesn't play knight e3 he plays knight g4 which is another way of doing things then he trades and has the pawn there and that pawn is probably going to go to g5 now aosa plays queen e8 a big mistake he gets out of the way of the pin but he re allows knight e3 with an attack on the d5 pawn hearu doesn't play that either he plays bishop g3 so two times hearu misses a chance he plays bishop to g3 and then on the previous move instead of playing knight e3 he plays knight g4 and i think karu is just kind of combining attacking chess with positional chess he just wants abasa to have long-term weaknesses right so he plays bishop to g3 abasa plays a good move bishop to a5 eyeing this pawn over here now knight e3 is a little bit less possible but hikaro gets right back to it snaps off the rook best move if black goes here queen e3 good luck defending your pawn in the long term so we have bishop b6 and in this position iaro plays rook b7 but it was rook to b8 which was even better however black could consider the queen sacrifice and like i said it's the two worst nightmares for white coming together and the engine thinks white is better here but i kind of get it i get it you know you you don't want to allow this like why would you do that apparently this is winning but it is very very scary nobody can fault hikaro for not doing that he plays rook b7 instead and abasov makes a mistake again he makes a final mistake a final mistake and finally hikaru is completely winning knight c8 comes back it does stop bishop to d6 which was sort of the idea but too many pieces are scattered and the move here is g5 and now black is lost and g5 is just like a trojan pawn trojan horse trojan you can't take it the idea is to play queen h5 so pawn takes queen h5 is game over this is mate g6 you just take not that you just take and this is mate and after queen h5 f5 you actually sack the rook and then you play bishop e5 and it's mate because queen h8 queen g g7 if rook f6 you win the queen you win all of black's pieces g5 is winning there is another line queen c6 rook b8 and queen h5 g5 is completely winning hikaru misses it and now iaru misses n's absolutely brilliant defensive move here n plays 97 and that loses a rook because white can play bishop h7 check king h7 rook f8 but niat was going to go here and then take this pawn which i told you about 20 moves ago and now black is not even worse black's not worse he has a pass pawn this is weak where's the mate you play queen c2 check i block black is the one playing for a win nanab basov has turned the whole thing around hikaru miss multiple chances but none bigger than the move g5 and in an absolutely unbelievable turn of events and i know some of you guys have been writing comments the other the guy yesterday said i was sad my boyfriend lost i mean imagine how brave you have to be to talk on the internet like that to somebody some of you need a reality check all right now i understand most of you who talk like that on the internet are children let's say child goes up to the mental age of like 25 but that's crazy like it it it it is really crazy that that hikaro lost yesterday and now today he misses his biggest chance of the event 97 he's pushed back he's down 20 minutes and very quickly the whole thing spins out of control as aos of completely takes over white has nothing absolutely nothing here rook e8 queen d2 the rook comes in a boss of dominating hikaro seven minutes to make six moves or he loses on time and hikaru gives a check brings the queen back and now just a very simple bishop c7 and you trade some pieces i'm not even i'm i'm not sure what could possibly happen but abasov plays queen e7 and now all of a sudden the queen is disconnected from the rook and suddenly black can't move that many pieces this bishop needed to be trayed if you go bishop c7 now rook b7 you can't take because you lose your queen on the previous move you couldn't do that because this was a check so karu proves his position and all of a sudden comes roaring back and black's rook is trapped what abaza has to sacrific the rook and hikaru immediately back into the game all he needed to do was start blitzing he reactivated all the neurons d4 he takes the king comes to safety and he brings back his pieces wins ab bos of z pawn and he is completely winning because of the pawn the pawn is going to promote because abasa doesn't have the artillery doesn't have the the the cavalry to defend oh my goodness what and hearu against all odds he once said like a couple of years ago he has to make it as dramatic as possible yeah he does it was over his candidates was finished he was going to lose two games in a row and one of them was going to be to the guy who is the lowest seed and is currently in last place and it went from bad to worst he missed every chance abos of completely dominated and then right when the tension was at its peak a bos have needed to go here and if he did that i have no idea how hikaro would have made a comeback here he is dominated he is one of the best defensive players in the world i don't know how he would have fought back from here but he wins the game that is insane what an insane turn of events abasov was so upset when he resigned but hikaru gets the win and yes look i have told you from the beginning i think hikaro is one of the favorites along with nepo and fabiano and yeah if hikaro wins the candidates it would be massive for chess so i yeah i have not said that i was not biased i'm not a sports channel that's supposed to stay unbiased i'm allowed to cheer for somebody so you can call him my boyfriend that's weird though and i would urge all of you to behave online the way you would in person which is advice none of you will take let's be serious but that's just a good way to live life now fiano carana versus al resa fua so the reason why this game matters is because ali reza is trying to make a comeback in the candidates and yesterday he had a great position against yanomi after he wasn't able to win against yan he went on twitter and he mentioned that the chief arbiter spoke to him during the game about his shoes and about his walking and him making noise because a player had complained and he talked about how unprofessional it was and you know the internet is not really a place for nuance like i'm sure you know any conversation on social media has zero nuance i actually put out a twitter poll today it's 50/50 50% of people support ali resa and 50% of people support the chief arbiter the chief arbiter then gave an interview yesterday to mike kleene chess journalist he is on site there with chess.com and he basically said look it is my job to protect the other players and ali reso was walking in a small area and his shoes were making a lot of noise chess bas india then put out a video and you could hear ali re's footsteps in the background now i have a lot of thoughts but to summarize i i mean what was the what was the chief arbiter supposed to do if a player complained ignore the player complaining just let ali resa stomp i don't know i mean to be honest i'm looking at the big picture why is there no carpet in the venue how are the organizers finding a venue where you can hear people's footsteps rattling and there is such a small playing area that you can hear their footsteps just bang bang i mean it's i don't know i have a lot of thoughts and today oliv ver fu's father showed up to the playing hall and apparently was kicked out and gave an interview he gave an interview like an hour into the event this was live also with my klein on the on the chess.com stream and he was saying that al rza was so upset yesterday with this event he had an incident with the organizers of the t steel tournament as well he was just fed up with chess and he's like i'm not sure i want to play chess anymore it's not just the shoes it's not just this incident and the reason ali rza's dad was was removed from the playing hall today as was summarized is because and this was by pavl tregubov who was an official and did also did an interview with my client long story short the players agreed before the tournament that spectators were allowed but not coaches and family not coaches and family okay for fair play reasons people are scared of cheating except for rounds 8 through 10 well today is round 10 and hamed resa showed up and they told told him you have 15 minutes and he said i don't want 15 minutes i want to stay and watch my son play and they said you have to leave and he said no i'm going to call the police and then they escorted him from the premises that's what that's what was said in stuff online i don't know how the chess world just keeps just making up new drama as we go i've seen a lot of people say a lot of mean things about oli russa on the internet and i always just go back to like he's 20 he's a super talent you kind of get a little bit of a leeway in my book especially in something like chess which is ultimately so cerebral but yeah it's a tough situation look getting interrupted while you're the game is going on because you're walking around it a noisy way i don't know like i said i don't think anybody's fully right or wrong in this case i think it's an unfortunate thing that happened yesterday and if it really caused them not to beat nepo or not find the best moves it really sucks anyway he has to play fabiano he has to play fabiano and not only does he have to play fabiano carana fabiano shows up and play something he's never played in his life this is the nidorf sicilian there are like 17 or' different possibilities that white can play in this position and he plays rook g1 which is the idea of which to go g4 ali resa thinks for a while plays h5 he spends 13 minutes this is a move that has been played and the idea of h5 is to force white to put the bishop on g5 and basically say well you can't play h6 and now fai plays this and officially we have a position that has never happened before at master level so fabi shows up anticipates that fuja would go h5 cuz he's done it before and now does this and now we've reached the position that has never happened and so ali razza now has to navigate a position he's never seen before against an uber prepared fabiano carana plays queen a5 down 25 minutes on the clock and plays like this knight c6 and here fabiano probably should take this knight and just kind of go for it just go straight down the middle and that is likely the best approach and he would protect his king with his bishop but he would also play for e5 instead of that he plays knight c6 so he doesn't navigate the opening perfectly he actually allows alza to give up his queen and then pin him and now something very funny happens where in this position alira just leaves the queen here so he doesn't take the queen so the queen is just indefinitely pinned to the king he actually loses the game immediately from the opening fabiano here has the winning move take take e5 black's options are to triple his own pawns which is positionally lost or take with the knight which allows f4 and now both knights hang can you believe it and now black is losing fabiano i mean fabiano's got to be out of swords like he really maybe by the way there was some drama here with with with with hamed resa i don't know maybe there was commotion but some h and and he doesn't find this he just doesn't see this idea at all he goes back to e2 and then ultimately the queen gets taken a little b and the queen just hangs for a little while and now fab has to just win this end game he has to play this position they trade some pieces in a moment here knight e7 knight e4 and knight f5 gf and basically fabby has to win this end game like this is the only way he's going to beat ali rza which is nuts i mean it it it's it's really really a shame bishop d3 if you're a fabiano fan rook f8 ala chooses to to defend his f pawn rather than his d pawn fbi does in fact take because he likes free pawns rook f6 a nice idea c5 and now ali resa should trade the rooks and then play rook d8 trying to get this pawn back white can take on f5 but taking on f5 hangs two pawns but for some reason here ali resa does not go for take take rook d8 clearly he didn't like something instead he plays h4 relying on takes and pushing the h pawn bobby shuts that down real quick and suddenly black doesn't have time if you play bishop g2 bishop f5 wins because i deflect the king from the rook rook e7 rook f7 rook g6 king f8 take take rook g2 oh my god so rook e5 and fabiano carana all of a sudden in the mess in the tactical complications might be winning the pawn is now promoting is defending himself bishop c4 rook d8 and now the king returns to its home square and fabby awakens in this game after missing a chance from the opening ali resa never gets this pawn back bishop d5 rook e7 check bishop b5 he wins a couple of pawns thus fabby this is a completely winning end game it's a completely winning end game bishop d7 king g1 the king is walking over here the pawn is under wraps and if the bishop goes here you just play b4 and black can't stop everything alza loses fabiano wins that's only fabi's second win of the tournament two wins in 10 games insane completely insane and we're only two games in and not all these games are going to be 10 minutes we're now going to speed through a couple but those were the two big story lines of the day one of the most insane games of the day was nurul salimova versus vali ra rames babu nuril a dark horse to actually win the event by sh has lost four straight this one an aggressive grunfeld and i'm just going to kind of show you vali is out of sorts in this game she was under attack from the opening early white had a lot of pressure in the center of the board was doing very very well and vali obtained a very difficult position early on and then had to suffer in this end game knight g5 king f2 it was imbalanced but nurul has been playing super well the entire event and this game was no different she applied pressure for a very long time look at her dewn it is now promoting and in the complications vali finds herself under tremendous pressure that is an understatement white plays rook d2 king h2 waits patiently makes it into the position and black just can't defend and now nurul is playing what we call cleanup this is clean up now she just plays king h3 it is over king c7 king g4 there's nothing vali can do beautiful game by nuru king e5 rook f3 but suddenly around here in a plus six position knight c5 the winning move was rook h8 and rook c8 the idea knight d8 and then e5 f3 and then you bring the rook back and now the pawn makes it through but what happens in this game is all of a sudden nurul is no longer winning both players in a massive time trouble king f7 rook h3 e6 it's a draw and now white is winning again vali has thrown it it it's it's going to be five losses in a row if this you can just take an e7 and that's it oh my goodness knight b7 but nul goes here and i think she blundered that she can't take the knight because rook h7 check so now she's just down a pawn and it's a draw you have to repeat the moves they make a draw here no they don't make a draw knight c5 and nuru loses she's losing because black wins the pawn like this and then puts the rook and guards both pawns oh my how can that happen that is absolutely insane that is absolutely insane and that is the way that black wins this game vash was on was almost at five losses in a row it was a it was a disaster it was a disaster but she manages to hold on she brings the king and in this position she simply went on to win her opponent's final pawn white sacrificed but it just it just wasn't enough this is always going to be a winning end game for black and let's just say something like this but this is just not you you can't make it through and vali wins and nurul almost got to five out of 10 i mean she was having an unbelievable game credit to vali for her fighting spirit she avoids the five game losing streak something is wrong with vali this tournament but in this game the fighting spirit paid off and in a crazy back and forth game she managed to win now prague versus vidit both guys still in the running for first place kukes and nepo are over there playing while fabby and alira are battling kikar and abos of are battling prague in this game goes for a spanish vid to berlin prag says no berlin bishop c5 they play an anti- berlin and get out of theory very very quickly as prague reroutes the knight over here grabs the bishop on d6 and then basically just plays f4 and this is the type of chess at classical level that exists where you try to push a microscopic advantage but the problem is these opposite colored bishops and they're beneficial in an attacking setting but if there's no attack you get a position that looks like this one guy has all his pawns on dark squares the other guy has all his pawns on light squares so vidit now gets a you know the the chief arbiter comes over to vidit gti hands him a little achievement award like you get on ch.com says congratulations for putting all your pawns on dark squares and vidit says thank you but please don't distract me from the game prag gets a little bit jealous here he definitely wants to put the pawn on h3 but he doesn't have enough time to do so so he just trades this pawn will stay on in the dark square and yeah none of that actually happened i just made that up because this was a very boring game and sometimes you just have to lie to your viewers kind of like you got to lie to your kids sometimes if something you know they created was not that interesting parents you would know and they made a drw so they both are still in the running five out of 10 for vidit five and a half for prague but yeah this tournament has been very slow crawling up the leaderboard not much to choose in this game not a particularly enterprising choice from prague i would say i think prague did not want to take massive risk in this game cu he didn't really he didn't really do too much in the opening he kind of he played his prep he played knight c4 and he definitely did not get anything maybe he could have played some more aggressively but that was all he was able to do now lno musuk on the women's side this one was a mainline open spanish where black takes and plays like this this was the game hikaro versus fabiano in the 2022 candidates there is so much cutting edge theory here but sometimes what happens when both players know a ton of theory is nothing happens at all the board absolutely explodes black gets a very very dangerous looking position but this this is all theory you might be shocked cb4 now there's a fork now you lose the bishop but you lose the knight on e5 as well and bishop b4 muzichuk has a 40-minute time advantage but as she has shown in this event sometimes she has unbelievable opening prep but unfortunately you just can't cash in and actually if anybody's playing to lose this end game it's white because black has three connected pawns so this pawn looks very strong but it's not and yeah i mean i would love to make this game more interesting but by the the 25th and 30th move a lot of pieces were traded i'm sure playing the game was definitely quite intense lago actually gave up her pawn completely to force this king back but in end games like this you you just can't beat a bishop and a pawn with a knight and two pawns bishop c8 king f5 and you cannot activate the black position here so they shuffled around for a little bit and ultimately they made a drw but lagno stays in the running but she hasn't won enough games lno she's been a little bit too solid she's made too many draws it sometimes happens t is winning the candidates so she shows up she plays a scotch which is something that she has not played she plays a very solid scotch with double knights and queen e2 and long castle very imbalanced but humpy just you know castles that same exact way she doesn't castle kingside making the game into some crazy complicated fight we have bishop c4 now i love t position from the opening but humpy was right there i mean even though she's having not you know an event that's probably below her standards she's right there she's ready to to fight and actually it was white who had to be really really precise in the opening king b1 losing a pawn by the way just straight up losing a pawn but due to the pressure she's able to play knight d4 and get the pawn back and when the dust settles just like in the game lagno versus muuk sometimes after 25 moves there's really nothing to choose between the players queen a6 check and rather than the game actually ending in a in a draw here they actually battled for a long time neither player particularly wanted to make a draw and in this position humpy could have played rook c2 and this might have lost white the game because you threaten mate and if you defend the mate then you just get mated so what you actually have to do on rook c2 is you have to take and then queen f5 and just set up a discovered attack which is really tough to play and now black is winning because of the plethora of threats so for example rook d3 rook e2 and king c3 queen c5 is made in a couple moves so in this position humpy could have sacrificed her rook the problem is she had 5 minutes so she went here and that allows queen d5 and a queen trade and even though you get this white defense and you're not going to win this game and it was imbalanced it was definitely complicated it was kind of all over the place but soon all the pawns started falling and the players did make a draw in a in a very nervy time trouble but my god i mean can you imagine if humpy in this position had sacrif oops in this position had played rook c2 oh my i she just wasn't think she just wasn't thinking that she was going to get a winning chance like that rook c2 was the only chance in this game and if tanong had lost like that that would have been nuts but they do ultimately trade down the pieces and make a draw tanong six and a half out of 10 she's doing very very well and the only person that can catch her is leting j and she's playing the other co-leader so two leaders are playing and these two leaders are playing we got we got the women's and the open both have five and a half out of nine both are playing for first place all right so in the first game gachina versus leting j l plays c6 by the way can i just why did le play knight f6 c6 and then d5 like why did she not just play d i don't know maybe it was to avoid this because then white doesn't have to play knight c3 cuz g can have played that in the game she actually played cd and gachina spent a lot of time here a lot of time and maybe that was like like gacha got to the opening down 10 minutes on move three and you know this is a very boring line like white can trade all the pieces but lay plays it very provocatively and says like come in like let's fight knight e5 takes takes and from the opening black has the bishop pair rook c1 f6 pushing back the bishop bishop e7 been taking some big provocation here king f7 look at this le is playing for a win with black queen c3 h5 trying to trap the white bishop white says no thank you black plays h4 bishop comes back and now here queen c7 she says you could take the pawn take the pawn on b2 cuz i'm playing bishop d6 i'm going for a checkmate rook e8 defense the computer evaluates this as permanently equal but rook c1 allowing your piece to be protected while the piece is attacking allows l to play king g6 and the king runs out and if bishop takes on e7 the rook can take and you can't take back because you lose this so suddenly le's up a pawn black is now playing for a win it is still extremely complicated white is still hunting on the queen side but lei gears up her pieces gets the rook for the rook and is now playing this end game for a win now her king is still in dire straits but he's trying to defend himself and here white had to play knight e6 instead she plays f3 and after queen f2 black is winning lei is about to win this game win this end game the knight is trapped oh my god the knight is trapped the knight is trapped on the edge of the board white has to sacrifice material to try to save the knight now why le didn't go here i i will never know she does not take on e4 you will notice the players get extra time on the 40th move the men and women are actually playing different time controls in case you haven't noticed that's not because fay hates men or hates women that was actually apparently voted on by the players so like the women wanted to play this time control now should we standardize it i kind of think so like there's this big debate in tennis five sets and three sets i don't understand why men and women don't play the same time control in chess now you could start talking why don't men and women just play in the same tournaments all the time that's a bigger project that i cannot get into right now but yeah time control yeah i don't know but anyway they play different time control and lay doesn't take on e4 instead she goes here and suddenly white is back in the game and we are getting into an end game where i'm not sure what's happening anymore le is still playing for a win but she messes it up and actually by the 55th and 57th move gachina is just holding insane an insane ter of events but it's really hard to draw this game and after king c2 b5 king b3 b4 you can't take cu i make the a pawn king a2 f5 knight e5 is losing here white had to take allow the advancement play f6 for f7 king g6 knight e5 king f6 and hold the end game with knight c6 if this knight b4 this and you stop the pawn she doesn't do that and after king f4 after a 5h hour battle lay's final pawn is the deciding factor unbelievable game unbelievable game the final pawn survives the knight can't stop it and in this position white resigned and ling j joined her co-leader and compatriot tandi with six and a half points leading the women's candidates with just four rounds to go and these bozos gash the youngest freaking candidate at ever 17 years old playing black against the guy that's won the last two candidates plays a spanish this man gu casat plays the freaking coio def look up the average rating of people that play this opening with black i know you don't quite understand the significance it is ridiculous to play the leader of the candidates the man that has played for the world chess championship twice now to play him like this this is such a provocative opening it's not as provocative as f5 and look this is this is not on the level of like people who painted or made music in the'th century and they made like a different chord and everybody was like throw them in prison they're a witch it's not like that but this is really crazy stuff and actually nepo doesn't play the most critical way he just plays in a way to get gcash out of prep and a few people have played like this with black demchenko there's a grandmaster he always plays bishop d6 bishop e7 is the move that ges chooses in this game and from the opening yan just had a little bit of a nagging advantage had this knight active strong queen attacking chances but yeah overall gcas just trapped the bishop on the edge of the board and the second that jan threatens to bring it back he will take it and you know yan made some aggressive moves but gkes defended throughout this game optically white looked better but not much happened and actually jann's content to play like this he did not attack fabiano with white he's not attacking gukesh with white he's content to attack the people and by the way did you see that c3 take take now he gets rid of the knight nothing happens the co-leaders unfortunately play a game that did not have a huge amount of spice but and they drew obviously but gash said in the interview like i wanted to just get a game like i i wanted an imbalanced position against nepo and he was like well nepo clearly had a strategy and his strategy was not to let me provoke him not to let me you know get into a fight with him and instead he kind of tamed the other man in first place and they made a draw very different than the battle of the co-leaders in the women's side very dramatic game there was over there these are your standings after 10 rounds of action tomorrow is a rest day here are your standings gukesh and nepo lead the candidates with six points prague five and a half fabiano caruana back with a win over fua also 5 and a half he car with 5 and a half after a crazy turn of events where he almost lost and that would have been the end of things and vidit still has five vid is still a point away oliv's chances are probably over i mean i hope he doesn't quit chess i hope that is resolved on the women's side there is still a one-point gap between third and fourth place and the leaders there's four rounds remaining something has to happen it's a six horse race from the on the men's side like it's it's crazy that's all i have for you today tomorrow i will probably upload some interview footage again and i will see you on the 17th get out of here
