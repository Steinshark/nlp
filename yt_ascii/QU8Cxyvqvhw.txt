god announces two things once he three things four things once he creates man he says man is to tend the garden that's his purpose why a garden it's a wall garden actually because that's what paradise means walled garden why a walled garden well a garden is a place of nature obviously and walls are a place of culture and a walled garden is a place of nature encapsulated in a manageable manner by the walls of culture that's what your backyard is it's a yard it's nature has walls the walls are culture the walls you could think of as physical as physical entities as objects but your your lawn has borders if you don't have a fence and your neighbors know where the borders are and where are the borders well they're in the imagination of your neighbors i i'm i'm dead serious about that the walls it's so funny cuz you'll see people in the border between canada in the united states say they'll get out and they'll step across the border it's like as if it's an object of it as if it's an entity that's there on the ground and people know that that's magic in some sense because the grass in canada is only slightly less healthy than the grass in the united states let's say it's easy to concretize that but the the idea of a walled off space in a communal society is a social agreement you have your domain your house your your garden your backyard that's enough cosmos for you to set right and perhaps if you're competent enough to do more you'll expand your garden so that you have more to tend but you start with a walled garden of some size and if you tend it properly then the promise is that as your competence grows so will your dominion man sent to tend the garden and to name everything that's in it this is adam what does it what does that mean well it's the logos again it's an re-representation of the creative spirit of god that makes itself manifest when time begins and when new things come into being our ability to name our ability to speak is that in in in the microcosmic manner that's what we're capable of doing that's what the patriarchal spirit does is name and order the world and god brings everything to adam to see what he'll name them and that's a reflection of the idea that we have a created order but man has a place in it and the place is to organize it and to put everything in its proper place and to assign it its identity and that's no different than the prioritization of attention that's part of the story name things in relationship to their function put things in place in relationship to their significance in the hierarchy of being orient them orient all named things up upward sequence constrain organize and order the manifestation of the patriarchal spirit what does god decide that's not good enough man lacks a helper man needs a helper woman's created as a consequence because the order that men produce because of their limitations is insufficient and something has to be introduced to speak for that which is not included that's the role of woman that's the biblical role of the woman it's the biological role of the mother you know this in your own household women bring the concerns of the marginalized to the center you can think about that politically it's used ful to think about it politically all established human orders exclude the exclusion causes pain the pain of exclusion requires a voice that's the voice of the eternal mother that's where genesis 1 ends genesis 2 begins contains the story of adam and eve it's another creation story it's commensurate with the first one it's a variation on a theme god creates adam out of matter earth and breath spirit why because that's what human beings are we're material creatures that are animated ana means spirit we what's the spirit the spirit is the living organizing principle of the material and human beings are an amalgam of the living organizing principle and the material and that's what's portrayed in the creation of adam the combination of matter and spirit the combination of ma material and conscious you could think about it that way if you're more secular-minded we're conscious m matter what's up with that no one understands that no materialist understands that we understand nothing about consciousness it's as mysterious now as it's been throughout our the entire course of our existence it's never been reduced to a material phenomena phenomenon we have no idea what that would even mean and if we did reduce it to the material all that would mean was that we inadvertently elevated the material we treat our each other like we're conscious we presume from first principles that we're conscious we can't even distinguish between being itself and being conscious and so that's a perfectly reasonable representation of man woman is taken from man from a rib from the side as an equal there's a critique of patriarchal judeo-christian narrative from the resentful feminist side that makes the claim that the biblical narrative is for example radically patriarchal in its orientation dooming women to subjugation that's a preposterous claim by the way it's it's not only false it's false in a very particular way there are falsehoods that are approximations of the truth there are falsehoods so deep that they're the exact opposite of the truth and the truth of the matter is that right from the first words the biblical library is miraculous in its in its insistence that women like men are made in the image of god that emerges in the first chapter and that eve is the equal of adam in every manner although complimentary and not identical and our society is riven by conflict so deep that we now doubt both of those propositions there's no form of confusion more profound than that sexually reproducing creatures without nervous systems can tell the difference between male and female i i'm dead serious about [applause] that if you can get people to swallow the lie that there's no difference between men and women there is no lie they won't swallow right [applause] [music]
