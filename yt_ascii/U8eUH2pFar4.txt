ladies and gentlemen if you know anything about the game of chess then you're probably familiar with grandmaster hikaro nakamura hikaro is incredible he's one of the best in the world at blitz at bullet at rapid chess he's top three in the world in classical he has got the biggest live streaming channel as well he's frequently streaming hundreds of hours a week but one of the skills that goes under the radar a little bit about hikaru which in my opinion he's probably the best in the world at is his defending this man defends positions probably as well as stockfish in certain situations it is impossible to defeat hikaro in a game of chess to do it you need to beat him multiple times within the same game because he will make comebacks and in today's video i'm going to show you multiple examples of this just from the games that he's played this past week against some of the very best players in the world including grandmaster fabiano carana former world chess championship contender really this video is going to make you very mad because it it's it's just not not possible to beat this man in certain games we are going to simulate playing as his opponents in a few games and i'm going to show you just how ridiculously hard it is to beat hikara nakamura in a game of chess from start to finish i'm talking on the clock resignation checkmate one of these so this is a this game inspired this video because i was watching him play yesterday and i was like are you kidding me fair chess on youtube that's not his legal name his legal name is demetri andreen one of the best rapid players and blitz players in russia hikaro plays knight f6 c4 normal openings thus far knight f3 hikaro goes for what's called the queen's indian defense very solid opening black frequently put put the bishop on b4 trade it play bishop b7 and be rock solid the computer claims that this opening is just a touch worse for black as you can see there 0.1.2 and black's major idea is to wait for the knight to arrive put the knight here trade the knight off and have these two bishops counteracting each other it's very much a neutralizing opening that move is very fancy but it's essentially this is what black wants black just wants a very stable position where there is a lot of equality and it's really going to take a monumental effort by white to try to win this game now andreen goes for a nice little tactic it's a fancy little move which is knight to g5 and the idea of knight to g5 is that he threatens checkmate but he also threatens the bishop which would trap the rook so if hearo took the knight he would get a bishop back take the rook and the knight is still trapped the knight actually struggles to escape here so that's the little trick now this is not an example of hikaru's miraculous defending he plays knight e4 it's a just a very logical move and he blocks the path here all right knight takes e4 knight c6 castles and he plays f5 hikaru pushes the knight back plays knight b4 trades the bishops and plays knight c6 now remember hikaru's game plan is neutralizing he's trying to neutralize okay now you may be wondering why karu is down three minutes on the clock you may be wondering how do that happen this is an armageddon game so in armageddon the players will bid who wants to play black the person playing black can make a draw and move on it's why it's called armageddon but to play black you need to start with less time on the clock so hikaru bid a certain amount of time so he's down a little bit on time but he's just trying to neutralize white's got a slightly better position in three extra minutes okay how is hikaru going to first of all how is white going to apply pressure puts his rook in the center takes a lot of space takes even more space this is exactly what you need to do to beat a person okay just got to advance you got to advance forward i mean there there there's no other way to beat a person in a game of chess you can't sit back on your own side unless they give all their pieces up pawn takes knight takes queen slides over knight g5 instigating hikaro plays knight e7 and then dren just keeps moving forward just keeps walking him down the center of the board i mean this is the way that yeah aggressive chess is played hikaro is slightly worse he's down on time less time than he was down pawn takes now andren immediately takes the other center line and takes back six pawns each queen knight two rooks but white slightly better always going to apply pressure can play pawn to d6 at some point there's a reason karo is not playing h6 i just don't understand what that reason is knight f5 knight f3 queen c3 and i mean you know that square is exploitable that pawn is exploitable that pawn is exploitable and at some point probably andreen is going to break in queen d3 b3 now karu decides to go for it with pawn to g5 it's a very big decision because he doesn't need to win this game he could have just sat back and right away andreen gets g4 and andreen in this position gets f5 and that little sequence there is a reason hikaru should not have overextended with his pawn cuz now his pawn can't actually fight the advancement of white's pawns two sneaky pawn moves by white leaving the tension of the knights here and just taking back with the king this is now a pass pawn it's it's just clogged this rook is going to arrive on e6 for example a5 rook e6 takes takes although i i have to tell you maybe not right now because queen e6 but in the future that is definitely a major idea and white is going to try to win that end game hikaro plays rookie five take take and we have this and hikaro is just worse he's just worse because this is a passer and this pawn is going to fall that pawn's going to fall both pawns are going to fall andre's just headed for a win rook c7 pass pawn for white on the file really bad structure for black and andreen sacrificing this pawn to bring in the king it's game over this pawn is going to have an a professional escort over here king is going to get to g6 the game is over hik caro's completely lost tries to fight back with h5 king d5 rook e2 rook takes a7 andrean's not even down a pawn anymore this is going to fall that's going to fall andreen there is no way he can stop fnb it's just not possible b5 rook b7 now and dren is up a pawn with the passer pawn to f6 hikaro is doing his best but the game is over rook b4 that's it two pawns and dren's done it i told you this game inspired this video i saw this game and i wanted to vomit like i was like like how does he do this he caru defends in the most annoying way possible he will make you feel the pressure of the clock he will make you have to put him away five or six different times in an end game he plays king f7 stands in front of the pawn now white has to configure a way to advance the b pawn while not losing this pawn so rook b6 king g6 so far so good there it is now karo goes for that pawn now you could just chuck you know you could just ignore this completely and just fully yeah there we go okay i don't know about king e6 b5 and simply rook d6 was probably the best at which point you know king c5 and you know king c6 and b6 like just over you know b6 this pawn is coming down but rook d3 is going to stop it and you you know you can't stop my pawns but andreen does it this way and plays king e7 and rook e6 and this should be good enough this should be good enough and dren is now two scores away from queening on two different sides this plus five g3 and now andre can probably calculated b7 g2 b8 g1 takes the rook andre can also in this position can actually play rook to e3 stopping the pawn g2 rook g3 or rook h3 check force the king to the g file then play rook g3 then win the pawn then promote it's game over and dren plays b7 and with 40 seconds on the clock hikaro finds rook b4 and the pawn is stopped not only is the pawn stopped hikaru now is able to allow a queen get his own queen and he's not mated his king has no legal moves but andreen has no check the black king hides in the corner and is shielded by i mean this is unbelievable five moves ago it was plus five it was over i mean it was plus a million the game was over hearu just hung in there he just managed to pressure this and this just enough f7 was impossible because of king g7 b6 and b7 was impossible because of the rook rotating hikaru saves this game by by just by by just hanging around just lasting long enough and he does this all the time here's a game where karu had the black pieces versus a 2800 this is entitled tuesday all right this one i'd like to show you from from white's perspective again right like i said we're going to be burying hikaro okay that's what we're going to do we're going to play against hikaro and and and simulate what it feel this man plays a6 this man deliberately plays bad openings to give himself disadvantages to win i mean it's look at and i mean obviously it's not like bad as in like dead laws but i mean he's playing some caroan stuff his opponent is a 2800 plays absolutely normally takes a lot of space on the queen side and hikaru fights back and does it in a way where he allows white to get this m look at this look at that look at that how do you deal with that two two pawns there's a pawn on c6 which is two squares away from queening how does this man allow this to happen there's no way he's going to get out of this right right well first he gives a check he gives a check because white's got to react now okay white blocks and now hikaro plays knight e4 now you can take that he hikaru's got pressure on you but you're defending you could actually take this but then you have to calculate knight b6 rook b8 knight d7 and use this pawn to anchor your knight and prevent black from castling which is which is doable it's it's actually doable and then the way black would play this is he would have to put the king on e7 and just try to get rid of this pawn maybe queen a8 in the future black can't rush with queen a8 you can't rush with this move because your rook is actually trapped which is insane so knight b6 knight d7 the most obscure move ever and you just live there your knight just lives on d7 sometimes you have this one microscopic moment to put hikaro in a very tough spot and if you don't and if you don't because you are a little bit worried about his pressure he's going to defend himself in castle and now you have the advantages of your position but your position is stagnant position is kind of stagnant you know who's not going to be stagnant iaru he's going to immediately play f6 you're going to play a move out of inertia you'd really like to play rook e1 but you can't so you go here what you don't realizes that actually helps e caro's plan and before you know it he's playing e5 in a matter of four moves it's 0 again he completely consolidated your your your fake little advantage here that you had that i mean it absolutely was an advantage but you managed to do nothing with it suddenly this is barreling down the board and you know if i'm playing white here i'm trying to keep the tension i'm i'm i'm going to play queen b3 i'm going to try to like you know lock the center no no no white actually technically played the best move according to the computer which is taking and then play queen b3 now and immediately hikaro marches you down that trade opened up the rook now the bishop is open the the rook is powerful the knight is going to get into the game white plays rook e one thinking that they're very clever setting up an attack rook takes e4 because of this pin probably expecting king h8 no hikaru gets out of the pin by not only getting out of the pin this is gone this is no longer a pin he's threatening to take the knight now because that's not a pin and if you move the knight that's a pin and if you move the knight you get mated that's mate in a span of about five moves we go from hikaro slightly worse to hikaru breaking open the center to hikaru completely winning completely winning it's over why is it over because this move unpinned two different things it unpinned the queen it unpinned the king it set up its own pin and that's it you can't move the knight so what does searo do takes the knight then here beautiful move hit the queen checkmate rook e rook d1 the queen slides out of the way queen f5 we have a trade you can't go here because this rook is is pinned be careful but he caro sax's queen for a checkmate just the pawns never moved the pawns never moved on move 13 they landed there and they were just spectating as hikaru slowly methodically untangled absolutely violently obliterated the white position and sacked his queen for m i mean it's just it's this dude is a 2800 i'm a 2800 blitz player at my at my best my wor some like you know 27 you know 20 20 like'800 but like this is just so he makes it look so simple here's a very fun game that i saw his opponent in this game is gandam this is arjent arigi one of the best young players of india and in this game arjent played a london okay hearo played you know normal stuff car played normal f5 trying to you know but but but argent played really well argent got a great position from the opening look like this karo trying to create winning chances long castle directly into this directly into all that i mean just hikaru plays such provocative chess because he knows how difficult he is to beat he knows you can get certain advantages against him he can give you certain advantages like this opposite side castling with b4 b5 on the way hearo plays you know directly into this and you don't understand how difficult this is for black because this is coming like just give it a couple of moves i mean this is mate like so hikaro plays knight c7 and arjun plays rook b1 and i mean arjun's just going to go a4 b5 or b5 right away or bishop c7 and b5 laro plays bishop d6 now the best move here is b5 b5 is really strong if cb5 knight b5 is good you also have a4 let's say knight b5 knight b5 rook b5 and i'm not really sure what arjun didn't like about this but b5 was definitely the best move definitely the best move i mean it's much easier to sit here and say the moves then actually play the game against saro and play the moves instead of that arjun gets enamored with a different plan you may notice that this plan is really nice but you may also notice that the queen hits the pawn and this move loses the pawn because of take take queen f5 pure loss of a pa did hikaru blunder that or was this genius is hikaru trying to relieve the pressure of his position by giving up a pawn because he's smart enough to realize he's got pressure of his own eric gey needs to keep his eyes on the prize he has to not fall for the forbidden fruit instead he falls for the forbidden fruit because he's a human and he's like how how bad can it be i'm going to be up a clean pawn all right hikaro ain't got nothing clean pawn pawn and now i can play b5 anyway and you say how can he play b5 well because it's the same thing you you get the pawn and you get the bonus and you just keep attacking but for some reason arjun here goes you know what i'm playing hikaru i got to be a little bit careful because i know how good his defensive skills are so what i'm going to do is i'm going to trade the queens look how much of his advantage left it was9 before winning the pawn it was like 1.3 so now it's. n only which is fine he's a pawn up but now it's five point4 you know why because he car that was his plan all along hearu now has a target aragi is going to defend the target but in defending the target arigi is now very passive and now hikaru starts running circles around the white position despite being down upon because the knight can't move if theight i can't move the rooks can't move the rooks were put there to attack now they can't even attack if you play a4 i just go here if you play b5 i'll just take where's the attack you don't have an attack anymore you don't have a queen you don't have any powerful pieces on the board so within about five moves eri is border line wor he's worse he's worse despite being up a pawn how does that happen he's up a pawn in a position with rooks and knights but he's worse huh it's like being up a goal in football but suddenly you're down to nine players i guess i don't know there's no comparison or you're down to you know you got injured players on the field and you know aragi keeps trying he attacks a little bit but hikaru's just got a blockade and he's just going for this pawn and he's going to get that pawn because after f5 that knight's got to move the knight's moved now karo's got all the benefits of his position he's not even down a pawn anymore but every guys he's going to fight back but notice notice what else hearo does to people the clock 3 minutes versus two it was just 2 minutes versus four eri trying to fight back the king is pushed back here comes the rook in the knight f4 takes takes the king is hiding arigi down to his final minute hikaru is very good at instigating in positions like this 20 seconds for arigi lot of checks being given rook e1 rook f1 hikaru trades and plays rook d3 it's impossible to make a move for white that knight was put there about 20 moves ago the night was put there 20 moves ago but now we can't move because it's stuck defending this pawn the one the pressure of hikaru forced ari to play passively and the knight never moved again and after rook h2 it's just over he's just going to lose everything he takes knight d2 check anywhere the king moves knight f3 wins the rook defends the rook game over i will remind you this was the position on move 15 it looked like heri was headed in the right direction hikaru offered up a pawn for long-term play against the e pawn and within about five to seven moves he got exactly what he wanted he got everyy passive doubting himself going backwards nothing happened over here nothing happened they set up the structure of the building they did a little bit of plumbing and then they abandoned the project there this man just completely beat a guy just down a full pawn like full pawn like that just pure pure purely down a pawn unbelievable it's just incredible and the last game that i have for you is a game that he he played against fabiano caruana this was the recent speed chest championship match where karo was deliberately playing goofy openings he literally started the game with knight h3 in like half the games and then he played bishop g2 d3 and fabiano came after him with the h pawn to get the bishop and the rook involved then hearo played f3 and g4 man kids look up to this guy kids look up to this guy and he is out here doing this oh my goodness and he's doing it against one of the best chess players on the planet but in blitz anything goes and i'm telling y'all y'all not ready we've been looking at games that he saves in the middle game in the opening in the end game sometimes hikaro does this for fun in the in in in the early stage of the game look at look at this look at this position got nothing he can't move any pieces but hearo of course he can move pieces kn d7 he plays f4 he's not he's not supposed to be the one calling the shots and the thing is with black if you keep the tension he's just going to lock the position and now you can't do anything you have a symbolic advantage g5 i don't even have to i don't have to touch the position i'll castle my king is completely safe now because of the brick wall so it's up to fabby to open the position he does plays h3 great move offering up the pawn hikaru just takes it dude just takes the pawn you're not supposed to take the pawn because black is now active knight e5 knight f2 knight g6 i mean black can slowly prove an advantage iaro doesn't care because he is one of the best defensive chess players in the world knight g6 he just comes back to f2 it's been 12 moves now this is this is heinous not only did hikaru take the offering of the h pawn allowing the rook and the queen and the bishop to pressure there he has put all these pawns on light squares the dark squares are completely exploitable he's got no development whatsoever despite being a pawn up it's a minus one advantage to black so black has two points of advantage to make up for that and hikaru castles into this position he castles into queen h4 bishop d6 bishop g4 because there's nothing because the truth is this looks great there's nothing here by the time you start attacking me i will trade off all your pieces i will play bishop f4 and you'll just have zero attack i don't know how he manages to do this fabiano plays bishop d6 knight e5 queen f6 he does everything right and hikaru just plays h3 and says go ahead get a knight to one of these squares play knight g6 go ahead fa plays bishop d7 because he's trying to castle get the rooks over there knight f3 that covers h4 that covers f4 knight g6 hi caro develops his bishop he's got an advantage this is unbelievable he's got an advantage in a 4 second time advantage as well knight f4 check this man creates a shish kebab of pieces puts the king on f1 how is this possible queen g6 and now e5 the pawn attacks the bishop which used to guard the knight if fabbi moves he just loses the full piece the only thing fabiano can do now is bring the knight back to hit the bishop knight e6 this is the only move but instead he's on tilt he goes here thinking take take probably queen e1 the bishop has been p pinned to the king now if black plays f6 i'm going to take the knight and now fabiano decides all right i got a castle he loses this he loses this knight e4 queen g3 knight comes back knight comes back king slides over knight comes back he brings the rooks and he just starts his own attack 41 seconds versus eight pushing on the king side knight f6 check pawn to h4 h5 fabiano fights back but hikaro just rocks solid defensively 8 seconds for black of course there's still opportunities to blunder here hikaro sends it to an endgame picks up some pawns rook c2 bobby gets some pawns back gets the position down to equality you would think that's just the end right that's just the end i mean hikaro burned out his advantage got a little bit too confident position is dead equal rookie the gods are on his side man rookie for take take knight g4 fabby still had to be precise it's very tough to be precise with a knight on the board and with 6 seconds unfortunately he blunders i'm not laughing at his pain i'm laughing at how brutal it is to play against t caro like like look at the look at what he does in the opening i mean it how does he look at every all of black's pieces are pointed at the king and the king's just sitting there shirtless like you can't do anything you just can't touch me you don't have jurisdiction oh my it's unbelievable what does is just it it it it doesn't it doesn't make any sense he defends so well in fact he loses his advantage when he has to play for a win that's when he gets a little bit you know a little bit lazy a little bit like you know of course black is doing a very nice job creating counterplay but 50 seconds versus 11 you just fall asleep at the wheel but when he's under pressure you can't beat him when he is under pressure he finds all the right moves at all the right moments he plays the clock he plays the man he plays the position it's just that first game was i bean think anyway likely the best chess player defensively in the world best defensive chess player in the world and it's it's not you know it's close him and magnus but hope you enjoyed this video i like i like focusing on these skills that these players have that that go into the radar i'll see you in the next video get out of here
