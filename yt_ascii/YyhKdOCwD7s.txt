- this is the ohio state penitentiary, the most haunted place on earth. with over 100 jail cells,
it's 250,000 square feet of pure haunted nightmare fuel. this place is known to
have one of the highest concentrations of ghost on the planet. so i'm going to go inside and
try to spend 24 hours in here. - are you guys not going with him? - no, that's his thing. - no. that's him. you got this man. - guys come on. - he said he would do it. - okay. - so here's what we brought
to help us find ghosts. we have a bunch of flashlights because you got to be able
to see them to find them. these are walkie-talkies. so me and all the boys can stay connected. this is a night vision
camera with infrared meter. and this next thing is an emf detector. so if the electromagnetic
frequency changes which i don't know what that means, but this red thing will light up, that means there's a ghost. we're all geared up. let's do this. - this place used to
be a six story prison. and it's one of the
biggest prisons in america. and a lot of people died here. we'll get into why it's hunted later, but i just want you to know it is massive. we could walk around here all night and not even see the whole thing. - look at chris by himself. what if something just takes chris? - why are you sneaking up on us man? dude i don't like this anymore. - that's the hallway we just walked down. jesus it's so creepy in here. - maybe that's why it ghost
hunter's got so bright. - whoa, whoa. my thing went off. - wait really? did it really. wait it really did go off. he's not even joking. - it jumped to yellow. - if anyone's right here, can you touch this little
black thing i have in my hand? thanks.
- you got it. - tareq you got to. - why every time you see a hole, you want me to just go in there. - tareq go in the hole.
- no. - i will give you $500
if you go in the hole. - look there's a. - no, i can't do that dude. - $500. - and then like for how long? - 10 seconds. - oh my god. oh my god. oh my god. - all right. - no. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10. - you all suck. - yeah, we should really. - oh gosh, taylor stop. - so now that we've explored
one part of the prison, we're going to set up camp in the middle. there's still so much more to
explore, like the hospital, the church, the attic,
solitary confinement. there's so many other parts to this, but before we do all that,
we want to set up camp. so base camp is easier to
see we brought a light. - i can see. - okay. i'm definitely sleeping here then. so jimmy, is this your spot? - how do i work the sleeping bag? jake, can you sleep there and
kill ghost if they attack? - no. - what's the problem here? - jake took our sleeping bag. - okay, goodbye. - jake stop with the bullying. - get out, make your own sleeping bag. this is our house, i slash claimed it. dude i hope you get haunted,
if you sleep on this. - that's too far. - oh, i like this. - it's done. - the cameramen should sleep together. - jimmy you're going to have
to offer a little more money if you want that to happen. all right. - get off off me. - no, i want to be the big spoon. - hey jake. - huh? - jake this could be
us, but you're playing. - oh baby. no, i'm not playing. - we're viewing all the
fan fictions right now. - and then jimmy's just watching. all right, jake. you ready to cuddle? - yeah. i'm born ready. - enough meandering around. let's split into groups. chandler we're going
to visit the hospital. you guys go visit the
solitary confinement. come here chandler, come on. - i'm going to scare you. - please don't. - i'm going to. - jimmy, can i just hold base camp? - no. - like someone needs to watch this stuff. - you explore that way. - use the walkie-talkie a
lot and get creeped out. - so they just went that way, and we're going this way. - jimmy can i not go please? - now you got to do it for content. - but i don't like content,
i like not being scared. - yeah. whoa, dude. this is giving me a headache. - oh, i can't see a thing. there we go. get some light. - stop. - he's still alive? - wait, what if something's in tea? - oh, it's just james charles. - hi sister is up. - didn't hear that siren. - what's this, it did blink. it blinked. - i saw it. - did you get it? i think i got it for a little bit. well we're going to chase it. - there was definitely like a siren. - dude, i swear i got it. - oh my god. dude, it's going on. - it's going crazy? - yeah. look at it. - oh my god. no, we're not. i'm not going in there. - all right. there's probably something
in that door then. i don't believe in ghosts. i don't care. although that is kind of scary. you go first. - no, my light doesn't work. - lord please help me. - dude it's going off. - yeah. keep going, follow it. - oh my god. - we just went in a circle. - nice. - oh, spooky circle. - i didn't even realize it. - we never went up these stairs. - it's a dead end. - dude this is like one of the hot spots. no.
- how do you feel? - so this is solitary confinement. this is where they kept inmates. like all real close up right. - this is interesting. - i think i just saw.
- i want to scare you. i think i just saw a person, i'm leaving. i'm actually leaving. - nope. nope - no, i quit. i'm going home. i'm going home. - what happened? no more, no more. - he saw something and then
josh comes in out nowhere, and scares out of us. - all right guys. we had to run back to base camp. we are a hundred percent
sure we saw something or something scared us. and we ran and we are scared. - okay. yeah. chandler's thing's been going off too. so we might join you in a minute. - yeah. i don't want to be here anymore. we're literally terrified right now. - stop being a cry baby - tareq screamed to the top of his lungs. - i can't wait to see this. - come here ghost. you're not real, chris
and them are going to try to scare us. - we might have got something on camera. - they're going to try to scare us. - you think so? - yeah. - i will beat the. - they're trying to set us up. yeah. what'd you get? - if you look at the footage, it looks like something moved when jake's looking down the long hallway, and that's when we got scared and ran. - i believe it. - i mean, if we meet them at base camp, they can't like beat us to base camp. - tareq was scared, so. - i bet they're just
trying to like scare us. - and tareq's been scared the whole time. so it doesn't mean anything. - well, we're going to keep
continuing the crusade. tell my mom i love her. if i don't make it out of here. - jake. - i don't think this is the right way. - you're my ghost shield. - i hate you ceiling, it's so gross. - right or left? to the left. - there's a light on, what do we do? - go up there. - we've been walking for
like a really long time. - we have been walking for a long time. - we go though. - sure. you go first, ladies first. who should go first chandler or me? - chris said chandler. - roger. oh yeah. and then we went up there. so this place right here is the church. as you can see, there's all chair. thank you chandler for
coming to church today. and it means a lot to me
that you came all the way out here to the most
haunted prison on earth. did you know that? i'm trying to quote, merge. - i see raining outside. - what was that? - it should only be me and chris. - there's a female voice. what was that? - i don't know. so anyways, go to shopmrbeastt.com, and buy the new rogo beast20. look at this text, that a bad boy. it doesn't any all better. - all right chandler,
you want to go up there? - no. - let's do it. i don't know where i'm going. i'm going to go hide, and whichever one of them
finds me will get $1000. all right. i found a good hiding spot. can you guys hear me? - roger. roger. loud and clear jimmy. - whichever one of you
find me first gets $1000. i'm hiding. - i knew you were going to say that. - have fun, i'm turning off my radio. i don't how to turn this off. i got to drop this. - so jimmy said, whoever
finds him first gives $1000. - you're not going to
find him first, i am. get out the way. - hold on. all right. tareq, someone's pulling your back. - no, it's you. - tareq there's a ghost. - hold on. okay. i'm going to go by you then. - go for it. oh man. i don't like this anymore. i don't like this anymore. - do you all all just want
team up and try to find him? - yeah. split it. - split it. - you guys, are we teaming up? - that's right. - he's going to go somewhere
that looks good for the shot. - all right, so we check the closet. - he might be here. - right there, jimmy. - hey good job in finding me. - yay, good job guys. yay. high five. - technically i found him
by using my knowledge. - look, i said, jimmy's going
to be somewhere that's easy to get to because he is jimmy, but also somewhere that
looks good for the shot. - all right. well, go back. i'm going to hide again. that was too easy. - okay. all right. that one still counts though. - i'm going to call chris. i just finally got to my spot. - where are you? - i'm hiding. i don't like
the sound of that at all. - come find me. - oh my god. what's the price this time? - $2,000 - all right then. let's go. - $2000? - he said 2000? - go, go, go, go. - you're not going to find me ever. - so are we doing teams? - me, chandler and these teams, and then that team. - i'm hiding in a prison cell. they'll never find me. - here we're going to test this. i bet jimmy's saying about them beans. - we probably need to go back to camp, and then go themselves that way. - i'm thinking that jimmy has some balls. - yeah. jimmy definitely. - to walk around here
alone and say come find me. - he calling you again? - yeah he's calling me again. hello. - i forgot to mention
you only have 20 minutes. - 20 minutes? - 20 minutes? - we only have 20 minutes. - it's currently 12:16. good luck guys. - how does jimmy even hide like this? like that's so crazy. is he in one of the cells
downstairs, you think? because that would be easier to go to. - but it took him a while. he was gone a while. - maybe he just literally chilled
on his phone for a minute. - i kind of want to go to
like the chapel though. - chapel? - yeah, and the chapel,
we'll look over there. - let's go to the chapel. - what was that? what was that? - eight minutes left? i even gave them a hint. - no, we heard a loud bang. - yeah. we heard a bang. all right. we're going to keep looking. - two grand on the line. i hear them over there. - he's in a area because it sounded like
he was like crutched. - yeah. oh shoot, jimmy just texted us. hey, where are you guys at? i'm in a very unexpected spot. is what he said. - how really unexpected do we think he is? - i really think he's
still in the home base yes. - do you all want to
rendezvous at the home base? - he said we have five minutes left. good luck. - yeah. we're coming to home base. - two minutes left. - i think he's in a cell. - no, we checked every
single cell downstairs. he won't have gone upstairs either. - i don't even know where this is. - yep time's up. sorry you guys all lost. - i knew he was in this area. - so jimmy, where were you again? - in a cell. i think i heard something. is there a ghost down here? - no, no ghost down here. - cool. - this is where the inmate
james lockhart covered himself in lighter fluid
and lit himself on fire, and burned to death
because he could not stand the one to 15 years sentence
he was given for attempted murder. kill the lights. here we go. - lights off. - if you are here, can you
make that go off again? okay. okay. i want you to touch that
when the answer is yes. and i want you to not touch
it when the answer is no. do you understand? you very understand. okay, got you. were you the inmate that died here? okay. well understandable. later dude. - yeah. this is ridiculous. this is not where you came from for. - this place is scary.
- i want to go home. - i don't like this. - what was that? wait where'd you guys go? oh, there they are. - now we're going to make a circle. we're all going to put this
in the middle of the circle, and we're going to give it some distance. - no, no. - were you a prisoner? - were you a guard? - did you know mr. saltz? - were you a doctor? - do you speak english? see, we figured it out. they don't understand english. - syco mode or mobama. - were you just standing
next to me and connor? - yeah. i see. - can you come back and stand
in between me and connor? are you standing behind connor? - i have to pee. - what are you feeling right now? - it was like chills and
it was like shortness of breath and my eyes
just got super watery. - you think it's still
there or is it gone? - no, it's gone now, but it
was like i started to cry. - are you making connor cry? - it blinked. oh, it went red. it's still here. - oh dude. we're jumping up here now. - it went red. it went to fourth. - i'm going to put the chair right here. we're going to come back in
approximately five minutes and see if it's in the
middle of the room again. all right. it's been five minutes. let's see if, whoa. - why? oh my goodness. all right. well, that was interesting. hey chris? - yes sir. - i don't believe in ghosts. here's a hundred bucks. i bet a ghost doesn't show up. - you're on. - that's not what the skit
was supposed to be but, just give him the $100. - jokes on you tareq,
i've still got the money. - all these fools fell asleep on me. you will never catch me sleep in here. what was that? - hey guys, wake up. - morning sunshine. we survived. guys no ghost ate us. - there he is. - i can't believe we
just slept on the floor of a 130 year old prison. hey, ghost last chance, any
of you all boys out there. all right. just checking. - we did it. - we entered thinking we would
