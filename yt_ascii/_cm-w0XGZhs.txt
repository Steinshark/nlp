in this video i want to talk about apple's latest technology plaything the mini led panel in the 2021 model of the 12.9 inch ipad pro the reviews on the ipad have invariably noted how nice the display looks and it appears that the technology is mooted to show up in some of apple's other products as is their tendency technology publications like linus tech tips and the verge have talked about what makes mini leds special and definitely check those out too but in this video i want to take a look at the company supplying this interesting technology one of the world's biggest led vendors shin chu based nostar group we will continue but first please consider subscribing to the asian armature newsletter the newsletter is a good companion to the channel and a great way to stay in touch check out the newsletters for the full scripts as well as additional commentary after the fact i am also adding some exclusives in the future you can find the link to the newsletter in the video description below or you can just go to asianometry.com as of right now you can expect a new newsletter every thursday at 1 am taiwan time much thanks led backlit lcds use led backlights to shine light through the lcd which is formerly named tft lcd which carries the image note that the leds are not acting as the pixels themselves they are merely providing the light which comes out through the final lcd leds aren't small enough yet to serve as the pixels themselves current ipads use this type of screen and mini leds are refinement on this concept in a mini led screen you vastly increase the number of backlights and then arrange and synchronize them into dimming zones sophisticated control circuitry is created to control all of the backlights uniformly and efficiently this dimming zone system means that different areas light up or darken depending on the image characteristics so dark colors can actually be dark for this reason these panels can offer amazing contrast ratios better refresh rates and more manufacturing wise they can also be made in the same fabs as traditional backlit lcds but with some incremental improvements yet at the same time because of the sheer number of led backlights needed to be created more wafers and dyes have to be made for each new ipad thus this new technology can get quite pricey tear downs of the new ipad pro find that the lcd backlight by itself is one of the tablet's most expensive components estimated to cost ninety dollars per ipad pro it takes up nearly twenty percent of the ipad's entire component cost it is expensive but the results are stunning so let's take a look at the company that developed and supplied it enostar aenostar group is an interesting company in that it is actually made up of two companies epistar and lextar they merge quote unquote in january 2021 exchanging both company shares for shares in this one holding company and i add the quotes because per their announcement they are together but operating separately it's complicated let's start with epistar founded in 1996 epistar is one of taiwan's biggest led suppliers prior to the merger they had been a fully integrated manufacturer this means that they developed the crystal wafer and die and they package it all into modules for delivery to the led application user its founders had worked at itri the taiwanese public-private partnership that famously spun off tsmc many years earlier taiwanese firms had been working in the downstream led industries ever since the 1970s with light on technologies being a taiwanese led packaging and module pioneer the industry quickly looked for a way to climb up the value chain afraid of always being stuck on the bottom levels they found our opportunity when itri developed a new technology called transparent indium tin oxide or ito at this period of time thin metal was used as a substrate for creating leds this way of doing things however hindered how bright leds can be ito offered a better approach itri founded and spun off epistar to refine this technology and bring it to the market the company did not turn a profit for the first six years of its existence but soon developed red leds that were substantially brighter than what was already available from there the company established itself as one of the leaders of the led industry it is another interesting story of a taiwanese high-tech industry climbing the value chain up from a low-level process today epistar holds over 4400 led patents including many of the patents surrounding core upstream aspects of mini led technology lexstar had been another taiwanese vertically integrated led firm they were established in 2008 as a subsidiary of au optronics one of taiwan's biggest lcd display makers their product specialties are in displays and automotive applications for instance the lamps that go into car headlamps and whatnot lexstar had been developing their own mini led technology demonstrating a 2.9 inch mini led panel in 2019 with over 2 300 dimming zones the panel can reach up to 30 000 nits so all in all good technology there was just a lot of overlap with what other taiwanese companies like epistar were doing in the industry the americans and japanese had long been leaders in the industry with companies like cree and nichia inventing many core fundamental led technologies and patenting them european firms ozram and phillips also had founding roles here taiwanese firms like epistar then entered the market and flourished but they were quickly joined by the koreans and the chinese many of these new led suppliers are allied with larger vertically integrated electronics conglomerates like sharp sony or hitachi this means that they do not necessarily have to make money i talked a bit about this in my video about boe technology what this means is that the led industry is seeing substantial overproduction in the space it sucks profits out of the industry and negatively impacted the taiwanese led industry as a whole even tsmc found itself unable to compete here in 2015 they sold their led foundry operations to epistar this has been a long-term trend in the industry and these market forces have not let up the brutal industry conditions continued into 2019 epistar 2019 revenues declined 27 from 2018. they made 15 billion ntd in revenue which is about 575 million usd losses were almost a fifth of that revenue 3.9 billion ntd or 140 million usd their gross margins that year were negative lexstar generated revenues of 9 billion ntd in 2019 about 323 million usd but posted a 310 million ntd loss or 10 million usd their gross margins that year were nine percent with the economic situation the way it is it makes a lot of sense for these players to consolidate and try to get bigger the two companies had both been vertically integrated that won't be the case anymore once part of enostar lexstar will focus on the downstream operations of led manufacturer this means putting together the various led components into finished modules epistar would handle the up and middle stream creating the wafers and the individual dies or grain the merger would also allow them to focus their dual mini led and micro led development efforts a key future growth industry and source of high end margins it would also bring some of lexitar's critical customers like au optronics and cree inc to epistar's upstream business and it might allow them the chance to supply panels to samsung electronics as au optronics has been a samsung supplier for some time now i would be remiss not to mention some of the other suppliers for this ipad according to bloomberg general interface solution holding limited and taiwan surface mounting technology corporation are some of the other key providers of the ipad pro's display technology these are some obscure names i consider myself pretty familiar with the taiwanese electronics industry and even i have never heard of these companies general interface solution holding or gis in myali provides the touch technologies behind all sorts of touch screens that includes the cover glass the touch sensors and the lcd display modules taiwan surface mounting technology in tauren does liquid crystal display surface mounting this is a complicated process that solders electronics components directly onto a printed circuit board this actually sounds kind of interesting and i wonder how they apply it to lcd screens but we shall save this for a future video another interesting name that came up during the latest supply checks is atl who provided the ipad pro's battery i did a video about their spin-off company katl which provides ev batteries for all the nice reviews about the ipad i guess mini leds aren't really making a huge wave just yet in the consumer technology space i reckon that people are more stoked about micro leds and are probably already looking ahead to when those can start appearing on people's shelves and that kind of makes sense the commercialization of micro leds allows for revolutionary brand new form factors and opens up new experiences in things like virtual reality imagine what new consumer products might come down the pike when that technology is ready but all of that is more than a few years away in the meanwhile mini leds have a lot to offer they deliver a beautiful image that rivals the very best that oleds can do there is a rumor that says that the next mid-range ipad airs are going to have oled screens while the next big macbook pros will have mini led screens i think that positioning mini led has the high end and oled has the middle end is really interesting and assuming those rumors turn out to be true demonstrates the potential that many leds have for the future they can deliver high dynamic range and color on par with oled while offering more brightness and less risk of burning as for enostar today the company holds 12 percent of global led chip capacity crucial scale in an increasingly competitive industry where scale matters a whole lot snagging apple's business demonstrates their technology lead for now anyway but there is still too much competition in the led space companies in south korea europe and china are expected to catch up as soon as 2022 with giant san an opto electronics being the most worrisome competitor enostar has to continue innovating and investing in r d namely micro leds to keep apple's business and push the display industry forward all right everyone thanks for watching that's it for tonight if you want more content you can like and
