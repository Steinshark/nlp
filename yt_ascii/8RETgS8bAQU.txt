ladies and gentlemen many of you who clicked on this video are beginners or intermediates at the game of chess and if you're higher than that at the advanced level well then you probably watch these videos to have a bit of a laugh this video is part of my playlist called how to lose a chess where viewers are brave enough to send their games in and volunteer themselves for a mix of a game review on a serious level and obviously a laugh as well and in today's video a 1200 rated player named anthony sent in his game and well in this game let's put it this way the king went god mode and that's all i'm going to say we will jump into the game in a moment but i asked for just one minute of your time this video was sponsored by myself now that might surprise you you might go oh wait a minute i usually skip this part levy no because today i have a pretty big and fun announcement you all know i talk about my courses quite a bit i'm very proud of them we've got opening courses beginner course intermediate middle game master class which recently came out but today we launched the extension of chesley so for the next three days we've got 50 off everything but we just launched this which is chestly plus and this is an extension you don't need to buy a course to get this but what we intend to do with this is build training tools that don't exist anywhere else one of those training tools is a game called flash memory flash memory will train your ability to take a position memorize it and then solve questions when the pieces are gone how you visualize a position from memory this feature which is think fast is one of my favorite you have a certain amount of time to play a move that maintains the an advantage in the position and we've got other games coming up on chesley plus we have a bunch of games here already but we have things like guess the evaluation and one called anti-puzzle which will take a couple of months to build but i mean we are we are really really working hard to create some amazing training tools that you can't find anywhere else coordinate spotter of course basic one just spotting coordinates if you get chestly plus you have a lifetime courses discount and you're even gonna have courses that we're not putting just for sale so 10 best games of the 20th century seven best sacrifices in history and when there are going to be big events like the world championship i will annotate games in detail there and we will go into some of those some of those lessons a little bit in greater detail so i said give me about a minute to explain that chestly plus plus launched today and if you lock in a price now you get that price forever so because you trust us in our earliest phases we're gonna have bugs we're gonna have little problems and i appreciate all of your support tremendously so if you want to check out plus check it out you want to check out a course everything is 50 off right now that's it that's the sponsor it's me hi i'm the problem it's me i'm not you know i don't have some product here to give you it's just this is what i do all right this is the extension of watching me on youtube and if you want to support me i don't have merch yet but this is like our big project on all my courses all the hard work that we've put in it launched today so exciting times over here let me know your feedback in the comments all those games by the way they have free samples you can play them anyway let's talk about this game and if you're watching this by the way like six months later tell me that in the comments hello justlyplus is still out just missed the launch sale but all good all right our players are burger eater from the u.s and anthony from lebanon and i made anthony carmelo anthony because that's you know carmelo anthony is goated from the new york knicks game began with e4 e5 and we had knight f3 and black played bishop c5 now this is the bush gas gambit i don't think that anthony knew that this is just a free pawn on move one like that is move two this is just the free pawn i don't think that black was playing a gambit and this is why i recommend folks develop your knights before you develop your bishops okay bishop c5 is not a good move and now now white plays bishop c4 because because white is trying to play in italian okay why why saw an opening video and and you know and just does this okay but bishop c5 is the move played we have bishop c4 now we have knight f6 so once again this is just 100 to free pawn this is no longer a gambit but instead of that both players castle okay so both players completely oblivious to their center pawns being under attack just no care in the world now again for white this is the best move but i think we've already established that white will not be playing that move and white plays queen e1 okay queenie one's not a good move because you should be defending this with either more development or d3 or rookie one queenie one completely supports this but it just i mean you block your own rook like the queen should be out a little bit more but okay whatever not a blunder just yet but the computer isn't really a huge fan black plays d5 which i like i like understanding that you should be attacking the center of the board and i i mean i i really i really like this move quite a bit what i really don't understand however is not taking back and gambling what but okay well i kind of i think i get it i i get it black's idea is to take back and i think black was worried that after this you know white would go here and simply have a nice advantage simply win the pawn i get it okay that makes sense so black went here so that when white captured black would recapture with the knight and defend the center and yeah have more development that makes a lot of what well i thought the idea of c6 was very obvious right you would place these eggs in blackwood okay well now white takes on e5 so now white is simply up two pawns on move eight these are twelve hundreds all right some of you watching this are 600. you can't even get a game like this right so now all right black is down two pawns but when you're down two pawns and you know you got open lines let's get the bishop out let's play knight d7 maybe maybe queen c7 defending that and then move the knight gotta get the bishop out right you gotta get developed now you definitely don't want to play something like bishop b7 here because you're just permanently stuck behind your pawn so black plays the move bishop to b7 getting permanently stuck behind their pawn okay also not a step in the right direction now i love white's move here which is c3 trying to get the pawn to d4 that is a brilliant move in fact c3 might be literally the top computer move which is absurd c3 with the intention of building a big center then developing the bishop i love it now black plays knight bd7 now if you're playing with white here okay at this level of chess i would recommend just taking the computer thinks some of your advantage goes away but once you get d4 and get bishop g5 and black goes here and you finish your development like your position is excellent and you are still still up two pawns what i would not recommend almost ever is to give up a knight and the bishop for a rook and a pawn knight f7 is a travesty that is not a good move it is not good to play this because more often than not the two pieces are better a lot better look at the evaluation here it's plus two white makes a trade that's technically equal six six but the advantage is gone gone almost because now you left yourself with an extra rook but rooks don't take part in the game until much later and black's pieces will very quickly come alive and you will feel their presence one two three four five six pieces versus one two three four five the king doesn't count so now black has more pieces d4 bishop now i do like the way white is playing this bishop e3 but look at this white just made a huge mistake how how is the move bishop e3 is such a bad move well black can create a threat here do any of you see how black can create a threat bishop a6 chess is about spotting our opponent's ideas onto ourselves not just right not just our own ideas that's it that's a trap rook now black is immediately winning that rook back let me tell you something else black is winning that rook back suddenly black has more pieces crazy now at this level nobody sees that into the black play c5 which i i don't just like this move at all in fact look at black's bishop from the corner there coming alive right that bishop stands completely unoposed nobody getting in the way of that bishop right so this is the stuff you need to pay attention to if you want to go up the rating ladder all right we have bishop takes e4 black trades oh apologies instead of trading which would have been decent black goes knight g4 now the reason knight g4 is a bad move is that when this move arrives on the board you don't know it's a bad move like you you don't know right the computer says it but why is it a bad move well first you need to go is there a threat the quit the answer is no i mean the the idea is this but there is no threat which means you can create a threat and if black continues to do this what's the big deal i mean now you can even give a check to black and maybe even stop mate just play h3 and how are you ever getting mated and the black king is actually the one under attack right so there's no idea to this move so why just plays f3 now it's not the best move but it is a move knight goes back to h6 and now we gotta get to this king all right we gotta bring the queen and the rook rook d1 is fine it's a reasonable move i don't dislike it and black is just not respecting the king safety black was doing well because for a brief moment a few moves ago the pieces stood very strong in this situation and black you know black had good future prospects but by playing a couple of lackadaisical night moves and now bishop to c7 which once again does not create any threat nothing has changed in black's position and white has made a lot of progress knight bishop rook queen now if only white's queen was like out more and could like get into the action a little bit but it's still fine black is in serious trouble and immediately blunders blundering completely the blunder here is the fact that white can take attacking the queen this is czech so you can't rush but after this the rook the queen and the knight are all getting in one of them is getting in all right and it's it's rook d7 and it's a devastation of the black position devastating all right like it's over so you gotta be able to spot these little details instead in the game white just gives a check because they're still at that level there's not a lot that separates twelve hundred and a thousand but the major similarity between 1200 and let's say 600 is the consistency of the moves and yet at that level you still go oh missy check me play a check right it's the only check in the position so it has to be a good move now black has to hide the king you gotta go here i mean you gotta go as far to the corner as possible you cannot go straight back that loses the game you need to look for checks and the craziest thing to me in this position white made a one move check in five seconds but then white did this in six if white had played this it would have been over this wouldn't have been a youtube video bishop c5 check and just simply take the queen it's it's on the board it is on the damn board always look for checks instead white takes thinking that in this position they were going to win the queen and guess what they were right wait but levy what did you yeah yeah yeah in this position bishop takes b6 the move that i was complaining about that i was saying was wrong right bad move why is it a bad move because this comes with check so you're not actually going to win the queen because the queen's gonna move yeah black recaptured in yeah in three seconds three seconds i mean it's moved 20 of a 10 minute rampant game move 20. you have eight minutes on the clock you spend three you hang your queen i mean it's nuts you guys are just riding a bicycle while shoving nails into the tires that is what you are doing you are wondering why it takes you so long to get places okay it's because you're putting sharp objects in your shoes and it hurts to walk and you refuse to take them out nothing that you guys do makes sense for your own chess improvement just there is a massive difference between the quality of recapture just look around the board guys the board is big this is the level at which it's almost inexcusable it's over now how do you win a position like this you gotta utilize your material bring it forward trade rooks a rook trade seals the game for white rook d1 blunders a rook in one move but i'm just saying like get the knight back rook trade bring in the queen ravage the position and promote a second queen what you don't do is randomly push upon like why why what what is g for for what purpose for what now black goes rookie eight now what is the problem here the problem is that the knight is hanging and there's a queen behind it right so you defend the queen that would have been significantly easier to do and then this wouldn't have been capturable if you hadn't played it but you have to defend the queen right or danger levels check then move the queen you don't just hang the knight like what what six seconds like all the nights that by what why why is the knight dead why oh he's attacking my knight with the rook and the bishop by the way this is why you should get middle games master class it'll improve your board vision queen d2 50 off by the way rookie five this is just insanity now folks remember how i just said trading the rooks will win white the game yeah not when you lose the knight okay now the chances of winning this game are significantly lower because three pieces actually coordinate very well against the queen it's three three still it's the right decision because a queen on its own will dominate right so black plays rook d5 now when you have an extra queen and a rook like this of course teaming them up on the same straightaway is a good way to go the problem is that you do not want to do this because as i just said knight and bishop for the rook knight and bishop are gonna do pretty well this is a rare exception why is it a rare exception because sometimes a rook is better than a bishop in the night this is not a fork because of the end game so you'll notice three on nothing right probably this is a win for white because it's going to be borderline impossible for black to prevent white's pawns from queening this is a rare exception now what you don't want to do when you have an extra queen is lose the queen move oh my god i mean how did this i should just end the video here frankly i mean honestly like i really should when i saw this i was like are you kidding me like you have one response you got one piece left basically you got the queen how do you not see that this is the same amount of squares i mean it's literally three squares just in the other direction like are you are you nuts oh my goodness well it's over now for sure now some of you who are attentive to video titles and things you're probably sitting there going i the kings haven't moved the whole game i know what's going on here a very nifty move here by black by the way that's why you always gotta look for checks rookie five game over like no question asked the king is completely shut shut down so rookie one is just made it's just made rookie one is made no questions asked that's called a mating net and if you have the middle games master class one of the ways of converting winning positions is just a direct assault on the king use your material advantage to go win another way is to take everything and trade and so on so black takes a free pawn i don't hate this move but rookie 5 is winning now black takes everything white plays rook b5 all right that makes sense you know you're looking to trade and maybe queen now if you're playing black here this is what you play that's what you play you have bishops okay they'll stop the pawns not to mention the fact that you probably have a mate with these three pieces but even if you don't the pawns will never get through and then you will slowly win them and queen etc do not go rook a7 i don't know why you're trying to save the rook unless you're trying to deliver checkmate so if you're trying to deliver a checkmate don't deliver it with the knight because now you gotta go back all right rook b4 okay good check here still nothing a4 you gotta bring the rook you got you got to do something right so you got to bring the rook down here that's mate you got to bring the rook there that's going to be made you can play rook a6 you can also play the rook a4 and hang the oh my god oh my god oh my god fine bishop takes c5 all right you just took one thing just take the pawn get a oh my oh my all right all right see yeah look at this bishop takes c6 is the idea and rook takes f2 but you know what black's idea was check oh oh yeah yeah yeah it looks like after all black is going to avoid any nonsense and is going to win this game now you gotta probably push this pawn if black plays h3 h2 check white cannot get close so just this this this makes a queen and then you can do you know your checkmate and white will not promote in time or that yes you can also for absolutely no reason at all give a night check okay now get the knight back out of the way okay fine you're preventing white's king from escaping that makes a lot of sense and the next thing that you'll do is go back and push that makes perfect sense yes b5 okay terrific move the knight now find g4g okay i like that too see all right gotta bring the king nice good nice b6 okay there's no thread so now it's time to move the knight out of the way or push the jeep on all right you you didn't need to go there because both of these things are all right but fine it's a messy technique but it's good it's technique all the same and black is still completely winning white gives a check black takes white makes a queen black takes it's stalemate blackens the game in a draw up 11 points of material foreign
