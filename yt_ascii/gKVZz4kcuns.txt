right. i'm gonna say, i'm gonna say... - before we show you who won. i need to tell you about the
sponsor funding this video. because lots of my videos
get copyright claim because of music and
yeah, i'm going broke. you might be wondering where
did all this money come from? it came from tiktok. the greatest app ever invented. - i love tiktok. - you see this clip right here? wow. that is a funny clip. the best clip i've ever seen. - i really like that clip. - same. do you see clips
like that on youtube? exactly. with tiktok, you can
watch comedy, or more comedy. or attractive people lip syncing. did i mention they have comedy? - whoa. they have comedy? - vine committed game end, and tiktok is here to
win the battle royale. now you might think you have to go to an ancient mayan temple to
find something this amazing. [music] houses driving 15 cars [music] wow. but you don't. see that
link in the by-scription? that's not a mayan temple. that's a redirecting
url available on what? - ios and android. - what other app is doing it like that? and if you don't like tiktoks like this, you're just a hater, man. if you don't believe tiktok's
the best, just watch. - i'm gonna say paper. oh, he won. - paper. no, scissors,
scissors, i'll say scissors. i'll say scissors. - so he just picked scissors. - yeah. he changed it. - i was literally about
to donate him $3,000, and he was like "nah, i don't want money." all right. well... - it's gonna suck when
you watch this video. - you let down us youtubers.
thanks a lot, man. - the twitch streamers are two out of two. - twitch is two for
two. come on youtubers. lettin' me down. disgraced of my platform. what do we give him? i'm
just gonna press random keys. - oh, that's a big number. - i think i put one too many. - the other streamer chose scissors, good job dad. - why is the zoe character disabled? - the other streamer chose scissors. g j dad. - yo, what the f-? mrbeast6000 donated $2,345. - [person offscreen] no way. - it said the other

slander on pewdiepie. youtube guy gets money. - you won, the other guy didn't like poods and that is a sin. - punishable by death, actually. - yeah. - mrbeast donated $2,000. "you won, the other guy didn't like poods, and that is a sin." what? it's the 11th commandment. what just happened? well, you like pewdiepie, and i like you then. - i feel like it is the real one.

- my heart is like racing. thank you. you're so sweet and so nice. i don't know why. - well, i mean it's 'cause you won. dude she doesn't know
why we gave her money. - because she was superior over the youtube streamer. - twitch is apparently
a superior platform. - i'm literally shaking. - you have to come to, honestly, twitch... oh my god. - oh my gosh. - $50. "pick rock, paper,
scissors," oh no. scissors. - she picks scissors. - well, i can't find one,
someone who speaks english. you have two minutes. or you just, you forfeit. - i need you to pick one. - paper. - i won. - dang it. - haha. yes.
- dang it. - how much do i give her? 1500? - yes. - what the, what, what the, what the heck? that's not real. there's
no way that's real. - i feel like i'm kind of numb to donating to streamers now. like, you know, i've done it so much. it's just kinda like, i
don't think we're gonna be doing much more twitch donation videos. i've just kind of like, i don't know. i've like i've done this a lot. so this will probably be one
of the last ones i'll do. i don't know how to explain it, but like giving money
to people is fun to me, but i've just done this so much that it's kind of starting
to lose it's funness. like i'm sure if you added it up i've probably given like hundreds
of twitch streamers money, and it's kind of like,
you know what i mean? it's kind of just like the
same thing over and over. so i don't know. you get the point. - mrbeast, thank you so much. what, what even, what even just happened? [music] mrbeast6000, oh, oh [music] [music] mrbeast6000, oh, oh [music] [music] his random videos are
the name of the game [music] [music] some might saying they're
his ticket to fame [music] [music] the occasional intro
may not make sense [music] [music] we all get a laugh at their expense [music] [music] mrbeast6000 oh, oh [music]
