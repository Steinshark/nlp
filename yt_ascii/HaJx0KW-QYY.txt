sometimes in python we want to retrieve a element from an array and we actually want to randomly select it and usually we can go ahead and create our own implementation for this but python has a better way of doing this and the method that i'm talking about today is called choice and we can import that from random so from random we're going to go ahead and import choice and the way this works is that given a non-empty array so any array that has at least one element or more it's going to pick one at random so for example if we go ahead and say numbers and that's equal to 1 2 3 4 5 we'll format that we can go ahead and say random number is going to equal a choice from the numbers and it's going to pick a random element each time we run this script so if we go ahead and print the random number right click on main and run this we'll get 4 as a response and each time we rerun this script we're going to get a different response so this is an incredible one-liner that you can import into python and use immediately it works with any non-empty array so you don't need to create an extra variable but you can just paste it in there if you want to make it exactly one line and it still looks very clean and if you rerun that it's going to pick a random element from the array and that's actually just a very useful function i found in python that i wanted to share with you guys but with that being said that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's video do let me know if you already knew about this in the comment section down below although there's a cool function that you want to share just leave it in the comment section down below and i would love to look into it and with that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next lesson
