hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the 2019 mazda miata mx-5 rf so it's got the hard top convertible and what better vehicle to be sitting in to discuss horsepower and why horsepower is so overrated so i'm not saying you shouldn't care about horsepower but in this video i'm going to give you five reasons why i believe you should care far less about horsepower than perhaps you do and to start things off with an analogy i feel like if i were to walk into a gym which is an intimidating place to me because clearly i don't lift weights that high in weight value you know there there's an ego associated with being in a gym there's there's the egotistical side of it and it's like look how much weight i can pick up cool great whatever and the same thing happens in the car world with horsepower we have these bragging rights that we put behind a single number that single horsepower number and it's almost as if every other factor is far less important and so my goal with this video is to tell you that no those other factors are very important and so starting off reason number one why i think horsepower is overrated is that we all simply go with the peak horsepower that's what everyone talks about what's the peak power that this thing has this car has'1 horsepower if you were questioning how much horsepower does the miata have someone would probably tell you well it's at'1 for 2019 that's how much power it has but that peak number doesn't tell you the full story if a car is turbocharged if it's supercharged if it's electric you know all these things will dramatically change the curve and how much average horsepower you're actually putting down at any one given moment so a great comparison and it's kind of disappointing for me but anyways we're going to talk about my s2000 for a moment the car weighed about 2900 pounds as i had it maybe 28.50 something like that and had about 270 horsepower at the wheels now a nissan leaf weighs about 3 500 pounds so significantly heavier and has about 150 horsepower at the crank not at the wheels okay well that electric nissan leaf out accelerates my supercharged s2000 with significantly more power and significantly less weight to 50 miles an hour to 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 all the way to 50. it's not until 60 miles an hour that my s2000 actually starts to be quicker than a nissan leaf and that's kind of silly like you look at the numbers and you think well why would it be it has more power it has less weight the end but that's not the story electric motors create a lot of power on the low end they have that peak torque immediately and so on that low end where the s2000 is doing absolutely nothing at all and just hoping that one day vtec will kick in you know that electric car is putting down full torque and so it out accelerates it even though it weighs more and it has less power so the whole point of that is to say that the curve is very important and the peak number is not all that important especially as we start to get more and more electric cars and you can see how quickly they can accelerate with low horsepower numbers now point number two is what does horsepower actually tell us well it's a major contributing factor to a vehicle's top speed so there's really two important things for determining how fast can a vehicle go it's aerodynamic properties how much drag does it have and then it's horsepower weight plays very little role in determining a vehicle's top speed it plays a tiny little role but really it's not that important it just tells you how long will it take you to get up to that top speed but it won't really change your top speed all that much so horsepower is that defining role but why do we care about top speed i mean it's something that hardly anyone is ever going to attain in their vehicles unless perhaps you live near the salt flats in utah or in germany and you're constantly on the autobahn you get to try out you know these high-speed runs but for the rest of us living on public roads with speed limits and the true constraints of like life you don't get to go up to those top speeds it's just not something that's feasible and so what's more important of course then is acceleration and horsepower of course does play a role in acceleration but only up until a certain point because at some point you become traction limited rather than power limited so here's my example a shelby gt500 has 760 horsepower that's amazing and it gets you excited you're like oh heck yes i want to drive a gt500 i do i do want to drive one 760 horsepower sounds awesome but here's the thing that car hits 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds why because it's traction limited a tesla model 3 performance which weighs about the same a little bit less but has all-wheel drive but only about 450 470 horsepower so it's down you know 200 horsepower it's able to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds so 0.3 seconds faster even though it weighs about the same and is down about 200 horsepower why well it's all-wheel drive and it's capable of putting down all the power it's not traction limited it's power limited and so with a lot of cars once you start getting into these crazy high horsepower numbers they become traction limited and you just have to ask yourself what's the point where do i want to be able to accelerate quickly do i want to be able to accelerate quickly on the low end which i think if we were all to say you know where do i want all that power to be where do i want to enjoy myself it would probably be in the 0 to 60 range because that's what we actually get to live with on a day-to-day basis without breaking the law once you get into the 100-150 mile per hour range yeah it's awesome to have that on a track but how often are you on a track and if you're not you don't even get to experience that joy so where the you know shelby gt500 is power limited and not traction limited is at an illegal speed and so it's like you have to start to wonder why am i putting so much value on that one number when useful power is more important than a giant power number that ultimately is going to tell me what my top speed is that i won't actually be able to achieve unless i go on a track or some salt flats or the auto bun so i think there's an importance and distinction there of what do you care about and if it actually has acceleration then you should care about useful power not a meaningless peak number now number three and this is where the miata starts to shine is that horsepower is heavy that's just the facts when you start adding power you either need a larger engine you need turbochargers you need cooling for those turbochargers you need cooling for all that power that you're making you need to beef up your axles your transmission your brakes as a result so once you start adding power to a car you start adding weight to a car it's just inevitable and so by adding that weight you know you you sacrifice a lot of things so here's some examples this mazda miata weighs about 2340 pounds a ferrari 488 amazing supercar right 900 pounds heavier than this the new supra a thousand pounds heavier than this the new corvette 1200 pounds heavier than this nissan gtr 1500 pounds heavier than this shelby gt500 1900 pounds heavier than this tesla model s performance 2600 pounds heavier than this so more than double this car's weight and then the porsche taikan turbo yes it is pronounced tycon not taken even though that's how it's spelled and the reason i think porsche is doing all this putting a turbo on it calling it tycon even though it's spelled take-hand or taken is to distract us from the fact that it's 2 800 pounds heavier than this mazda miata 5100 pounds in a sports car and so you know maybe it's this luxury ev sports car and that's kind of the new thing is it's just going to be this absurdly heavy thing but i don't think we should just give porsche you know a pass on having a 5100 pound car i think that's absurd and i think vehicles like this which you have the weight down it enhances so many aspects of the vehicle and as a result you know yeah it doesn't have that crazy acceleration but this thing's hitting 0 to 60 and 5.7 seconds that's quicker than a 2010 v6 camaro it's quicker than a v6 all-wheel drive dodge challenger so this thing is quick and another part about why weight is so important is from an aerodynamic standpoint and so let's say you create something that has really good downforce a car that has 2 000 pounds of down force at speed that's great that means you're going to be able to corner really well well let's say your car weighs 4 000 pounds so you've got two thousand pounds of downforce on top of the four thousand pound car well because of that you're gonna be able to corner at 1.5 g's which is very respectable it's a very high number that's super impressive however if your car weighed two thousand pounds and it still had two thousand pounds of down force then you could corner it two g's rather than 1.5 so simply by taking out weight but having downforce remain the same your cornering is going to improve dramatically and that's all you're changing you're just changing the weight of the car you're not changing the downforce or there are dynamic features of that car now point number four i want to talk about acceleration because obviously we all as like car enthusiasts enjoy acceleration and that's why we like horsepower but i think one of the distinctions that we need to make about what we enjoy about horsepower is jerk rather than acceleration so what's the difference well velocity is speed that you're going right and then your acceleration is the change in rate of your velocity now jerk is the change in rate of your acceleration and so what that means is you know if i'm not accelerating right now and then i put my foot down and we're instantly at peak torque that would be very high jerk you know puts me back in my seat that's fun that's response and that's what makes electric cars very fun is because they have that immediate torque and you get that really high jerk that puts you back in your seat so if you have a really high horsepower car but it's turbocharged and it's got a giant turbo and it takes forever for that turbo to spool up and you put down your foot and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and then that torque starts to build up it's not as thrilling than if you just put your foot down and immediately get planted in your seat that's more exciting and that's jerk and that's more about response rather than how much power the vehicle has so it's not necessarily that you have to have a high horsepower car to have fun accelerating it's that you want to have response from your car when you are accelerating okay now point number five we're talking about horsepower versus fun so you know think about like creating a little spreadsheet of what makes a vehicle fun and then weighting the different items within that spreadsheet you know certain values to say okay i care about this like for example you care about horsepower you care about acceleration you care about braking you care about steering you care about you know how it handles what it feels like you care about grip and so there are a lot of things that you will care about and say these are all the qualities that i want in a vehicle and horsepower is just one of those qualities but the sad thing about horsepower is that if you tend to weight that value higher if you say this is more important you start to sacrifice all those other values so you know handling gets worse as as horsepower goes up because you add weight weight is really the critical thing that combines all performance aspects of a car and it's so underrated we don't care about it nearly enough not enough cars i mean this is the lightest fun car that really exists that actually was trying to be an enthusiast vehicle that is sold in america today this is it yes you can get like a smart 4-2 and it weighs less but it's not designed to be a car that's fun to drive this is rear-wheel drive it's manual transmission and it's designed little roadster it's designed to be a riot to drive and so you know all these cars focus on being fun to drive and they seem to care so little about weight even though if you look at that spreadsheet and all the metrics that you say matter to enjoying driving acceleration is just one of them weight impacts that and power plays a negative role on basically everything else on that spreadsheet and so that's kind of the disappointing thing to me that we all care so much about power and it's always this horsepower war and and we don't seem to break that cycle and say you know what hey 300 horsepower at the wheels is plenty give me a car that weighs 2 500 pounds and you're going to be having a riot in it and and we don't take that approach we instead take the approach of it's okay that it weighs 4 500 pounds but hey guess what it's got 800 horsepower so that's cool right so all of this is to say that i just appreciate the heck out of what mazda has done with this vehicle the new nd miata and this is the 2019 i am six foot one i don't like the rf because it has a little bit less headroom and with the soft top you get a more immersive experience when you put the top down so i'm not big on the rf i think it looks better but i think that's it's only redeeming quality it's also heavier but as far as the 2019 mazda has made some really cool changes the engine has more horsepower'1 horsepower it's revving higher 7500 rpm and best thing of all i'm six foot one i fit in here and my knees do not hit the steering wheel when i let the clutch out why because they now finally have a telescoping steering wheel in the miata which is just oh it adds a lot to the experience when you bring the wheel a little bit in you don't have to worry about your knees and you just get to focus on enjoying how well this thing behaves and just how nimble and tossable and fun it is i mean mazda has knocked it out of the park with this car and if i can recommend a vehicle to anyone to to have fun at safe legal speeds this is it and it's just because of weight weight is the thing we should all care way more about and talk about more and be like yo porsche why is your new ev sounds cool it looks great i think it's going to be you know fun to drive but why is it 5100 pounds that's insane we need we need to get out of that we need to get more into the mentality of course under 3 000 pounds and i think we will all have much bigger smiles on our faces so anyways thank you for listening to my ramble about why i don't care about horsepower that much and why i think you know vehicles like this are what make driving fun i appreciate you guys watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
