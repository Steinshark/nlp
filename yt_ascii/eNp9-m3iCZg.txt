super mario 64 one of the most iconic speedruns of all time top level runs are beautiful there's incredible movement bizarre glitches and awesome tricks it all adds up to a super popular speedrun giving mario 64 the impressive legacy it has but i've got a secret to share all the gameplay you've just seen was performed with a blindfold on this might sound too insane to be real but for the past several years players have been trying to speedrun super mario 64 without looking at the screen how is this possible how do you take a three-dimensional game and not only play it with your eyes closed

blindfolded runs have been a staple at games done quick events and runners have even grinded at home to optimize blindfolded world records but those were usually for simpler games compared that to mario 64 with its 3d gameplay and wide open levels getting consistency with this seemed out of the question and for many years nobody bothered trying but then we arrive in 2017 when the main character of our story comes onto the scene neet busia busia had seen players like runner guy 2489 and 360 crism play blindfolded 3d games before and it inspired him to see what he could do in super mario 64 bubs has started by figuring out a few basic stars blindfolded from there he expanded to the rest of the game he slowly built up his skills throughout 2017 and finally by october he was ready to try for the first full game completion of blindfolded super mario 64 here's how he did it first off this was a 16st star run of the game collecting at least 70 stars is the intended glitchless route but that was not going to happen with a blindfold on instead bbia performed a popular speedrunning route collect 16 of the easiest stars then tackle a couple glitches to skip to the last stage that was much more manageable than going for 70 stars right from bub's first inputs you can see his general strategy he ran forward until he heard mario hit the wall then turned right and kept going it was slow but these inputs were hard to mess up and he eventually made it to the cut scene in bob on battlefield bubz worked on getting to the top of the mountain for the first star he used the camera angles to his advantage he'd run forward till he hit an object then carefully adjusted the camera and kept moving forward this normalized his movement and lined him up so he'd always end up running to the same place every time after gradually inching his way up the slope he got to use audio techniques on the boss he backflipped to pick him up then counted the audio of mario's footsteps to know when he was in the middle this lined him up so he was perfectly underneath the star when it spawned bbia ended up collecting three stars in b on battlefield and they all followed the same idea very simple and safe setups to reliably work his way through the map he then headed to wamps fortress where he ultimately picked up five more stars he used a plethora of strategies to get these slowly back flipping up the long ramp running from wall to- wall and even using a bit of muscle memory his setups were so normalized that whenever something went slightly off script he usually couldn't recover and either died or restarted this happened nine times throughout w's fortress bbia continued through the game slowly but surely collecting stars while a lot of his strategies looked safe they required an unbelievable amount of memorization and skill to do blindfolded none were harder than the bowser stages he needed inside out knowledge of the level to ensure he could platform without looking he had a clever scp strategy for the bowser fight itself by constantly letting go and reg grabbing his tail mario gradually moves forward eventually you'll collide with the bomb and skip having to somehow aim a bowser throw without being able to see after an hour and 25 minutes bubs had collected 15 stars he had a precise setup to grab myips the rabbit and then counted mario's footsteps to know when to turn through the hallways to clip through the doors bub zia had more setups that involved reg grabbing mips repeatedly they worked and bub zia was through both doors after a few minutes but then he arrived at the hardest part of the entire run bowser in the fire sea there are so many cycles moving objects and obstacles all over the place that even with the best setups bbia couldn't consistently make it through he had a few smart strategies to help by listening in the silly kicks he could tell where the platform was in its cycle a longer distance between each kick meant it was moving down and a shorter distance meant it was moving [music] up and later on by back flipping onto this box bub zia knew that even if he took damage in the lava he was lined up with the heart so he could recover safe strategies like these helped but it still took bb had nearly an hour to get through fire sea with 11 deaths along the way but eventually he cleared the level and after 2 and 1/2 hours he was in the home stretch next up were backwards long jumps and there was no big secret to doing these blindfolded he just had to line up and hope his mashing got him through the door and up the stairs and finally bowser in the sky it's quite similar to fire se in that there's several cycles you have to deal with the hardest being the two elevators right at the very end but thanks to a combination of back flips audio cues and normalization setups bubs had made it through after three deaths the final bowser fight requires three throws and bubsy's strategy for the first two was letting bowser run at him then dropping him right into the bomb but that's not an option for throw three so he had to just randomly spin bowser and hope he hit a long one random throw away from history being made first try okay okay calm down i need to connect this stu calm down guys calm down [music] guys please man please should be to the left two back flips or one back flip no no no that's not good that's not good yes we did it yes guys we did it bbia had shocked the world he could literally beat super mario 64 with his eyes closed probably one of the craziest gaming achievements ever now his run did take over 3 hours and he either died or restarted 33 times across the game there was room for optimization if bbia so desired but he didn't he was the only person in the world capable of doing this and he was happy to move on with his life but little did bubs know while he was working on his 16 star run there was another player on the other side of the world doing the exact same thing zerf neither player knew of the other's existence and bub's completed run came as a big surprise to zerf he was still working on individual stars this other guy was way ahead of him but zurf wasn't deterred he talked with bbia learning some of his strategies while improving on his own he found different routes to take and ways he could complete certain stars faster by the time he started full game runs in early 2018 he was a much improved player zerf ended up beating bub's run by a few minutes on february 2nd and a month later he took a full hour off the world record mario 64 completed blindfolded in an hour and 58 minutes a big part of the improvement was the fact that zerf simply died less than bbia he had to restart just 15 times across the run compared to busia's 33 but his route through the game was also quicker for one thing he opted to collect both peach slide stars he had a fairly safe strategy to leap over the edge and make it to the end before 21 seconds that's fast for a blindfolded star he also switched out a couple stars in hazy maze cave to save a bit more time but beyond the route changes zerf was simply faster than bbia he used more audio cues to his advantage for instance in the bowser stages he could tell where the rotating platforms were based on what part of the background music was playing and just all over the run zurf strategies were a bit riskier running up a slope rather than back flipping and using fewer setups meanwhile as zerf was lowering the mario 64 blindfolded record bubo was working on other blindfolded games most notably pokemon and kingdom hearts he planned to come back to mario 64 eventually but if nothing else these other games were still helping him improve as a blindfolded speedrunner he picked up on different blindfolded strategies and ideas while he played and as the months passed bubs realized there was one technique that might really help with mario 64 something that would make his movement look much more fluid almost like he was playing with his eyes open that fall busia came back to mario 64 implementing a trick called beat counting beat counting is essentially using the background music's beat as a metronome to time your inputs to now it's important to note that this isn't the same as a music cu that's where you wait for a specific moment in the song to use as a [music] queue instead beat counting is simply having a consistent frame of reference in this case the beat of the song to help time different [music] inputs for example you can run forward then know to jump after three beats then press jump again after four more beats and so on this can help make otherwise brutal sections become nearly trivial as it replaces insane muscle memory with consistent inputs beat counting was first implemented in super mario 64 by a player named katon who used it in his 70 star run it helped him all over allowing for fluid movement that looked like a visual player at times after seeing it utilized in other speed games bubs decided he had to try using it in 16 star so in september 2018 he came back to super mario 64 he wanted to see how much time he could take off of z surf's record of 1 hour and 58 minutes how much could beat counting help well right away bubs has saved time on the very first star he picked up a box and navigated into the corner of the gate by beat counting by then setting it down on top of mario's hitbox he got pushed behind the gate and was able to collect the star this is an obscure old trick known as box clip and predates the more traditional bomb clip used in modern visual runs new strategies with beat counting were used throughout the game often these helped big time with consistency as well as being faster the slide in cool cool mountain was now beat counted and bubs had a safer myips grab thanks to beat counting too but the biggest time saves with beat counting were the bowser stages especially fire se as you recall this is probably the hardest level in the run it took zurf over 17 minutes to get through it in his world record but here bbia used a beat count for the entire stage developed by katun highlights included a section in the middle where he navigated without adjusting the camera since he couldn't see anyway there was no point in changing the camera angle he still knew exactly where to go pbia flew through the whole level and ultimately he completed it in just 2 minutes a 15minute time save over zurf that's the power of beat counting pubo was cruising the run was far from perfect but after demolishing fire se he knew he was way ahead of zf's world record he couldn't see his exact pace of course but he knew it had potential to be a big record the backwards long jumps went well and thanks to beat counting and other audio cues bowser in the sky was quick too once again it all came down to hitting this last bowser throw and then he could find out just what type of pace this really [music] was yes yes su 53 yes yes yes this was ahead of even his wildest dreams not only was it sub hour but it was sub hour by several minutes the whole game beaten blindfolded in 53 minutes the run did have its slow moments he died a handful of times and the worst part was when he had to intentionally drown to restart in dire dire docks but being able to cut a world record in half did not happen very often this was everything bub zia wanted and more beat counting had changed blindfolded mario 64 forever but once again bubsy had decided this was a good place to stop despite there still being room for improvements he remained interested in exploring other blindfolded speedruns so he stopped playing and for the next year his blindfolded world record remained unchallenged but of course bubo wasn't going to stay away for long 16 star was his bread and butter and if you've seen my other videos generally people who dominate a game can't help but come back to it time and time again bub zia wanted to see just how low he could take the blindfolded record so after a 10-month break he spent the summer of 2019 rerouting the run changing up the stars a bit and trying to optimize his strategies by august he was ready to start up runs again and over the course of just 11 days he did [music] [music] [music] this i'm not happy man i'm not happy at [music] [music] all no wa it wo wo you kidding me [music] dud oh my god [music] [music] an unbelievable grind thanks to a combination of beat counting incredible muscle memory and a ton of skill bubs had beaten super mario 64 blindfolded in under 40 minutes this run had one big mistake during myips he got lost and had to quit back to the menu it cost about 2 minutes so a 36-minute run would be the limit but there were no major mistakes anywhere else 38 minutes was incredibly optimized for this type of run it was exact ly what he was looking for bbia really was the king of blindfolded mario 64 hardly anyone else had tried it and those who had were well behind him he could do with his eyes closed what others couldn't do with their eyes open and this 38-minute run was his magnumopus bbia was finally done with the grind no one else even approaching his times and then 3 weeks later something very interesting happened completely out of the blue a new submission appeared for the blindfolded mario 64 leaderboards the player's name was nobori 56 and he was claiming to have performed a 35-minute blindfolded run a new world record nobody in the community had heard of him before and having someone brand new instantly claim a big world record was suspicious to say the least and when the community watched his run it only got stranger he wasn't beat counting at all in fact it seemed like nearly everything he did was muscle memory he looked an awful lot like he could see what was happening on screen at least somewhat blindfolded speedruns can be easy to fake if you can get any vision through your blindfold it makes the run magnitudes easier this was a tough one to call maybe nobori was just an unbelievable blindfolded gamer or maybe he was a cheater over the following few weeks nobori continued submitting runs and gradually everything became [music] clear noori was 100% legit and he was actually that good so here's the thing with nabori he has an absolute knack for developing muscle memory once he does a trick with his eyes open it doesn't take much practice until he can consistently do it without looking therefore the idea of beat counting never even entered his mind and he was able to perform nearly everything faster even right from their first movements in the castle you can see the difference bubs had to set up his moves and work his way to the first door but noori adjusted the camera at the perfect moment to do [music] this basically indistin isable from a visual runner how about getting to peach's slide genuinely impressive even with eyes open it was more of the same with the stars nobori went for super fast strategies no beat count setups necessary even though he died a few times the time save for moving faster more than made up for it but as you might expect the place that nabori improved the most was the bowser stage when busia played bowser in the sky he kept moving but didn't do anything too flashy super impressive for being blindfolded but nobody would mistake it for a speedrun noori on the other [music] hand standing left side and elevator skip it's really hard to believe that all this is possible while blindfolded but in in case there's any doubt theori couldn't see at the end of every run he took off his' blindfolds no way anyone could see through all that he was simply so much better than any other blindfolded player he was running while the rest were walking nobori had achieved a 26-minute blindfolded run of super mario 64 simply inconceivable just a few weeks ago there's one more moment of noor's run i want to talk about the final bowser throw right at the very end this throw had a few different strategies over the years bubsy's initial method was to just blindly throw and hope it hit a bomb but zurf realized that since the whoosh sound occurs at the same time in every spin you could sink up your joystick to the spinning and know exactly when to release bowser to hit a [music] bomb this was the strategy that bubs had preferred to use use but noori took it a step further and used something else that zerf had found by pausing during the whoosh sound you can listen to the echo and judge whether or not mario is facing the [music] bomb if he's not then you simply unpause and try again but if he is then you can immediately unpause and throw bowser it'll hit the bomb every time this is a brilliant example of turning a seemingly impossible t landing a blindfolded bowser throw into something relatively consistent even though he was miles ahead of everyone else nobori still felt he could save time over his 26-minute run he died a couple times and had a particularly slow myip grab so a few months later nobori came back and improved the record to 25 minutes a run that would have been even faster had he not failed to grab bowser's tail and had to redo the fight and just two days after that noori made one more improvement this run was truly incredible from start to finish he collected the first 11 stars quickly with no substantial time losses he died once in hazy ma cave but it didn't cost him badly his myips grab was instantaneous right in front of the door his bowser stages were all fantastic his bljs were super quick and on the last fight he grabbed bowser tail and landed the third throw no retries [music] needed 24 minutes is a genuinely respectable time with your eyes open noori had optimized this run to insane standards hard to believe it was all actually possible as for bubs it was tough to accept what had just happened he'd been the king of blindfolded mario 64 for years and noori had demolished all of his times when bubs had tried doing theori strategies he could eventually pull most of them off but his consistency was poor definitely not good enough to complete a full run with them bbia had to accept that he wasn't going to be beating noor's record for the next year blindfolded 16 star had no activity there was no point when the world record was this good players focused on other categories with less optimized records and unsurprisingly noori took the top spot for those too just pure domination but eventually everything calmed down noori stopped playing and the rest didn't bother trying to beat his times it almost felt like he had killed blindfolded mario 64 but then in october 2020 buban managed to get at 16 star into that year's awesome games done quick this was the first time anyone would be showing off blindfolded mario 64 on such a big stage busia may not have been on noori's level but he wanted to put on a good show so he knew he had to get practicing bbia didn't have any illusions of trying to take the record instead he focused on playing for fun looking for new strategies and not taking things too seriously and maybe he can improve a bit on his 38-minute pb since noori's crazy muscle memory strategies were out of the question bubs focused on beat counting strategies he found faster ones in w's fortress and cool cool mountain and on bowser in the sky beat counting allowed him to make a faster elevator cycle at the start but despite lots of practice he was still slower than noori and he was dying more the improvements slowly started to come in first a 37-minute run and then nearly a month later a 35-minute run both of these had substantial time losses on the bljs so bubs knew he had the potential to go a few minutes lower but this is exactly what he was looking for even if he wasn't competing with noori it was still nice to see some improvement and as the weeks passed bbia kept getting better his movement was faster and he was dying less often he started going for laat to skip sometimes it wasn't very consistent but getting it at all while blindfolded was amazing bubsy's potential was much faster than 35 minutes if he could just string it all together in a [music] run fast mips okay it's very good okay please be aj dude it will come down to the bjs dude i'm up oh my god this defense up 30 this was a fantastic run for bubs he nailed nearly all of his strategies and had he not missed a throw on bowser and had to restart the run would have been a sub30 but still it was a great improvement he wasn't quite on the boris's level but he was getting closer even though it took months to get here this was a clear improvement noori hadn't played the category in a long time maybe bubs had the chance to close the gap even more but instead right after bubsy's new pb nobori came back it's me [music] mario [music] he made it seem effortless noori's strategies were somehow even faster than before to get to the top of w's fortress instead of teleporting he jumped off the slope while sliding to make it up he switched up a few stars and had a brilliant strategy to hit the talon star in shifting sandland and most importantly it was just incredible that he was doing all this while blindfolded occasionally he'd have a moment that looked obvious like when he struggled to collect stars that were right in front of him but he'd turn around the next moment and do something like this mindblowing bubs had improved yes but he was not on the b's level it almost seemed like he could lower the record at will but he decided to stop here with the world record down to 23 minutes nabori had once again killed the competition and blindfolded 16 star bbia knew he wasn't beating this nobody was beating it so instead he spent much of 2021 focusing on a new challenge routing a blindfolded 120 star run this was a massive undertaking and took up most of his gaming time throughout the year yet even though he wasn't playing the more competitive category in 16 star working on 120 star still helped him improve at the game he was optimizing the stars for speed and as a result found some new strategies for instance in bob on battlefield he found a consistent setup for bomb clip the iconic trick he used to get behind the fence quickly it saves 20 seconds and looks pretty darn impressive given its performed blindfolded after practicing 12 star for several months bubs came back to the game's shorter categories in late 2021 quickly sweeping through each one to lower his pbs in 16 te star he managed to get a 28-minute run featuring his new tricks still slower than noori especially in the bowser stages but a decent improvement after this he went back to working on 120 star and noor's record remained as safe as ever at this point he had held the record for more than 2 years bubs hadn't been able to catch him and nobody else was within 15 minutes of him as 2022 came around it was really seeming like this was nibor's record to keep he could simply do things with a blindfold on that nobody else could at least nobody who had tried so far the only hope of beating noori was somebody new coming along who had their own set of incredible blindfolded skills someone like hyman in late 2021 hyman became infatuated with blindfold olded super mario 64 that september he became just the third person to beat the game blindfolded in under an hour by january his time was down to 35 minutes and by march he lowered his pb to right behind bubs impressive improvement from a relative newcomer to blindfolding gaming hendy's play style was like a hybrid between busia and nobori he didn't beat count with numbers but didn't fully rely on muscle memory either many of his fastest strategies involved music cues he'd mess around in a level with his eyes open and figure out how to time certain actions to the music eventually he'd find a series of inputs that gave him the best consistency and practice it relentlessly until he could do it blindfolded hendy got really good at this and it paid off with a 28-minute run he fell behind bubs while collecting the stars since he died a few times but he was actually faster than bubs down the stretch it was gold split after gold s split for myips fire sea and bowser in the sky after hitting the last throw on bowser he knew he had a big [music] pb let's go holy a couple months later hendy got on another good run it started with both lacu skip and bomb clip and then he gained big time in bowser in the dark world unfortunately he struggled and then died in hazy ma cave died twice in fire sea and died on bowser at the very end that's four deaths yet he still pbd by a full minute and moved ahead of bbia into second place hendy had gotten really good despite several minutes of time loss the rest of his run was so fast that he couldn't help but pb hendy's movement and speed was incredible and it was honestly starting to look a lot like nobori the only thing he didn't have was noori's consistency these mistakes made up the bulk of the difference it was safe to say that hy was officially a world record contender and over the next few months things would get quite interesting hendy started practicing the last few tricks he needed to learn like standing left side and elevator skip and most importantly he worked hard to build his consistency he knew that he had the skills to get this world record he just needed to hold it together for long enough and get it all to line up in one [music] run i don't know what just happened i think i fat fingered [music] a [music] dude [music] yeah you did super mario 6416 star 26 [music] minutes you did super blindfolded in 25 minutes and 11 seconds [music] you did super mario 64 that's three days in a row hendy was closing in this was a 24-minute run with two deaths and other scattered time losses throughout there was easily a minute worth of improvements he could make but hendy was getting exhausted doing hundreds of runs with your eyes closed gets monotonous and he enjoyed looking for strategies more than he enjoyed doing runs so even though he was so close hendy decided to take a break from 16 star and instead focus on blindfolded one star an even shorter category meanwhile bbia was watching everything hendy did in 16 star he was amazed at how close he'd gotten to nobori and after completing the world's first blindfolded 120 star run in may bubo was ready for a new challenge he'd improved so much while on on the 120 star grind and had gotten especially good at searching for new strategies bub zia had turned into a new player his old 28-minute pb and 16 star was in a distant third place in july 2022 he embarked on a quest to change that bubs still couldn't rely on muscle memory as heavily as nabori that meant his game playay would generally be a bit slower as he had to set things up more but if he can make up the difference with faster strategies maybe he had a chance at this he and hendy found new tricks all across the run like triple jumping off the wamp while going up top and long jumping straight across the gap in dark world these small improvements began to add up but the heavy hitters were in the final two bowser stages bubs found a beat count to reach naor's elevator cycle in fire se cutting out his muscle memory strategies while matching his speed and name bowser in the sky bbia decided he had to commit to going for everything standing left side elevator skip and even doing a triple jump dive onto the rotating platform buban knew this would help make up for some of the speed and movement difference but would it be enough that july he got on a run that fell about 45 seconds behind nobori after the first eight stars after accidentally quitting out of lethal laval land and missing the star in dire dire docks his death deficit rose to over 2 and 1/2 minutes but he did manage to gain time on the bljs and executed his new bowser in the sky strategies to perfection the end result was a 2549 2 minutes behind the record and 1 minute behind hendy bbia was a changed player look he hadn't held the record in three years now nabori had always been just too dominant to beat but this run was proof that finally he was fast enough the world record was within reach if bbia could clean up a couple blunders in the middle of the run then he could finally get the top spot back bbia got off to a great start he hit all his new strategies through dark world and had a 20 second lead over neori in lethal lava land he looked like a visual runner collecting the eight coins no hesitations he nailed getting on the submarine in dire dire docks and had a beautiful fire seat all of a sudden busia had himself a deathless run into the [music] [music] bljs [music] boom yes oh my god dude it's over after three long years bbia was back on top it had taken a monumental effort to beat noori but it all paid off he still couldn't use muscle memory the way noori did nobody could but through years of strategizing and improving he was able to make up the difference anyway congratulations poured in and bbia pondered what to do next a sub 23-minute run was definitely within reach but ultimately he decided a 2317 was good enough and moved on to other categories in the time since since this run hendy and noori have been inactive from blindfolded gaming bbia on the other hand after taking a break for a few months he returned to 16 star by early 2023 and ever since then he's been on a quest for a sub2 minute blindfolded run sub20 is a milestone for visual runners taking the blindfolded world record there would be completely insane but that's what bubo was determined to do it all started when busia and nico the category's current fourth place runner began developing a way to perform blindfolded lblj this trick is used in top level visual runs by jumping into an outof bounds area in the lobby it's possible to then precisely do a backwards long jump that sends you into bowser in the dark world an area that normally requires eight stars once there you want to collect the eight red coins to obtain a star so that you can later head straight to w's fortress they found methods to complete lblj and the red coins blindfolded but obviously it was a major difficulty increase and when combining that with other tricks like owless and improving movement everywhere they reasoned that a sub 20-minute run was indeed possible but possible and realistic are two separate things in mid 2023 busia decided to make a push for the sub 20 quickly though he found that the lblj route was far too inconsistent after abandoning it he focused on optimizing the rest of the run and managed to lower the record down to 22 minutes yeah a minute but to get the sub20 busia knew the lblj had to be implemented in january 2024 he took another look at the route with nico and another community member honey beef they realized it was would be faster to skip cool cool mountain entirely adding another star in shifting sandland and lethal lava land instead this saved another 20 seconds and now bbia felt that he had to commit to lblj the upside was too good to pass up on february 15th 2024 bbia managed to land lblj and the reds in his fastest time ever word record he struggled a bit with the new stars dying once each in shifting sandland and lethal lava land but even still he was hitting most of his new strategies he had a clean fire sea then got both blj's first try after flying through bowser in the sky bubs had a chance at a big world record [applause] no no i think i threw it yes okay at least second try [music] man yes yes a 21-minute run with two deaths and a missed throw it wouldn't have quite been a sub 20 but clearly the run still has room to go lower and this 2148 is where the record stands today busia is still still actively pushing for the sub 20 and if hendy or nobori come back they can certainly get there too it's unreal to see the progression from bub's first blindfolded run 6 years ago to what he and others can pull off today they went from barely limping through the game to flying through like a visual runner all this difference in just 6 years i don't know about you but i can't wait to see what another 6 years of progression will do to to this run
