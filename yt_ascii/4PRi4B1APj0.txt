hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about the new tesla roadster and how the cold gas thrusters which are going to be on this roadster essentially rockets how these rockets work and by analyzing these rockets and figuring out how they work we can determine the performance characteristics of the tesla roadster so acceleration breaking distances cornering that sort of thing and what i think is really cool about this video is that the conclusions from it will be drawn not based on my own assumptions but based on what has been publicly stated about the tesla roadster so the first thing i want to figure out is how much does the tesla roadster weigh and i have an idea of what i think it's going to weigh but can we figure out how much it's going to weigh based on the limited figures that tesla has provided so they've told us that the roadster will have a 0 to 60 of 1.9 seconds this will be the base version and that it will have 10 000 newton meters of wheel torque so we're trying to figure out the tesla's mass so newton tells us that force is equal to mass times acceleration we can figure out what our force is we can figure out what our acceleration is and then that will allow us to learn what our mass is so the acceleration figure is that 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds so first we're going to find out acceleration then we're going to find out the force and then we can plug all that in to figure out mass so starting off with velocity equals acceleration times time in this case we're accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds 60 miles per hour is about 26.8 meters per second so we're going to set 26.8 meters per second that's our velocity equal to our acceleration times time it only takes us 1.9 seconds to get there and that gives us 14.1 meters per second squared as our acceleration writing that in forms of gs you simply take that 14.1 divide by 9.8 and you get 1.44 g's okay so we know what our acceleration is so now we just need to figure out what our wheel force is and we're given our wheel torque so torque is equal to a force multiplied by a radius so since we know what our torque is and if we can figure out what the wheel's radius is then we can figure out what the wheel force is now on the prototype tesla roadsters you can see on the front wheel there is a 265 over 35 r20 tire and on the rear wheel is a 325 over 30 r21 tire you can do the math to calculate what is the radius of one of these tires and if you take the average of both of them you get a diameter average of about 710 millimeters or about 28 inches this gives you a radius just divide that number by two of 355 millimeters so we can take our wheel torque number and then divide that by our radius 0.355 meters and that gives us a wheel force of 28 170 newtons so now we can get an estimate for how much this car is going to weigh so 28 170 newtons set that equal to mass multiplied by our acceleration 14.1 meters per second squared and that gives us a mass of 1900 kilograms which is conveniently close to 2 000 kilograms so that would be my estimate for what i think the target weight for this vehicle is going to be now do i think it's actually going to weigh just 2 000 kilograms i do not and reason being is that the model s which has a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack the performance version is good for about 350 miles this is claiming that it's going to be good for 620 miles significantly longer range and that model s with 100 kilowatt hour battery pack weighs in at 2 240 kilograms or close to 5 000 pounds so this is 4 400 pounds you know 500 pounds lighter than that model s with significantly more range so what in reality i think is going to happen is this car is going to be heavier than 2000 kilograms and it's actually going to have a higher wheel torque than 10 000 newton meters in fact the model s has about 11 000 newton meters of wheel torque which i calculated in a previous video so i would assume this number will be larger and this number will be larger as well but this is what we're going to use because this is what tesla has stated so for this video we are going to assume a mass of 2 000 kilograms all right so let's move on to the optional package on the tesla roadster the spacex thruster package so instead of the two rear seats you take out those two rear seats and in its place you put a composite overwrapped pressure vessel essentially this is just a tank where you hold really high pressure compressed air how high pressure well on jill rogan's podcast elon has stated around 10 000 psi and then around the vehicle you're going to have these cold gas thrusters so how this works is you have a battery that battery powers a pump that pump pressurizes this copv your composite over a pressure vessel and that composite overhead pressure vessel then can send pressure to thrusters around the vehicle and they've tweeted that there will be about 10 of these cold gas thrusters around the vehicle some of which may be hiding behind a license plate so you can pop the license plate out of the way and then have these thrusters appear and then accelerate really quickly so pretty neat system and it is all run off of the battery so the battery runs pump the pump keeps the pressure and the tank and then of course your discharge will likely be much faster than this pump can keep up with so in times when you're driving that you don't need to use those thrusters at full acceleration the battery will be running this pump and repressurizing this tank so the question is how much thrust how much force do these cold gas thrusters push the tesla roadster with and so i am not a rocket scientist so those of you that are rocket scientists will likely be disappointed by the depth of this explanation however there is an equation out there which we can use to determine the thrust of a rocket the force of thrust is equal to gravity multiplied by specific impulse multiplied by our mass flow rate that's your propellant that's coming out of the rocket now where does this equation come from there is a derivation i will include a link in the video description if you are curious about that but if you look at the units here gravity is in units of meters per second squared specific impulse is in units of seconds and mass flow rate is in units of kilograms per second so if you multiply all that out you get kilogram meters per second squared in other words newtons now if we look at newton's law here force equals mass times acceleration mass is units of kilogram acceleration meters per second squared kilogram time meter per second squared in newtons so you can see the correlation between these two equations here so the big takeaway with all of this is that you're going to have some stuff inside the rocket inside this pressure tank and you're going to throw that stuff outside the rocket you're going to throw it away from the vehicle and in throwing that stuff away from the vehicle you have that equal and opposite reaction where you send your vehicle in the opposite direction so that's all we're doing we're taking a compressed air within this pressure tank and we're throwing it out outside and that's going to push our vehicle forward now again we're trying to figure out how much thrust will these rockets actually create so we have four variables here and if we figure out any three of them then we can determine the last one unfortunately all we know is gravity gravity 9.81 meters per second squared we do not know specific impulse we don't know our mass flow rate we don't know the force of thrust so that's the bad news well what can we figure out well specific impulse is how effectively a rocket uses a propellant it's defined as the change in momentum per unit fuel used so it is given in units of time which doesn't really make sense unless you go through the derivation but it is given in units of seconds so the thing to know about specific impulse is that it's dependent on the design of your rocket and dependent on the propellant used so something like a cold gas thruster where you're not relying on the chemical energy of combustion combusting a fuel is going to have a lower specific impulse than a rocket that is using a combustible fuel so for example the space shuttle its specific impulse of its rockets used 350 seconds versus the cold gas thrusters tend to have a peak of around 70 seconds i found a study saying that nitrogen which is the majority of what compressed air is can have a specific impulse of 73 seconds so for this video we're going to use around 70 seconds as our specific impulse for our cold gas thruster that is one thing that we do not know that tesla has not provided that we are going to have to make some form of an informed assumption about now here's where i got stuck so we know what gravity is i have a decent idea of what the specific impulse might be but i have no way of knowing what the mass flow rate is going to be and so without knowing that there's no way that i can determine what our thrust force is and then i realized i don't have to figure that out as i saw a tweet that elon had posted saying that the tesla roadster will do something like this in reference to a car that was floating so a car was floating and presumably it has to be doing so using downward thrust and so the force of that thrust at a very minimum in order for it to hover must be equal to the vehicle's weight so mass times gravity so we know what our vehicle's mass is we calculated that earlier 2000 kilograms and we can multiply that by gravity essentially 10 meters per second squared and so that gives us a force of thrust minimum of 20 000 newtons now this doesn't include the weight of the driver it doesn't include any cargo capacity anything like that and it wouldn't actually allow you to accelerate up and actually move above the ground it would just allow you to float there basically the car would become weightless so it has to be slightly higher than 20 000 newtons so let's just say 21 kilonewtons or in other words it can accelerate upwards with 1.05 g however you have a downward force of one g so you would be accelerating upwards at just 0.05 g a small amount but enough to just be able to lift you off the ground and then come back down okay so here comes the really exciting part because today's cars are limited in how quickly they can accelerate based on the tires that they have it's all based on grip if they don't have enough grip it doesn't matter how much power you put into them they won't be able to accelerate any faster because they are limited by those tires rockets on the other hand have no such limitation if you have a greater force coming out of the back you accelerate forward quicker it's as simple as that and so you get to add the acceleration of a rocket to the grip of the tires and so if we go back to our original equation velocity equals acceleration times time we can try and calculate what will our theoretical 0 to 60 mile per hour or 100 kilometers per hour b and so we know that our tires are capable of accelerating at about 1.44 gs and we know that our rocket is capable of providing a down force of 1.05 gs now we're going to assume that we can point that thrust in the rearward direction and they're saying that they're going to have these rockets on the back of the car for accelerating so we'll assume that they're back there and they can take advantage of that full 1.05 gs of acceleration so we're adding this 1.45 1.05 we add that together and we get 2.5 gs of acceleration and so we can plug that into our velocity equals acceleration times time equation 26.8 meters per second times 2.5 g's times 9.81 times time and time is 1.1 seconds 0 to 60 in 1.1 seconds which is about twice as good half the time as the next best thing that exists today as far as street cars are concerned so this is extremely impressive now it is important to state the disclaimers that go along with this so this is assuming that the vehicle will be able to hover it's assuming it's going to be able to use that amount of thrust in the rearward direction to push the vehicle forward and it's also assuming that it will have enough thrust to last that full 0 to 60 launch i anticipate it will have enough to do it because i anticipate that this is going to be a little party trick for how to have the fastest 0-60 out there of a street car and so they'll want to make sure that it will last the full duration so i would assume you know something around the 1.1 second time frame is realistic if you start to increase this number you know think if this thing's actually going to accelerate upward especially if it were to have several passengers in the car it's going to need to be significantly higher than 20 000 newtons so if this were to just raise to 25 000 newtons 21 or 25 kilonewtons there that would give you 1.25 g's and in that scenario you would have a dead on one second 0 to 60. and for the car magazines out there that ignore that first foot of acceleration they'll all be saying it does 0 to 60 in under a second which it wouldn't be but potentially it could be depending on how high that force will be so very cool that the the limit of you know cars is being overcome simply by using rockets will be something that you can actually use on the street doubtful but on a track it will certainly feel quite cool or on a drag strip something like that now there are other cool things you can calculate so how about breaking from 60 miles per hour down to zero and what distance can it accomplish this now the best i found out there was the porsche gt2 rs which motor trend tested of having a 60 mile per hour down to zero stopping distance of just 87 feet or about 27 meters this roadster if it was able to apply that full thrust in the forward direction while slamming on the brakes will be capable of stopping from 60 miles per hour down to zero in about half of that 45 to 50ish feet or about 14 meters absolutely insane the kind of stopping power that this might have assuming it has those thrusters up front now finally i want to talk about weights so how much compressed air do you actually need to store on board in order for this to actually be achievable and so we're going to go back to this equation here i want to make sure it doesn't go to waste because it actually is fairly useful so we can rearrange it to calculate our mass flow rate and we're going to calculate it based on our calculated force right here of 21 kilonewtons so 21 kilonewtons multiplied by gravity multiplied by our specific impulse and that gives us a mass flow rate of 30 kilograms per second so for every second you want to be able to use this device you need 30 kilograms or about 66 pounds of air stored on board which is significant but not really unrealistic it's why i say though that i don't think it's gonna last much longer than maybe one or two seconds because think about how much weight that is if you wanted to store five seconds worth of this boost then you're talking about like 300 pounds that are going to be stored on board it's going to take up a lot of space and it's going to be very heavy so there's reasons why you might not want to do that and so i would i would anticipate somewhere in the one to two second range so they can get that party trick of an insanely quick 0 0-60 and as far as cornering is concerned yes you could theoretically have 2g cornering but remember if you're mid-corner and then this thing stops because you only have so much of it well then you lose all that grip and you start sliding so you could go at a lower flow rate and say maybe corner at like 1.1 gs for 10 seconds rather than 2 gs for one second but again it's not going to be in my opinion super useful for cornering unless they really have a significant amount of storage on board as far as how much air they can hold because you would never want the system to run out of air as you're going around that corner so it would likely have to have some sort of feed off you know algorithm in there where it says okay we're running low on pressurized air let's start to decrease how much we're assisting and then you start to understeer and slide off the track so i don't think in cornering you have enough mass enough flow for a long enough duration to make it make sense but certainly for accelerating certainly for stopping and then a fun little floating party trick maybe for like one or two seconds it may be possible either way very cool stuff and very cool how rockets can allow you to skip over you know the boundaries set by street tires so you can get zero to sixties faster than about two seconds which is where current street tires are really limited at as far as zero to sixty times thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
