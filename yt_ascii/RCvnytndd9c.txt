vr challenge, here you go. gabby ended up leaving 10 hours in and mark ended up sticking it
out for' hours with chris. but in the end, chris prevailed. chris, he totally took his headset off. you can take yours off. - i'll never leave. - he totally took his off. take yours off. - i don't believe you. - take yours off. - say scout's honor. - scout's honor. - you were never a

never do vr again, so, it might be over. - well you guys should go subscribe to this channel right here, because he might not do vr anymore and if he does, that's our fault, so we got to help him in his new endeavor. - mr. beast 6,000, oh. - mr. beast. - 6,000 oh.
