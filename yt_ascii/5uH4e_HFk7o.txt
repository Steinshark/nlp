ladies and gentlemen we're currently in a little bit of a quiet phase in the chess world it's currently february 26 2024 and it's been about 2 weeks since we had any sort of massive drama cheating accusations people calling each other ugly going at each other on social media the standard protocol of a professional chess player but one man has been busy and that man is grandmaster hans ne the quote unquote bad boy of chess the most polarizing figure in the chess world in a previous video i called him a superstar i got angry fan mail in my inbox saying that i shouldn't do that hans nean brings out emotions in folks both positive and negative that i've really never seen before and for that reason i'm going to cover his games cuz love him or hate him you're going to watch some of you are cheering him on and some of you are rooting for his demise and to those people i would say crack open a window and get a little bit of fresh air in today's video i'm going to be showing you couple of games that hans played in a recent tournament and he always provides bangers his games win or lose feature insane drama plot twists devastating attacks unre blunders and i'll be getting into two of these games today that's all i have for you let's let's move right along here the first game that i have for you i'm actually covering these games out of order he was playing in a tournament called the gerba masters gerba is is an island off of the coast of i believe tunisia and one of his opponents was belel bell senate and belel is algerian but after this video you should go google ble and then google logic the rapper i've never seen two people who look more similar in some images bell literally looks like logic the rapper so logic opened the game with e4 hans played c5 the sicilian defense always confrontational always looking for a fight it's a perfect opening for for hans but that came off a little bit more rude than i intended i was not saying you know what it's just it's a good opening to get in a fight all right and hans frequently plays e5 as well he plays the berlin but he was clearly looking for a fight in this game knight f3 d6 so you know sometimes hans likes to react to my video so if hans is watching this right now hi i did not mean that in such a you know sometimes my mouth moves faster than my brain i you know whatever anyway hans plays a knor sicilian with d6 knight f6 a6 and white now has many options many many many options bishop e3 and bishop g5 not bishop h5 are the two main lines but there are many other lines belel does play the classical main line and now black has the option to play e6 to play e5 or play knight bd7 and that's kind of a little bit more of a of a of a of a little bit more of a passive line e5 then you can play bishop e7 you can play bishop b6 actually e5 in particular is much more common against bishop to e3 setups but in general for like 99% of the audience those are the three setups in the night orf we have e6 queen f3 applying pressure obviously you want to castle long h says take my knight bozo bell says no thank you i i do not want to take your knight i'm going to lower the volume of the pe sounds and then hans plays e5 so like i said e6 now e5 the knight's got to go somewhere it does and now hans plays bishop g4 rather than bishop to e6 this is the other comfortable situation and the comfortable space for the bishop on the e6 square and then bishop 2 e7 as well white in the nidorf likes to win control over the d5 square and apply pressure to the d6 pawn black decides what to do frequently based on what white is trying to do as well knight bd7 now we have this now we have this so this is the nidorf setup right here open c file for the rook you got b5 and stuff and now it's a question of which way you're going to castle here's long castle rook c8 is a possibility as well as sacrificing over here so for example if white plays bishop e2 there's actually a very thematic sicilian defense sacrifice which is known as the rook sacrifice on c3 this would leave white with a damaged structure and a potentially open king and then black would play b5 queen c7 and doesn't have to deliver mate right away you'll notice there is no mate but black is better if white ever plays king b2 black will play knight b6 it's a very very unpleasant position actually for white i had a friend play a a tournament recently and get hit with one of these moves he sort of fell asleep at the wheel a little bit and his opponent just went here and just demolished i mean like black just won a really really nice game so you got to be really careful which is why bell plays knight d5 says he can't take my he can't take my knight hans does this targeting the pawn now white develops like this and this is a very stable position it's a very nice position very solid white will move the queen out of the way start launching pawns black is a question of you know am i going to castle short am i going to keep my king in the center yeah hans just decides you know what you want to attack me buddy you want to attack me while my king is in the center you want to attack me and do something very principled h5 what like this is what i mean hans's games are so confrontational sometimes his king's in the middle white is doing everything right trying to open up the position hans is just firing back at him with flank pawns look at this rook f1 h4 how does this even make sense hans has five out of six pieces on the home r on the home rank on the eighth rank the fact that black's position is not completely lost doesn't make any sense queen h3 you you can't guess han's next move it's not possible like if you don't understand the nidorf or you don't understand attacking in dynamic chess you'll never guess the next move all these pieces look like they suck all of them they they they look like none of them are doing anything like if black slow plays and plays bishop g7 why's playing f5 bro if black castles now white's going to play king b1 and then white's going to open up the position play queen e6 i mean it it's hans nean in this bro he plays rook h5 he has now moved both rooks you can't castle now if you move your rooks you can't castle it's it's not allowed did you know that i i don't know if you knew that he continues to attack does bel but f5 is a mouse running into a trap instead of that white had to like bring his knight that way and then hans would have went f5 i mean this is nuts and then white would have went here and we would have had an explosion but you see it's it's balanced it's a game is balanced the fact that this is a balanced position is completely ridiculous rook h5 and now black gets caught he gets caught uhoh and i don't know what his original followup was but now he plays knight a5 and suddenly hans trades everything we're going straight to an end game ain't nobody getting made it anymore and now hans he he he's going to lose one of his pawns he's going to lose but no no he doesn't he plays knight c5 and belel starts reconsidering doesn't take the pawn back knight b7 we have take take finally this and now we have rook bishop and six versus rook bishop and six and hans has the armada he has the centralized fallons of pawns and he is going to just push them bishop h6 f4 rook goes to g8 it is targeting this pawn bell plays g3 hans shuts down the rook's invasion of the queen side he's just controlling the game i'm telling you hans's games are so fun you know they're always so exciting rook a3 defends goes over here takes takes bishop g3 we're going to a rook end game rook and five rook and five buckle up here comes the c pawn asking the rook is it's going to stay on the b file or go sideways it stays on the b file look at hans defending from the side he needs to keep pieces on the board b3 what watch this move watch a five the idea is if rook c4 he's going to trade rooks and despite being a pawn down in a king and pawn end game he's faster to the pawns and then he's going to eat the pawns so instead of that white goes here hans play c3 taking away space from the white king king e2 rook g3 loses the pawn and when the dust settles these guys are down to three on three and it is a race and i'm telling you this man makes things exciting rook b4 check rook c4 check king goes here b4 very tough to say which pawn to move is better plays b4 hans plays f5 it's a race all right it's a race five squares away from queening 1 two 3 4 five because you can't cross right now black 1 two three four the best thing for white to do is apparently to play rook h4 and then after f4 check rook h7 king e6 the rook stays back anticipates the promotion and it's it's pandemonium but apparently that's what he should do instead he plays a4 right away now f4 now the rook can't get out now a5 now hans sneaks down to the first rank uhoh now the white rook is really in trouble because it's never going to be able to to zigzag and get behind this pawn so white continues to push rook a1 stops the advancement b5 and that proves to be the losing mistake instead apparently king d2 rook a6 and b5 white had chances to hold the game but when you get into this race f3 b6 f2 rook c7 check wait a minute king e6 b7 they qu queen at the same time but hans neeman gets the first move with the new queen and he plays queen f3 check and ble resigns ble resigns why does he resign if you play king d2 it's rook d1 mate if you play king b2 it's queen a3 mate so you got to go forward you go forward to one of these squares i can win your queen king b4 rook b1 and not to mention there are other mates and if king c4 i have queen d5 queen d4 rook b1 and i take crazy like it was just rook and three versus rook and three with no time on the clock the boys got into a race and ble misjudges the endgame and is losing and resigns now things don't always go hans's way all right he doesn't always play a sicilian and get into a scrappy game and and pulls it off this game was nuts and this is a buding rivalry these guys played in january in the tata steel challenger so we might see a calendar year of these boys just battling it out constantly mar andre is like 1516 2600 very very good grandmaster all the same things apply to hans except he's like 20 and he's been 2700 now mar andrea plays a carocon which is clearly an opening that still has a place among top level chest players because it's it's a tough opening to crack it's such a tough opening to crack you got bozos doing stuff like this against it i'm not even joking this is a real line it's a very popular line this is called the brier the brer brer for my americans like the ice cream right you yeah yeah we we we americans we we like our ice cream for sure that is that is probably statistically proven anyway it's called the brayer variation and the point is that white is like i have no way to get an advantage against the caroan cuz the greatest opening of all time so i'm going to play this crap and i'm going to trade the queens lose the right to castle and play this end game yeah like this is this is how effective the caroan is at top level and then after black plays knight f6 white plays this move knight f to d2 undevelop the knight blocking your bishop and then defending your center and this is according to top level chess the meta this is the meta it's idiotic and this is why top level chess and noob level chest just will never really intersect because a person that has never played tennis can watch tennis and go oh as you just swing the thing with yeah you know but no be no this is idiotic this is beyond idiotic and the next move will surprise you even more it's g5 okay like i mean again like this is if you if you let a 600 level player guess this position not a single one of them would even go g5 it's beyond idiotic it's so idiotic it's brilliant and and that's the way top level chess works you let an engine think for a little bit and the engine goes well actually because i cannot develop these pieces i should probably play g5 and on the next move white should play a4 and then black should play h5 i can't explain this to you like there there is no the meta of the position is just effectively because of the obscure structure and the unnatural setup it's very difficult for black to make developing moves without getting attacked by white so black just kind of arbitrarily takes a little bit of space and so does white right knight c3 bro plays h4 like but clearly based on the time spend both guys know that this these are the best moves because they probably both analyzed this position white now plays h3 hans spends a little time covers g4 and maranda plays knight h5 so both guys are out of are out of prep right h4 h3 black plays knight h5 the idea of knight h5 is i have no idea what the idea of knight h5 is cuz you can't play knight g3 maybe it's to play knight f4 but then you know and and after knight f3 black plays f6 this might have been the idea all along just get a little connect four and at this point mar andrea paused the clock and said i won and then him and hans demon had a little conversation because they realized they were actually at a chess tournament not a connect for tournament now the knight could either go there or route backwards the other idea is will black play e5 or does black not want to play e5 or will actually hans play e5 himself because hans is the one that's like i want black to play e5 had i played bishop c4 black might have gone here and created a really really powerful structure on that side of the board i don't know haven't had a chance to talk to the players e5 now black doesn't want to take i hope we understand that because then you would be creating two weaknesses right so instead of that black plays knight to d7 h plays a5 just arbitrarily taking a little bit more space on that side wait a a5 but what about this pawn yeah it's all part of the plan in fact it's so valuable to white that black damages the oh he damages the structure but i guess white is going to be winning the pawn back on g5 okay well that's really weird why did mark andrea give himself doubled isolated e pawns and a weak h pawn i don't know and the position is still equal because chess is an idiotic fruitless time spend and after you get to like a thousand you should probably go play checkers poker connect 4 battleship tetris katon league of legends world of warcraft overwatch rocket league literally any other game like i i don't i don't know what to tell you bishop f5 and black plays long castles with check hans nean principled man look he saw rook a4 and he really liked it king c1 you know what's funny there's people in the chess world that don't even understand that reference look i saw rook a4 man good times the chess world has been through a lot anyway white has six pawns so does black double d pawns and a weak h pawn but what marrea has is he has a lot of open lines and the open lines make the position okay for black and not terrible now he does in fact put the knight on f4 after take take the pawn cannot be captured because your rook would be pinned to your king by some miracle hans neeman saw that and said and played bishop 2 e2 instead and then knight e4 and now we get into a very complex endgame six pawns each bishop pair for black rooks each a very easy way to make a draw here would be to play take take and by make a draw i mean suffer for a very long time because white has a little bit more activity but again opposite colored bishops no winning chances for black so black has an incentive to keep bishops on the board rook e one by hun black plays rook g8 targeting that g2 pawn hans plays knight b3 going for a little walk with his horse a6 preventing white from any advancement king b1 arbitrary king slide out of the way which happens in many types of positions rook to f8 setting up i suppose a defense of this pawn by virtue of bishop c2 check rook e2 king c7 bringing the king up one square both sides kind of shuffling poking at each other rook c4 okay bishop d6 all right it's a shuffling game you will notice mark andrea about 10 moves ago at 40 minutes on the clock and clearly is uncomfortable cuz all of a sudden bros got three versus 31 hans has the easier position to play hans has the easier position to threaten stuff overload black's nervous system and as you can tell get him to three minutes and constantly have him on the back foot and guessing now mar andrea is just losing the pawn he didn't have to he could have played rook f6 but when you have low time what you try to do is you try to force stuff he's trying to get white to take his pawn so that maybe he gets an end game that he can just hold right because he's worse and yeah now hans has all the benefits of the position plus the extra pawn plus a 25-minute time advantage this has been a great game by hans outmaneuvering his opponent doing everything right 34 seconds mar andrea played this move with 4 seconds on the clock because he got 30 seconds back so 4 plus 30 is 34 which is how i got to that number i'm really smart in case you didn't know knight to f3 going after the other weakness remember how a long time ago a long time ago i asked you why why did mark andrea get himself into this situation well it turns out that gotham chess was right all along now i'm right here i would you know i wouldn't be right at at the tournament yeah black's in trouble he's down a pawn he's got huge weaknesses he goes here he's setting up like rook d1 and you know various bishops are annoying plus he's also attacking this pawn h plays rook a4 bishop f7 threatening mate rook d1 is mate by the way okay no mate rook d5 and now hunt takes and goes for this end game five pawns versus four still a big time advantage and just like in that last game when hans had the majority on one side of the board he just got him rolling so he gets out of the way and he gets him rolling now if black could teleport the rook here it would be mate he can't do that though because that's not allowed but he can threaten mate right that's a big threat yeah but white just plays king c1 and the king could just defend and i don't know what you're going to do rook d5 okay okay i get it all right rook a5 but these guys are chess players and they're going to stop each other now hans could play rook a4 he could just run the king he just runs the king check here rook a2 and now hans is going to be in a situation where rather than defending his pawn with his king which would run into bishop g6 he gets exactly what he had in the last game remember the last game last game all the pawns fell off the board and that's exactly what's happening right now hans now has three pass pawns all on one side he's going to push them he just has has to make sure nothing's happening over here look at this nice idea deflecting the bishop from the defense of the rook black has to play bishop to a1 win the bishop back now we have this position there goes hans all right he has a massive head start and what other key differen is in this position there's another difference it's not just that his pawns are further ahead than black's pawns what is the difference between white's position and black's position goam it's the bishop vus is night shut up no anybody can see that let's be a little bit more creative it's the king it's the fact that this king is so far away there's no way black and white's king is right here white is in the square this is the square white's awaiting the other side to get into the square so this is over you got to be a little precise rby to check king e3 rook b3 check they shuffle a little bit now he blocks rook a2 hans already can consider playing h6 just getting as close as possible and getting to h7 as close as possible and then playing rook of eight now by the way if bishop c3 king d3 look at this take you have check and h and it's completely winning it's completely over right so it's completely winning so he can already play h6 but he doesn't hans respects the pin he plays king d1 that's he didn't play h6 he was very close to queening but he you know and now now mark andrea is going to do all he can he's going to play a5 now hans plays h6 now we have a4 now it's a question of do you send help or do you walk the pawn up to h7 we send help we got two friends and they're going to go side by side and they're going to go promote black plays a3 but this is everything we talked about the knight is there covering this and the king is there so now now hans just has to play knight b3 the bishop would let's say go to e5 rook f5 the bishop would come here g5 if rook b2 attacking the knight g6 if rook b3 g7 and if a2 it's g8 and it's a fork and you win okay now if there's rook b1 king c2 a2 g8 and you win this so it's winning you got to calculate a little bit more but then there's rook f eight and then there's g8 so you win but instead of that hans plays g5 okay he doesn't play knight b3 now black goes here now hans again and this is perhaps the easiest win that he has i'm not going to say i would have found it i'm just saying he can go knight b3 and he's just pushing this g pawn rook b2 g g6 rook b3 g7 you can't stop g8 you just win like it's not even there's check and there's rook g1 but then there's rook f8 so there's also king takes bishop and then rook f like if you do it in the right order you can't play king takes bishop here or actually you can so but for some reason i mean knight b3 is not that complicated like i i don't know and he but he goes here for some reason all right and now he's also got a minute we just went from 30 minutes no no even earlier even before all this it was 31-3 and all of a sudden we're deep in this end game and suddenly hans is like getting in his own head he doesn't play knight b3 he plays g5 he doesn't play knight b3 again black plays bishop e5 and now hans has one final moment he can play rook f8 check the king moves let's say the king goes to a7 and now he comes back and the the idea is that after he does this he always has rook a5 check so if bishop d4 he has rook a5 and if king b6 whatever he keeps his rook on the a file and then he pushes and then he's winning so he has this winning idea again instead of that he plays g6 the idea is to sacrifice the rook and play g7 it makes sense but black gives him check first and now it's a question of where do you move your king king c2 a2 i'm threatening rook c1 and a1 queen oh my goodness and now it's too late to bring this back now it's too late so now the best line that can happen is rook f8 king a7 king b3 you can't move your rook because i take the pawn rook h1 king a2 rook h6 draw apparently apparently so rook a1 check he's got to go toward the pawn and for reasons i cannot fathom he runs the other way he goes the other way so now instead of being closer to the pawn finding thisy i mean king c2 king b3 is difficult i get it he plays king e2 and mar andrea just goes here cuz it was the only damn idea that he had in the whole position was just to push the a pawn hans plays g7 now his pawn is stopped and black is queening what just happened out of nowhere okay i'm telling you i get the position is tricky i get time is low but i am flabbergasted knight b3 and pushing the pawn to g8 listen i'm telling you every game hans plays is exciting like i i cannot i i don't know what he hallucinated he just hallucinated because rook b2 g6 rook b3 g7 wins like i i don't know i don't know what he saw i don't know what spooked him but this just wins it's just winning so he didn't like this he didn't like this concept maybe he didn't like something else here maybe he didn't like king c i don't know maybe he but you know like maybe he saw he he didn't see a win here i don't know maybe he didn't like this i don't know all i know is now the position is winning for black hans plays knight g3 black queens hans queens with check normally when you queen would check you begin the attack but there's no more checks the rook is hanging and more importantly the king is hanging queen c4 trying to give up the rook but queen d1 rook e1 that's gg that is just gg the king is completely surround the knight2 mar andrea goes here and this is a completely winning position because hans resigned because if he had gone here black would have went here deflecting the king from the queen and then they would have traded and then this and this is just a completely winning end game because you have two pawns and the bishop covers it's winning without that as well but it's yeah it's winning and that is crazy i don't know how like hans is just he he i i don't know i would love to be in the mind of hans because this game was so well done and then he just he just had to play knight b3 and i don't know why he didn't like this move i don't know what he didn't see but black wins from you know four mistakes in a row basically and i i guess it all sort of started like here he played a g5 which was slightly inaccurate then he played knight e4 which was a mistake and then he played g6 which was a mistake and then he played here which straight up just lost the game here was maybe his last moment instead of g7 he could have played rook g4 with the idea rookie one check taking allowing a queen and then running the king there and white is not lost this was his final moment he could have put the rook here but he didn't and i yeah i ju i don't know just like a total total meltdown and when hans plays like this is just exciting i mean it's not you know win or lose i'm just i'm just here to provide the entertainment like this man killer be killed is the style of hans neon and he is always looking for a fight and i think mar andrea has now beaten him twice in two months if i'm not mistaken so this is a very fun developing rivalry hopefully these games were exciting i will of course cover hans whether he wins or loses and i have never seen somebody so polarizing when i cover hans the comment section is like 5050 at each other's throats you guys are like never cover any of his events and the other half are like yeah let's go hun like this is this is hilarious okay and i'm going to continue to cover his games when he plays so that's all i have for you today i don't know what hans's next event is but you know the drill get out of here
