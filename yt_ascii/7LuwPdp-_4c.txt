oh man point of view you're about to get laid off look at that look at how uncomfortable she looks drinking that lroy like it's going out of style this this is making me i'm physically uncomfortable watching this hey britney hi yes i'm so sorry my name's rosie i'm just joining the call nice to meet you i'm on the hr team can we just take a moment and pay some respects here people whenever you join a meeting and then hr joins with you like you know you know for a fact that this is not good like this is not this is not a good situation okay poor what out for britney hi britney hi thanks for meeting with me and rosie we have an important meeting today we finished our evaluations of 2023 performance this is where you have not met cl expectations for performance we've decided to par ways with you yeah i'm going to stop you right there sure so it's a good move just stop him right there good job britney she came in right at dude i i don't know why she's filming this because i don't you know like i i wouldn't personally want to to film my own personal experience of this one yeah this is pain to watch this is genuinely one of the most painful things i've ever watched i started august 25th i've been on a 3mon ramp and then it was 3 weeks of december and then a week of christmas and then here we are i have had the highest activity amongst my team since i've started i have had three contracts out done a really great job managing my deals up until the very end that decided not to close last minute so i don't think that that makes a lot of sense for me in my cloud flare journey here so far also every single oneon-one i've had with my manager every conversation i've had with him has he has been given me nothing but i am doing a great job i have had great activity i have really great meetings i by the way if that's true if the boss is doing that and the boss is like hey you're doing great you're doing a great job i love what you're doing i'm going to have to say that that's that's pretty that that like just taking her at her word because you know i have no idea like that's that's that's shitty like your boss should be the one that's helping you know if things aren't going the right direction right that's like number one boss requirement i mean what the hell are you doing as a manager if that is not like top priority in your life crazy she's the cheapest from the team to fire i guess that's probably probably more correct is that they're looking for a reason to fire her so therefore i mean if i i have no idea cuz i know cloud flare got a shellacking at recent stock times right so if we go if we go if we jump over here hey hey youtube hey youtube are you guys being degenerate still probably cloud flare stock right and i know they've been struggling we go a little six monon or on it oh wow maybe they maybe they aren't struggling anymore maybe they're maybe they're winning now maybe they're winning man they fired her after winning i thought they were getting sleck okay well look at that despite earnings and revenue beats cloud flare shares fall on outlook okay anyways i thought they had a really poor outlook like they had some whatever anyways i guess i'm the one that's wrong fake news i got fake newsed out of my mind wait please tell me that twitter did not just okay good twitter did not just do what i thought it did all right let's keep on going sorry for the misinformation i'm picking up the products very quickly and things have been going really really really well i make really great relationships with my clients so i disagree that my performance hasn't been i haven't met performance expectations when i certainly have just because i haven't closed anything officially i hear you yeah i mean that's hard that's hard if you haven't closed anything officially that does i mean that's difficult i i'm just saying like when it comes to just paper right if you're just looking at someone's paper performance that's where things get difficult so like it doesn't really matter how good you are if on paper you don't look good like that that's hard right and she's been working there for what i think is four and a half months with christmas break in there yeah and so anyways the guy here is why are you doing this and not my manager not you know we've never met so this seems a little odd that my manager has no idea that this has been happening and the director has no idea that this has been happening so i'm just definitely confused and yeah i would love like an explanation that makes sense 100% real qui 100% right there with you okay here we [laughter] go dude the guy that's firing had no idea what he's coming into i'm sure like 95 % of firings just go with someone being like f you or something like that either it's either it's like so upset or whatever but this one's just like i'm g to try to hit you with facts and logic and the guy's just emotionally not prepared for this at all let me carve out the the two threads the ladder of why i'm on this conversation i'll i'll put that one to the second half and rosie might be better to explain the process of who giving this information in the prior piece which which is your feedback and and notes about your performance so we add a little color context to that so just for clarification you are not being singled out in this your peers are also being collectively assessed on performance this is a collective collaboration for cloud flare so i just want to clarify that piece i won't be able to add any kind of specifics on numbers or we yeah no can you explain for me why britney peach is getting let go the i won't be able to go into specifics for numbers wait why though i just started i've been working extremely hard just because i haven't closed anything that has nothing to do with my performance on yeah hold on i i know she's like arguing the point but what the hell is collective collabor calibration i i mean that is a weird term does that mean like what does that even mean like he can't even tell her specifics like hey we wanted you to meet x deals you couldn't even meet x deals there there for this it sounds like layoffs this sounds like layoffs collective tuning yeah we're right sizing the department damn dude i would hate to get right-sized right out all right all right all right all right all right on a three-month ramp with just one month with two major holidays in the middle i don't think that has anything to do with why i should be let go if that makes sense so i really need an answer and an explanation as to why britney peach is getting let go not by the way it is a good point how many tech companies are making cloud flare changes over the holidays right like you you want to change your your tech stack over the time in which your service is likely to be the most used like so i don't really blame her like i mean it's kind of it's it's kind of difficult to say that any person would want to do any sort of of changing during this time what did bar say everyone's saying bar bar wasn't this the lady l laid off like 3 months into her job that just means the employer is garbage at predicting their staff needs quarter to quarter they deserve roasting oh okay is that what this is i don't know yet we're we're still learning okay why cloud flair decided to hire too many people and are now actually realizing that they can't afford this many people and they're letting that go if that's the real answer i would rather just you tell me that instead of making up some [ __ ] and telling me that right before i lose my job from someone that i've never met before if you can respect that yeah i can totally respect that and i don't think dom or myself today is going to give you any cl hr is so soft hr is so soft clarity or answers that's going to meet the expectations that you're communicating to us britney so i that was the longest way to say no i have never heard a no gent gently delivered so forcefully that was the most gentle forceful delivery of a no so your expectations won't be met like what the hell what the hell does that mean so stupid i can't speak to so am i getting let go for no reason if you guys can't give me a reason be no reon follow up with you separately to give you the data that was calibrated i'll need to speak with revenue leadership specifically to see if we can get that for you but domin sh in our meeting i cannot share that with you right now unfortunately yeah it's understandable how you feel and your frustration cannot stress fired by the algorithm is pretty [ __ ] up i'm not going to lie to you that that's like enron style enron style for those that don't remember the bottom 10% just got fired that is it there was no it doesn't matter if it was the allout bangout quarter of all time bottom 10% got to go enron was a ponzi legitimately was a ponzi but still like this getting fired by bing ai crazy i have been working extremely hard sorry i by by the way working hard does not mean anything so i i do want to throw that out there if you say it doesn't matter how hard you work like real talk it does not matter how hard you work at the end of the day it's about results if someone can work 10% of the hours and produce the same results as someone working 40 hours it should not matter which one at the end of the day it should just not matter if you work five or you work 50 does not matter long as the end goal is what someone expects and i think this is what we're missing here because obviously hr here is so soft they're so soft they can't say anything and they're saying it so it makes it sound like she's getting fired by yeah especially in sales like sales is a the hardest hardcore number firing thing of all time it's like hey you need to make x doll for us we're high we're paying you x so you make y that's your job go do your job and if you don't make y and they just pay you x i mean it sucks sales is brutal by the way sale like you think programming is hard with your lattes and everybody loving you you should try sales i've done sales it's the worst i just knew that this meeting was coming after knowing what's been happening with my peers and how extremely frustrated and upset everyone is i know you guys must not be able to understand that given in the positions that you are in and it must be very easy for you to just have these little 10-minute 15minute meetings tell someone that they're fired completely wreck their whole life and then that's it with no explanation that's extremely traumatizing for people if you can imagine that and i don't i don't think that this is it's it's just very very shocking very very shocking i like really given my whole energy in life over the last four months to this job and to be let go for no reason is like a huge slap in the face from a company that i she may have cooked a little too much on this part you know being fired sucks and i i totally get that i always feel like in our in our i mean shoot asmin gold just got done getting canceled i guess i'm joining in on the cancel train i guess i guess i'm going to jump on in on this one as well the the hard part that i have with this is that trauma is like a real thing people experience real trauma and getting fired i'm not sure if it counts as real trauma i know everybody experiences something different someone who is used to the absolute tippity top of the luxury goes to just some run-of-the-mill five-star hotel and it sucks like i get that but like at some point like there's there's trauma is subjective this is 100% true but it's like at what point i wonder if the interview process she led them to believe she had already business ready to sell like a big client list oh oh yeah that i mean that's true salespeople do that i mean i hate to be that guy i hate to say that but i mean the the the thing i have about just the general modern language we take a bunch is that people who have real problems are getting equally lumped in with people that are having not as real of problems i'm not saying that her life is not hard at this point she's pro i don't know what she's doing how hard it's been obviously recording yourself and then putting it out there is going to make it a lot harder she may have broken the law if she's not in a single consent state i mean there's a lot there's a lot to it financial stress can be no joke yeah i went through financial stress i've been in it you've heard my story the guy below me i had pe i i the guy below me was a methodic and i had several altercations that were not pleasant experiences i'm most certainly not saying that but saying that being fired is equivalent to trauma it's very difficult for me to like i don't know if i'd put that under the same thing as severe trauma it's just i don't know if it's the same category i understand that it's difficult but difficult is not trauma really want it to believe in i know some people aren't going to like this one understand how you feel that way why you feel that way and i'll be honest with you there's nothing that we're going to to be like like honestly i think so just just put this out there i think the real trauma is going to be caused by the recording of this like i mean i've been hearing about this for like a week and a half i've been seeing it everywhere like this is this is huge like this is going to be hard you know like i feel like i personally feel like this is the harder thing of the two to say in this call in the time that we have that's going to undo the way that you feel right in this moment and i personally will do everything that i can to give you as much specific information as i can after this call i can't make any promises i understand where you're coming from i can tell you that dom and i do i got to put a pause on here someone said this module module tu said my thoughts on all these layoffs are simple if i can get fire sl lad off simply because of poor decisions by leadership even if i'm a star employee then why the hell put an effort if in if the effort doesn't matter in the long run there are several reasons why you should always put in effort that are orthogonal to your job like real talk like the more effort and stuff you put in the more responsibility you're going to get it's very difficult to gain responsibility and to be able to build things independently and make decisions and so there is a benefit to putting in effort because when you put in effort you get the reward and the reward can simply grow your skill set so that you are more hirable and more desirable at several companies and so i'm not saying that it's i i'm not one to say hey go bleed your whole life at a company i said you know enjoy programming and lean in and become great at it and these are one of the ways you can become great at it it's very very difficult to find yourself in charge of or running a project with people also making commits that are forced to make commits by being paid like that's a very hard thing to find yourself in unless if you go find it from a company and so that's kind of my take on this is it's not i don't do things because somebody else might do something does that make sense like i'm not because at the end of the day i that's why i've said don't be loyal your job isn't to be loyal like if my job ask me to do something unreasonable i'm going to tell them back i think this is unreasonable right now for the last few months i've had a fairly shitty set of things i've had to do i would say at my job things that are definitely unfun and i try to find the joy in it and i try to find a way to automate and make it so that things can be done and i'm getting some people going wow hey this is looking pretty good because you know this has been a very shitty thing for years and now hey this is great we're identifying we're moving on we're doing things this is fantastic it's just like i want to be great for the sake of me being great i want to be good at what i do for the sake of me being good because if i don't do that like that is so so so difficult real talk it's so so diff difficult if you're constantly just waiting for somebody else to do something difficult and you're constantly dwelling on that so you're constantly just trying to find the minimum like dude i can't live that life i would be too demotivated i'd be too deflated i' just i would feel like [ __ ] constantly so instead i just choose something different so why should there you go sorry i had to say all that anyways let's keep on going i don't know if she was treated unfairly right i think it's shitty if if cloud flare over hired and then they had the fire a bunch of people is that unfair i don't know i have a hard time saying it's unfair it's shitty for sure and if they're going through and just firing teams based on like this team has performed less overall than this team and we just need the downsides therefore we're going to you know it's unfair not to call to layoff exactly that that on the other hand i do agree with that if they're not calling a spade a spade then it totally sucks and i think it's very unfair i think that is unfair or i'd say that that's irresponsible or unethical i'm not sure if i'd use the term unfair you know what i mean because an unfair simply means like two people with the identical credentials are being treated differently if it's a team based decision and they're just letting teams go like this team's performed less than this team we're just simply getting rid of this team because we have to get like we're getting rid of this whole org manager team everybody just get them all out we're doing this they're avoiding the term layoff because share value impact and that's [ __ ] i agree with that that's if that's the case that's stupid i think that that's genuin i mean it's groy yeah the ceo respond we're going to find understanding that you have right now and i can't change that so i'll just be honest but why can't so but there you guys have still not given me a reason why i'm being let go yeah it sounds like they're laying off the team despite constant positive praise from my manager great meetings that i'm having they did give a reason they said she didn't perform but then she said then she pressed them and then they responded with well we're team calibrating which means they're not actually firing her for performance they're firing the team all of her teams being let go they even said that the entire team's being let go which sounds it doesn't sound like they're doing that mass layoffs have more regulations around them yeah i could see that the amount of activity that i have has all been positive i have not received any negative inclination i have not been put on a performance improvement plan nothing so i i cannot okay one last pause yes i do agree with this take right here which is we canot we can't technically assess that it is fair or unfair because we don't actually have the cloud fair perspective we only have one perspective from her perspective it feels unethical it feels shitty but it's hard for me to say that it's i again that's why i don't i don't like to use that term unless if i i know that's what's being not speak to what your manager has communicated to you directly but that should be the indication for performance based on your attainment and leading indicators of data that is that is the rationale but i've been here for only a month after ramping and that was during a holiday so i don't understand what those can you explain what those performance metrics are or is that just like a a a vague term to give to everyone that you're speaking to today i'll say that the the performance indicators and performance metrics are well they are we're not able to go into specifics and we won't there's no situation where we will be able to go into do you guys even know do you guys even know like why like who you're talking to each day like every single 10 15 minutes do you guys even know who you're talking to to like why you're letting these people go when you don't even understand like the kind of work and everything that they've put in it's pretty based question okay i mean i'm just gonna say that's you know plus plus one for britney on that one britney plus one i hear you and what you're saying it just doesn't make it it just doesn't make is that hr training just to say i hear you 100% oh yeah 100% one hey 100% i hear you i i feel you feel and hear you 100% of the time just like what any sense that you guys have still not been able to give me a reason why i'm being let go just from a process perspective your questions are valid this isn't going to be the forum and the situation where we'll be able to go into the detail that you're looking for then but then when if it's not right as i'm getting fired that it's certainly not going to be after when i'm no longer part of the company no so i don't think there's anything we can say yeah yeah yeah yeah you know you know yeah you know yeah i i i hear you in this moment or today britney that's going to change the way that you feel and it's under again like understandable on taking notes and feedback need to be yeah i know you're 100% correct hr should be replaced with ai honestly they only do the company bidding they're only there to protect the company might as well just put an ai on it honestly they're there to protect the company and that is that just put an ai there you did that for too of the meeting it's not going to change the outcome of the situation today so it may be best if we i do get into more of the specifics of what the next steps are because i think it's clear that you have questions that we cannot give answers to and if you'd be open to it i' by the way notice that notice her her way she said it you have questions that we cannot give answers to it's not that we don't know the answers to hr is careful with words okay they're not they have to be notice the time stamp 8:46 they have 15 minutes allocated per person yep damn that's true yeah though that was very specific that that wording was intentionally chosen we know but we won't get to tell she just won't say it's it's lay i mean this for all intents and purposes as far as i can tell this is likely layoffs and her team just wasn't performing as well as some other team so she got she caught a stray and i think it's probably a little unfair to judge like to fire her after because it's true when you're when you start working out of place there is a ramp up period where you're just learning the lingo learning this learning that and that's totally completely fair i think bisco brought up a good point maybe she sold in the interview process that she had a list of clients that she could sell to blah blah blah blah totally like i mean all of that's fair that's like a huge thing of sales people often bring in a person that has really strong sales not because they think that they can sell really well but because the relationships they have and so i totally get that this is a this you know it's there's something there but they bring the client list exactly they bring the client list love to move into what the next steps are so that you're not any further blindsided than you already feel okay thank you d okay and i'm again i'm really sorry that you're having this experience and feeling this way one of the things by the way that's such a stupid that's like that sorry means nothing that's the dumbest sorry i've ever heard sorry that you feel how you feel after i helped make you feel that way sorry about that you know like i didn't mean to take my hand put it into a fist and then punch you in the gut but i had to so sorry that you feel it now i know fake empathy it's all fake empathy it's a dude the silicon valley is the fakest it's it's it's it's sheen sheen of sheen of all the things that feel virtuous with none of them that's all it is i do want to confirm as your personal email address because that's where fudge that was loud last part last part little loud last part a little loud little loud okay damn got i got hit by that tik tok at the end i was not aware that tik tok lasted for nine minutes all right all right so let's let's let's let's let's see what people have to say here so one of them is co-founder and ceo of bloom tech the school that invests in you will tweet as i wish and suffer the consequences okay and then the response of course we're going to look at with matthew prince ceo of cloudflare and co-founder so we got two things okay all right some quick assumptive analysis one looks like the company was nuking most of the sales orgs if they if they are keeping less than 25% of the org the calculus isn't are they doing a good job and have we given them a fair shake it's more who are the top performers we need to keep them let's see who are the top performers we need to keep to keep have oh my goodness i i i'm having a stroke the stroke is happening we have to get rid of everyone else totally unfair to her it may have been nigh impossible to reach the performance bar required to stay but hard to say with no info i don't think that's again that's not unfair it's just like that sucks it's it's just sucks right i don't like to use the term unfair because if there's someone that's performing 5x better than you and you have to choose three people to stay and you have 10 there's it's not i mean it the situation sucks that she was so new at the company she had no chance to prove herself right i think that's the sucky part is that everyone gets judged on the same scale despite the same time scale not being the same you know the fact that it's two hr people who don't know her is either a big misstep or it implies her manager and possibly her manager's manager are gone too see this is what i thought i thought that the manager like he's gone when they say they're liquidating the the the sales team well then what is the manager managing manager probably gone too the hr team was probably given a big list of names they needed to tell and probably had no clue as to why the decision- making led to some of some staying and some going that's not a fun position to be in but could be the only alternative to mass firing in a giant zoom meeting depending on how ma how much of management was also fired okay it is you know honestly i think that me personally i would rather have a mass firing than a one-on-one firing where they couldn't say anything one in the chat if you would rather have just the mass firing or two in the chat if you'd rather have the personal i don't see a lot of twos there are some twos though it just feels kind of shitty because it's just like what's the point of having a personal conversation if they can't say anything right it's not even personal it's it's being mass fired one at a time mass firing is a layoff which impact which materially impacts the yeah the sales price yeah i i've had let's see i've had both mass email/ call is way better since everyone else has to sit and wait their turn yeah oh aiden that's yeah aiden you i mean not only that but aiden you just i mean literally aiden's probably one of the best people to speak to this because you literally just got done having a little moment where you saw in the news that twitch is laying off 30% of their staff and you didn't even know the outcome of of your life you knew from bloomberg that you were getting fired and then it turns out you weren't one of one out of three people getting fired which is crazy like that's crazy to learn from from bloomberg that you're being fired like not not a cool not a cool thing i got laid off from twitch last year when oh my goodness when they did the wait for your turn method and it sucked yeah yeah cuz i can imagine because you'd be literally just days of like you halt the entire staff all together because every staff is just sitting there feeling like i'm going to die yeah we had a mass email this time it [ __ ] sucked but it was better than than that [ __ ] yeah man damn first off mr bite hate to hear that sorry about sorry about that that [ __ ] sucks that's crazy that's crazy man a lot of people are in layoffs dang are layoffs still pretty strong it is interesting that they are so clear its performance- based and not a layoff that's not an accident could be let's see could be to avoid regul around the warn act or as justification to give zero severance usually in this call they go over the high level of that stuff but this one took a turn sad across the board also you got to remember like i still am i'm curious about the the what's it called the recording by the way because again if she's in california she broke the law and like cloudforce technically could sue her ass which is crazy right we fired 40 salespeople out of out of over, 1500 in our goto market org that's a normal quarter we when we're doing performance management right we can often tell within 3 months or less of a sales hire even during the holidays whether they're going to be successful or not sadly we don't hire perfectly we try to fire perfectly in this case clearly we were far from perfect this video is painful for me to watch managers should always be involved h should be involved but it shouldn't be outsourced to them no employee should ever actually be surprised they weren't performing remember look at what we're looking at here we don't always get it right and this is the ceo and sometimes underperforming employees don't actually listen to feedback they've gotten before we let them go so you saying that you saying that there was underperformance here importantly just because we fire someone doesn't mean they are employee it doesn't mean we won't really really they won't be really really great somewhere else chris paul was a bad fit for the suns but he undoubtedly a great basketball player oh no oh no oh gosh did he just drop a sports ball reference did he just drop a sports ball reference dude that's so that is just so [ __ ] up that is just like the worst take in the universe honestly this is just the worst take ever dude dude poor chris first off chris paul catching catching strays over here okay chris paul was in there for three years it's it's a nonsense because it has nothing to do with the fit or performance it's not comparable because the nba is a huge company where a team can trade players l they just fired her ass after 3 months yeah okay yes yes there was 3 years versus 3 months obviously very very different you know a lot about a player after three seasons versus one season and she's not even in for a season plus the holidays i really doubt the holidays are a good way to really calibrate performance i just really do people companies everything act so different i know it's just seems different anyways i can't come up with a good reason so maybe i need to check i need to think about this more why does this why does this not settle well with me cuz if it doesn't settle well with me but i don't have a good reason then maybe it shouldn't settle poorly with me i don't know i got to figure out stuff and in fact we think the right thing to do is get people we know are unlikely to succeed off the team as quickly as possible so they can find the right place for them yeah i mean that's i mean i i technically agree with this statement that if you know someone's not going to be a good fit then maybe get them off the team like i i agree with that we definitely weren't anywhere close to perfect in this case but all healthy but any healthy orgs need to get the people who aren't performing off that wasn't the mistake here the mistake was not being more kind and humane as we did dude again silicon valley empathy is just so stupid it's the veneer of virtuousness so that everyone can go out and talk about how much empathy they have the word empathy has been like the soup dour word for like the last five years in the silicon valley but it is so so so not empathy that is not what they're doing they have all the words of it it's like ai you know when ai creates an image you look at the image when i've been looking at ai images lately it actually kind of makes me upset i can look at them they bother me they're just like super average really pretty images like they're just like the worst right they have all the looks of something creative without actually being creative is that's how i look at every one of them they're just like they they they almost they're they're like drinking diet soda it's like just drink [ __ ] coke people like you're just just just drink the thing stop drinking the the image of the thing it makes no sense and i'm just like i look at it it's just like ai is the image of the thing and not the thing itself and this right here the mistake that we are not more kind and humane as we did is just again they're simply wanting to be more looking like the thing but not being the thing this is peak capitalism alienation no this is not peak capitalism alienation this is just what happens when you have to when you have a like a cult a culture enforced on people right the silicon valley enforces some sort of quote unquote fake ass standard on everybody else this is just yeah this is just valueless society this is just simply non like this is what it looks like when a bunch of lawyers and insurance companies get involved that's something that zatlin and i are focused on oh oh thank you i bet you i bet you there's so much look this i enjoy building products that people love young global leader 14 co-founder and president cloud flare amazing and i have dude by the way poor zatlin zatlin she just got tossed in on this one she just got tossed in on this one right here and just getting ratioed you know she doesn't have a you know imagine imagine you're like not that into twitter and you you go on and you have what appears to be about seven and a half thousand notifications you're just like ah today's a nice day to go check twitter oh [ __ ] like what did i get tagged in dude it's crazy it's crazy but yeah again as a company you can't do this companies are not humane or kind that's just that if you're going to try to make every like how i look at it is that when they do these firings no matter how nice they sound they're still putting the dagger in it's just like ah we love you we're we i know it this hurts doesn't it ah gosh i can't believe it hurts i'm so sorry oh you know i really feel you got it you got it i'm just going to keep pushing i hear you 100% i just got to put in a little bit more and then yeah now i got to twist it i'm going to i'm going to twist it now okay but i'm humane about it i'm telling you before yep see now i just twisted it but i love you so much i'm so sorry okay you can go now it's just like yeah you're not humane you can't be humane you're a company it would be so less bad if companies just we like we're not humane we make decisions based on profits and we fire fast if they just say that then you know what you're getting yourself into and there's no surprises and then they can just be like yeah you didn't perform we fire you we fire fast that's that i would be le taken back because i knew the stakes that i was given not some fake ass really nice everybody's nice oh everything is great oh but we're gonna kind of fire you kind of approach to life it's just so stupid it's just so stupid and it just makes a bunch of people feel really happy and virtuous about themselves with absolutely none with no virtue yes europeans don't understand anything about firefast i get it yeah with communism there's no companies think about that okay you got got them i don't even think you're correct on your communism take to begin with communism mentioned let's go all right anyways this is totally effed up and ryan winchester let's go ryan winchester let's go ryan i'm glad that i'm glad to see this by the way this is also good okay hey hey shane good one right here let's see firing 2 to 3% of your networks or of your employees every quarter is wild it is because they're low performing are you just firing the bottom percent of your company every quarter because if it's the second part i cannot imagine the stress your employees are under this is some straight up andron [ __ ] right she she is right if you are firing two to 3% of your employees every quarter you might not be that good at hiring or b you

as bad or the streaming side sorry that's netflix talk is the is the is the product side the the the engineering side nearly as bad is it ran completely different i don't know right i know i said the streaming side is stupid stupid of me that's like 10% of your workforce every year yeah there's just something completely wrong that's firing the bottom 10% that's like literally cloud flare i mean that's literally enron enron fired 10% he just admitted that he has the same practices as enron firing the 10% of his employees per year again it's also sales though sales is just different i can i
