i will be looking at the game double and what i actually want to talk about is how something seemingly unrelated as double relates to what i do for for research the problem that i'm interested in is you have devices or people over the internet giving advice somehow so you can think of routers on a computer network that are advertising the locations of their neighbors you can think of reviews on amazon from strangers these are all things where you have to choose to either believe people or to disbelieve them so how does this relate to the game of double or at least the mathematics behind it so the game of double for those that are unfamiliar is played with a deck of special cards and the goal is to look at two cards and then you want to look at which of these symbols they have in common so having a look it is the stop sign and if we want to represent this as a venn diagram we can see that that's what they have in common now you can take any pair of cards and they will have something in common so if we take this pair what they have in common is the snowman and it's a fun game for all ages and we have made our own version which is not exactly double because it's slightly more general so it's generalized double or gobble so what does gobble look like well of course it's using computer file related symbols so let's look at a pair of global cards what do they have in common they both have an arm processor okay so we can have a venn diagram but i guess some viewers now will be confused and think hold on a second that's not what i found i found that it's the turtle in a room that they have in common it's a raspberry pie but it's a raspberry pie that actually makes more sense so it's no longer the case that every pair of cards have one element in common they can have multiple elements in common and perhaps they don't all have the same number of icons like a double set does but rather they can have various different numbers of icons so this is our game gobble is a generalization of double and the only requirement is that every pair of cards must still have at least one element in common let's talk a little bit about a much simpler game of gobble because double has 55 symbols and if you do all combinations of all sizes of cards that would give you 2 to the power 55 different cards which is way too many i we can't print those out so i just went with three symbols so it gives you eight possible cards but as you can see not every deck is suitable to play the game with for example these two cards don't have anything in common so if i put these two out you cannot spot which of the elements they have in common okay let's move now to something seemingly unrelated which is what i was you know saying at the beginning of the video which is the problem of advice over the internet so let's pretend that we have these three entities the key let's call the key mic the old-fashioned floppy disk let's call it steve and the c programming language let's call it david so we have mike steve and david and each of them gives advice for example it's something that people will objectively agree on it's something that is true but that people might lie about for example the university of nottingham is a university in the uk that would be an example of a true statement but the university of nottingham is a university in france is not a true statement so if we ask steve mike and david where is the university of nottingham and for example steve may say it's a university in the uk and mike may say it's a university in paris france and david may say it's a university in melbourne australia right how do you figure out who's telling the truth and who's lying what we can do relating it to these playing cards is we can look at the situation and we can see each of these cards as a reality so for example the reality where we have three icons all three of them are telling the truth if we have the card with the floppy disk which represents steve then we're talking about the reality where steve is telling the truth and the others are liars now in the rules of the games liars are still allowed to tell the truth but only honest people will always tell the truth which means that if we listen to steve in this reality we win because he is the one that is telling the truth if we look at this reality steve and mike are both telling the truth which means that if we listen to either of them we will win the goal of the game is to try to win as often as possible now what what seems to be a natural strategy if you're getting advice from multiple people you mean who do you believe yeah who do you who would you believe if there's multiple people giving you advice well seems to me if if there are any that agree with each other then there's more of a likelihood that's right yeah so you would listen to the majority if possible right so if that is your strategy if your strategy is that you listen to the majority and it turns out that everyone involved is telling the truth you will definitely win right because they're all going to say the truth so you listen to the majority you win in the case that david and mike are telling the truth well there would be a majority so you win in this reality as well you follow the majority and the majority is truthful in the reality where only steve is truthful we don't know right if the liars choose to tell the truth we might win but in general we will not win in this reality in this reality we will win because the majority is telling the truth in this one again we will typically lose and in this reality we will win in this reality we'll typically lose and in the reality where no one is truthful but we won't definitely lose but if they choose not to tell the truth we will definitely lose so that means that in four cases we won and in four cases we lose but there's other things that you can do you don't have to listen to the majority what you can do is you can say i actually like steve more than mike so i'm going to do whatever steve is telling me and in which realities do we win then well in the reality where steve and david are truthful i will win because steve is telling the truth this time in the reality where mike and david are telling the truth i will lose because i'm not listening to the majority this time i'm just listening to whatever steve is saying so i will typically lose in this reality where everyone is truthful i'll win in this reality i'll win in this one i lose lose lose and in this reality i'll win so again it will be four against four and you might now think okay so it seems that it doesn't really matter it will always be four cards versus four cards and that's i would say a good observation but it's not necessarily the case that all of the realities are equally likely let's consider again the scenario where steve always tells the truth and we can look at the probability that these things are true 0.2 0.12 0.07 and 0.14 so those are the probabilities of each of these realities being true then the probability that i'll make the right decision is simply the sum of these which is 0.53 just over half alternatively the first strategy we followed was the one where we followed the majority which was mostly the same we substitute out this option for this option so we end up with these four realities in which we win if we follow the majority and again we can add the probabilities and in this case we get 0.55 so this was apparently a better strategy but perhaps there are better strategies why don't i just turn these cards around and select the four cards with the highest values so that would be 0.22 0.2 0.14 and 0.12 those are the four highest cards then i turn them around and i will look at what my strategy is okay we have this card and this card and this card in this card but here we run into a problem can you can you see what the problem is yeah there's no matches between all four are there exactly there are no matches between all four so if we look at these cards in particular we have mike and david on one side and steve on the other side so that means that if mike and david say the university of nottingham is in paris and steve says it's in nottingham which one do we believe we can't believe both of them only one of them can be right at the same time so this is not a valid strategy and here is what i think is the interesting thing the reason why this is not a valid strategy is because you are not able to play gobble with it so there's only two rules that you need to determine whether a selection of cards is possible as long as you can play gobble with your four cards it is a valid strategy if you cannot play google with it it's not of course when you only have eight cards this is fairly simple but if you're asking for advice from 10 people you would have more than a thousand cards of which you can select more than 500 to win in and it's not it's not always obvious whether your strategy is possible or not and then i think this definition of can you play gobble with your cards is actually a very natural way to summarize whether it's possible or not i love the tape i thought it was like a turtle path finding in in a room so viewers know these are all items i've used for animation over the eight years or so we've been making computer file videos quite high resolution enough to deal with 1080 and 4k video
