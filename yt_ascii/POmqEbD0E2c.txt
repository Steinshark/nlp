and it just kills me that on the one hand we've got all oh gosh no if you if you criticize somebody you know that makes them feel bad so we have to make sure that we don't do that this is harm reduction okay which we talk about which is a major impediment to efficiently running organizations by the way if you get to that level and then you got the people on the other side who just say you know that they ought to be able to yell and abuse whoever they want because they're in charge why is it so hard to just go okay let's just let's balance that and reasonably and responsibly help people get better instead of trying to tear them [music] down hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with lawyer former washington state senator and now federal congressman adam smith we discussed the difficulties and promise of genuine political dialogue practical and psychological the dangers of a too narrow definition of merit and accomplishment the difference between negotiating and winning and topics related to mental health and political action outlined in his new book lost and broken my journey back from chronic pain and crippling anxiety i've been attempting to bring democrats on my podcast for several years congressman smith is the first sitting house member or senator for that matter willing to take the risk and to combat in that manner the dangerous polarization that presently confronts us all right well congressman smith thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me and to everyone watching and listening today you and i have met a couple of times before in washington in preparation for this i've met a lot of democrats in was washington congressman and senators many of them were willing if not pleased to speak with me there often pleased too i suppose it's been somewhat tricky getting democrats to talk to me on my podcast for a variety of reasons and so i think that's unfortunate but i'm pleased that you have decided to do that and i i guess i'm probably curious to begin with why you agreed to do this and and also what your to accomplish and then we'll dive into the political mess a bit sure i mean it has been my sort of approach to politics from the very start and i've been doing this a long time i got elected to the state senate when i was 25 years old and heck i started that campaign two years before it ended so the age of 23 i decided want to run i wanted to run for office one of the things i i sort of learned as i campaigned back then door belling basically i knocked on every door in my district well every door of a registered voter to be perfectly honest about it is the best thing we can do is be open in our conversations and as a general rule i'll listen to anybody you know i represent 750,000 people and i represent every single one of them not just the ones who voted for me and i have found that i learn a lot if i'm open to listening to people particularly people that i disagree with and then also just from a messaging standpoint i i developed a campaign philosophy which is never let the other side occupy the space so way back when when you know conservative radio started in the 90s they wanted me on i went on let's talk i mean i'm not i'm not afraid of the conversation by coming on someone's show i am not endorsing everything that they've ever said i believe that that is the most effective way to represent the district and the most effective way to be a successful politician in general you i'm regular on fox news i did matt gates's podcast just a couple weeks ago i've been on tucker carlson show and back in the day sean hannity i just believe that's the right way to engage in general and in this particular moment when our country is becoming more and more divided it seems to me like more and more people are simply deciding you know part of their decision is who am i not going to listen to who am i not going to engage with and i think in a representative democracy that is an incredibly dangerous thing to get that divided so i definitely want to engage and i you know certainly i i know a number of people who are big fans of yours you have a very wide following you are an influential person when it comes to culture and politics and for any side of the debate to say we're just going to try to like block that i think it's incredibly counterproductive as for what i'm hoping to get out of it is just hopefully an informative discussion whenever i go into these things for the most part i hope to learn something and i hope to offer something that the other person can learn as well you know and one final point on this is i think too often now when we're getting engaged in debates the goal is to force the other person to agree with you and don't get me wrong there are moments in politics and in life when you're trying to do that you know if if a bill is finally on the floor of the house and i'm trying to pass it i'm trying to win an argument and in that moment i'm going to try to get as many people as possible to agree with me but for the most part when you're engaging with someone your mission shouldn't be to bludge in the other side into absolutely agree with you on everything it should be to learn it should be grow in your understanding maybe you're missing something first of all second of all maybe if you listen to the other side you will better understand how to make your own argument so i always find the most interesting discussions to be with people who i don't agree with on everything so to me it's a logical thing so so there's two things there i mean the first is part of the reason to talk to people with whom you disagree is that you're going to run into disagreements with what you think in the world on the from nature and from culture from other people from yourself and if you set yourself up so that you're optimally challenged by resistance in the abstract realm through discussion then at least in principle your ideas are going to be a lot more battle hardened and tested so there's no real difference between that and thinking so so so given that i'm curious also given the self-evidence of that and the necessity of that even in terms of getting your own idea straight what do you think it is that's produced these increasingly insuperable barriers to communication and also more specifically why have you got away with talking to the opposition let's say when so many other people are appear increasingly unwilling to do so i mean you said you know you've talked to all sorts of reprehensible people on the on the rightwing side you didn't say reprehensible i did not say reprehensible and i don't believe i said that yes i don't believe reprehensible yes i said that definitely definitely and and you know the the the walls haven't come tumbling down on you now people are afraid of council culture and they're afraid of being mobbed and alienated and they're often afraid of that if they step across whatever the divide happens to be at the moment but you know by your own testimony you've been talking to people across the aisle and the walls haven't fallen down on you so why is that and and why if that's the case and it can be done why do you think so many people are loathed to do it well i think the biggest reason i'm trying to figure out how to put this because it's hard okay it is difficult and and and i will tell you right up front you know and it's got and also i've been doing this for a long time i think it's one of the benefits if you take me back to in my 20s and everything i devel i would develop strong opinions about thing i'm a very passionate person i believe strongly in a number of different things and i believe in advocating for them and i i would build up to a good belief and then i'd run into someone who would say a bunch of things that i hadn't thought of and it's an incredibly unsettling experience all right because first of all you're like oh my goodness i i i just i put my myself out there and am i wrong okay am i missing some huge thing and i sort of run back in my mind i was just at this event and i just told these people this is the way it is this is the way it has to be and oh my gosh i've spread this message and and and i'm wrong yeah you know so it's difficult in that regard and then whenever that happens there's i think off the top of my head two possibilities one you are in fact wrong you missed something something that is crucial to what your position is or two the argument has come at you that you haven't had the chance to think your way through it okay because i frequently will get hit with things and this happens a lot when we're debating an issue in the armed services committee i prepare for a lot of it but a lot of it it's happening okay and it's it's always joke after the debate you're like oh i should have made that point you know that would that would you know so so and but that's hard okay it's really hard to go back and okay how do i counter that argument i know what i believe i believe it if i can just go out there and say it but now i got to counter this so i think a lot of people are drawn to the easier thing and the easier thing is oh all these people preach into the choir i mean pick your favorite cliche at this point and that's one of the big things one of the reasons actually why i mean and certainly there are things you and i disagree on but from what i've seen of your speeches and from our conversations you are a believer in doing things that are difficult and the inherent benefit that comes to us as human beings from doing that and so am i but by definition it's not easy okay and as human beings we are as i said i think before we started this we're incredibly adaptable and that's what i learned from my own personal experience when i went through my mental health and my you know physical health problems is human beings are incredibly capable of getting better all right if you work at it that's number one but number two it is rarely our first inclination to do something that's uncomfortable we we are going to look for the more comfortable option just instinctively so you have to fight that instinct it's not easy it's not easy to do the thing that's uncomfortable that's going to make you better and i think a lot of people struggle with that and of course modern technology makes it very easy to never have to encounter things that you don't agree with you can you can filter every aspect pect of your life to make sure it stays in the lane you want to stay in final point on this don't want to give a long-winded answer the second question here but is you know i think it's the reason people say wow we never talk about politics and religion okay what's the what's the fun in that okay you know how do we learn and grow if we don't talk about the things that make us un a little bit uncomfortable so that we can better understand each other and not be off in our own little corners thinking all kinds of awful terrible things about each other and then never never trying to bridge that that divide so by temperament i a very agreeable person which is a rather feminine trait because women tend to be more agreeable than men and agreeable people don't like conflict and i've been embroiled in a lot of conflict and there's a very specific reason for that and the reason is is that i learned mostly through clinical experience although that wasn't all of it that conflict delayed is conflict multiplied and you know you pointed out that it's challenging to be shown to be wrong and the reason for that i've looked at this technically the reason for that is that our beliefs orient us like a person is oriented in with a map and if you find out that your map is wrong then you don't know where you are and you don't know where you're going and that produces anxiety and hopelessness and the bigger the akake the more of the map is invalidated and that's very disorienting profoundly disorienting we don't like to be lost and so then you might say well why would you ever bother challenging your beliefs or engaging in conflict with someone and the answer to that this is a bit of a reiteration but the answer to that is quite clear it's a lot better to have your ideas tested in the abstract than it is to have your convictions demolished by reality itself and and so you need to this is partly what i think has gone wrong for example in the education system lucen off has written a fair bit about this along with jonathan height is that we believe that students because of the fragility of their mental health should be shielded from uncomfortable conversations let's say or uncon uncomfortable conversations and the clinical reality is very very clear it's very clear this is one thing that all reliable clinicians have agreed upon over a 50-year period which is that voluntary encounter with what you're afraid of and even potentially disgusted by is clearly salutary and curative and so you want to give people a hair of the dog that bit them constantly right to fortify them against challenge and the best way to do that is to engage voluntarily in the exchange of of ideas of representations so and the reason i'm dwelling on this in part is because people might be listening and thinking why in the hell should i ever have a difficult conversation why should i ever talk to someone who disagrees with me and the answer is well you if you're 100% about right right about everything and you're currently living in paradise itself and everything in your life is as good as it can possibly be then you don't ever have to encounter a negative opinion because you've got everything right but if there's some un unfurrowed corner of your soul that still isn't in the order that it could be and you're you're feeling that as a consequence of your own suffering then you should be out there testing your ideas against everything you possibly can on the off chance that you might be fortunate enough to learn how you're stupid and wrong so you can stop being both of those and of course that's painful but it's not as painful as being stupid and wrong souls well i mean a couple things about them me first of all i'm with you i you know as i document i i grew up a very anxious person i i did not like conflict either because i had massive insecurities psychological issues that became significant problems later in life so yeah right there with you because i think it's worth pointing out that there are some people who like conflict and seek it out and that's not a good thing and that's sort of brings me my third point and dealing what you're talking about to me it's all about balance and that's something that we've sort of lost and again i think part of the problem is balance is difficult you tell me that in every situation this is the way it is all right i'm good i know what to do you tell me in every situation that it's great but if you tell me well it depends okay you know what did the person say what are the circumstances well then you're back into a situation where you got to work pretty hard to figure out what the right way to be is and that's hard but that's life we need to teach people how to balance that and i'm completely with you on the fact that in our education system and in many aspects of our life right now we do not teach resilience okay we teach people to be protected now the one caveat i'll throw out there is a lot of these people who like conflict you know get to the point where they take a certain amount of joy in putting people in difficult circumstances which is not for any clinically beneficial person it's just because they're being jerks so you can empower a lot of people acting like jerks by saying well of course we have to test them so you always have to try to have a balance here the purpose of conflict is to help people get better and you have to understand that purpose of conflict is not so that you can attack somebody all right i see this frankly a lot of times in parenting it's really important i have a 23 and a 20- year old child so but my wife and i have raised two children now and have experienced this and we're human we're trying to educate our children along the way teach them how to be better but then also we got our own stuff going on here here okay so when you're getting angry at a child is it because you're trying to make them better or is because you're trying to score a point and you really need to try to figure out how to balance that and i think a lot of people don't so if you can balance those two things it's fine i mean i'm completely with you on the resilience thing but but you also have to guard against resilience being just an excuse to abuse somebody so with regard to scoring a point so you imagine that there are two ways of establishing a modum of psychological and possibly social stability and one would be to negotiate a settlement voluntarily so that you and i could exchange our opinions and come to a negotiated agreement about the nature of the present and about the nature of the desirable future right now the advantage to that is that if it's voluntarily negotiated you can go off on your own and i can go off on my own we'll walk down the same path without a lot of mutual ual without a lot of mutual supervision so that's very helpful another alternative though is to attain a certain degree of comparative status and so it turns out that the serotonin system monitors comparative status and so if i score a point on you in principle that elevates my status above you and then you might ask well what's the advantage to that and the advantage to status acquisition is a raise in central serotonergic function and that dampens negative emotion and so you can imag you can imagine there's two deep places there's two deep sources of the conflict between two different approaches to problem solving right if i can attain comparative status this is people are trying to obtain comparative status very constantly in our culture often without doing the requisite effort but the advantage to that is that the status boost does produce a quelling of negative emotion now it's not as good a solution as a negotiated piece the problem with a negotiated piece is that you have to wander through the bloody disagreement and sort out all the intervening conflicts in order to establish the peace if i could try to put it a little bit bit more simply when you're having a discussion with somebody are you trying to solve a problem are you trying to get to a fair result or are you trying to win okay and there's a big difference and i think in a lot of the disagreements out there in the world too often now people are trying to win okay they're trying to own the other side me temperamentally i don't know why but i'm i'm a peacemaker well i think it's partially because i grew up anxious and there were you know things in my family that were a little disruptive and i just want peace and stability and i learned early on and it's not that it's it's not that i'm not selfish and not passionate and don't have things that i personally want but as i grew i realize that that above all of those things is i wanted a peaceful environment around me and if i'm going to achieve a peaceful environment around me i have to care what other people want and what other people think too and you have to work at that and that's where i think the conflict goes i think you're right i you do you get that initial high i was right you know now i'm going to win the argument now everybody has to do what i say from here on out because i've proven that i am the superior intellect in this place it's like yeah that doesn't work too well past a certain point we all have our ups and downs and again i really want to emphasize this point you know i've negotiated a lot of things over what is it now 33 years that i've been an elected official and it's so crucial if you've gone to negotiate something actually i'll quote something to a good friend of mine who's a very successful businessman told me if he's involved in a business deal and when it's all over said and done with he got everything he wanted he knows he did it wrong okay right because it's got to be about how we keep everybody on board and i worry that as we become more dogmatic in our politics and our business in our my gosh in in little league for crying out loud you know it's like no we have to win we have to be the one on top we have to it's like okay but you're in for a whole lot of conflict if you don't care at least a little bit about whether or not the community as a whole was getting to a fair place okay so so that's a great seg way as far as i'm concerned into a political issue that i've been longing to hash out with the democrats for example who will talk to me and i'd like to explain momentarily why i'm not a fan of identity politics and it's relevant i think it's relevant to the concerns that you just laid out it's incredibly relevant yes okay so so so what i see happening in the broad culture and this is part of the culture war is this increasing insistence that i can define myself in precisely the terms that i want to define myself now that tends to devolve into something like sexual identification or ethnic identification or some other group identification which is also something i think is incredibly dangerous but but here's the problem with this and i i've been trying to think it through from the perspective of a psychotherapist on the one hand i could claim that one of my clients for example has the perfect right to define themselves subjectively but that runs into to a number of problems and the problems are for example that sometimes people's subjective self-identification is clearly counterproductive so anorexics for example think they're too fat when in fact they're generally on the verge of absolute starvation and people who are manic get an very expanded sense of self-confidence and believe that they can do all sorts of things that they can't and that they have resources that they don't and so forth almost everything about psychotherapy is actually about identity and so it's clearly the case that you cannot merely identify yourself subjectively and proceed appropriately in the world on that basis and here's why i believe and this is partly i think what's tilted me more towards conservatism in so far as i am tilted in that direction so psychotherapists who are inheritors of a kind of a protestant and humanistic tradition have presumed that mental health is something that you that characterizes the structure of your psyche it's something internal and i think that that's incorrect i think that what mental health is is the net benefit of experiencing a harmonious nested relationship with the broader community so it's very difficult to be sane if you're not getting along with your wife and you and your wife can't be sane if you're not getting along with your children children and your family can't be sayan if you're having a scrap with your local community and the local community can't be saye if it's not well integrated into the town and the state and the nation and then whatever might happen to be above that and so the the right manner of conceptualizing mental health is that it's the manifestation of the harmony that comes from having the hierarchy of being put in its proper place now when we turn to subjective self-identification on the sexual or ethnic front for example the insistence that i am whoever i say i am the problem with that is well what the hell are the other people supposed to do i mean you've been married for for decades you have kids you know you know 30 years congratulations i just had my 34th this week you know perfectly well that and and this is germaine also to your point about conflict is that you have to establish a negotiate peace in order for stability to maintain itself and negotiation what you're negotiating constantly as far as i can tell is your identity right and so ab so i'm very concerned about okay so what so first of all do you think that that's those observations are relevant to the culture war that's raging now not least over subjective self identification and and what what's your opinion about how the political landscape has laid itself out around those issues sure i think it's very relevant let let make couple quick points to walk through this first of all yeah and we haven't talked about it but i keep making references to physical mental pain i i went through a severe anxiety problem severe chronic i wrote a book about it which sort of outlined how i got through that when you started talking about psychotherapy i went through three and a half years of psychotherapy that was enormously helpful and i think you're right your your your internal mental health is going to be dictated a lot by your relationships i would say in defense of the the psychotherapists out there in the world your ability to have those positive relationships has a lot to do with your own internal mind and whether or not you are psychologically stable person whether or not you've dealt with the issues in your life so just that little quick shout out to the psychotherapists i think there is an important component of that second i think you're you're you're working your way around the the broader culture issue that that we have and i think it is incredibly important i tell you i i read christopher rufo's book along the lines of me being engaged that and i i spoke to chris just last week and walked through some of this and you're getting down sort of into the granular level of okay what has happened as an outgrowth of our concern about racism bigotry and discrimination and the conversations that people have had about how identity factors into that but i think the big problem and the thing that i hope and i can try to convince folks on the conservative side of this that when it comes to the fight and the battle that we have and certainly i think christopher rufo did a pretty good job of outlining some of the more extreme elements of the left approach to this but what motivates people like me is the fact that racism bigotry and discrimination are problems in american society they are okay you can't fairly look at the history of the united states and conclude otherwise now i also think you can't fairly look at the history of the united states and conclude that that's all we've ever been about okay is racism bigotry and discrimination i think as with most things it's a balance and there's a lot of things going on i think the problem i have with the conservative movement i had this conversation with mr ruo is yes what the left is doing is problematic but the right conservatives republicans they don't offer a reasonable alternative because their alternative is racism and bigotry aren't really a problem let's just stop worrying about it and move on okay and and logically i have all kinds of problems with that approach so then we get trapped between you know the far right in terms of how they want to approach that and the farle and their very specific way of approaching it and to answer one of your earlier questions that i skipped over as to as to why i can be successful doing this i think the overwhelming majority of people are in fact looking for what i'm talking about an open and engaging approach they're just not offered it altogether that often and that's where we're trapped in identity politics is these two extremes okay you know racism bigotry and discrimination is everything every single decision every single thought you've ever had has to be focused on identity and then the other side not a problem not we're thinking about there's a lot in between there that i think we could work on to build a better society it's time to take your fault style to the

of people in california my friend and former student greg herwitz on democrat messaging for about five years and i've had a lot of conversation with democrats and one of the things i've often asked them this is a very complicated problem is when does the left go too far and it's a complicated problem for a variety of reasons i would say the first reason is is that most of the excesses on the progressive left make themselves camouflage themselves in the guise of compassion now i know there are bad actors on both side of the political spectrum there's bad actors in the religious domain there's bad actors in the scientific domain and these are always people they have a very identifiable set of personality characteristics generally bordering on the psychopathic that will use a moral st st to put forward their own agenda instrumentally or to torment other people and there's a very well-developed psychological literature indicating this and the the problem there is that boundaries have to be drawn to stop those actors the psychopathic types from invading the general culture and taking it out and a small proportion of people like that can do that psychopaths in general by the way run about 3% of the population that's about as successful as they ever get but they're an omnipresent threat to cultural stability well i guess that's a little lower lower than i thought so i'll i'll take that as good news but yeah yeah well it is good news because it means that 95% of people aren't like that it's very good news now the bad news is that it doesn't take very many people like that to cause an awful lot of trouble now the other thing that happens on the left and this is different than the right is that people on the left do have more difficulty temperamentally drawing boundaries and you can see this in the rhetoric that right and left use well i'm this isn't a criticism exactly no no i'm i'm just think a boundary a boundary can keep good things out just as much as it can keep bad things out and so the liberal bet especially the the leftist bet is the more information that flows freely the better off everyone is and the conservative rejoinder is yeah but not all information because some things are so toxic they can't be digested and then the discussion is well what should we allow in and what's too toxic to be digested and that's con that has to be constantly discussed because it shifts and changes that's part of the reason why free speech is necessary but what i've observed like i've asked for example virtually every democrat i've ever come in contact with when does the left go too far i'm i'm going to decorate that with one other observation so one of the disciplines i studied social psychology the social psychologists insisted for 70 years that there was no such thing as left leftwing authoritarianism that didn't crack until 2016 yeah well right that's utterly insane but but it is actually troublesome because it is harder to point to an ex to excesses on the left and to say well there's a policy that purports to be put forward in a compassionate manner that's actually not that at all and that's highly toxic and so you've been involved in the scrum of washington politics for a long time i asked robert kennedy this question and he said before bloody youtube took our my conversation with him down he said i don't he said essentially that he didn't want to answer that because he wasn't trying to run a campaign of divisiveness and you know fair enough but it it it doesn't get to the heart of it we have a culture war going on there's excesses on both sides a fair bit of it's driven by psychopathy it isn't obvious to me that the democrats have done a good job of drawing a dividing line between them and the people who are you know the moderate democrats who i know are most of them and the and the small minority of extreme radicals who have a disproportionate influence and so well i'm curious about what you think about that and well so you went in a whole bunch of different directions here and let me try to make sure i can can can sift through it i mean first of all you know on your point about there's no such thing as leftwing authoritarianism i've stayed in regular contact with some pretty hardcore conservative people over the years and a number of them have argued with me that there's there's no such thing as right-wing violence okay so when it when it comes to that ability to try to like i don't know twist the world to fit your ideology i haven't noticed any particular difference between the the the left and the right on that they both are capable of it second you rais a really interesting point which i will just mention briefly and not go down that rap not a rabbit hole won't go down that that discussion because i want to get back into that you know when does the let go too far question but yeah i i went to forom university which is a fascinating place to go to i'm not catholic i i'm an episcop bilion i thought about becoming a catholic after leaving forom and the primary reason that i didn't is because it's too much work okay i was 23 years old they said well you got to go to classes for 6 months and i'm like i went to classes for like a month and i was like i don't want to do that anyway minor point but anyway i took a class things is interesting about forom particularly forom in the 80s i don't know about now is you know jesuit schools have both some really really left-leaning professors and then some hardcore conservative professors as well and i had this this professor i took a class with about edmund burke and sort of studying the importance of tradition and this was a very conservative professor who was pro-life and at one point during our discussion he said you know the worst thing our country ever did was to allow people to debate abortion and at the time i was 21 years old i had a very li liberal mind my parents had raised me that you know we have open debate we do all this other stuff and you know and it was just it struck me as like just who is this guy you know saying that we shouldn't even talk about it but when you stop and think about it from a logical standpoint he was cw life he didn't want any abortion to be legal at all it was illegal so if we didn't talk about it he was going to stay up top so that's that's an interesting little debate about how much freedom of information you know depending on what you're trying to accomplish personally i'm with you the more we talk about it the more we get to the right answers is what i believe on on that front but on your question you know when does the left go too far when does the right go too far one of the things i've discovered is it's best not to engage in that type of conversation i take a vastly more practical approach to it and i will specifically explain what you mean and then i will answer that that that question so when i look around the seattle king county area that i represent my district's now entirely within king county it's changed over the course of my 27 years of representing it we have a significant problem with some very specific issues we have a problem with homelessness we have a problem with drug abuse we have a problem with crime and we have a problem with affordable housing all right so when i dive into this i don't dive into it going okay who's the who let happen i dive into it like okay what are we going to do about it all right what's working what's not working how do we how do we actually get to the point where we better address those issues and within that context the the specific answer to your question as to what's problematic is that the left has moved too far in the direction of let's look at the broader societal causes of these things which by the way is important it is okay you know if you have more economic opportunity if you have better access to health care if you have better access to education all of those things that i just mentioned with the possible exception of the affordable housing problem which is complicated get better that is true but if you take individual responsibility completely out of the equation and say we're just going to look at grer societal problems that's where you get into trouble we need to get a balance and i've had this conversation with a number of different folks community- based organizations county government city government as i'm trying to sort of work through this and i asked the question you know well okay broader societal stuff i get but what role does individual choice play in a decision to abuse drugs in a decision to commit crime and frequently the answer i get back is well it really doesn't which is which is wrong okay i mean i you know i'm not getting getting into some broader ideological oh my gosh you've gone too far you i don't care about that you're you're adopting a policy that is going to make it more difficult to actually help people and i'm progressive on this i believe in alternatives to incarceration okay i believe in you know getting people into treatment so you've got that's issue one is is there any individual responsibility here do we set expectations for people do we hold them accountable for their actions and and out a level okay you don't take a homeless drug addict with a mental problem and say okay you got to go to work 40 hours a week starting right now no okay i get that but you could be a little something okay let's let's do a little something today we'll do a little more tomorrow and we'll do a little more the next day they're rejecting that and then the second problem is individual agency okay and i also that's point i i believe in that okay you know you can't just again grab somebody pull them off the street street throw them in a me mental hospital and tell them to get better okay you want to work with them to get to the point where they're making individual choices but they're making the right choices and i think we've gone too far in the other direction of look we can't tell this person what they should do okay when they're ready okay they they'll they'll seek treatment when they're ready they'll move on this it's a lot more of a balance okay and i think in our approach looking at the broader system societal issues also looking at some of the authoritarian problems i mean look we incarcerated too many people in this country over the course of 60 60 years it became the easy button for public policy and it ruined a lot of lives it absolutely did and we should fix that but you don't have to go all the way over to the other side where okay we can abolish the whole criminal justice system and everything will be fine the problem we run into in our community is so we've got a lot of people pushing that that that further out agenda on those two issues and then as i keep saying what's the conservative alternative the conservative alternative is well let's just keep locking them up and let's pretend that racism doesn't exist well my community isn't going to go for that i'm not going to go for that you know i think we need a more balanced approach but that fundamentally to answer your question of it'd be wrong to say and when we spoke once you you put the question is what what is the democratic party doing wrong democratic part is a big amorphous thing you put the question a little differently today what is the left doing wrong i would say those are the two issues we need a better balance that takes into account personal responsibility individual choice and the need to help people get to a better place i i've taken to summing it up from a meeting i had a week ago you know the phrase meet people where they are i completely agree with that it's long been my philosophy when i'm trying to pass a bill or get a vote i got to understand that person before i i'm not going to come in and tell them to be something different so meet people where they are i amend that to say yes but don't leave them there okay you know yes person homeless they got all these difficulties now what are we going to do to help them get to a better place that is the way i would describe that that challenge so i agree with you in relationship to the dir of let's say conservative alternative alternative vision i think that's a real weakness on the conservative side and maybe even more specifically on the republican side so we can return to that later i wanted to embellish your comments about agency and responsibility a bit so technically there's not much difference between agency and hope they they run on the same neurological circuit so if you believe you can do something well that's a hopeful vision and hope is positive emotion broadly speaking it's mediated by the systems that produce positive emotion and indicates the probability of successful movement forward and so by attributing all problems to society you risk removing individual agency and the consequence of removing individual agency is you destroy hope and that's not a positive thing and then there's another element that plays into that that i'd be interested i want your opinions on all of this but one of the things i've noticed as i've traveled around the world speaking to my audiences let's say the people who come to listen and and to consider is that if i draw a relationship between responsibility and meaning the crowd always falls silent and the the reason for that as far as i can tell is that the meaning that sustains us in life is actually a consequence not so much of having the right to do whatever we want so that would be on the hedonic side which can lead to a very short-term and impulsive orientation self-centered orientation instead it's the res the meaning emerges as a consequence of bearing the responsibility for yourself and for your partner and for your family and for your community i mean literally that's where the meaning comes from and if that's demolished and that's on the personal responsibility side if that's demolished you leave people b of meaning and that is one of the dangers of abstracting the diagnosis of societal problems all the way up to the to the highest level of social organization you know the pathology of the patriarchy is that you demolish the domain of useful attention and action on the individual side and i also think that that's one of the cardinal sins let's say of the radical left is that it's that combination of excessive abstraction and also the now the leftists their their point fundamentally is well how do you discriminate assigning responsibility from laying blame right i mean well and that's it's really a good question and you always wrestle with in psychotherapy you know if i have a client i personally don't think it's that hard i'm with you everyone i run into says it is but having been a parent the way you do that is it's it's almost a matter of cone okay you know you can have a conversation with your child when you've done something wrong and i had when i try not to drag my children too much into this but i can think some specific conversations when you calmly walk through an explanation of here's what you did here's the choice you made here's why it was a problem or you just scream at them for being terrible awful horrible human beings okay to me that's how you differentiate okay blame is an affirmative you're you know responsibility is just okay we're all flawed we're all humans you know we're all going to screw things up i'm not saying because you did that wrong okay that that means you're a terrible awful horrible human being and i can't stand to look at you okay but you did something wrong so let's not pretend that that didn't happen just cu it's going to make you feel bad to realize that you did something wrong let's have a professional grownup kind caring helpful conversation about how you can do it better and it just kills me that on the one hand we've got all oh gosh no if you if you criticize somebody you know that makes them feel bad so we have to make sure that we don't do that this is harm reduction okay which we talk about which is a major impediment to efficiently running organizations by the way if you to that level and then you got the people on the other side who just say you know that they ought to be able to yell and abuse whoever they want because they're in charge why is it so hard you you you you delve into the mind a lot more than i do why is it so hard to just go okay let's just let's balance that and reasonably and responsibly help people get better instead of trying to tear them down according to a recent report planned parenthood continues to rake in billions to despite dwindling clients the biggest takeaway here is that planned parenthood is generating vast profits including millions in taxpayer funding with the help of pre-born you and me we are stealing their clientele meaning the babies they are trying to kill pre-born operates on a very slim budget as they rescue over 200 babies lives every day and they receive no government funding pre-born network of clinics are situated in the darkest corners competing head-to-head with the abortion giants they need our help now more than ever when you donate $28 to pre-born you will offer a free ultrasound to an expectant mother caught in crisis once she hears that harpy and sees that precious life her baby's chance at life doubles if you would like to sponsor a precious baby's life your gift will be tax deductible and will go directly towards saving babies lives dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby or visit preborn docomo all gifts are tax deductible you will never regret saving a child's life that's pound 250 baby or visit preborn docomo well it's it's part of the problem that you point to in your book and your book i thought i'd just point this out to everyone the book is called let me i've got it written down here i want to get it exactly right lost and broken my journey back from chronic pain and crippling anxiety one of the things you discuss in that book is the difficulty of diagnosis and this is relevant with regard to the judicious decisions and conversations that are necessary in assigning responsibility and you might ask well why bother calling your kids out on something they've done wrong if it hurts their feelings and certainly parents will avoid doing that especially if they're the kind of parents that foster dependence but the answer is well if your child did something stupid that hurt them and other people in a manner that's counterproductive if continued the price they have to pay to realize that flaw is offset by the advantage of not doing the stupid thing again now the the diagnostic complexity is toold right one is first of all things are complex and deciding how someone went to hell in a hand basket parsing that up the responsibility up there with regard to social contribution familial contribution and individual responsibility i mean that can take hundreds of hours of dialogue it's very very complicated so complexity is part of it and then the the conflict that might come along with mediating responsibility and blame that's difficult you know if you're talking to your kids they might say well you know if you weren't such a son of a  i wouldn't be so rebellious and that's you know that's a perfectly reasonable potential proposition but there's no shortage of conflict that has to be had in sorting that out and of course one other lay one other layer on that i just want to throw in is so i have two children and and i'm married and when you're like negotiating between okay an argument between like my son and my wife or my son my daughter then it's like okay well what about what they did all right and then that that throws in a little bit more complexity as well personally i think it's all navigable like guess you can work your way through it let's put it that way it's not easy for the reasons you describe but i i think it is more doable than most people give it credit for it that's all i'm saying well the alternative is to put your head in the sand and continue to get kicked as a consequence or to degenerate into out outright conflict i mean it's either it's negotiation slavery or tyranny those are the fundamental options and so well on that front one of the things i've also viewed and you can help me with this if you would is i'm watching you guys in the us tear yourselves apart we're doing it to some degree in canada with regard to the idea of systemic racism let's say now you pointed out out quite rightly that the proclivity to alienate and manifest prejudice because of innate group differences is pervasive and i think the anthropological literature suggests that you know most tribal groups around the world describe their people as human and everyone else is non-human it's an extraordinarily common linguistic c categorization proclivity and so i think you can make a strong hsian case that although people are cooperative and will reach across the aisle that generally we tend to think of the people like us as human and the people who aren't like us as not human and so out of that comes just to be clear i don't bias and racism i don't know that i would go quite that far i i would say we tend to be tribal we tend to think of the group that we belong to as being somehow better than other groups i don't know that we necessarily decide that other groups aren't human just that there's the tendency to think that you're better and that will vary obviously situation to situation but it it is a human tendency yeah you see you it it's complex because obviously tribal groups can trade and intermingle and so there is a countervailing tendency but the linguistic tendency is literally to define the non-tribal members as not human now i'm not saying that we necessarily do that fully but we can easily be tempted in that direction now the radical leftist critique of american society is that the society itself is systemically racist and this actually really bothers me as an outside observer and an admirer of the american system now the canadian system is quite similar although we're doing everything we can to muck it up at the moment but you see my sense is exactly the opposite which is that the proclivity for systemic bias and racism is deeply rooted in the human soul and it's a a bloody miracle that there was any progress there's ever been any progress made in that direction at all and i would say that your society grounded as it is in a broader uk tradition is the stellar example of the counterveiling tendency which is to attribute to all human souls something approximating divine value regardless of the particulars of their group identity and so then when i see these radical critiques of american societ accusing it of systemic racism and being even founded on those principles i think this is very counterproductive because not only is it not the case it's actually the case that the uk/ american tradition that has made of slavery let's say an absolute moral evil is rare and most pronounced in the case of while the anglo-american tradition and so what i see happening with the radical left for example is they're actually throwing out the very thing that they purport to support because well and you can tell me what you think about this the idea that might makes right and that if i can force you into servitude i have the i have the right to do that that's pretty damn self-evident the notion that you have some intrinsic worth even if you're weak and easily what would you say easily manipulated and forced that you still have some worth that's a very difficult proposition to put forward and yet both the uk and the us managed it and whatever degree of true interracial harmony and freedom has prevailed particularly in the west particularly in the us is actually a consequence of that counterveiling tendency and i think that's the fundamental forward thrust of the american enterprise so when i see the leftists go after that and they and that's something that's become increasingly dogmatically taught in universities i than god you guys you know you're killing the very thing that in principle has been the closest thing to bringing about what you want that's ever made itself manifest in history yeah i mean i think you've hit upon what is you know one of the principal divisive issues in american politics that is making things more difficult to get things done because people are locked into that debate which side is going to win that debate and as i've said a couple of times and we'll likely say more more frequently as this interview progresses i take a more practical problemsolving approach to things and it's you know what do we need to do to build a better society now when it comes you know what what is america founded on it's no one thing and it's no one thing to one group of people i tend to agree with you that the principal idea is equality is the idea that we are not going to be as tribal that's certainly what the document said but i think the thing to remember you know for for conservatives is this approach to dealing with racism bigotry and discrimination didn't come from nowhere okay it came from in addition to all those traditions that you rightly just describe we've had a pretty rich history of also some pretty thorough discrimination now that's that's changed gotten better i confidently assert over the course of the last 60 years but for much of american history i mean let let's start with you know the the founding principles of everyone should have a say in how they are govern democracy which was one of the big ideas that we tried to introduce well at the time we introduced it everyone knows i mean it applied to white male property owners and that was it now my personal take on this is at the time we did that democracy in its trueu sense really didn't exist anywhere on the globe so to take that step was a significant step and ever since then we've been expanding on that okay we've been trying to get better at it but also along the way incredible history of you know white supremacist white supremacy patriarchy all manner of discrim discrimination that have in fact been more locked in to how we've governed ourselves than most people realize and i'll give you just one one example and then expand out on how i think we should handle this and i agree with you the way the far-left is handling it i don't agree with okay i also don't agree with the way the right is handling it but you know we have this debate and this something that i led the the fight on in congress to rename military bases in our country we have a lot of military bases and installations and other things ships that were named after civil war southern generals and southern leaders and so we we've pushed this effort to say we should change those names and we get into this debate about you can't it's our history it's you know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and as i've debated this and i found out what a lot of people don't realize about that stuff this stuff was not named in'70 or'80 the names came about in the early 20th century after reconstruction failed there was a concerted effort in many parts of this country to reestablish white supremacy you go back and you listen to some of the speeches i think i forget the name of it this a stone mountain georgia which is this etching of i think four confederate generals go back to i think like 1910 when it opened and you listen to the speeches to the people commemorating that it's a lot of white supremacy all right it's the same time that the klux clan rose up at the same time that jim crow got put in place there actually a pretty interesting book i forget the name of it i think it's a fever in the heartland by tim egan about how the clan took over indiana okay not talking alabama i'm talking indiana early 20th century in the fight that had to go to to move that back so that history exists all right and we have to wrestle with that history and figure what does it mean h how do we better treat people equal and not fall back into that now i have participated in some dei trainings not that many and there's two parts of it that i really like and then i think there's an incredible missed opportunity the part that i like is we talk about this history because a lot of people don't understand this history i mean they they don't know it's like well okay the civil war happened the north one and there was you know discrimination in the south and then everything sort of sorted itself out well well no actually it didn't well into the 70s 80s 90s okay there were significant problems in all these areas and if we educate ourselves about that history we will better understand our own country and frankly i think we'll better understand how difficult it is to achieve the ideals that you talked about this is what we're trying to do but it doesn't necessarily come easily so understand that history and then the second piece of what they try to do is and the individual that you're working with what's their story who are they okay you know if you are a black person growing up in america you had a different experience than if you were a white person growing up in america and if you're going to work with somebody whether it's in an office or a school or wherever having a conversation and understanding your colleagues i think is a very positive thing now where it goes off the beam in my estimation is it then sort of talks about how discrimination and bigotry is unique to white western culture okay yeah that yeah that's pretty that's that's right now to call that wrong is to barely scrape the surface it's a universal human proclivity it is but understand that under the circumstances and there's a lot of different reasons but white european culture emerged as the dominant culture i don't know 19th century thereabouts actually i'm reading a book called when china rules the world it's written in 2009 it's an assumption about how china's coming and what's it going to be like and it sort of walks through this history of you know how and it it to some degree was an accident of history you know guns germs and steel right you know what whatever played out this particular group of people became dominant it was white men so therefore that discrimination was the discrimination that dominated a significant chunk of the globe it's not irrelevant all right to point out that that came to pass i think it is more helpful and and going all the way back and i'll close with this to your identity comment what i find most useful is when we talk about things that talk about our shared humanity as opposed to the things that make us different and of course we're different of course men are different from women of course whatever your cultural background is it's going to make you a little bit different from somebody else it's so much better when we talk about the things that we have in common and i think one of the things we have in common no matter who who you are is a feeling that other people don't understand you okay i mean that's a pretty universal thing in my experience so if you want to get together and talk about well here's my experience but we shouldn't segregate it based on race or anything like that we should put humans together and say discrimination bigotry bias these can be problems you know let's talk about how we have things in common instead of how we're different so i think we could do a lot better but again the problem is and i we had this debate in the house arm services committee on this year's defense bill now that the republicans have retaken the house i was the chairman of the committee for four years when democrats were in charge now i'm the ranking member diversity equity and inclusion was a huge part of the debate and the debate on the right was we got to get rid of it lock stock and barrel we just got to get rid of it i just think there's got to be a better answer i don't necessarily not necessarily i don't like the way the farle does diversity equity and inclusion but the idea that we can just say it's all good good no racism here no bigotry let's just move forward and not talk about it i am at least equally troubled by yeah well what seems to have happened to me on the dei front especially is that and this has been partly abetted by psychologists who put forward the implicit association test for example which reports to indicate that the standard psyche is wired up rif with implicit biases of sufficient magnitude to to warp the entire social enterprise these are very weak tests by the way they're not very valid they're nowhere near valid enough to be used for clinical diagnosis because they are very stringent criteria established to allow a test to be used for clinical diagnosis and the accusation of racism is a kind of diagnosis and you cannot do that with implicit association test period two of the people who made the test there are three have already disavowed their use for such purposes and so what i see happening with the dei movement at least in some not small part is that people who are advancing a particular view of their own moral v virtue and who are misusing the science in an in what would you unforgivable manner are elevating their status in the public domain by purporting to be compassionate when in fact all they're doing most of what they're doing is feathering their own nests at the expense of broader social harmony i see very little good in the yeah and and i hear that and certainly you know i people will always try to you know push the debates you know in in their favor and i'm as i said i i i go to great links to avoid those sorts of traps and get back to sort of just practically what are we trying to accomplish here i'm i'm thinking as we're talking about this about the question that was popular you know and i may still will be you know do you think healthc care is a privilege or a right they'll ask that question as if the answer has some sort of significant impact on the quality of your health care system you know i mean call it what you want to call it it's a public good that we need to figure out how to deliver in the most efficient and effective way possible let's work on that but people are always trying to position themselves if if i can get people to use the right language i win okay and the thing is that that's not entirely wrong okay but it also distracts from the practical problem solving of how do we actually improve things so more so than just about anybody you're ever going to come across i will fight against that i will not answer those sort of well do you believe it's like let's talk about what we want to do with the policy i'll talk about that i'm not going to pick your word or her word or his word let's just work on solving the problem but i'll give you one of the examples that i give a lot of times about why i think the eii is important and in my district is kind of fascinating i graduated from tai high school which is right by cac airport my father was a baggage handler at for united at seac that's why i grew up there and when i graduated south king county which is south of seattle was a white blue collar suburb it's what it was it has diversified massively in the 40 years since i graduated from high school and one of the things that i've noticed in the community i'll talk about me first of all is i don't know i was like 10 15 years into my career in congress when i looked around and noticed that most of the people who were working in my office were white you know there was no problem between men and women but and the reason for that most of the time the first job that you're going to get is going to be because you know somebody i mean it does happen that someone just answers a want ad and they get a job but for the most part it's connections that help move you forward i grew up in an entirely white community i came from an entirely white family the people i knew by and large were white the people who i knew knew were by and large white you know i wasn't biased against anybody i just well i was biased in the sense that i wanted to hire people who i knew and i looked at this and i said okay this is a problem now i think a lot of people would say well no it's not a problem do you think you're hiring bad people no i don't think i'm hiring bad people are you not having a rigor you know no i think we're doing a decent job it's still a problem because you're not reaching out to a broader community so what my office did is well let's let's work with some community groups and there's a variety of different you know there's a thing called taber 100 that tries to help african-american business people and i'd worked with them a lot there's the black collective in tacoma there's el centra de laza that works with the hispanic community a variety of different groups and i said when we have a job opening now what i'm going to do is i'm going to reach out to them i'm going to say i got this position who you got and it diversified my my workforce it es and flows for a whole bunch of different reasons i think it's really important that you and i'm going to go ahead and use a left-wing word here it's about the only one that i like you have to be intentional and i believe in that you know if you're trying to get something done it doesn't happen by accident so you have to affirmatively reach out in that way and i think we need to have those types of programs and a lot of times people yeah well your i i would say just on technical grounds your argument is is correct in relationship to confidence because the case you're laying out essenti is that because of the ethnocentric structure of your connection network there were potentially qualified candidates that you are unlikely to come into contact with and so by diversifying your outreach in relationship to candidate selection you are able to in principle find more qualified people because it's a broader pool and with a subsidiary with the subsidiary benefit of potentially providing a workforce that was more representative of the community but it seems to me that all of that can be accomplished by the mere mere observation that a broader and more differentiated candidate pool all things considered is technically preferable rather than concentrating particularly on on equity issues and equity this is another thing that i've talked to democrats across the country about and most particularly in washington equity is a word that really disturbs me because equity fundamentally means equality of outcome and equality of outcome is a very bad idea because there's no difference between inequality of outcome and ownership like if you own something that means that you have an unequal access to it in relationship to someone else and there's no way of eradicating inequality without eradicating ownership per se and the notion that we can calculate the fairness of our society by it dividing people subdividing people into their group identities and checking every single enterprise to make sure that proportionality exists which would be impossible in any case definitely puts the cart before the horse and and it and i also see in the term equity and of course christopher rufo was concentrated on this too that's the place that i see the most radical form of quasi marxist idation invading the the the democratic discussion so that's concern and so i i both agree with you and disagree with you on this point i think if you if you well the the way i disagree with you is equity equality they mean a lot of different things okay back to my whenever well ask ask me are you a socialist i don't what do you mean okay you know equity and equality are the same kind of the same way they can mean a lot of different things if you just say i'm for equity or i'm against equity you haven't added anything to the conversation whatsoever now where it is true is what you said there is a certain segment of the leftwing political world that is defined equity in a very specific way that has sort of got them wrapped up in a lot of confusion because when you get past the point where it's okay you can certainly focus i mean okay i'm to get myself in trouble here but the two most discriminated groups in america broadly speaking are black people and native americans okay you know if you're want to start somewhere in terms of where who america has treated poorly that's a pretty good place to start but it goes beyond that okay well what about you know recent immigrants what yeah how do you salami slice it past a certain point let's say okay you've improved equity you have more people of color in your office but you don't have any asian-americans okay or you could go right down forther okay you've got a bunch of people from india but you don't have many people from southeast i mean you can go down that road to the point where it's impossible to achieve that and i think that has in many instances happened and that is is is a challenge however i don't think equity and equality are well irrelevant for i think equity and equality are things that we need to work towards okay not in the sense that you just described where equity means absolutely everybody regardless of anything has everything the same that's ridiculous okay but if you simply go the equality of outcome route then you're you're you're leaving out a whole bunch of stuff that comes before you get a chance to have that outcome yeah well that's for sure so so we need to think about that and we need to think about in that case historical racism historical discrimination redlining okay whole bunch of different things do factor into what the outcome is today this is very difficult because no simple way to do this there's no formula that you're going to come up with you in fact one of the big things that i frequently say problem we have in the world if you are after perfect justice then you are going to be any permanent state of war i have this vivid image in my mind of mosovich back in 1988 when you know on what i think was the 600th anniversary of the battle of koso where long story short the the serbs got their asses kicked by somebody and they've been bitter about it ever since and they were going to they were going to write that wrong 600 years later and a number of people got slaughtered over the course th you because of that fight all right if you're constantly focused on everything has to be equitable then you're in a bad place if on the other hand just sort of shrug and go well you know not anything we need to worry about you're also going to be in trouble and i just think that the human mind is in fact capable of striking that balance without having to choose one side or the other okay we can work and say okay here's a group of people that don't seem to be achieving is it the case that they're somehow just inferior no okay so let's think creatively how can we be more inclusive how can we help them get to a better outcome knowing that it's never going to be perfectly equal it seems to me certainly in american politics i don't know anything about canadian politics so i will not speak to that that we've just set up this false choice you know either you have to be a full-on equity identity politics farle person or you have to be on the right and not care about it at all you know and you know that that dynamic is something that i'm trying to fight is to get to people say no we we can find a more reasonable place in between here it doesn't have to be this death match between two extreme ideologies yeah well you you make a constant case in your conversation with me today for differentiation and diagnosis i mean one of the problems is is that it's easy for us for everyone to abstract a problem way too far up the abstraction hierarchy and to talk about such things for example as health care when in fact there's no such thing as healthc care there's 10,000 different variants of caring for people each of which is a complex problem on its own and you can understand why people would rather have a one- siiz fits-all solution because yeah well if you could have that it would be wonderful and it certainly decreases the cognitive comp lexity but it is necessary and challenging to differentiate i wanted to turn to something can i question before we move off because i'm interested in your cognitive take on this because you know my my my shand to all of this you know it's a quote that i i quote in my book i always misquote it because i prefer it this way but sue grafton who was a mystery writer she wrote the a toz the kinsey mahol mysteries she want wonder of her book she said thinking's hard work that's why most people people don't do it you know i'm sort of torn between that and also a passionate belief that if we engage and take on difficult problems we get more joy out of it okay that that that we don't have to accept the fact well let's dumb everything down because nobody wants to work hard i just don't i don't i don't really believe that and actually there's a professor at yale university i think it's dr santos who teaches a class on happiness it's it's the most highly subscribed class apparently in the history of of yale and her big point is what makes us happy is to be productive but our basic instinct is to not be productive so we have we have to work work through that and just from a you know someone like yourself who you know has much more medical background than i do you why can't we get the human brain to to embrace that a little bit more well take on to see complexity as is a good thing not a bad thing that's what i'm trying to say well you you po well you you you put your finger on a fundamental problem the problem of complexity the problem of complexity is essentially that there's there's far more entropy in the cosmos in the world than there is organizational capacity in the psyche right because things overwhelm us and that's actually a technical problem because if you're exposed involuntarily to a situation that's complex you will manifest a stress response and that's accompanied by an increase for example in the production of cortisol and what that does is start to have you burn up resources that you could be saving for future use now and if if you're chronically stressed you will age there's very little difference between those two things and so if you're exposed to too much complexity especially involuntarily it will it will take you out physiologically psychophysiologically and so people are very motivated to avoid it then well let me add one more let me add one more detail to that because while it's the rest of the answer to your question so then you might ask yourself well how do you calibrate the optimal amount of exposure to complexity and the answer to that technically seems to be by moving towards something approximating the spirit of voluntary play so now you and i like we have agreements and disagreements in the way that we map the world and what we're doing and i think we've done this successfully so far in this conversation is to push each other in an optimized manner that enables something approximating the spirit of cooperative and competitive play to emerge right and you can tell that's happening because to the degree that we're successful at it we're deeply grossed in the conversation and we're developing as a consequence of doing that and so i believe and that the instinct of meaning and it manifests itself for example in play the instinct of meaning is exactly the instinct that tells you when you're optimizing your confrontation with complexity yeah here's the interesting thing about that to me going back to my my psychological problems and my anxiety and what psychotherapy ultimately did for me i believe that you can train the brain to better deal with complexity something somebody said to me and i mentioned this in my book early on was that it's not the amount of stress in your life it's how you process it now at the time she told me that i was in the early stages of my second bout with crippling anxiety and i completely rejected what she said my whole life had been a combination between on the one hand i was incredibly ambitious i wanted a lot out of my life so i had to push myself to get there and i understood that but even as i i was doing that i sort of thought of it as i've got i've got a tank here all right and i'm going to use it up and then i'm done okay and then i got to retreat and i got and so in my early battles to deal with anxiety i was focused on okay what can i sort of declutter my life right how can i do how can i change things so i don't have as much stress but the central insight she gave me that insight it took me several years and three and a half years with the psychotherapy to understand it is she's right it is not amount of complexity in your life it is how you process it and that's the basics to my mind of simple meditation i say simple meditation because complex meditation is something i've never been able to do meditation is not about eliminating every thought in your head okay i thought that for the longest time it's a very it's a very difficult thing to do and it will drive you crazy you know i'm meditating i medit oh my gosh i had a thought i failed not the way to do it the point is a whole lot of stuff's going to come at you every single day it's coming at you all right right thoughts feeling sounds you have to teach yourself to be able to from time to time just sort of let it bounce off okay notice it and move on so you know we could walk down a road here i know you want to go in a different direction but that's what i find most interesting about the brain is i think you can teach it it's not just okay here's here's my complexity jar once it hits here i'm out okay i think you can train your brain to better process complexity and in that sense i think basic mental health has a lot to do with some of our broader societal problems well you're you made a case there that you could imagine that you could protect yourself against being swamped by entropy you could protect yourself against complexity by defensively armoring yourself for example and by walling yourself off from complex problems that idea goes along with the kind of zero sum mentality that you also des described which is well i have a limited amount of resource and when that's exhausted i'm done and so i better be careful now we know that's not true for example and and i think this is best illustrated when you think about people playing a game is that if you are playing one-on-one basketball with someone you're going to want to find somebody who's about as good as you are or slightly better and the reason for that is because you might want to win but actually what you want to do is get better at playing basketball and the same is true of the proper attitude towards complexity like people often wall themselves off and defend themselves and retreat because they're afraid they'll be overwhelmed but you can teach people and you do this through graduated exposure and incremental improvement you can teach people to stay on the edge an edge they define right an edge of competence and in consequ quence what happens is that their capacity to deal with complexity continues to expand and that's really a process of optimized maturation and what's fun about that i love this being a clinician is that there's nothing more engrossing and entertaining than helping someone negotiate to a point where they can discover that it's the edge between chaos and order by the way the developmental edge it's the zone of proximal development to help people discover that and learn to stay there there isn't anything more rewarding than that and there isn't anything that expands people's competence and social competence more than having that occur this is also part of the problem with such things as trigger warnings and and the protection of students say in the university environment because you don't want protection and safety you want optimized challenge because that increases your competence yeah no i think that that makes a great deal of sense so but you were going somewhere else before i took us in this direction why do you think you were res resistant to that or why do you think that hadn't occurred to you because you you intimated that much when you were dealing with the an anxiety problems that you had where do you think the inculcation of that idea that you had in some ways limited zero sum resources where do you think that came from that assumption and how did you successfully challenge it well i i i literally think that the reason i had that outlook is because the other thing hadn't occurred to me okay you know and so and that's why again why enjoy having these conversations it frequently happens in my life that i will have a very strong opinion about something maybe i've thought about it for years decades and and then someone will say something that it's like huh had thought of that before let s of play that out so i think was a big part of it and i just think it was just it was just sort of my mentality because stress and anxiety that was that was who i was okay you know i i was not walking into a stressful event you know it was just it was part of me i would think about it worry about it and so and i outlined this in the book i i the strategy that i came up with actually there's one other reason why i felt this the strategy i came up with i describe as think think think worry worry worry work work work that basically that was my approach if i wanted to get somewhere and there was a problem i had to go after it okay and i was supposed to be stressed i was supposed to be worried if i wasn't stressed if i wasn't worried then i wasn't doing something important all right and that became mentality and i think the biggest reason why i struggled to let go of that is aside from the mental problems i was spectacularly successful okay i won a number of campaigns that were a number let's be fair i won three campaigns that were extraordinarily difficult but changed my life all right and i was able to succeed you know i have a happy marriage i have good you know my good relationship with my children kn on would as we say that everything you know everything's good and i thought this is how i succeed and if you're going to come along and tell me that i got to do something different i really felt like you know that would make it less likely that i would be successful that you know yes okay maybe i wouldn't be crazy but i also sorry that's a pejorative term but maybe i would wouldn't have the anxiety problem but i'd also wouldn't and i was so wrong about that so so it sounds to me like you had you had fallen into the presumption and correct me if i've got this wrong that there was no difference between your laudable moral striving and being stressed that stress was a marker that right right and so and so you had presumed that in order to actively cope and be successful there was no respite from being overwhelmed by complexity and by and being stressed and what the therapist did for you at least in part was to lay out for you the fact that you could progress forward effectively without having to bear the burden of constant crippling stress is that and that's the yeah that's biggest message i want to try to get to people because i used to say it's the stuff i don't worry about that gets me in trouble and i also used to like to say i believe in the power of negative thinking which was you know if i worry oh my gosh what can go wrong what can go wrong you know and you know and so that's what i believed i had to do when in fact there you can be every little bit as intense every little bit as focused on getting a task done without having to feel physically stressed out so what did you do specifically to start making changes in that direction we talked a little bit about the utility of incremental progress and this is obviously tied in to our broader discussion about facing ideas say on the political and conceptual front that challenge you there there's a very tight relationship between these things but i'm very curious you you you report in your book that you had an anxious temperament we somewhat shy and introverted from a very early age so it's a deeply it's a it's deeply ingrained inside you that that propensity for negative emotional response how concretely how was it that you changed the way you were approaching things that actually made a difference and why do you think those changes were what made the difference yeah it was ultimately a couple of things three and a half years worth of psychotherapy which i'll get into in a minute second it was getting off of the various forms of medication that i had been on but most importantly the the problem that i had is sort of a baseline and this is incredibly important for psychology and psychiatry there are three basic basic steps in my view to getting to good mental health number one was the one that i completely missed and that is to have an inherent sense of your own selfworth this is what i didn't grasp i thought my self-worth was was a measurable thing on a day in and day out basis all right and by whatever measurement you want to come by you know was i doing my job well okay was i a good husband was i a good father you know was i being responsible did i make a smart decision here did i do that so every day i was trying to judge okay how am i doing all right when in fact an incredibly important concept in our psychology is it's a buddhist thing for the most part we are all worthy of love we all have self-worth and that self-worth is not dependent upon our deeds and in the three and a half years with the psychotherapy was me arguing with my psychologist on this point because the biggest sticking point for me on this was wait a second you're telling me it doesn't matter what we do okay that you know somebody who's completely irr i'm very responsible person my my wife and i have have this in common she's the eldest of five children and she fits that that oldest child measurement quite quite well we believe in meeting our responsibilities so you're telling me that if i don't meet my responsibilities if i don't follow the rule if i that i'm just as good as if i if i don't of course that's not actually what they're telling you all right you should always you can work to be better at things but it's not an existential threat all right just because you make a mistake could do something wrong doesn't mean that your basic self worth as a human being is out the window i didn't understand that okay i was working my whole life every day to prove that i was worthy so having someone walk me through that and explain to me was was the number one biggest thing and then the second biggest thing in psychiatry is to really understand who you are and i love this quote about psychotherapy which i quote in my book which is that the purpose of psychotherapy is not to correct the past it is to help the patient understand his history and to grieve for what he has lost i wanted to correct the past and the very specific past i wanted to correct was my screwed up family okay and there are families that are more screwed up than others and i don't walk through the whole story i was adopted you know and my and it just fell apart by the time i was like 12 or 14 my older brother you know we became he had criminal problems he had drug problems he was out control my parents were stressed out out indoor depressed my father died when i was 19 my mother died you know a few years after that and just felt like this complete epic failure and then after all of that happened my life you know i got elected to the state senate i met my wife everything went fine and i was like okay don't have to worry about that anymore when in fact it was still bugging me okay it was bugging me both in terms of you know well why didn't my family do a better job of handling this and then crucially it was also bugging me from the standpoint of if i'm holding myself out as a leader in the community you know as someone who gets things done and all these other positive things you know about my career the hell did i do about that the whole thing fell apart while i was there okay and i never really resolved that so we talked through that and that helped resolve that that's a big thing now in in well with ptsd and other things you have to be able to resolve issues in your past and some of it is traumatic we're talking real trauma but even if it's not trauma in the classic sense of the word things that have really bugged you bring them out in the open deal with them and that can dramatically reduce anxiety and depression and there's a variety of different therapies now emdr there's a new thing that they're working with in the military in particular and i hope i get the initials right etm which is another way of sort of rewiring your brain through conversation to look at these events in your life in a different way so those are the two big things the biggest problem we have in psychology in america and i i don't want to take us too far down this road if you have political things you want to talk about and happy to answer them is we start with cognitive behavioral therapy and to my mind probably 90% of the time that's a mistake that's what they did with me that's why i cycled through so many psychiatrists and psychologists and cognitive behavioral therapy is important you need to figure out how to better process things coming in and you understand exactly what it is you're worried about or depressed about how to handle it but if you don't deal with those two baseline things first cognitive behavioral therapy is just going to piss you off all right because it's not going to seem like it's working i the analogy i came up with just a couple days ago it's like if you break your leg you can say physical therapy is important and it's going to be important but if you don't set the leg first okay and then tell someone okay start doing these exercises it's not going to work very well so i just don't think we have that order correct so so that you were you were suffering by your own admission from a very fundamental theological dilemma i would say and so you could imagine that there are ways of justifying your miserable existence so to speak and one would be justification through works and that is the proclivity that conscientious people have conscientious and responsible people which is that they derive their sense of worth worth from an evaluation of their continued contributions and as you said there's some real utility in that because you should be responsible and generous productivity is laudable and it's reasonable to observe how you're doing in that regard and to evaluate yourself to some degree on that basis but if that's all the is then you are missing another important theological presupposition and i i'm speaking about those as fundamental presuppositions akin to setting your leg before you start worrying about physiotherapy is that you know there is an axiomatic presupposition that underlies the ethical corpus of the west that every person is made in the image of god and has intrinsic worth and that means that you know if you think about those as balanced you could say well of course i should strive forward and make the appropriate sacrifices and be useful to myself and my community but underneath that this is probably what's provided by the way in the final analysis by the proper kind of maternal love you know that that kind of all-encompassing love is that regardless of your flaws you have you have an intrinsic worth that's inviable that you can always return to as a as a source of what replenishment and self-confidence right that sense of intrinsic worth and you know if you don't the interesting thing too is that if you don't apply that to yourself it's also very difficult to apply it to other people so yeah yeah and so that and that's where i cross cross over into public policy okay that's you know and i i make that point at the end of my book exactly is you know what really helps cur you as well as everyone else yes you have selfworth but think about that that means everybody else does too even the person who's from the different political party if you're pro-choice even the person who's pro- life okay whatever the issue and if you believe that it makes our society get together better and frankly that's you know you ask why i wanted to do this interview certainly i find you very smart i i love intellectual conversation just in general you have a good following it gives me an opportunity to get an audience but i think one thing in particular about what you teach that i think is so important that really has come to me as i've looked at the broader mental health issues is the idea of getting better and that that needs to be the f focus cuz a lot of people talk about the stigma around mental health and i've had a lot of interviews about that and i think that is important we're getting better on that we're more willing to talk about it but there still is a a stigma that will stop people from wanting to seek treatment but the other piece of it is if all we're doing is talking about mental health problems if all we're doing in essence is wallowing in it and saying okay now i have something identifiable for why i'm so hopelessly screwed up or just sort of boeris looking at it what really gives me going as you can see is what i learned throughout this process about how you can get better and i think your basic point i watched a video you i can't more was in titled anyway it's the basic point of every day try to make yourself better and that will make you happier and you will get better and and there's a bunch of different ways to balance it but i worry to that in america a lot of it on mental health has become like i said this is why i messed up okay so no this is a diagnosis so that you can get better and i think a lot of the messages you talk about start small okay you know you're not going to solve the world's problems don't compare yourself to other people compare yourself to yourself and what you want to be and what you want to do but work to get better i think is such a crucial message for the mental health of of society well it's especially one of the things that was really really gratifying about working as a psychotherapist was watching what happened when people did begin to take incremental steps forward and there it was often an exercise in like a painful humility you know because if you're weak in an area when you start moving forward you have to take very small steps and it's a humbling experience often to grapple with the fact that the only thing you're capable of doing is that tiny step forward you know something absurd if i counseled my clients for example to work on maybe i'd have a client who was 30 and still lived in his parents in the bedroom he was in in high school and it was a complete bloody mess because he'd never done anything to keep it orderly in his whole life and he's 30 you know and so there's an element of that that's pretty damn pathetic and we'd have to struggle to find the level at which he could grapple with that problem and so the injunction go clean up your room and come back next week to the therapy session and tell me it's done was completely useless because it might have been that he was only capable because that because there was a big problem of lurking dependency there of cleaning up half his sock drawer and to realize that that's the best you can do is pretty damn humbling but the upside and this is what's so cool this is part of the matthew principle right to those who have everything more will be given is that once you start improving that improvement accelerates geometrically not linearly and so even if you have to start with virtually nothing that doesn't mean that you won't accelerate extraordinarily rapidly and that's so fun it's so fun to help people do that because they take these tiny steps forward in humility let's say and then very rapidly they're they're the length of step they can take it lengthens remarkably well and that and that's you know going back to our equity and equality conversation that's something that i've always passionately believed in and this is one of the down sides of sort of the american meritocracy thing okay and and we're wrestling this with this now is you know we've gotten rid of affirmative action or any sort of race based stuff in colleges based on the supreme court and now everyone's looking at well what about legacies you know what about the the guy who plays badminton and now he gets in is i do think in america you can go too far in this whole meritocracy thing you know if you have stuff that means you're better okay well maybe and maybe not number one number two and i believe this everybody is capable of of doing better okay and throughout my life you know i didn't go to a ivy leak school i grew up in a very blue collar neighborhood those you know and i see my friends from that neighborhood who have gone on done some pretty cool things with their life all right and i think too often in america we're like we're trying constantly trying to call the top okay you know it's like oh this guy's the best you know he got 1,600 in the sat and it's like and i think one of the things that motivated me i i had a 32 in high school i had an 11 an 1190 on the sat as a matter of fact figuring out how to beat those people who got a600 in the sat brings me an enormous amount of joy okay and i've done it throughout my life you know and so when i see other people people oh gosh you know he's not that smart you he's going didn't go to college whatever it's like no if you really see people all right and work with them what they're capable of is incredible and so i get frustrated with both the right and the left on this i get frustrated with the left that sees people like this and says oh you know you you have to be really care with this person they can't really do anything you you can't put any pressure on them you know i just that's not my experience and then on the right when it's like well that person doesn't deserve to be here you know they haven't done this they haven't done that they haven't gotten the scores let's just give a little bit here and we'll see what what folks are capable of and that's what i really really want to deliver and it's been my experience in life is you know help people it's funny you know that in some ways it was your proclivity to engage in that kind of let's say right-wing meritocratic thinking that was actually contributing in no small part to the acceleration of your anxiety it's so interesting to see that given that you know you thought that before but yes well well yeah well and i mean that is the problem with a with with a strict mer with a with with a a strict and narrowly defined meritocracy is that right it privileges being over becoming that's a good way of thinking about it and you know and what you were talking about the 1190 sat you know one of the things there's no doubt that intellectual prowess as measured by such tests is a deadly accurate predictor of long-term success it leaves about 34 of the success domain unaccounted for by the way but it is also the case that vision and hard work can go an awful long way to redressing that difference in say initial starting point and so and that is something i do want to give you what i happen to be reading a malcolm gladwell article and this is probably was this his book of essays so was probably 20 years ago when he wrote it but and this gets back into some of the racial issues that we face he was attempting to explain the difference between panicking and choking which is not terribly relevant here but one of the things he analyzed was stanford did a study i forget when it was that they did this where they gave the same test with two different explanations the first time they gave the test they said this is an iq test this is to measure you know how smart you are basically how capable and when they gave that test they gave it to black students and white students the white students performed significantly better than the black students but when they gave the same test and said this is a survey it isn't measuring anything we just want to know how you respond to these questions they performed at the exact same level and the reason they surmised was because of a lot of the stigma in society the reputation oh you know black students can't do well on on standardized tests that the black students felt a lot more pressure okay they're like oh my gosh this is something i'm not good at so you know i better figure this out i better and they and i i always get the panicking choking thing mixed up there one of them is thinking too much the other one one is just ah choking choking is when you think too much panicking is when you stop thinking altogether and they kind of kind of choked because they okay i got to think through this i got to be you know and that's just not the right way to take that test and it shows both that you know this notion of inherent you know capability one way or the other is ridiculous number one and number two we have a long way to go to overcome some of the racial stereotypes in both directions to move towards a more equitable society if you'll forgive me using that word well your your criticisms earlier about the conservative side of things i think are appro there too is that one of the ways that we overcome the [music] built-in inadequacies of the current system is to provide people with a vision and one of the things that the left has done much more effectively than the right is to provide a vision you know of equality equity and harmony and and movement towards something approximating a utopia whereas the right's vision is generally something like less of less interference is better and there's some truth in that but it's not a vision right it's it's the it's the absence of a set of constraints and it would be lovely to see the left and the right engage in the kind of dialogue that would produce a compelling vision that both sides could could engage in i want to close because we have to close this side of the conversation fairly soon i i want to close with one more political question if you don't mind sure it's been very interesting to me to see the response by the two front runners in the 2024 presidential campaign respond to the the possibility of engaging in debate i mean biden has as as far as i know has indicated quite clearly that he's not going to participate in any primary debates and now we have trump making exactly the same statement on the republican side and to me first of all this i think this is very bad i think it's cowardly on both their parts and i think it's also a huge mistake because leaders should model that right if you're a leader if you're a genuine leader and you can listen and you can negotiate you should model that for your people on the stage and so i'm i'm i think it's a missed opportunity and and i think it's a form of instrumental behavior as well because both biden and trump are assuming well we're the front runners and we have we have we have nothing except loss on the debate side and you know that's that's not a position that's associated in my estimation with confidence and authority because the proper attitude should be well number one the people deserve to hear us put our ideas forward and to have them challenged period and number two well if you're the guy well why not take the opportunity to indicate that and so what do you think about the fact that you know the two front runners have dropped out of the debate out of the they they've forgone the debate opportunities well i have multiple thoughts about that as i alluded to earlier it's always been my philosophy let's engage and i'm never afraid of engaging anywhere anytime asking what whatever question comes comes at me i mean was i was doing a forum at the brooking institute talking about i think it was ukraine specifically and the code pink people storm the stage and tried to shut it down this woman's yelling and asking a question and i and i just said i said you know actually i think that's a really good question i'd love to have the conversation which of course she did not want to have but so i think in general engage all right as much as you possibly can and number two from a political standpoint i'm a huge sports fan so i tend to use sports analogies we've gotten almost through this entire interview without me using one but you know if you're ahead and you're playing not to lose you're losing that's always been my philosophy you know you got to play to win every second every play it's funny i think i think my wife could hear this but it's the way i watch baseball and she's like my gosh you would think this was the world series it's one inning and one game and i'm like you know and i'm focused on it all right because i just think you know you got to try to be doing your best at every second you get ahead and think you're going to hold on and i can't exactly explain it but i've played enough you know games in my life to know psychologically once you get to that place where you're trying to hold on instead of trying to win you're vulnerable so you don't or trying to improve or trying to improve right because well the thing is you think about what's happened psychologically here's what's happened is you've shifted into a defensive stance exactly and that means all challenge will now be experienced as stress now if you reverse that and say of course i'll take the opportunity to debate then you're taking on the challenge voluntarily and that that produces an entirely different set of not only psychophysiological responses because it's a challenge rather than a threat but it also broadcasts a kind of confidence in your own ability to progress that's part and parcel of being willing to engage it's a much better measure it's a much better indication of leadership concretely right merely the willingness to get into the frey so we did today yes exactly so i agree with you mistake the other part of it though that that i spent a lot of time wondering about try to be careful about this but you know speaking is is something that i'm good at i'm it's you know my whole life i've been able to articulate ideas in in a comfortable and effective way and i think that is an important part of leadership but then you know and this is my my egalitarian side i guess what what makes me more on the left side of the political spectrum i'm like well is it really the case if you just happen to not be that articulate that you're necessarily a worse leader okay is that the case you know maybe you've got the ideas maybe you're good in a crisis you work with a team and do all that but standing up and giving a speech not the thing you're best at and i've certainly worked with colleagues by the way who in a million years i wouldn't want to be sitting on the floor listening to them give a speech but i know there's someone that i can count on i know that they they're going to do the work they know the issues they'll work together so is a public debate really the one way to figure out who's going to best lead a community i think we fall a little bit in love with that idea i always think of a quote that dennis miller had about michael dukakis about how michael dukakis never really had a chance because he lacked that superficial charisma that we seem to look for in our leaders you know so i'm mindful of that as well i i i think people place too much emphasis on the debates so all that said i still think they should do it i guess the final criticism i have is the debate debate formats are difficult this conversation between you and i is dependent upon both of us being reasonable with the other person you know yeah i'm not going to talk over you you're not going to talk if you have a question you'll interject it but you do it in a polite and respectful way you know you look at the debate that trump and biden had the first one when yeah i mean is that really useful when there's no construct and then they said well you got one minute one minute and then you're done well okay how how informative is that all right when when i i love chairing the arm services committee because i tried to run it in a fair way all right i would include people in the conversation and not everyone got the same amount of time all the time because that's that's not how you have a good conversation you need a moderator who's honestly trying to make sure that we get the issues out in a fair and balanced way and i guess i would is that possible in today's era is it possible to do that in a way that the two candidates aren't just going to be shouting over each other in an unproductive way i don't know well you know i'm really i'm really hopeful with regards to political communication on the long form with regards to long-term format podcasts because they give people the opportunity to speak in an unscripted manner relatively deeply spontaneously right which which is a good way of detecting both ability and the proclivity to to deceive and to deepen the political conversation and you know we had these terrible restrictions on broadcast accessibility that were part and parcel of the legacy tv environment but that's all gone and so now there's no reason even for debates you know there's there would be no reason whatsoever not to hold a forum of this sort with a variety of different candidates and actually have a conversation because you don't have to the thing about debates is they're very tim limited instruct ured and you can see why that's necessary when television bandwidth is hyper expensive but in some ways there's no reason for that anymore anyways we should stop i'm going to for everybody watching and listening i'm going to continue talking to congressman smith on the daily wire side and we'll do what i usually do there and delve into issues that are more autobiographical i think that's particularly gerain in this case because of congressman smith's new book lost and broken my journey back from chronic pain and crippling anxiety we're going to talk about that in some more detail on the daily we plus side thank you very much for agreeing to talk to me hopefully that'll set a trend on the democrat side i guess we'll find out or at least somewhat of a trend because it would be lovely to be able to have discussions that reach across the aisle and and to attempt to reverse some of this terrible proclivity towards polarization that really threatens the integrity i would say of the west the integrity of the us the integrity of west more broadly so it's much appreciated for everyone watching and listening please join us on the daily weare plus side for an additional half an hour and thank you to the dailywire plus for making this conversation possible pleasure to talk to you sir likewise i appreciate the chance thank [music] you
