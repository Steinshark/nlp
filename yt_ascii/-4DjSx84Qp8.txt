ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the chess world cup 2023 it is august 24th the tournament ends today we have a gold medal match we have a bronze medal match four players are going to play a tie break against each other to crown a champion a tie break consists of two 25 minute games if those are tied one to one it goes to 10minute games it goes to 5 minute games 3 minute games all the way down to what we call an armageddon chess which we don't even have to get into because an armageddon didn't happen in this video which is not much of a spoiler because it was still a ridiculous day of tie breaks that's all i have to share well except for the fact that it's magnus carlson competing for his first ever world cup title and prand ramish babu of india the youngest ever finalist the man who has knocked out the number three and number two ranked players in the world and the man who probably has one of the best records against magnus in online events which is 17 wins to 19 losses this man scores nearly 50% of the time against magnus and rapid and it is going to be a sensational time my friends buckle up you're going to see four chess games in this video first i'm going to serve you the appetizer get your get your appetite going and then we will cover the grand finale this is it it has been a month of chess oh you like my shirt oh thank you i didn't ask nas of aeran versus fabiano carana kick us off these two have punched each other in the face repeatedly and they have one a game each n plays the move pawn to d4 to open up the world cup rapid tie breaks fabiano plays knight to f6 and we have bishop to g5 a trompowsky i love this this is one of my favorite openings i mean basically black's main lines here are d5 and knight to e4 or c5 to bring out the queen but fabby plays a move that i have not seen much of which is the move knight to c6 and i don't know what on earth his idea was after let's say knight to f3 i don't know if he was going to play d5 like the knight is really not supposed to stand in front of the c pawn but after e3 he can now play e5 which is not really a move that black gets to make because white took control of the e5 square on the very first move and after the knight comes to f3 you do a really nice job controlling it but a little bit of you know a little bit of uncertain play here and now e5 and fab's counterattacking in the center of the board now after d5 is played by abasov you would think that fabby moves the knight this way to maintain a defense with the queen no he brings the knight back in front of the bishop and his own queen inviting this capture inviting this capture and basically symbolizing he is never going to castle this way he's never going to castle this way cuz his king is going to be wide open but he does does have the knight still to move and after the knight moves the bishops are going to get out and he's going to have the bishop pair very interesting and provocative opening now n plays c4 two pawns on light squares that means the dark squared bishop is going to be very happy now we have pawn to d6 knight c3 and fabbi takes some space with a move f5 fab's kind of improvising here trying to build upon the structure that he has created the knight is probably going to go to g6 now anticipating that the knight is going to go to g6 abasa plays h four which is a very aggressive move now fabby could play h5 and and but but after bishop e2 he's probably just going to lose the pawn so he plays here and now the knight has been stopped from going to g6 and i told you a long time ago fabby still has to make preparations to what so fabby gives up the damage to the structure and the opening of the g file and then in a cool common collected fashion castles directly into that what what did he really how's that possible how's he going to how's he going to survive look at this look at this look at this look at this look at i mean i don't all right like let's not forget in the first classical game fabiano got steamrolled with a kingside attack oh my neck is stiff it's early in the morning here explain something to me just real quick so every day the world cup started at 7:00 a.m. eastern time which is 300 p.m. local time in aeran for an entire month the last day of the tournament they started at 2: p.m. local time an hour earlier can somebody please explain to me why did they do that i only learned about this yesterday i learned about this i i don't know it's very early bishop d7 and abasov obviously has to build into this kingside attack he plays knight to g3 but all of a sudden my friends fabiano carana plays b5 and fabby has had enough bobby was like i can't believe i even lost the game to this i can't even believe i let this man get a game off of me where is this man going to castle his king we've been talking about black can't castle white is creating some sort of attack and he might get some piece of how is black going to castle look at this i mean fabby has got an avalanche coming on the queen side and then he stops white from advancing at all with his h pawn and white castles despite advancing over here here which is basically a clear indication he's not going to be attacking anybody anytime soon fabby plays rook c5 cuz he's looking to take over the c f put pressure on the d pawn play pawn to b4 f3 looking to fight back but potentially weakening the dark squares every time a pawn moves you do have to think about what it's targeting but what it used to protect fabby plays bishop e5 attacking the knight on g3 now he takes what's the idea the idea is to slide into the dms here comes the queen looking to rotate over monster pressure on the dark squares all a result of the slightly careless play by white a5 now suddenly the bishop is strapped it's time to sound the alarms in the white position rook f2 and now fabiano what a what what a what a move here rook takes c3 you know why he played that move because after takes there's queen h4 and you can't defend the knight you see white's ideal was queen h4 whoops was queen h4 knight e2 bobby plays rook takes c3 now queen h4 is fatal so ni plays this but getting made it he gives up everything but black's position is way too powerful bishop h3 and abos of resigns abos of kind of like you guys he plays a 25-minute game and then he you know he he plays much faster but unfortunately he is unsuccessful so my friends that is a massive result fabiano carana just won with black which means in the next game he has to not lose with white and he is the clear number three in the world cup which is wild that's really wild stuff he plays e4 plays directly into nadab bas of sicilian defense which n played against magnus and he's also played against fabiano and yesterday n played e6 this time he plays knight c6 so he's playing yet another sicilian knight c6 which he did against magnus bishop b5 and he continues playing in the exact same way that he did against magnus with the move pawn to e6 the idea of pawn to e6 is to play knight e7 and to be able to take the knight here with the knight and magnus against him did this and then it was like bc6 and magnus played a really crazy way with a very early rook to g1 was one of the strangest games that i have ever seen but instead of that fabby castles so fabby actually welcomes the knight to e7 and now is basically like well i'm not going to take because he's not going to take any damage to his pawn structure and he's going to go here so i have to play this move and the idea of that move is after a6 you actually play bishop f1 and this might look really dumb to you cuz like why are you returning the bishop to the home square the bishop did its job the bishop forced black into playing it into a certain way and now white is going to try to play for the center because black is actually stuck a little bit with his development it's going to take him several moves to untangle take take pawn to d4 let's remember something fabiano has to not lose this game that's it that's the objective plays bishop e3 knight to g4 attacks but now the bishop moves now it's very difficult for black because if you play bishop to e7 you best believe i'm going to take it then i'm going to take and you're just not going to have a lot look take and i can also go d5 taking advantage of my rook in the e file so position is very difficult for black who now has to play in a very provocative way fabby plays here pushes the knight back now boom oh my goodness h5 square looking juicy but fabby is down a pawn n did win a pawn knight d2 fabby looking to win it back knight b3 maybe knight e4 attacking the king b5 but now fabby has a target a4 and this move the this move you could see the evar jump by a whole point because after a4 it's really tough to defend yourself if you play something like rook b8 i can take that's a mouse slip you wouldn't have that happen over the board take take knight b3 white has an active rook it's very difficult for black to defend this it looks like you're defending it but it's an illusion because the pawn's not actually defending it so knight b3 n plays bishop to b4 and it looks like in this position fab's going to have to move his rook which is going to give n a moment of castle but unfortunately it is an illusion as well what is worth more than a pawn a rook which is why n played that move what's worth more than a rook a queen or a king boom how does this attack the king boom and then boom and boom and boom and boom knight d4 is the enanu uppercut on alistar overum and black's king is now in dire straits and and fabby calculates really cleanly rook slides out of the way no way to defend yourself because even though there's this there's pawn to c3 and fabiano carana fans could be heard cheering around the world as he swarmed in with his rook and his queen the black king has overstay his welcome he has unpaid rent chop chop knight c5 we are infiltrating and by the way fabiano could have taken this at any point with czech and yet it wasn't even a good move so he takes this instead knight d7 and now when he's got all the pieces in he plays this queen g7 is on the way queen f6 is on the way and in this position nadab bas have resigned because checkmate is coming 20 you can't get any cleaner than that beautiful fabiana carana plays what we call the swiss gambit he played four games against the bosov he lost the first game i thought i i was like oh my goodness could it be over but he is clutch wins the second rapid game wins three wins the second classical game and then wins games one and two in the rapid and that's it he is your bronze medalist of the world cup 2023 one of these men is about to lose and one of these men is about to win let me set the stage once again magnus carlson likely to go down as the greatest of all time personally i think you know he's got a few more years in the career so he's he's he's going to get there kind of like a lebron versus jordan situation some people would disagree with that it but you know it's kind of the same debate modern generation previous generation there's you know he's won the title five times he's this is the only event he hasn't won he's rappid and blitz world champion multiple time triple crown winner paganda is' he has beaten magnus probably more than any anybody else in the last year except maybe hikaru cuz they play a lot of blitz he's now the youngest ever finalist and he's beaten the number three and number two ranked players in the event the entire country of india is watching this might actually be more impressive than the moonlanding if he manages to pull this off i don't know what are you what are you cheering for the moon landing in india or or or prague taking down magnus prague plays e4 there has to be a winner yesterday magnus made a quick draw with white food poison now he can pull off the michael jordan flu game to win the only major chess event that he has not won knight f3 knight c6 knight to f6 obviously we don't get a fried liver d3 bishop c5 prag takes a little bit of queenside space a5 bishop b3 magnus said a long time ago that his strategy when he plays these events is good luck beating me with black like when i play black good luck you know because as we say with white you're supposed to push the issue you're supposed to put the pressure so take take clearly this is prague's preparation 2549 on the clock magnus castles f uh and prg plays knight bd2 prg not even thinking at all knight to e7 bringing the knight out of the center of the board rotating it this way also preparing pawn to c6 and pawn to d5 for the future knight to h4 meeting the n there when it arrives also opening up the file utilizing the space this is weak but you know it'll be defended c6 and p plays queen e1 with the idea of playing queen to g3 waiting for d5 he's not really worried about this move because he can always slide back he can also take taking would help black a little bit but he slides back point is that if you take then i'm going to play knight e4 and if you play knight e4 actually this structure is really good for white you get all of this all this real estate that's under fire that's under fire that's under fire that's under fire so queen d6 very tense position queen g3 magnus attacks the queen down five minutes on the clock back against the wall prague slides forward now they could repeat moves here according to the computer but magnus plays g6 and this is prague's biggest advantage of the game apparently to prove it he needs to go back attack the pawn force f6 slide back again backwards backwards and then attack in the center and basically the computer is saying this structure by black is like you know you're you're it's a really really bad siding job on a house meaning you know the construction was just off all right the water's still going to get into the house it's going to cause a flood it's going to be really bad but prague is human and right now the position position is is kind of falling forward all of the momentum is carrying the position forward so he plays knight f5 magnus gets rid of the knight and then all he's got to do is to seal the dark squares so he plays the very cool common collected king to g7 and the idea of this move is that he is going to be able to play f6 or h6 in the future f6 no longer works because if knight takes f6 and prag had that moment there and now prag is like what do i do play king h1 you will notice some big moment in the game because he spends over 6 minutes he's realizing he could probably bring his rook he could probably break like this looks like e4 is the most natural move but after f6 you you just don't have anything which is why knight f5 was not the best move so knight f5 king g7 prog plays king h1 and unfortunately queen f6 and now this is that moment this is the moment in the matchup where you go are we going to an end game are we going to an end game with enough pawns and enough pieces and enough questions and enough imbalance that the best endgame player of all time has enough material to work with that is all he needs it does not matter that the evaluation is 0.1 that's that that's insignificant point 2 that's insignificant what is significant is human nature 10 minutes remaining on on the clock to play an end game with seven pawns each pie on the board and rooks against the best end game player of all time the dynamic here is that white could potentially create an outside pass pawn white has an open f file black has an f pawn white has an h pawn everything else is the same you build a brick wall of light squares against the light squared bishop prague tries to open up that brick wall magnus takes takes puts his rook on the center line hits the tonight not the best move rook f2 prague defending himself rook d4 maged it down to 551 on the clock prague 744 rook f1 counterattacking on that monster f file knight g8 look at this oh my goodness the best endgame player of all time retreating backwards c3 kicks out the rook rook d7 now it's an avalanche rook e to defending himself so he can move the knight rookie seven oh this is so ugly so ugly now prague is probably the one going to call the shots he hits both pawns he has threats to infiltrate he's going to get to the f7 pawn magnus desperately trying to defend himself the rook super passive on the back rank now pro plays g4 trying to play g5 and locking in the knight on the g8 square magnus has to play f6 now rook g2 knight h6 and g5 breaking into the position the pawns are split knight e3 knight f5 is an idea knight d6 hitting f7 and f5 is an idea the the bishop is going to come back the rooks are going to pressure the g6 pa knight f7 rook g2 you could double this way you could double this way you could also rotate down to the defile this is ridiculous both of them have three minutes on the clock i mean it literally does not get any closer rook to d2 hits the knight on d7 the rook oo you can't take the knight because of this you can't take this cuz i go here what is he going to do he takes but now the white rook actually cannot touch any square so pro plays b4 u in one of the pawns that he hasn't used take take king f8 king g2 king e7 pawn to a5 restricting the queen side the position is still very very tense but br 40 seconds on the clock magnus 230 rook h8 rook e2 now his rook stares into the b now here comes the knight here comes the knight king to g1 the knight gets into the f4 square rook to d3 now the rook gets in on the third rank magnus looking to pressure this pressure this if possible pressure the queen side if possible knight g5 knight f3 prague is really struggling to break through here with his pawns because none of them can really move and now prague desperate times call for desperate measures sacrifices a pawn to pry away the queens side defenses magnus takes calling the bluff l in poker bishop a4 hits the pawn on c6 but now rook c3 taking advantage of the week and night the knight's got to move knight a5 and with all the pieces stranded over here knight g5 prague is going to have to be really really really careful with the knights are driving toward the king he has to play rook to d1 for some reason to protect the back rank he plays this we have check king f1 and rook a3 the king has been sealed on the back rank the bishop is hanging rook a1 is mate prague takes a pa with check but with time taking down to zero realizes he is completely lost and the only thing he can do is to cover checkmate and give up the bishop and he doesn't do that and he resigns the game magnus carlson just won with the black pieces in the exact situation that i told you that it seemed like it was impossible for brog to win prague was actually the one putting the pressure in this end game this position did not look particularly good but in trying to advance forward and break apart his position prague slightly gave magnus chances slightly it wasn't even significant at all rook g3 rook e6 was the idea played in the game instead of rotating the rook to d2 and getting hit with rook f6 this is where prag spent the majority of his time instead of doing that apparently knight e3 was a bit better to try to put the bishop here it's all obviously equal but now prague has to win with black this is single-handedly the most important chess game of this young man's career career he's got to beat magnus carlson with the black pieces magnus plays e4 prague plays the sicilian defense we just saw abbasov although abasov always plays the sicilian defense prag plays the sicilian what did magnus play against gukesh do you remember what is the best way to tame a sicilian defense player c3 the alipin trying to play d4 put two pawns in the center put the knights behind the pawns only way for black to fight back is to play d5 or knight f6 brock plays knight f6 pawn to e5 knight to d5 knight to f3 at some point white is going to play d4 or bishop c4 or both knight c6 pawn to d4 takes on d4 bishop c4 i told you now the knight's going to move it does the bishop slides back it's too dangerous for black to take white gets a really powerful initiative he plays d6 looking to break apart white center magnus takes takes and and simply castles and the point if you take this is actually a gambit line where white plays knight b5 knight c7 it's very very difficult for black to play this black gets overrun so rather than doing it that way bishop f5 now take take take this is the position magnus 2630 on the clock 90 seconds more than he started with winning this game he's going to go here he's going to develop his pieces prog has to win all he's got going for him here is that white does an isolated pawn so trade a couple of pieces you trade some pieces maybe put some pressure on the pawn e6 knight c3 bishop e7 magnus just developing hits b7 if you take on d4 i take this you can't castle because your bishop is hanging so prague thinking for a bit plays castles and now you can play this with white to play this develop your pieces no magnus carlson goes full viking here true to his norwegian roots and he does things brutally pawn to d5 the idea of pawn to d5 if you take you lose your bishop but it's worse than that the fact that whatever you take with you're going to lose the bishop but i'm i'm just going to smash into your position i will no longer have a weakness and then i'm going to trade whatever i want i going to pillage the black position and take anything i want bishop g6 played by prague and now he's looking to gambit a pawn to create winning chances prag is in a must-win situation but after queen e6 he is just down a clear pawn he is down a pure f pawn five pawns versus four bishop c5 operation trade the pieces bishop to e3 take take bishop b3 magnus plays rook e1 and offers a draw actually i think prague takes the rook and offers a draw and magnus carlson accepts you may ask yourself why did prague offer a draw because magnus carlson ain't losing this position if one person's losing this position it's black because the knight is being dominated the rook is about to go into the seventh rank only white can probably win this game players agree to a draw and with that the world cup is over magnus carlson has just won his first world cup ever in the same year that lonel messi won his first world cup ever magnus wins his first world cup ever prague takes down number three and number two in the world but magnus defeats gukesh and prague from india the next generation of players one of them is probably going to be a world champion in 10 years because at some point magnus will not be playing and but for now but for now magnus ain going anywhere it's the only real event that he hasn't won yet and now he's won it and then he tweeted that he completed chess that's all that's all i have for you magnus carlson world cup champion alexandra gkin a women's world cup champion runner up nul salimov on the women's side prag rabu he qualifies to the candidates so does magnus we'll see if he plays cuz he's not the world champion anymore fabiano carana qualifies to the candidates and we'll see because if magnus doesn't play n basov will play from aeran it's been a fun month of chess we have a book cut out we've had a lot of good memes we've had a lot of good dreams and now it's time to resume our regularly scheduled chess programming get out of here oh and if you're new to chess stick around we're a fun crowd we we do some crazy stuff
