who in their right mind would buy youtuber merch for 250 dollars when you can get it for a fraction of the price that's right we're back with two tables of counterfeit ltt merch everything from backpacks to water bottles to things that we don't even sell all with extensive notes from our product development team so are they garbage are they better than what we're making there's only one way to find out by hearing this message from our sponsor i fix it are you traumatized with visions of lost screws and missing components dancing in your head make those visions go away with ifixit's fixmat click the link below or stay until the end of the video to learn more [music] even at a fifth of the price i'd be pretty disappointed if it wasn't for the circle around the ltt i wouldn't even know that they were trying to knock off our logo is that comic sense i'm pretty sure that's ms paint drawing lines the print quality is terrible with light fringing around the outside oh my god they printed this and just put a pocket over top of it i think this might actually be made out of the like recyclable paper material that comes over top of a tv or monitor oh i know what you're talking about the like the monitor film yeah i think it's a paper-backed canvas wow i got a bottle mesh oh oh we've got our second piece of counterfeit merch and that's a point for this backpack you can put a water bottle on the outside yeah exactly hey why would why would i take the one that doesn't even have an external water bottle holder hello i belong to someone with extremely low standards to be clear i'm not shaming anyone who doesn't have a ton of money to spend on a backpack i'm saying if you spend 50 us dollars on this one you ain't doing it right that's all care instructions oh assembled in usa of us 100 polyester that i believe great kyle i can hear it in his voice and why is it off white it's gonna get dirty how strong is it not bad it holds it holds it got a box stitch on the armstrong not confidence inspiring but it didn't break okay well if ours can survive that then this one has to too okay all right i gotta give them points for durability bridget described the material as crunchy feeling due to the construction it actually does manage to cushion the laptop pouch a little bit i gotta give credit where it's due okay wait this is hilarious the bottom where they print it actually has little dotted guidelines for where to sew on the pocket and you can completely see them they're just unfinished i don't hate the name tag inside but i could rip it with my hands says bridget oh fair enough bridget oh wow i can actually see through it hi kyle complained about the smell i didn't actually smell it oh i don't think it stopped out i think he's being fussy oh my god you can get stuff for like if you're american you can get stuff for like 25 bucks that stomps this see ya oh i haven't actually worn it it really doesn't seem very comfortable these guys at least got the font right i think they actually bothered to rip the graphic off of our site but why why would you make it bigger so that you can cut off the top and bottom if you know that your printable area is this just make it smaller with that said i think i've seen and used water bottles from this factory before because i recognize this lid i have an asus one that has served me very well it's just not insulated i again nothing wrong with this water bottle if you don't mind a non-insulated bottle but 28 canadian dollars buy a real one not even remotely comparable vacuum sealed twist off cap sarah points out that the logo is obviously image traced because some points are pointy and other points are rounded probably could have put a little more effort in i can crush it with my hands he said oh wow i did manage to bend it a bit no it'll it'll deflect back what are you doing what are you doing bud for this that'll buff out hey what's next feel like i'm ready for my first day of school stick me up oh my god why that's called the big liner sticker big linus sticker available in a variety of sizes i think that's the extra large size so it's 22 canadian this is a 15 us dollar sticker somebody made commission on that you know you have to leave it on there for a week okay hahaha what is that supposed to be it's the linus tech tip sticker with a semicolon in the name oh perfect so this is intended for a water bottle well i just happened to have a water bottle there's more complaints about the smell this time from bridget but i guess they've been sitting for long enough that it's kind of gone away it looks good on there it does look good now no one will mistake my water bottle for theirs i gotta give them credit for the adhesive it goes on easy comes off easy and is also pretty easy to cut to size i'm gonna leave this on my framework permanently nice clean cut oh yeah now i gotta find somewhere for the value four pack oh beautiful i kind of like the stickers i mean obviously our stickers are better this is our 2022 pack with the recyclable packaging really cool done by sarah designs they're die cut they've got metallic and holographic elements and you can select them from the bonus bin for free with every order you're not gonna throw this at me now you can have a phone to put in it wow cool it's an iphone case this is actually not bad as far as cell phone case kiosk cases go the fits like kind of bang on actually oh again thirty dollars what i mean i guess i'm printing look if i wanted a picture of my family on the back of my phone or something like that i'd pay 30 bucks for this now i just have to find a convenient cell phone pocket in this backpack how about the one pocket perfect don't throw it don't throw it oh he threw it it's wide blindness on a mug print quality is actually not that bad sarah's comments why don't we sell this kyle says what i want a coffee mug why i have no coffee mug you know both bridget and sarah criticized the print quality but the source of this picture is actually really low quality i think this is a good quality print of a bad quality source cheers redbubble he kind of nailed this one oh it's dusty why did i drink from this there's definitely floaties oh well this is the actual ltt towel and we've got oh from aliexpress towel this is a towel it's a hand towel oh oh oh okay oh it's supposed to be a hand towel six dollars and nine cents six bucks hey yeah it feels more like a chamois than a towel like the smooth side of this that they printed on i don't even know if i'd be able to dry my hands on oh we can find that out easily enough one moment please thanks i'm good at being a towel rack it's dignified working here okay now tell me are my hands dry are they just clammy are they wet i can't just still very well i accept tips tech tips tech tips well i guess what we're working on now is a beach bag day bag for the beach so let's get our towel in there all right what's next it has instructions on it to not make counterfeit merch but it is counterfeit merch this is from aliexpress yes do not ltt ltt double layer bento box lunchbox salad food bento box linus lennis tech tips hot sexy liners ltt that is the unabridged product description for this i mean the price is right 10 us dollars oh this one smells i would not put food in this oh would you put food in this this part no that part i think is fine i think it's the gray plastic [laughter] ally just like do it do it and put your nose in there and smell cup and smell [laughter] leak proof i don't believe you let's find out you ready you have to lock it after you do it i'm gonna lock it there is no rubber seal jake there is no way no way that this doesn't leak it doesn't even have a tightening clasp it just goes on i think i'm about to wet my pants oh look at this okay now put the water back in the cup and drink it washable and reusable i see well here goes my lunch hopefully that doesn't leak here's what we're gonna do i'm gonna put on all the t-shirts without looking at any of them and then i'm going to see them as as i take them off that's it oh this is a real one that's a real look see okay good when you so big reveal okay it's a nice hand feel good stretch i like our new shirts oh yeah here we go first one oh wow that is the cheapest possible printing process this is literally worse than what you could do if you just went to best buy and bought like transfer heat transfer inkjet printer paper sarah really big logo bonus points for almost being the right pantone color open the product page look it's on the wrong side or is that just my brain wow that's the wrong yeah it's totally on the opposite side it doesn't have the white background and it's 25 this is four dollars more than our shirts to their credit one of the issues i find on cheap shirts a lot is that the thread that they're using is not stretchy no thread breakage mind you the entire shirt just stretched out for me doing that it did not spring back i can see what bridget was talking about with the really small like holes it's hard to get in and out of this one how's this for a look establish major power bills is that a mining rig and a doge and me is that a speaker no that's a graphics card why is the tag sticky asks sarah oh that is a really weird texture this has got to be the most uncomfortable fabric i've ever felt in the t-shirt oh god it's like almost soft but then somehow still really gritty at the same time it feels like they printed on the whole t-shirt that like weird crappy print what is that is that like brody oh this is the last one look at these look at these seams what's that stain yeah why is there is this a used why is there marks in the armpit looks like deodorant almost but that doesn't make sense you too can have this t-shirt complete with schmoo sarah actually didn't mind the design the designs kind of cool david wants that one it's like if i was like an edgy weird band like this was our tour shirt i established major established major power pass this is an active shirt that's what they're going for oh this would be horrible to work out in i think you should put that one on bear 28 all right i will try that one on on its own to feel the fabric oh this one's a shirt what is up with the black outline sarah's got that it's thick with four c's four c's of thick i i'm with her on that it's cheaper though okay it's cheaper than our shirts it is technically cheaper than our shirts that's a win technically come here i love this it's the old text oh my god it's that picture oh wow you gotta meet that guy yeah it's really uncomfortable it's gotta if it's cotton it's gotta be the world's worst cotton 100 cotton they say i only learned recently that there are grades of cotton this ain't it this doesn't get a grade made him madagascar machine wash cold with light colors 100 polyester yeah yeah it is all that chafing man if i actually did anything in this 10 out of 10 would not wear but the design is kind of cool oh david this one are meth tips which one which one do i wear for the rest of the video feeling cool to their credit the inside is quite soft and cushy feeling foreign that's a laptop sleeve okay what's the price though if this is 15 bucks then i'm okay graphic design is barf says sarah oh wow and they didn't print all the way to the edge of the fabric so there's a white strip sounds like snow pants when you hold it says bridget i love their critiques it does oh bridget says this interior fabric will shed it actually feels nice but yeah she's right that could be a big problem 37 dollars that is too much we're definitely gonna need our laptop for the day at the beach though most real laptops do bend like this so this should be fine nothing makes me respect the creator warehouse team more than seeing someone else try to do their job and failed this hard wait oh no oh that is such a weird thing to have on a skirt take off your pants so that's good okay whoa that's need to be adjusted that's they're quite revealing you get to wear for the rest of the video don't pull your legs up keep your legs down wearing a skirt that happens to be in your own skin tone not recommended linus moans tips there will be no breathing in this says bridget the black stitching is unfortunate and shows how uneven the stitches are yeah that's quality look at these threads hanging here trying not to look yeah just don't slip that camera i don't want to get the close-up yeah something to cover up with the linus lightweight hoodie sarah's only comment feels bad man oh it's not that bad sarah i mean it looks nothing like the quality of the pictures would lead you to believe it is oh my god that print quality though can you see the cracking from there also this is huge compared to the picture the picture shows it being like this big and this is forty dollars look at this sleeve look at all the loose threads on this custom masks oh custom masked so timely too even if i didn't have a beard this is going to be pretty leaky i mean a face covering is better than no face covering at all if you're like coughing or whatever but it's already come off my face oh wow we've got a big one coming i do like a big one legitimately something to cover up with take the mask the ltt bedspread blanket duvet cover comforter and we got it in a queen hey i am 100 putting this on the guest bed comforter filled sewn and finished in the usa with fabric made in china a hundred percent polyester comforter that is not going to be good for sleep you would be shocked how much moisture your body loses while you sleep and if you're under something that's not breathable it all goes into your mattress oh my god hold on david i'm gonna need to step back a little bit here let's get that on camera oh god wait is it stuck oh what is that just like a loose thread oh wow quality the quality of this is terrible it looks good you know what the printing though is better than a lot of the stuff we looked at pretty low res oh it's very low revs i mean it's not their artwork why is there a hole in oh yeah what oh that's terrible what happened here is that in the design file i don't know it is it's in the design why it totally is with how vibrant this looks in the picture though i would be pissed for a hundred and forty eight dollars for those of you wondering by the way yes the bento box has leaked through the bottom of the backpack leaving a nice little wet spot on our couch here oh and i realized we haven't really done like the the full ensemble shot here i mean that was my whole thing right like we got the back to school ensemble so we'll do the sweater around the waist kind of look casual okay just got it ah oh just gotta tuck into bed now and tell you
