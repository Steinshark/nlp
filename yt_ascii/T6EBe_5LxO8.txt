this is fire pong also known as rule zero which is a project that we made for emf camp 2016 and the basic idea is it's like a game of pong or one-dimensional game of pong but with fire rather than pixels rules are over hack spaces do not be on fire and that basically means look after your own safety and look after the safety of other people around you rule 0 the game has an asterisk next to it which basically says what the guideline each league players i was one of these bats you'd get timing quite right in order to bounce a flame back to the other end if you don't get time right then the big buffer goes off first one two three so first player is randomized oh that's its first layer alternates now you've won i won the match by getting first person to three points and as a reward i get a victory swipe which means i can whacked my bat and then lots of fire happens that is the most fun bit in the bats wiimotes they're just and so many ously taped in so as you swing the bat the wiimote sends a signal to roughly pi that's in the control box which is putting in the greenhouse at the moment this is the main control box which has the pi in it it has a 12 volt power supply which runs everything and it has some rs-485 serial controllers and a bunch of relays and stuff all of this goes out through these connectors to various other parts of the system and they're all controlled using arduino z' so we've got a whole bunch of arduino pro mini x' quite a few of which died in the making of this project and they receive serial data from the raspberry pi and convert it into some sort of events that they're supposed to do so we have display event which can make things appear on the display panel so this is a matrix display which was made by another hack space member alyttle and it just receives an rs-485 packet in a proprietary protocol that i wrote and display some text so the pi controls the kind of high-level stuff and then all the individual devices actually do the sort of turning on and off the solenoids and sparks and things like that in one of these little control boxes you can see a i've been o pro mini there and it's connected to this solenoid control board that's the rs 45 level and the arduino just turns on nathi solenoids which will in turn make some sparks happen and gas came out one of the things we had to work out how to do was how to light the gas so we experiment with things like barbeque lighters but they weren't really that effective and i came across these things one-pound 64 from ebay they put 5 volts in you get a few thousand volts out and then another challenge we had was how to design a spark gap we need we need some insulators so we've got a couple of ceramic tubes from fuses with the screws in the ends and a machined aluminium block would just mounts to the right position it was a bit of description about what would happen when you one wasn't there so that was when the victory swipe came was ensue to faster to encourage people to want to want to win and to have that extra go and make more fire when you win yay initially it was just kind of if you lost then there was a big puff but yeah we realized that would be an incentive to just miss so you got more fire so the victory swipe was a kind of an incentive to actually try to win the game and it really worked i mean people yeah people really enjoyed the victory swipe i think the other two canisters are actually butane cylinders which were discarded and they act kind of like a gas capacitor the cool accumulators and they store gas close to where it comes out so that it can come out quickly
