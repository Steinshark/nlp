okay so i'm going to talk about splitting necklaces and about non-constructive proofs - and this is a story about thieves that steal, together, a necklace. but they are not just any thieves, they are mathematically oriented
thieves. so imagine that we have two thieves and they steal together a necklace. and this necklace has beads of two types, eh let's say diamonds and rubies. they want to split the necklace evenly among them and they want that each of them will get the same number of diamonds and also the same number of rubies. so they open the necklace at the clasp and then they have an interval of beads. and the necklace can be complicated but, but this is an example. 
- (brady: no pattern or intervals or-?) that's right. we don't assume anything, let's assume for simplicity that the number of diamonds and also the number of rubies is even so that it is possible to split it evenly among the two thieves. now they want to minimise the number of cuts that they do in the necklace. what they want to do is to cut the necklace in several places, this will split it into intervals of beads, and then they will take the intervals and will distribute it among them; and they want in this example that each of them will get four diamonds and three of the rubies. all together seven beads.
- (brady: but it's important minimal cuts?) it's not necessarily the minimum possible number of cuts completely but they want to have a small number of cuts. each of them should get seven beads so we can try to cut the necklace in the middle. then we will have two intervals of beads, the left part and the right part, but you see that in the left part we have too few rubies, only one, and each of them should gain three. so this doesn't work. what we can do is we can take this interval of seven beads and shift it one to the right, and then - so this corresponds to having the cuts here and here. and then in this interval we have two rubies, which is still too few, but we are making progress; and then we can try to shift it gradually and hope at some point it will be okay. if we shift it up to this place here, so three...one, two, three, four; so the two cuts will be here and here, then in the middle interval we have exactly four diamonds and three rubies, and therefore also we have four diamonds and three rubies in what's left. and this means that two cuts are enough. now i claim that actually what we proved here is that two cuts are always enough. and why is this the case? because we started by splitting the necklace; so imagine now that it's a even maybe longer and very complicated necklace with diamonds and rubies, we split it into two halves by cutting the middle. now if on the left cut there are too few rubies, then on the right cut there will be too many, right? because altogether we have the right amount. and then we use what is called the discrete version of the intermediate value theorem. so that's a theorem in 
mathematics but these are just words. what this means; so we observe here that whenever we shift the interval here by one to the right, then the number of rubies in it can change only by one. because we lose one bead and we gain one bead, so we can gain at most one ruby. and therefore we started maybe with too few rubies, at the end we have too many, and every time we change the number of them just by one. so that means that somewhere in the middle we must hit exactly the right number, so this means that two cuts always suffice. 
- (brady: so the) (ruby number's only ever changing by one) (so we have a firm control of that?)
- that's right.
- (brady: but the diamonds are taking care) (of themselves as well?)
- yes so, you're right the diamonds will be okay as well, because the total number of beads each one gets is a correct number. so once we have the right number of rubies then the number of diamonds will be, will be correct as well. we saw also in this example, but it's kind of obvious, that if all the diamonds appear contiguously on the necklace somewhere, and all the rubies also appear contiguously, it is clear that the number of cuts we need is at least two because we have to have some cut in the middle of the interval of diamonds, and we have to have some cut in the middle of the interval of rubies. so it means that sometimes we need two cuts, and what we just proved is that two cuts are always sufficient. 
- (brady: sometimes we) (can get away with one cut but that's only) (when it's symmetric or-?)
- yeah so it doesn't have to be symmetric, what it means that exactly in the left side we have the correct number of rubies so it's true sometimes one cut is enough but what we proved about two cuts is that two cuts are always enough. so now we can try to make it a little bit more complicated. let's say that still the number of types of beads is still two, only diamonds and rubies, but now we have instead of two thieves we have four thieves. you know sometimes
it's better to have a bigger group so, so we have four, a small game of thieves. and they still are mathematically oriented, still they want to split it evenly, and still they are lucky and the number of diamonds and also the number of rubies is divisible by four. how many cuts do they need now? we have this necklace which is an interval of beads. by what we saw before we can have two cuts, maybe here and here, so that in this interval and in those two together we have the correct number of rubies and the correct number of diamonds - we split it into two fair shares. now we can take this interval that contains the half that went to two of the thieves, we started with four of them they split themselves into two groups of two thieves. and then, once these two thieves got the fair share that they deserved, then they use another two cuts in their part in order to split it evenly among the two of them. and these two intervals of the other two, we can shift them to somewhere, let's say here, in this interval we put it here and we forget that they are two intervals so we view it again as an interval of beads, and again this other group of two additional thieves can cut this part in two places and split it evenly among them. so if we go back to the original necklace this corresponds to six cuts. the two original ones, these two and these two. okay? so it means with four thieves and two types; six cuts are always enough and it is good to observe that sometimes six cuts are needed. so again the simple case where the diamonds appear contiguously, and afterwards the rubies also appear contiguously, if now we have four thieves then of course we need at least three cuts inside the interval of the diamonds, because we have to cut it into four parts. and we need at least three cuts inside the interval of rubies so altogether in this example we need six cuts. what we showed is that six cuts are always enough also. 
- (brady: four was very) (convenient because you are able to use) (what we learned from two,
what about; what) (if there were three thieves?) 
- right, yes. so it's not much more complicated, let's leave it as an exercise to way to the viewers, but it's not much more complicated to see is it for two types of beads with three then four cuts will always be enough; for a similar reason to what we said before. i mean with an extra simple twist and, and sometimes we need four. so it will be possible. it's getting significantly more complicated when the number of types of beads increases. so maybe we can have diamonds and sapphires and rubies. and let's just say the, the general theorem. let's say a group of k thieves. we denote by t the number of types of beads, and again they stole together this necklace, it contains beads of t different types, the number of beads of each type is divisible by k, they want to split it amongst themselves, and they want to do it with a small number of cuts. if we have this example in which each type appears contiguously, so maybe all the diamonds appear here and then all the rubies appear here, and then all the sapphires-
- (brady: emeralds if they're green!) emeralds, yeh, emeralds are better. so they appear here and so on. 
then it's clear that we need at least k minus 1 cuts inside the interval of each type. so for 10 thieves we would need 9 cuts inside each interval. and altogether 9 times t cuts. and in general we need, in this example, we need k minus 1 times t cuts. so it means sometimes k minus 1 times t cuts are necessary. and the theorem says that k minus 1 times t cuts always suffice. there is always a way to cut the necklace in k minus 1 times t places and then divide the resulting intervals into k collections, and each collection will contain exactly the same number of beads of each type. so this is more
complicated, and i'm not going to describe the proof, which uses some tools from continuous mathematics, specifically from topology, but let me just say that the first step is a simple step if we know the validity of this assertion, of this theorem for k1 thieves and t types; and we know it also for k2 thieves and 
t types then it implies that it is true for k1 times k2 thieves and t types.
and this is actually not difficult, it's similar to what we saw before when we dealt with 4 thieves.
so for example, if it is true for 3 thieves,
and it's true also for 5 thieves,
then it will be true for 15. if we know the statement for 
3 thieves and for 5 and we want to get it for 15 then the way to proceed is as
follows: the 15 thieves split themselves into three groups, each of five thieves. 
and then we view each group as a super thief and then we use the result for 3 and we split it fairly among these three super thieves. and then each group
that corresponds to a super thief, which consists of five normal thieves, they use the result for five inside the group. and then if we just work out the numbers then it will give us the correct splitting. this
is simple, but the more complicated thing is that the second step is to kind of change the problem into a continuous one, and i'm not describing how exactly, and then to use some theorem in topology to get the result for the continuous problems that implies the discrete version that we need. and the nice thing is that actually the topological result works only when the number of thieves is a prime number; is a number that is not divisible by any other number besides one and itself. (brady: something about the nature
of that proof) (means it only works for prime numbers?) that's right. so it's kind of lucky that we have this way to get the result for three times five from the result for three and the result for five, because the result for three and four five we can get it using topology, which seems to be necessary when the number of types of beads is at least three. right, we saw that with two types of beads everything is simple, but with three or more types of beads then we need this topology.
- (brady: so any number of thieves can be) (handled because any number can be built) (from prime numbers?)
- that's right. any number is can be expressed, even uniquely, as a product of primes and then we can use this result. a feature of this 
proof that i want to mention, that is intriguing, is the fact that it is non constructive. the topological proof does not provide any efficient procedure or algorithm to solve the computational problem. so if, for example, the number of thieves is five; and the number of types of beads is five, so the number of cuts needed will be 4 times 5, which is 20. and the total number of beads, let's say is 200, then we can always check all possibilities - we know for sure that we can cut it in 20 places and divide the resulting intervals evenly among the 5 thieves.
and we can, at least in principle, check all possibilities but even if we use all the computers in the world for years and years we will not be able to check all possibilities, the numbers are just too big. and some of the proof does not provide an efficient way to solve this problem. and moreover it is likely to suspect that there is no such efficient procedure, because it is known that this problem is what is called complete for some specific complexity class. and this means that there is a large number of computational problems and- which we don't know to solve efficiently any of them, and if we will be able to solve efficiently this specific problem then we will be able to solve efficiently all of those problems. and because we do not know to solve any of them then maybe it's likely to believe that this is impossible, and that means from the thieves' point of view that maybe they thought that the challenging part is to get the necklace, but actually maybe the even more challenging thing is to split it afterwards evenly among them. 
- (brady: all the computers in the world?) you know the total number of
elementary particles in the universe is something like 10 to the 80, and it's really easy to formulate a a very simple combinatorial problem where the number of possibilities will be more than 10 to the 80, just because often things grow exponentially in terms of their parameters. [extra:] much much longer, longer 
ago, where we think about having maybe an interval representing a cake...
- watch carefully. only time in my life i'm going to wash my hands in diamonds.
