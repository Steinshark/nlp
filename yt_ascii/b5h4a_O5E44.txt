it is iphone time iphone 12 iphone 12 pro in the house so let's start with iphone 12. iphone unboxings have always been brief but welcome to the next level the phone's on top there's a usbc to lightning cable and little insert which has some leaflets and a single apple sticker that's the unboxing no charger no earphones this time but for the phone itself there is so much to talk about so this is the blue it's kind of dark it's like a cobalt blue which sits about halfway between something that looks professional and something that's kind of fun looking it's got the same glossy back and matte camera module as the last phone but the big change is the form factor it is so flat i remember watching the launch event and part of me was really excited because i love minimalist design like this i've caught myself a few times in the last couple of days just beaming at it like a like a proud dad but at the same time i was also a little apprehensive because well chances are the hand you're going to be holding it with is curved not angular probably and you do feel it it's actually the only bone i have to pick with this design this is not as comfortable to hold as the iphone 11. i think flat sides really suited phones like the iphone 4 and the iphone 5 because they could literally fit into your palm but those phones have gotten bigger there's a reason that most have tended towards curvebacks but it is somewhat helped by two things one fact that 12 is actually quite a bit smaller than 11. like literally apart from the fact that these two phones have the same 6.1 inch display size the 12 is smaller in every dimension it's shorter it's narrower it's thinner it is 30 grams lighter it's kind of like they took an iphone 11 and just shaved off the entire protruding perimeter and so for context in the realm of iphone sizing it ends up just a tiny bit bigger than the iphone 11 pro iphone 10s and 10 but quite a bit smaller than the 10r and 11. if this was an android flagship it would be classed as compact so i'm very curious to see how small the iphone 12 mini's gonna be and the second thing which somewhat helps with the feel are cases so i've got two here the silicon and the clear random fun fact these boxes are exactly half the size of the box of the phone be very curious to know if that's intentional i really like the silicon one it takes away the sharpness of the phone softens the edges but keeps the core design intact the clear case i'm not much of a fan of i mean i've never really liked them but it's just that this year especially because of the magnetic accessories apple's designing they can't get around the fact that they've got to install magnets into the cases as well and those aren't clear oh yeah and the display on the iphone 12 is a mile better i mean don't get me wrong the iphone 11 it kind of needed a screen upgrade but it's just good to know that now that they've done it it's a big one it is still a notched phone but they've moved from lcd to oled which amps up the contrast quite dramatically it's got thinner borders and two times the resolution so you can actually now finally watch 1080p video without needing to get the pro model mind you it does cost 200 or 200 pounds more than the 11 does right now and it does still come with a fairly limited 64 gigs of internal storage but i would say that if you are choosing between the two and you're going to use your phone for like three years or so there is enough of a gap to justify that price difference the 12 is also water resistant to three times the depth coffee resistant too apparently although i will not be trying that one and the front glass is apparently four times more drop resistant also i've just ordered a whole bunch of iphone 12s for a giveaway starting right now and to enter all you need to do is to hit the link in description and follow my mrs boss social accounts i'll remind you about it at the end okay so that's why 800 gets you this is what a thousand dollars gets you the iphone 12 pro being the pro phone you get the pro packaging which is well it's the same but it's black you've got the phone on top you've got a usbc lightning cable inside and the same insert but the phone itself does feel different and it's kind of weird because dimensionally it's identical the iphone 12 and 12 pro are exactly the same shape to the point where you can literally use the same cases on either model but the pro just so happens to weigh 25 grams more and that's for two reasons there's an extra camera and they swapped the aluminium frame going around the edges on the 12 to stainless steel on the 12 pro but it is an undeniably better material like steel is way more resistant to bending to cracking even actually to corrosion oh yeah and they've polished it like crazy like if you go into work one day and someone tells you you have something stuck between your teeth now you've got your mirror to check but to be honest for me i'm not actually that bothered about the rims i think the more important change with the pros body is the fact that the back has a matte finish for me it's it's such a peace of mind thing i'm someone who likes to keep my phone clean and so the fact that i can still use this phone without feeling like i'm covering the back and fingerprints it keeps me sane i say that but at the same time because the sides are now so glossy you probably will end up fingerprinting them which is minor but if you're anything like me you might find it a little annoying oh yeah and something i've actually just realized while filming this video is that the extra weight to the pro combined with the fact that it has an extra camera on the back means that it actually wobbles less on a table so this is the iphone 12 and this is the iphone 12 pro random fact number two both these phones have magnets in the back now they're not strong enough to be able to kind of stick the phone on a fridge and leave it there we haven't tried that but they are strong enough to pick up paper clips or sim ejector tools not that i would recommend this but just a fun fact anyways i think it's fair to say that this year the pro isn't as much of a jump over the normal iphone as it was last year i mean literally today i've had probably five occasions where i've picked up one of these devices i've used it for a full two minutes only then to realize oh yeah it's not the right one which is i guess why they've priced them closer to each other than they normally are but the pro does have a few things that you might not have realized obviously it has that one extra camera a two time zoom but it's also got a lidar depth sensor on the back it's got twice the storage at 128 gigs and while the display technology is the same the pro can get brighter about 800 nits versus 625 now for me this lidar sensor has been a bit of a surprise hit basically it's a sensor that sits alongside your cameras and fires out infrared rays to figure out how far things are from you it feeds the cameras an extra layer of detail about what they're capturing but at the same time when i was watching this launch event and i saw it get announced it's also something that was tough for me to get excited for because i probably tested 15 devices this year which all claimed to have revolutionary depth sensors and with not a single one of them has it actually brought anything tangibly new to the table this is different i mean i still don't think there's a whole lot that this can do that this can't but at the same time the difference it makes for augmented reality is like immediately noticeable let me give you an example so something i used to do a lot on my iphone 11 pro was something called ar measure you can literally check the dimensions of a room or the amount of space you have for a new bookshelf you want to buy without needing to take out a measuring tape but the one thing that all these older iphones lacked and i guess this newer base iphone 12 also lacks is depth information see to know how far two things are apart from each other you also kind of need to know how far they are from you and so what these phones have done historically is kind of used all the sensors that they do have to guess and so while i have loved the feature there's a pretty wide margin of error and sometimes when you're plotting lines you realize when you look from another angle that they're not actually attached to the object you thought they were and you've actually just kind of drawn lines in the middle of the air but the 12 pro knows exactly where everything is i've been using ar measure on this and i can get the dimensions of objects correct to the nearest centimeter i was playing angry birds ar this morning and it's probably the first ar app that i've ever really lost myself in because of the depth sensor the objects in the game have a sort of permanence they stay in place the same way that objects in the real world do even as you move around them you get closer or further away and that makes the illusion more convincing the whole thing that normally breaks ar for me is when objects are kind of jittering around trying to figure out what's where in your environment but that doesn't happen as much here so there's that but lidar also helps when you're taking photos it can help you to focus on things faster you can take portrait shots of actually much more complex objects than past generations and it nails the edge detection plus you can also take portrait modes at night there's actually quite a lot of new camera stuff on both of these phones and i'm covering it all in a full camera comparison going live tomorrow so stay tuned for that now the final two main things that these new iphones have are the a14 bionic chipsets and 5g now as for the chipsets if you if you benchmark them it'll tell you they're about 15 to 20 faster than the last generation in reality i can't tell and it's not because these are bad chips by any means it's just because the a13 from last year already handled everything i've ever wanted to do on my phone i'm not saying that everything here is like snap your fingers instant but it's just that i don't think the chipset is a limiting factor anymore i think to get things to the next level we need a higher refresh rate display we'd need things like faster storage speeds we need better wi-fi connection in our homes we need it so that third-party applications were maybe co-optimized with apple to run as well as the first party applications so obviously these phones can play every game you throw at them i did think it was a little weird that in the official announcement of the phones they talked about how i could run league of legends just because what it can actually play looks a lot better than that and as for 5g i kind of live in the middle of nowhere so i don't get any here but it does work in a town center environment and there is an interesting feature that means the phone will only connect to 5g when it needs it and then it can turn itself off which should save battery so that's something i'm going to test properly before a full review the 5g is in very early stages here in the uk but alongside introducing 5g apple also scaled up facetime to now work at 1080p whether you're on 5g or wi-fi so what better way to test it than to call the man himself who is also testing the iphone right now marquez brownlee so marquez you're testing the you're testing the iphone 12 do you have any initial thoughts i like them i've been waiting for this design forever so that's my favorite thing the interesting thing i'm thinking about is comparing these two because iphone people are gonna buy iphones but they're probably gonna cross shop the 12 and the 12 pro a little bit and they're very similar phones do you think the do you think the 12 will be a better selling phone than the pro i think the 12 pro will sell better at first and then the 12 will catch up and pass it yeah so my bigger question is how will the mini sell yeah it's like it's kind of crazy though because it's like completely new product category it's like no one actually makes a top-end phone especially with 5g that's anything close to that small i hope it starts the trend so do you think do you think this design is an upgrade i like it so i prefer it a lot because it feels more secure to me like grabbing a a rectangular side versus like the curve size we just had on every other iphone for a while i think the grippiness is all right amazing man thank you so much for taking the time and i'll catch you in a bit all right thank you so much for watching and don't forget to enter the giveaway i'll leave the link in the description and i'll catch you tomorrow for the camera test
