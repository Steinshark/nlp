i love artificial intelligence and you thought i've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie space obviously 2001 a space odyssey let me ask the question about hal 9000 that makes a few decisions there that prioritizes the mission over the the astronauts do you think from a high philosophical question do you think hell did the right thing prioritizing the mission i think our artificial intelligence will be smarter in the future for a mars mission it's a great question that is the the reality isn't for a mars mission you know we need fully autonomous systems we will get humans but they have to be fully autonomous and that's a really important that the most important concept because you know there's not going to be a mission control on earth you know i'd you know 20-minute time leg there's just no way you're gonna control so fully a ton so people have to be fully autonomous as well but all of our systems as well and so that's that's the big design challenge so that's why we test them out on the moon as well when we have a okay a few seconds you know a three-second time leg you can test him out we have to really get autonomous exploration down you asked me earlier about magellan and magellan and his crew they they left right they were autonomous mm-hmm you know they were autonomous they left and they were on their own to figure out that mission then when they hit land they have resources as the in situ resource utilization and everything else they brought with them so we have to i think have that mindset for expression again back to the moon it's more the testing ground the proving ground with technologies but when we get to mars it's so far away that we need fully autonomous systems so i think that's that's where again ai and autonomy come in really robust autonomy things that we don't have today yet so they're on the drawing boards but we really need to test them out because that's that's what we're up against so fully autonomous meaning like self-sufficient there's still a role for the human in that picture do you think there will be a time when ai systems just beyond doing fully autonomous flight control will also help or even take mission decisions like how did that's interesting it depends i mean they're gonna be designed by humans as you mentioned humans are always in the loop i mean we might be on earth we might be in orbit on mars maybe the systems the landers down on the surface of mars but i think we're gonna get we are right now just on earth-based systems you know i systems that are incredibly capable and you know training them with all the data that we have now you know petabytes of data from earth what i care about for the autonomy and ai right now how we're applying it and research is to look at earth and look at climate systems i mean that's the it's not for mars to me today right now ai is two eyes on earth all of our space data compiling that using supercomputers because we have so much information and knowledge and we need to get that into people's hands we need first there's the educational issue with climate and our changing climate then we need to change human behavior that's the biggie so this next decade it's urgent we take care of our own spaceship which is spaceship earth so that's to me where my focus has been for ai systems using whatever is out there kind of imagining also what the future situation is a satellite imagery of earth of the future if you can hold that in your hands that's gonna be really powerful will that help people accelerate positive change for earth and for us to live in balance with earth i hope so and kind of start with the ocean systems so oceans to land to air and kind of using all the space data so it's a huge role for artificial intelligence to help us analyze i call it curating the data using the data it has a lot to of visualizations as well you
