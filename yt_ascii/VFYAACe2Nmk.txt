welcome to the complete battery comparison between the brand-new huawei mate 30 pro iphone 11 pro max iphone 11 pro iphone 11 and the samsung galaxy note 10 the first things first let's get them to the same brightness level so i've opened up a white page and used a looks ometer to measure the amount of light emitted i've put all phones on the same settings and now i've done that it's time to remove the charges and start the timer on the far right and the first application we can do is instagram because as always we're gonna try and simulate a fairly day-to-day scenario right off the bat a few things to note if you look at these specs below the mate 30 pro one in particular might stand out it's got a 4,500 million power battery and you might know if you watch a lot of these tests that's big almost more interestingly though the iphone 11 pro max has nearly 4,000 milliamp hours and yes that's not as big as the hallway but at the same time in every test i've done iphones have always been very efficient with the battery they do have and so given that this is such a large capacity by far the largest apple has ever used on a phone it'll be interesting so we're about 40 minutes into the test and we finished with instagram we're now on an application called the history of everything standard education app and you can see the note is behind for now but it's looking like the iphone 11 is not too far in front of it one thing worth bearing in mind about the note is that like the huawei it has a massive battery capacity it's got four thousand three hundred million powers but a couple of factors that perhaps put it a little bit behind on paper the note has a six point eight inch display which in terms of area is actually quite significantly more than any other phone here and it's running on samsung's 1ui skin which is a beautiful bit of software on top of android but in terms of battery management it's not as aggressive as either of the four phones it's up against that said if we take a look at the battery percentages on top the note has already overtaken the iphone 11 next to it it's looking about on par with the iphone 11 pro so far but the pro mercs and while ways make 30 pro they look like they're in a league of their own let's talk about resolution for a second because we've got quite a weird set of phones in terms of it and generally speaking more pixels is gonna drain more battery the reason i say it's weird is that apart from the samsung which is just set to full hd plus none of the other four phones actually use a standard mainstream resolution the mate 30 pro and the iphone 11 pro they're pretty close to 1080p but they're just a little bit higher the iphone 11 the base model is lower than 1080p and the 11pro max is higher it's the highest resolution phone out of all of them now the note tim plus does have a quad hd plus display but because out the box it comes set at 1080p and because that's what 95% of people are gonna stick with that's what i'm using for this test so you might have noticed in the background of this the iphone 11 has slipped behind it's on 62% after just over two hours and it's a full ten percentage points behind the note 10 plus and the iphone 11 pro we've just finished some camera recording of standard video 4k video and slow-motion video and now we're moving on to gaming starting with something pretty light and working our way up to more intensive titles this gaming process it takes much more out of the iphone 11 than it does the other four phones and i've got a few theories there's the obvious stuff like compared to the pro its battery is a little smaller and it's screen a little bit larger but that can't be the full story otherwise it wouldn't be so far behind the pro what i'm thinking is that this primarily boils down to display technology whilst the pro phones are using oled displays the standard 11 is using an lcd which in itself has the potential to suck more power but there could be more than that it could be that the iphone 11 doesn't have as good a cooling system as the pro variants that would also potentially lead to more power drawn every phone here is an extra brand new unit so there's no chance for batteries to degrade and they're all on the same settings they've all got wi-fi nfc bluetooth and location on as well as being on 50% volume so it's got to be an internal factor that said we're now creeping up to the four hour mark and providing a phone last five hours in a test like this that's good battery life that's respectable battery that you're not going to need to worry about for a while so we might still get there i actually had a double take at this point when i realized that yes we are approaching the four hour mark and yes the main 30 pro and 11 pro max those things are on well over 50% i don't think i've seen battery life like this since the pixel 3a xl you may or may not have realized but we're actually in a really interesting position when it comes to looking at the chipsets of each of these phones because these are phones from huawei apple and samsung the only three small phone companies that actually have their own smartphone chipsets and so in a way this actually further i'm sorry the stakes of this battle you've got wha where apple and samsung's top-tier flagship phones using their latest and greatest silicon and it's all being pitched together in this battery comparison after about an hour on youtube music the iphone 11 finally calls it a day but to be fair it has lasted more than five hours so i'm happy the next closest phone is the note 10 plus with 29% anyways time for after polls which is a super underrated first-person shooter game and the graphics on here are some of the best you can see on a phone full-stop i think also in case you missed it i'm running an iphone 11 giveaway with everything a poor pro all the rules are in the description now i feel like one question i haven't answered properly yet the u.s. ban on huawei you've probably heard about it you've probably heard of how our way is unable to do business with google and that means there's no google apps on this phone yes and no from all the units we've seen so far yeah none of them have google play store or google maps or anything like that on them but two things first of all it seems like huawei is pretty confident that this will blow over and that the situation will eventually sort itself out and the second thing as you can probably tell you can sideload them it took me about five minutes i'll leave a link in the description if you're curious but you just download an app and that downloads the google play services for you and so you still can have full access just as i say that you can see the samsung galaxy note tend from this point we've pretty much seen what we need to see so i'm just gonna fully fast-forward this test and let's get to the final results there was a bit of google chrome a bit of youtube and one final game and i did somehow manage to kill all these phones although let me tell you this was the longest time i've ever spent filming a battery comparison anyways in fifth place the iphone 11 with five hours and two minutes this one i'd call good battery life next up was the galaxy note m plus a way ahead at 6 hours and 31 already in the great category the iphone 11 pro was even better than this but what makes that more surprising is that this is such a compact device but then the mate 30 pro got 8 hours and 13 minutes that's staggering that's the second best phone i've ever tried but then the iphone 11 pro max takes the full title this is the best battery i've ever tried on a phone and it completely came out of nowhere i always did wonder what would happen to iphones battery life if apple actually put a large battery inside and you can see for yourself it's pretty great anyways thanks a lot for watching if you enjoy the video a sub would be amazing and there is tons more smartphone coverage of these phones and other devices plus a couple of secret ones coming very soon so do stay tuned for that i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
