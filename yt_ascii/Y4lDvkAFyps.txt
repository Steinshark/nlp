it's all about being in the in-crowd and i've been reflecting about this you know sociologies would have a field day about it yeah at bell labs they of course were the computing science research section they could afford their own computers but i think even there they liked the idea that it was their computer and it wasn't the computing centers computer although there was one let me go way back to the 60s and 70s when multi user computing came on the scene even here at naughty and it was batch it was cards and paper tape in those days that we could but of course the university had to make quite sure that your user name reflected a fair bit about you so they could categorize you i remember i think i was p m z df b p pure science faculty m mathematics department said don't ask me why member of academic staff df d six characters we were all like that but when we could afford our first unis computer we thought we can be like bell labs i could be just df be wearing with the in-crowd we've got our own computer and it's all ours i'm sure that was an awful lot of what was being reflected in that if you say bw k way over 90% of a computer science audience will tell you who that person is but i've checked back with brian about this and i said well was it always initials because i know in north america you know first name middle initial surname is very common he said well almost always and i said well what about ken thompson then he's kin isn't he and it was more or less davey you going to tell ken he can't be ken no apparently ken because he was so early on was on multix not just on unix and absolutely ground zero multi-user system and which he was helping to design he was ken and that was allowed you see so i think the rule came about that if you've got a short first name then fine that might be used as well so that was part of the whole thinking behind all this and i guess the next question i asked brian because i know how it evolved here was were you allowed to have more than three letters and so yeah yeah there's a guy i think surname was chesaning you know chaz no problem you know and so oh and rob pike i think was allowed to be robbed yes a it and i said well did anybody pull rank and say i'm seen here i want that and again according to brian no no it was first-come first-served if you got the if you got the acronym then that was yours so it started me off i'm thinking well if i'd only been fortunate enough to stay longer at bell labs in my brief visit in 1986 i didn't stay long enough but if i could only have had a user name could i have been dfb at bell labs the answer is yes but here's the sad story doctor heartbleed he's srb so i said to brian how about srbija balance sorry steve he said it's gone already steve born inventor of the bourne shell we'd have had to find something else when you think about it you can see some of the perils and pitfalls and this what about if two people have very nearly the same three-letter codes but not quite and you accidentally send the wrong email to the wrong person that has happened to me with steve a few times in fact the two steve's that are a bit ambiguous i've gotten both on computer file steve bagley is srb steve benford of blogging guitar fame is sdb and i have from time to time had a baffled visits from sdb saying what on earth do i know about document engineering or something like this the virtue was of these very simple three-letter names was it going to remember your back in the days of dumb terminals here pretty well keyboard character-driven terminals what you type is what you get it could have also completed but that would have been in its infancy the idea of auto completion and yes then you can click on it no that had to come in the future that came in with graphics terminals later unix windows mac's all that so there you are out in the visiting bell labs you've got a dumb terminal you want to send somebody any an email being able to type whatever you would be as they are at something easy to type that mattered a lot i still routinely type three-letter acronyms to get through to people on email unless i'm replying to something of course they're man it then that's all automated it's not just computer scientists although we're probably the worst about it but as you know in high school teaching in in any organization where somebody's trying to say who's in charge of this item on the agenda who's the person responsible rather than writing a full name you'll often just put three initials at the bottom again it's in the in-crowd we board members know who each other are and abc is in charge of this particular matter when we come to doing our grading sheets our mark sheets here every year and we look at each student's individual performance there's always a little bit added on in the corner the three-letter log in name of the academic members stuff responsible for that student and that helps you normally what happens if you've got a initials that don't really let's say they're not they're not something you want to be known as oh yes they're there if there is some rude examples of this but let's try one that isn't made as well i know that many of the viewers here are very familiar with things like github now i know what it means and i wondered well is there some other kind of more universal meaning of get them that and i looked it up and it says on wikipedia no less that get is a uk inspired prefix for a person's just very very annoying which is true i don't think there's any other meaning behind to get in get up other than that so you know somebody called joe george ian taylor might not like having the three-letter acronym get the other only other thing i think we haven't covered is what happens with people as have only got two initials yeah now apparently at bell labs ground tells me that tom duff who is really famous fabulous computer graphics guy and everybody the inventor of duff's device look it up i might even do a separate video on that at some stage yeah tom duff so famous you just allowed to be gd now that's amazed me cuz my dad and we can refer back to youtube videos again when he was with his type x machine out in the field he had to have us air force accreditation because he was reporting a cyber clock to the us air force he got his documentation you know what it said at the top frank nmi brailsford so what does nmi stand for and no middle initial yes so you know i'm surprised to find that tom duff has no middle initial i'm not saying it's quite unique in north america but there we go i would have thought perhaps lots of systems required that had to be this of the same format yes again you know and asking brian about this as background to all of this he points out that there was a sort of feeling that maybe not going beyond four would be a good thing because again it's a thing where we hope to get on onto another videos there were some weird word lengths in early computers and for example i remember that on the icl series computers there were six bit characters not 8-bit characters and 24-bit integer words so four characters for six to 24 would fit into one word on a computer like that i think he said similarly one of the machines he was on it was fine to have up to six characters it was all efficient because 660 36 it was a 36 bit machine so those kind of considerations because we're computer scientists were background factors as well it should be such a quiz right just a little quiz who can be the first commenter not to say first but to tell you shawn the answer the following question who is de que any clues is it a bit i don't want to give too many clothes except says a computer scientist yes and a second and rather harder one another very famous computer scientist was at bell labs but he's no longer there but he's very famous and it's a he his acronym at bell labs was a v a and it's not female it's male it's not a surname he was a va who's that good i hope these aren't just available on google and people will just go hard them i do there might be that definite come went up after the talk introduced himself it was the first time he met freddie since he was threatened with instant death i think freddie's wonderful handwriting you know what
