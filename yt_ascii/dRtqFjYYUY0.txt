[music] okay so what just happened here what you just watched is me unlocking a phone with my fingerprint through the glass in the display which is pretty dope that's like a glimpse into the future of smartphones so for unlocking our phones lately for the last couple years we've gotten used to fingerprint readers touch id became that standard and now pretty much every phone that comes out has somewhere on it this fingerprint reader for unlocking it but lately they've gotten shoved to like the back of the phone or the sides or just off of the front entirely to accommodate these full screen phones the bezel-less revolution the infinity display now i personally love the idea of shrinking bezels and i can see that future smartphone being completely bezel-less all screen but that does of course come with a couple sacrifices one of which being where do we move the fingerprint reader you can put it on the back like we've seen a lot you could put it in the power button on the sides there's a couple possibilities you can even go the apple route and totally remove it iphone 10 of course has no fingerprint reader and they've moved over to facial recognition or face id but synaptics has been hard at work on their own solution and that's what you just saw working it's called clear id but whatever the name doesn't really matter what matters is it's a fingerprint reader underneath the display glass so the sensor itself is called the fs9500 it's made by synaptics and it's being shown in this vivo phone called the x20 plus ud it's a pretty weird name but it's on sale and everything it's the first phone that has this fingerprint sensor in it so does it work in the exact same way that all these previous fingerprint readers have in the past almost sort of so you enroll your fingerprint in the software just like any other fingerprint reader you can do more than one finger if you want and then you'll notice i didn't scan my finger until a little indicator light turns on this is kind of how you know it's ready to scan and where to put your finger and then this is literally an optical sensor so it's a cmos sensor the same type you'd find in a camera or in the smartphone camera itself actually so in order for it to work number one it has to be an oled display it'll only be found in phones with oleds and number two it has to be shining a light on your fingerprint for it to reflect back under the glass and read it so when i put my finger on that indicator which is basically a helper for guiding my finger to the right place you see a light shine for a second a sort of a pulse that's long enough for it to read the reflection of my fingerprint on that optical sensor it's literally lighting up my finger for the sensor to see so you go from the screen off to raising the phone which lights up the indicator touching your finger to it pulsing the light and reading the fingerprint reader plus this pretty slick animation all in under a second and a half which is not bad so all that's pretty impressive and it usually brings a couple of main questions to mine number one being does it affect the performance of the screen in any way no and number two can you see it like in the display at all if you tilt it to the right angle can you see the sensor and that answer is yes if you look hard enough and while the screen is off at the right angle with just the right amount of light you can see the little rectangular sensor under the display but it's definitely so subtle that you wouldn't notice it if you weren't looking for it and of course once you turn the display on or light up any pixels around it even at the lowest brightness it's completely invisible so this is definitely really promising i was personally impressed trying it myself and i think the biggest thing obviously for it to improve is that speed like i mentioned it's all about a second to a second and a half to do everything it's faster than face id but it's slower than touch id it's think of it as like a first gen of a new touch id in the future though consider this because this is just the first generation of what we're looking at it doesn't just have to be in that exact area it's not limited to just the little rectangle in the middle that's just where we're expecting it so that's where they put it but it's unlimited in size it could be the bottom third of the phone it could be the bottom half of the phone it could even be the entire display all of the glass could have a huge cmos sensor underneath it that reads your fingerprint so i could see a phone in the future where you just take it out of your pocket and just touch it anywhere and you're in you're unlocked because you touched the screen but anyone else trying it wouldn't get in that's kind of like the ideal biometric authentication it's what face id wanted to be so with that in mind this first generation being this good already is pretty promising and it means we're closer to our goal of course of a fully bezel-less phone as far as phones we could see this in in the future we're not going to see this in the galaxy s9 probably not going to see it for the next lg flagship or the note but maybe a little after that i mean the sensor's out there now it's in this vivo phone but like i said it's a bit slow so you know the big manufacturers the lg's and apples and samsung's of the world aren't going to put this first gen product in their phone but i could see even as early as next year us having a much better much more refined version of this start to show up in phones a lot more often so i'm looking forward to that let me know what you think is this what you're expecting in the future of the iphone and the galaxies let me know until the next one thanks for watching talk to you later peace
