so i thought i would speak about reading csv files was theer c++ that's a fan activity so you know i've been thinking about csv files a lot this year and i've been very happy about it because in front of the conference you know i needed to read the csv file to get the bches done this was rather helpful and so you know have you ever read the iso csv standard the international standard and c sated values well yeah doesn't exist so pausing csv files is fun and the standard answer i get from every developer oh that's easy we have that under standard it's even in ranges so you can can you can use split split will do the job right and technically that's that's true practically it's a lie so if you look at the example yeah it doesn't work there is just a little problem in reality csv files look not like comma separated values you actually have like you know the option to have quotes and quotes you get to have the comma or whatever separates your values again and split will happily split that so we have a split which has its use cases and the standard and we'll split that for you but then you'll you know have to glue the other stuff again together and but the standard can help you if we talking about quotes we also have something to read a quoted string in the standard which is sdd quoted and if you could combine those that' be nice but i'm not aware that there is a quoted in the rangers or that you could build something like that in rangers that' be interesting maybe someone could show us it next year but the quoted in the standard goes to c++ 17 and you can either read an a string view or not no no you can you can write a string it's an io manipulator so you can read or write a quoted string from an io stream and when i read a csv file i like to work with string views because i don't want to get another ocation so using like a a string stream and reading into a and reading then this quoted into another string is not really an option and there's like i understand that it's probably for the standard not like an io manipulator for an io streams possible to give you a string view on the io stream but it would be nice to kind of you know basically have this interface where you can read from a string or string view and get a string view back and have a gor but then there has actually a csv file i'm really interested to read because it contains interesting data and unfortunately that has also this character in it in quotes and this prevents you from using getline and getline is really is really nice to use if you you know want to write an import or importing things and it's just always the same string you you get get to reuse mostly it's fast efficient but in that case you have to write extra code to accommodate the ability to have new lines and or that basically the data set is multiple lines potentially and your quoted strengths so with split basically you could like you know do the splitting and then you could do the merging because all the does operate on views and so you keep the characters between that so which are actually the content for you which you don't want to ose and so i thought that is a fun exercise for for the audience to present the best solution next year as a talk maybe at the conference but let me talk about why i think that's interesting to me i talked earlier that i want to actually look at statistics from csv files and one of the csv files which is really interesting for me is the data containing my records about butterflies and i do that now for a couple of years and it would be really useful to see the trends and the population and just you know when you do the monitoring in a year you kind of get a feeling for how the population is but it would be nice to be able to compare that to the past years and then maybe also have like multiple csv files as as an input because there's of course two websites which contain the same data one for germany one for the dutch area which i happen to every now and then also stroll in either by on purpose or by accident and the side effect of all this butterfly works this some images you see here which then end up in a calendar and i'm still looking for a website to maybe you know make that accessible to you and i thought it's maybe also you know a nice end to the conference to show you some pictures before we actually get started to you know begin our ending ritual where we have a speaker present us the closing keynote which is basically the next thing and this will now be a little break an
