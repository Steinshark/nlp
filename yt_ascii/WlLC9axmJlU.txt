mock e model three ford tesla america america engineering explained now that that nonsense is out of the way hello everyone and welcome in this video we are going to be comparing the ford mustang mach e to the tesla model 3 as well as the tesla model y now these are all electric cars so let's knock out some of the high level specifications first starting with the battery and if you want the largest battery the mustang maki actually offers two battery sizes one of which is significantly larger than the one battery option which is available with the model 3 and the model y however from a range standpoint that's where the model 3 and the model y shine so according to epa estimates the model 3 and the model y are going to have an advantage from a range standpoint that said the mustang maki is not that far behind and if you go with the highest range version a rear wheel drive extended battery pack that is epa rated for 305 miles what we're looking at here is the premium all-wheel drive with the extended battery pack so this has a range of about 270 miles so what does this tell us about efficiency well if the model 3 and the model y have a smaller battery pack and they're able to go further they're obviously more efficient and so actually what's surprising is that the least efficient tesla model y the model y performance is actually more efficient than the most efficient mustang mock e now as far as performance the mach 3 premium all-wheel drive which we have here is pretty equivalent to the model y so 0 to 60 in 4.8 seconds for both of those and then if you were to get the gt mach e that's 0 to 60 and 3.5 much like the model y performance 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds the quickest of the group is the model 3 performance 0-60 in about 3.1 3.2 seconds now what about cost well tesla has the advantage here if you're looking at equivalent models however because there is still an available 7 500 tax credit with the mock e you can come under the tesla's pricing using that tax credit also if you're looking at the larger size the maki versus the model y there are currently cheaper options available with the rear wheel drive only maki versus currently we just have the all-wheel drive model y on sale looking at the vehicle exteriors tesla's sleeker styling leads to a more aerodynamic shape so a drag coefficient of just 0.23 for the model 3 and model y versus 0.285 for the mach e looking at the wheels and tires two things surprised me with the machi the first one good that they use fat sidewalls i love to see this everyone's going towards very narrow tiny little sidewalls on their tires now and ford has done the opposite with the mustang machi which i love to see 19-inch wheels tesla likes to use a narrower profile there on the side wall so i like the sidewall on this unfortunately the tires are pretty narrow i was very surprised to see 225s on this especially considering the maki's weight this is a very heavy vehicle and it's got a very narrow tire on it for that weight these are narrower than the model 3 the model 3 using 235s and the model y using 255s so 30 additional millimeters of tire width on the model y for a vehicle that probably weighs less now i actually really like the exterior of the maki and i think it's cool how they've done the design and kind of made it look slimmer than it actually is and i think the side profile actually looks really cool there's a downside to this side profile however in the name of aesthetics they take something away from you and this leads to my biggest disappointment with the maki and that is the ground clearance so why doesn't it have much ground clearance well ford is using their pouch style lithium-ion battery cells and these are about six inches tall and so these six-inch batteries you can see are fitting in right here so when you close the door you can't see this but then when you open the door you can see this area you know where you have the battery in there and so because you have that giant battery and they want this to look aesthetically pleasing from the outside without raising it up way too high and having a really high roof line they have to give out some of their ground clearance so they give up that ground clearance and it has just 5.7 inches of ground clearance now if this is being classified as a crossover or an suv that's not very much in fact the tesla model 3 comes with 5.5 inches of ground clearance so less than a quarter inch difference between the maki and the model 3 the model y has 6.6 inches of ground clearance so about a full inch of ground clearance on the maki and to me i was already disappointed with the model wise ground clearance i thought it should have been a little bit higher so with the mach e you're only getting 5.7 inches so i think that's a bit disappointing now tesla uses a significantly shorter battery cell and so looking at this model 3 performance to my left this has about half an inch difference in ground clearance the model 3 performance being slightly lower down versus the standard model 3 half an inch difference in ground clearance between this vehicle and this vehicle and yet if you look at the hood height it's about at shoulder height on me here and then this is well over my shoulder coming up here so even though these vehicles have similar ground clearance look how much taller this one is sitting so it gives it that you know suv appearance it lets you sit up high for that driving style however unfortunately you don't get the benefit of added ground clearance all right so let's start to get into practicality starting with the front trunk both of them have spacious front trunks which is nice to see one advantage of the tesla is that you can open it using an app on your phone so that's nice you know you're coming out of the grocery store or whatever and you want to put your things in you can pop it open using your phone though with the mustang you do have to come inside here and you can pop that open just like a regular hood both of them somewhat similar as far as the amount of space inside of them the mustang does come with this divider which you can take out another nice touch that they have with the mustang is that it has a drain hole so if you do want to fill this up with ice throw some drinks in there or whatever it is you'd like to keep cool you can basically use this as a cooler which is pretty neat now as far as rear cargo space it is quite difficult to beat a hatchback or you know an suv crossover that kind of thing so plenty of cargo space back here the model y wins out by a little bit as far as overall cargo space once you do have these seats folded down versus the model 3 you know the model 3 is decent for a sedan but nowhere near what we've got right here all right let's have a peek at the interior so to open up the mock e we've got a button right there simply push that it pushes the door out there's a little handle and you can pull that to pull the door open got these graphics that start up as you enter and also very nice to see a front display here so not only do you have this massive touch screen right here on your right which is for most of the controls you also have your important information like your range how much better you have left what speed you're traveling and if you're wondering what these flashing lights are right here these are actually infrared cameras looking at you and making sure that you're paying attention so that if you're using the hands-free driving hands off the wheel it's making sure that you're actually looking ahead and paying attention to the road and pay attention to what's going on in case you need to intervene another really nice touch you've got wireless apple carplay here so fantastic to see apple carplay you've got waze spotify all wirelessly connected i already had my phone connected so the second i got in it already connected up the wireless apple carplay nice big screen here and overall pretty easy to use you've got this car up here which gives you pretty much all of your settings and the different drive modes that you have and then if you want to get back to carplay you've got this menu system right here to get to that and use those apps as far as space in here now i know jacob from straight pipes use having a little trouble with his knee and this corner mine actually doesn't hit the corner even though jacob and i are the same height six one and a half and also you know there's plenty of adjustment in this seat if you want to go back even further so i mean i've got a big gap there so if you are really tall you can put this seat quite far back and get your knee away from that corner that said that is a pretty sharp corner so if you're riding really close on your knees bumping into it it's not the most pleasant thing to rest on for sure looking at the materials in here this is a nice interior now this is the premium but you've got leather touches you've got soft touch nice interior in here great sound system also look how much headroom i have an abundance of headroom so that is nice as far as visibility i feel like it could be a little bit better you know you've got these large a-pillars and the hood of the car is very long so you're quite a ways back from the front of the car which i think takes back a bit from the visibility overall though it's okay you know looking out the front and then if you go towards the back you've of course got those rear corners that are all clogged up so visibility i feel like could be a bit improved obviously they're taking some styling you know going for aesthetics here rather than optimizing purely for visibility now sitting in the rear the story's a little bit different still a good amount of headroom if you're sitting upright but if you lean your head back onto the headrest my head actually does start to then touch the ceiling here as far as leg room though there is plenty so i have the driver's seat adjusted to where i'm comfortable and you know look how much space there is in front of me there plenty of leg room and headroom here in the back same story with the tesla model y plenty of legroom and headroom in the front and the back seats now as far as leg room and headroom in the model 3 if you're up front plenty of leg room plenty of headroom no problem a bit more restricted if you are sitting in the back seats versus the mock e and the model y visibility pretty good in the model 3 and the model y looking out the front it does get a bit restricted looking out the back the back just comes up really high so kind of hard to see that of course you've got rear view cameras so restricted a little bit in the back minimalist interior in here large screen you don't have that you know screen in front of you if you wanted a display right there but i very quickly got used to this don't mind having it to the right but i think it is a nice touch in the mock e having that display up front so what is it like to drive well thanks to having that battery all of that weight beneath you as well as having that low ground clearance the behavior the driving behavior actually not a ton of body roll it's got you know a good feel to it it's responsive and and it's fun it's actually a playful thing to drive around which is surprising and you do feel the weight you know you certainly do feel this is a 4 800 plus pound vehicle but from a dynamic standpoint it feels good even with those little skinny tires on it you know it's fun and you know you come out of a corner and you put your foot down the rear end kicks out a little bit it gets a little tail happy so it's a playful machine they also do have one pedal driving so you can do all of the driving with your right foot lift off the accelerator and you can come to a complete stop it'll slow you down at 0.2 g's and from a driving perspective i think one pedal is definitely the way to go in here i didn't really like the standard two pedal driving in this the way behave the brake pedal is a little spongy and it doesn't quite feel right when you're using it at low speeds the one pedal driving feels much more precise and allows you to come to a stop without ever touching that brake pedal of course you've got the brake pedal if you need it in an emergency and regardless of how much regen you like say you don't like having a regen you don't like the vehicle slowing down when you let off that throttle pedal there's different drive modes to accommodate you and one of the biggest differences from a driving standpoint of how this is different from the tesla is that the brake pedal blends both the mechanical brakes and the electric regen from the motors so in the tesla the brake pedal is only operating the mechanical brakes and you choose what regen you want in this you choose what reach end you want but also no matter what the motors will use that maximum regen when you start pressing on the brake pedal so first they'll use regen as you get deeper into that brake pedal they'll blend over to the mechanical brakes to bring you to a stop if you need to stop faster now this thing is certainly quick 0 to 60 in 4.8 seconds and it's got immediate response ford says within 0.1 seconds of putting your foot down it's giving you that torque and at 0.5 seconds you've got peak torque so you get torque very quickly and oh do you hear that v8 rumble so from a noise standpoint not exactly sure what's going on but you can turn that off with the setting and then you floor it you hear nothing so you can have it quiet or you can have that little rumble as you put your foot down on the accelerator pedal overall fun to drive all of these you know model 3 model y they're all fun to drive if you know purely driving dynamics is what you're most interested in the model 3 is going to be the most rewarding it's just you know it's the lowest it's the lightest it's the quickest so the driving dynamics of a car are better than you know a crossover but overall they're all pretty fun to drive now what about tow rating well if you're looking to tow in the u.s market neither of these are coming with a rating however in europe the mustang machi is rated for 750 kilograms and the model 3 is rated for 910 kilograms however in the us you can get the tesla model y which has a tow rating of 3 500 pounds so greater than either of these options and the only one with an actual rating so far in the us market now there is a mobile app for both of these vehicles so a lot of the functions you have are equivalent on both of these apps whether it's unlocking the car using your phone as a key starting the car up to start preheating it before you take off that sort of thing a couple advantages on each side for the tesla i like the climate controls it tells you the exact temperature in the car and you can set an exact temperature versus the mustang has three temperature settings one thing i do like about the mustang app though is that it shows you tire pressures and i think it's good that they show you tire pressure it's something you know often you may not look at and so having it right there on your phone i think that's cool and they tell you what the recommended pressure is so let's end this with a summary talking about why you might choose each one of these individual models so we're going to start off here with the mock e and of course styling is a subjective point so if you like the way it looks great you know i think it looks fantastic and you know i think actually how a car looks plays a big role in what people are willing to buy so of course you know pick something that makes you happy another great feature wireless apple carplay so i really wish i had carplay in my tesla model 3 i'd love to be able to use waze in the tesla but you cannot and despite how good the user interface is with the tesla i still think it'd be great for them to add the capability of apple carplay so i love that you have android auto and wireless apple carplay here with the mustang maki heated steering wheel another fantastic feature of the maki and actually works great i was driving around with it keeps your hands nice and toasty i love that another benefit of the mustang a front display so this is a common criticism of the model three you know you only have that screen to your right there's nothing directly in front of you and so you have that nice screen giving you the important information in the mock e while you're driving directly in front of you right underneath that steering wheel and finally the price so you know not just because you can get that 7 500 tax credit which is still available with the maki and not for the tesla's but also because they have the rear wheel drive models which are coming in at really good price points in order to get into a long-range electric vehicle so if you want you know this kind of style vehicle this crossover style here at a good price point with the rear wheel drive models that is a great option with the mustang machi okay so sitting in the middle what are the advantages of the tesla model y i think the biggest one is just you know it's immensely practical so plenty of cargo space it does have more range than the mach e if range is a big concern though you know range overall on all of these vehicles is pretty good another big advantage is ground clearance so nearly an inch up in ground clearance versus the maki so that's a big one and also if you do need to do any towing honestly towing with an electric car these days is going to be pretty miserable but if you have short trips that require towing the model y offering you 3 500 pounds of towing capability so impressive stat there versus these two and finally the model 3 so if performance per dollar is something that interests you this is the best performer at the best price and the best performer overall as far as you know driving dynamics and outright speed it also offers you the longest range out of the three and you know with that long range of course tesla's fantastic supercharger network now i mention this as an advantage and right now it certainly is an advantage but the network of chargers for non-tesla evs is definitely growing electrify america is fantastic and definitely growing so there is fast charging capability for vehicles like this mustang and they do have that all built in within you know the user interface you can find nearby chargers nearby fast chargers plug in start charging right up just like you do in a tesla now all of them offer wireless updates so all of them with the ability to improve over time which i think is fantastic you know and i think you know from a comparison standpoint as far as the stats go the tesla's going to come out ahead in a lot of areas however the mustang is actually a great great vehicle and i think the thing that probably won't be as understood to tesla fanatics out there is that not everyone wants a tesla and now there is another option out there that's really good and it's probably going to get some people interested in evs that otherwise didn't have any interest in evs and i think the mustang ev is a fantastic option to go with also a very fun vehicle capable i'm disappointed with the ground clearance and that's probably my biggest gripe aside from that i think the range is good the efficiency is good you know the charging network is good i really like the interior it's spacious it's practical so all around it is a solid vehicle all around these are all three solid options if you're looking to get into an ev thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
