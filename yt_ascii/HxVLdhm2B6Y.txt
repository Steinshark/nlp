[music] hey what's up guys i'm pbht here and welcome to autofocus episode 2 so today we're gonna look at apple carplay and i've heard of it a little bit but i've never actually tried it tesla's don't have it so today we got a car that does have it that we can explore so this is the 2018 lamborghini aventador s but honestly the real reason this car did catch my attention was because it has apple carplay i swear it seems like most in cardassia's no matter what the car are pretty bad at navigation whatever they do so it feels like apple carplay and android auto are the two best chances new cars have at connecting to your smartphone and working easily and functionally in a way that people actually use so the best connection most people now have to their cars is just bluetooth when they get in so they get in the car it automatically connects to bluetooth and then you get your music and maybe your phone calls right with android auto or apple carplay you get a whole operating system as soon as you get in your car so with this you get in you plug in your iphone lights up and you get carplay so you get apple maps you get siri all the time you get text messages you get stuff that you're used to having on your phone so let's do that so you start with the normal lamborghini ui in the car which i gotta say is pretty badass looking inside all this carbon-fiber you control it with this knob in the middle you press in to select and they can do all kinds of things like navigate somewhere or toggle things inside or outside the car you plug in your iphone though you can give it a second to recognize everything and then boom carplay comes to life immediately now you're controlling the iphone through the ui of the car this is way better than lamborghinis ui instead of spinning a dial and trying to like type in an address then navigate through an on-screen keyboard and all that kind of stuff you just use your phone's navigation system it's not your fingertips or with voice control now that is still apple maps and siri but it's better than before so you still have all the same functionality you're used to and basically the idea is you get to do as much as possible hands-free so you can focus on driving assuming you'd probably want to do some driving in a car like this in fact let's drive to another location so yeah you'll notice a lot of similarities between carplay ui and the iphones homescreen obviously that's the idea you're supposed to feel at home like you never left your phone behind so that's what you're familiar with you get the home button in the bottom left corner above that you got the time in the most recent apps you've opened and then the main section is the layout of all the apple apps the default ones first and then the third-party ones that are actually on my iphone that are compatible with carplay so anything that's on the iphone that's compatible will show up here and then i can move these around wherever i want i can add pages if there's more apps add apps to my phone and just put them however i want it's pretty useful all right new location [music] so there's a couple of third-party apps on my phone i got pocket casts and spotify and these both also work with car plates so when i open them they open the car play version on the cars display and then there's this whole list on apple's site of apps that are compatible that will also show up in car play if you open them it's not the longest list i'd actually but probably say android auto has a longer list of compatible apps in the play store but there's still some pretty good apps here and then not only that it's a one to one connection with the phone so if i have it open on the phone it opens in the dashboard as well other apps that aren't compatible won't do anything on the car screen they'll just open on the phone screen but it's cool that it's actually this responsive and then of course probably the most useful functionality in a car voice control in this case it is siri and that can be for responding to text messages it doesn't show the text of what you say to respond on the screen which is a bummer i wish it did but basically it reads your responses back to you and asks you if you want to send it and then you can send it off so how much you use this will basically just depend on how much you trust series voice recognition oh and by the way driving an aventador is incredible when granted i only had a day and a half with it and you can only learn so much about a car just by spending that little time but i have plenty of observations about this ridiculous half million-dollar supercar number one this car is low everything about it is super low the roof line is like forehead level so if you want to see anything above you you like really got a lean forward and then also because it's so low getting in and out of the car is kind of funny it's a probably a legit challenge for a lot of people the doors of course go up instead of out so you can't really use them as handles to hold on to to get in and out otherwise we'll just close them on yourself so you end up doing this kind of a shimmy to get in and out it's pretty great there's a button in the cockpit that's what i'll call it a cockpit to switch between driving modes strata which is like street driving then sport and then corsa which is basically race mode it's mean as hell and then ego mode is kind of your own custom cocktail of the settings mixed between them all the gauge cluster is super sexy changes with the driving modes and has me feeling kind of like a fighter pilot as soon as i sit in the driver's seat and i got to say even though this car came out in 2018 it is nice to see a screen without a notch on it it has a surprisingly tight corner and radius because the back wheels actually turn a little bit to move tighter and of course just driving generally is insane huge wheels huge grip huge brakes and huge power and now i come to think of it huge sound it's louder than you think pretty much all the time it's just sensory overload as soon as you're holding the steering wheel i'd say it's kind of the opposite of a tesla and lastly actually one of the most interesting facts is the 2018 lamborghini aventador s does not have android auto that's actually one of the reasons i first caught my eye first got on our radar was because we thought it had android auto there was headlines about it i got a lot of hype for it there were some people saying oh this is the most expensive car with android auto we opened it up on our phone we plugged it in we tried it as far as we could tell this car does not have android auto if it does i couldn't find it and nobody who works at lamborghini who worked with us on this video could find it as far as we know it could get it over a software update which these cars do get which is really interesting but as of today the headlines are wrong the aventador just has car play and it's actually not even on apple's list of cars that officially support car play if you look it up there's another older lamborghini model listed but not this one so it's just kind of off the grid go figure but there you have it if you are if you're looking for a recommendation from me on whether or not to buy this car i'm not quite very yet obviously i just spent a day and a half with the car but it was a lot of fun so shout out to lamborghini for the car and for making this all happen and for reaching out after my tweet to get this together shout out to the dealership in palm beach for hosting and showing us around and shout out to casey nice tat for being the area photographer for this video i'll link his channel below and he also dropped a video a little bit of behind the scenes and shout out to you for watching doc's you guys the next one peace
