hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about the successor to the michelin pilot super sport tire which is the michelin ps4s now the supersport was often regarded as the best tire in its category and now michelin has improved upon that tire and i was invited by michelin to go check out this tire i got to test it out on the track on some autocross courses and out in joshua tree in some supercars and audi r8 mercedes amg gts so super cool experience getting to try out these tires but i want to talk about you know some of the differences that are in this tire in order to make it better than its previous tire the michelin pilot super sport and so you know one of the obviously the most important things with any tire is the compound but this is kind of this mysterious black art that's kind of behind the scenes you know where each company has their proprietary blend of 20 plus compounds or whatever it may be in order to make that perfect tire that perfect amount of grip but so you know some of the more physical differences that you can see we're going to be talking about here i mean one of those is this air mid nylon belt so this hybrid belt that they use this is done in order to maintain the shape of the tire so they put a lot of emphasis with the ps4s on you know making sure that that contact patch has the ideal you know contact with the ground and also that the shape of the tire doesn't change depending on whatever you're doing to it and so this tire has a y speed rating meaning it's rated for over'6 miles per hour'6 plus and so you know at these high speeds you're going to have obviously very high g-forces on that spinning tire and so you need to be able to maintain the shape of that tire not have it expand out or change in shape so that the contact patch remains ideal on the ground also for you know high g-force cornering things like that you want to make sure that the shape of the tire doesn't deform so you have that ideal contact patch so that's done with this aramid nylon belt which they have woven in the tire and so the placement of this belt and you know how where you put tension on it is very important for how the steering response is going to feel and for the endurance of the tire so the tire lasts a long amount of time now moving on to another thing here we're looking at the contact patch of the tire in a high g-force turn and so if you can imagine going around a corner and you're looking at the outside tire so you're going to have you know these five different strips here you've got that groove those tread grooves where water is allowed to pass through so obviously you're not going to have contact in those tread grooves but you can split it up into these five sections and here on the left we have the previous pilot super sport and then here on the right we have the pilot 4s pilot sport 4s and so you know the difference you can see here we're looking at a heat map basically of pressure and then that translates into temperature but essentially what they were able to do with the new construction of the new tire you know some of it has to relate to this belt some of it's the compound but point is if you're on this high g-force corner you're going to have all that pressure going towards the outside of the tire as you can see here so this is the outside this is going to be the inside of the car here outside of this tire right here and they have this hot spot in the previous michelin super sport which they were able to basically distribute better in this tire so if you've watched my video on tire load sensitivity you know that you want pressure distributed as evenly as possible because the more even the pressure distribution is the more grip you're going to have the coefficient of friction of a tire goes down as the load on it increases and so if you're able to distribute that load more evenly you're going to have more grip now another thing that they've done here is this multi-tread compound with an asymmetrical tread so this is actually a really cool thing where you know you may think that there's going to be just one compound used for the tire but actually they've split it up into sections where you've got a varying compound across the tire so once again if you're looking at the outside of that tire you're going to have this dry compound and then on the inside of the tire you're going to have this wet compound which is more ideal you know for wet scenarios and it's going to give you good grip in wet conditions and so why would you do that why would you have the inside well if you think about it when you're driving in the wet or when you're stopping in the wet you're not going to be having real high g-force turns because you can't you're limited by grip and so the inside of the tire is more important in lower g turns and it's important of course in braking when you're in a straight line now when it's dry and you have tons of grip and you're able to push that contact patch out to the outside of the tire you can see that you're going to want you know a nice high grip compound for that area and so that's what they've done they've split up the compound as you go out towards the end edge of the tire so you have more grip in the dry on the outside better grip in the wet on the inside and another thing you'll notice with this tread composition and this tread design is that you're going to have larger more rigid tread blocks towards the outside of the tire and that's of course for those higher g scenarios to give you increased lateral grip now michelin isn't purely content in just saying that it's the best tire in the wet and the dry they actually have the data to prove it so they commissioned a third party to do some testing for them and they were ranked the number one tire in wet breaking dry breaking and in dry lap times and so here i've just listed out the dry breaking distances which is pretty incredible looking at the differences between the tires this was all done on an audi s5 all the cars using and then basically the top of the line summer tires for these different companies now these aren't the track oriented tires like the cup twos that are out there this is you know michelin's ultra high performance summer tire that's also very capable on the road and in wet conditions so the ps4s stopping at 110.4 feet over the average of their test runs bridgestone potenza so4 pole position 115.3 feet continental extreme contacts 117 pirelli p0s 116.5 and the goodyear eagle f1 115.3 so you can see the bridgestone potenzas in the eagle f1 in second place there and there's still a five foot difference in stopping distance versus the ps4s tire so really impressive dry braking they also have the numbers out there for their wet braking and the dry lap times it is a really impressive difference you know like a second or two faster on the pilot super sports around the track that they tested on versus the competition now i actually got to try out these tires in an autocross course and i tested out the ps4s the bridgestones and the continentals and what was really fascinating about my testing initially on my first run for each of the tires i got two runs on each tire my first run the bridgestones and the pilot super sports were really even in braking i think they were both at about 114 feet and then the continentals were a little bit worse in braking but then on the second run so you're going twice in a row so the tires are heating up as you're doing this my second run once the tires were all heated up the pilot super sport or the pilot sport 4s's actually improved they went down to 113 feet whereas the continental and the bridgestones both got worse on the second run after the tires had heated up and so i think they were about 117 118 feet there whereas the ps4s were at 113 so really impressive that even as you add heat to that tire it's not degrading in performance whereas if you added heat into the continentals and the bridgestones it was degrading and performance now as far as driving these on the autocross course you could actually feel the difference pretty significantly so the continentals to me you know there was a lot of understeer which was pretty noticeable the bridgestones honestly felt really good the first run and then they started to deteriorate on that second run and the only you know major difference i noticed is it seemed a little bit more tail happy than the ps4s tires and the ps4s tires great turn in honestly and so you know very good tire on that autocross course now another thing that michelin did that was really cool is they set up this breaking board that you could look at and see everyone who had been doing the autocross you could see what their braking distances were based on the tires that they used and you can see you know the cluster of stickers that's much shorter breaking distance for the ps4s tires and this is you know just all of us you know random people that they invited to test out these tires you know these are our actual braking distances would say put up there and you can see the ps4s tire doing really well so a super super impressive tire out of michelin really appreciate them for having me out and checking them out thank you guys for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them
