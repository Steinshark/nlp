[music] first up a smartphone gadget i don't think i've ever come across in public but there are a lot of potential uses for this you're looking at a portable 1080p display with a trick up its sleeve it can be completely powered by your phone so one cable connecting your smartphone and this display and all of a sudden you've got either a full desktop experience or just a better way to watch your netflix shows on-the-go fun fact i used to be a big fan of the drum kit so this blew my mind it's a kit containing four sensors you attach one on to each foot and then one on to each of two drumsticks and you can play the drums anywhere it also doesn't really matter what surface you're hitting it could be a table it could be a lab i wouldn't say it quite replicates the feel of a drum kit but it's about as close as you can get without one i think he's a fan i think he's into this one the osmo mobile 3 is pretty much the king of affordable smartphone stabilizers it's not the cheapest but considering just how smooth it can make your footage it's worth a slight premium take this video taken on an iphone whilst running lightly and now this with exactly the same settings on the phone just with the gimbal it also folds up into an almost pocket-friendly size next up is grip head and unless you mount your phone pretty much anywhere whilst you've probably seen sticky pads like this the fact that this product has a cover means that when you're not using it you can close it and so the stickiness lasts longer it can supposedly be used thousands of times i think he wants to he wants to help pick all right you let me know it when you like go cube kind of feels like a 21st century re-imagination of the rubik's cube you still looking at a 3x3 cube with the objective being to solve it by rotating until each side is a plain color however i think i deserve that one i should probably stop throwing things however you probably guessed it there's an app and it adds a lot to the experience it cannot just guide you on the best next steps from where you are but it brings minigames and challenges plus it records your stats also the company has clearly spent a long time thinking about the feel of the cube each movement is super smooth and there's a satisfying lock every time we shift into a new position the ori is a tiny gadget that lets you make phone calls with your fingers i'm not even joking it connects to your smart phone and can give you a subtle vibration anytime there's a notification but more interestingly when you want a phone call with someone you can talk to them just by going like this i'm being dead serious ori has a good quality microphone built in to pick up your voice and uses bone conduction to send the audio from the other person into your inner ear what's also cool is that when a message comes in you can actually just place it on your ear like this and it'll dictate it for you and plus you can use a whole load of other air gestures to control other parts of your phone like what music track is playing is dull feels a little first-gen it doesn't pick up all the gestures i'd want it to but i hope it improves over time [music] by a company called easy future i think we've got one of the better mobile game pads it feels tightly constructed no flexing and the buttons good enough but the most important differentiator here is that it slides on to your smartphone and this makes a whole lot more sense to me then a traditional bluetooth gamepad for which you'd have to find a separate holder to keep your device propped up this also has a bit of texture on the back and just generally gives you something meteor to grip onto also if you do enjoy straight-to-the-point tech content like this a sub would be amazing then we've got delina and probably the most expensive gadget we've ever had on this series but the results are mind-blowing they call it an observation station you've probably seen night mode on smartphone cameras it allows you to still capture good detail in the dark well this is kind of like that but on steroids stellina has a massive sony sensor that is built for extreme low-light performance and the equivalent of 50 times zoom so when you pair that together you can see distant space far beyond what your eyes alone can i took this shot of the andromeda galaxy and this is just after 5 minutes of capture time and on a day with a pretty average amount of light pollution is also built to be easy it can automatically find constellations and i'll lock on and shoot them for you [music] ever since we heard that apple's air power was being discontinued there's been this surge of alternatives wireless charging pads with multiple coils to charge a couple of devices at the same time without needing to be particularly careful about placing them exactly on top of one of the coils this one's pretty good it's got five coils in its main section but realistically that does don't mean you can only charge two devices with this but then it does also have this separate section where you can charge an apple watch to the cork mini is a tiny bluetooth speaker which runs with the idea that the best speaker is the one you have with you instead of carrying around a bulky dedicated unit this thing can clip onto an empty bottle turning the space inside into a sound chamber that can produce some serious bass it's also even on its own a pretty detailed sounding little thing now the will having in a pretty health-conscious age but the difficulty comes because we've never been busier and so the idea of taking even more time out to go to the gym is a pretty tough sell entered the active 5/8 tool that allows for over 100 full-body workouts you might be thinking then how there's no actual weight there well it's based on the idea that instead of using a dead weight you can actually create just as much resistance by using your own body in a sense making one half of your body workout against the other half the active five when paired up with a phone creates a structure around this kind of exercise because it can measure how hard you're actually able to press against it it can turn the whole process into a game you'll be doing everything from pushing harder to stay over a line to sumo wrestling and the game's serve as a really cool way to distract you from the pain but also to push you harder next up the rather unfortunately named touch you like the gripper do you stick it onto the back of your phone but here if you lift one of the sides it snaps into a fern stand i've got to say cool concept but the stickiness of these pads is not hugely reassuring this one's pretty simple it is three useful things bundled together an alarm clock if you're still into the idea of not using your phone first thing in the morning a night light just bright enough to see your surroundings and a wireless charger for your phone it uses touch controls on the side and whilst i'm not personally a user of the traditional alarm clock if you were you can't go wrong here the all-round o is an all-in-one at charging cable pretty simple so i won't spend too long on this but on the main end you've got micro usb usb c and lightning for apple and then what's also cool is that it lets you convert the usb a port on the other end into a usb c port it's also coils to prevent tangling then we've got pics they call this the backpack for those who dare to be different it's a pretty normal back from most angles with a clean uninterrupted aesthetic and a good amount of space inside but the differentiator is this massive pixel display on the back which you can use to show everything from the time to a video game as with everything nowadays there's an app where you can choose designs from a library or create your own so this right here is the mr. who's the boss logo on my bag for the most part it's all a bit of fun most the things that allows you to do are not hugely beneficial but there are use cases i could see how having a glowing backpack might help with safety if you were say cycling at night there's no internal battery which keeps it light and spacious but it means that if you actually want to use this display you've got to have a power bank in there at all times it's a good product as long as you're clear that it's a toy not at all if you enjoyed this video there are a ton more in this series so i'm gonna link them from here and without being said my name is aaron if this is mister who's the boss and i'll catch you [music]
