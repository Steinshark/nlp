so you know that what i do mathematically speaking one of the things i like to do is i take numbers i square them and then i add another number to them right and then i do it over and over and over again and i see what happens so i'm going to tell you something about that today and we're going to start out with a really nice sort of not too tricky computationally example which is i'm going to take a number i'll call that number by the variable zen and i'm going to square it and then i'm going to subtract 1/2 okay so i take in a number i square it and i subtract 1/2 and then i repeat the process let's do an example right so the number i want to deal with here is zero so if i take zero and i square it and i subtract a half the next number i get is minus a half if i take that number and i square it i get one4 if then i subtract 1/2 i get minus a4 and then i don't know i get two-digit numbers i don't even want to write down so i'm interested in understanding what happens under iteration of this process to the number zero so if i draw the graph of this function i know sorry this feels like you're taking an exam if i draw the graph say y = x^2 - 12 so when x is zero i'm here and it's going to be shaped something like this and then i'm going to draw the line this line if you like graphing is the graph of the equation yal x okay you can just think of it as a line that's at 45degrees here to the horizontal so here's how we can visualize iterating zero under this process so we're going to start at zero we'll go down till we hit our graph and then we're going to turn left or right until we hit the line here's my line and then we're going to go up or down until we hit the graph here's my graph then we're going to go repeat the process so left or right till i hit the line up or down which down in this case i need to hit the graph left or right till i hit the line up or down till i hit the graph and i keep going with this process and you see that something interesting is happening that i'm getting closer and closer and closer these points are sort of spiraling in to some point that lives actually it's the point where these two things hit each other that lives on my graph so this is following the the iteration of zero under this process because what i'm doing at each step my sort of left and right up and down thing is replacing the output y as my new input x okay so that's why this is a graphical represent ation of iterating this function so the key feature here is that this minus 12 has the property that this process sends everything close to a single point okay so i've got one point here right there and as i do this process i get closer and closer and closer to that point okay let's do another one this one's going to be tricky if i don't draw this well then it's not going to be very convincing at all but let's try it instead of minus one2 we're going to square a number and then subtract 9 over 10 so this graph will look something like this okay so let's do this procedure again it's much nicer to do i know i'm drawing graphs why am i doing that it's much nicer to do this graphically because once i start actually writing down the numbers that i get i mean think about what happens so 0 goes to min - 9/10 but then i square it and then suddenly my denominator is 100 and then i square it again and suddenly my denominator is even bigger so these numbers get kind of bad really quickly so the graphical representation believe it or not is actually the simpler way to look at this so i'm going to take my point zero and let's do exactly the same thing so i've got zero and i'm going to go left or right till i hit the line up or down till i hit the graph left or right till i hit the line up or down till i hit the graph left or right till i hit the line up or down until i hit the graph actually what's going on here is we're going to keep sort of bouncing back and forth to sort of either side of the line here and instead of there being sort of a single point that we spiral into what happens is that there's two points here so sort of here and here that each of these get closer and closer to okay so two points for everything to get close to so one point for minus 1/2 and two points for 9/ 10 anytime you do this procedure where you take some value here say -2 or - 9/10 and you look at what happens to zero what happens is it's possible just like we saw in these examples that there is some sort of finite list of numbers or of points in the in the graphical picture where everything is sort of coming in towards one of those finite list of points okay so in minus one2 we saw the example of a single point here where everything gets close to that in minus 9/10 well i i sort of did my best but hopefully you believe that there are two separate points here and everything kind of comes in closer and closer to those two points it's possible to do this with more than two so in fact for any number that you want you can cook up a function like this so that you have sort of that number of points as your limit points so if this happens now i'm going to get sort of my usual thing here yay so if this happens for a number c that when you do this process to zero you get this finite list of points then you would say that c is hyperbolic if this list is finite okay that we iterate and iterate and iterate and we're getting closer and closer and closer to one of this finite collection of points on the graph and so here's a really basic question even allowing a computer how can i tell whether or not if you give me a number c it's hyperbolic okay now you might say well i've only shown you two examples and they were both hyperbolic so maybe they're all hyperbolic it turns out not to be true but what's actually happening here is notice the only way i could come up with to figure out that i had this sort of one point at the end of the process or two points at the end of the process was by iterating right i had to do it a bunch of times and see that things were getting close together and the funny thing is okay if you know that there's only one point you might end up at or two points you might end up at that's not hard to figure out whether or not it's true right you just start writing down the numbers and see if they get close to two points but if you don't know how many points there might be maybe there's a thousand points that everything gets close to how can you possibly tell whether or not the the process that you've got going on here the the parameter c that you're dealing with is actually hyperbolic the strange thing is we we truly don't know how to do this so for example something that we do not know at all is whether or not cal - 3es is hyperbolic right so you put in zero you square it and you subtract three halves and then you square that and you subtract three halves i don't do arithmetic in front of people you just keep going this way and we have no idea whether or not this picture has that feature that there's finitely many points that you end up with at the end of the day okay that you get closer and closer to and so the amazing thing is that this is this hyperbolic feature is actually part of one of the most important unknown questions in the entire field of this iterating functions thing that we call complex dynamics and it's secretly i've been hiding from you the mandal br atch i'll say remember i'll be impressed if anyone remembers the mandal br set is a picture it's a collection of complex numbers where c is in the mandal br set if when we iterate zero under this function z s+ c we don't get very large my drawings have not improved over time okay so we have this sort of complicated boundary behavior and it's this pretty picture including the inside of these pieces all right so the picture i just drew you i can actually relate back to this notion of hyperbolicity for example this big heart the main cardioid of the mandle broth set it's called these are precisely the values of c with the property that when you start doing this process to zero you get a single limiting point this disc which is next to the main cardioid is precisely the collection of values c so that when you do this process iterating zero you get two limit points and so these pieces inside the mandel br set they come from these hyperbolic values of c except we don't actually know if that's true so any drawing you can make of the mandal brat okay the pieces that you see do indeed come from these hyperbolic maps but it's actually an open question whether or not all of the interior pieces of the mandal br set come from hyperbolic maps like this so this is a question called density of hyperbolicity this open conjecture it seems so nice and easy up down left right look at what happens in the long term but not only do we not know this very fundamental question about the mandal bret about which maps are hyperbolic or not we don't even know for really basic examples like c equals minus 3 hales whether or not that single map is hyperbolic and so this very sort of pretty geometric feature that can be described so nicely is really still a mystery there's always new c quizzes and puzzles being added to brilliant these case studies have caught my eye recently how do you go viral on x or how do you top the charts on spotify in typical brilliant fashion this learning material is interactive you can play with it tweak it really get involved and it's fun it's chatty it's written for normal people like me who just want to get smarter who might not have all the technical knowhow but want to delve deeper into math computer science and science in general if you haven't seen brilliant yet go check it out today there's a free 30-day trial and the first 200 number five viewers who go to brilliant.org slumber file can also get 20% off the top premium subscription that's a great offer there'll be plenty of links in all the usual places this is fun this is clever our thanks to brilliant for supporting number file so this is the only one that we know of but we don't know if it's the only time it can possibly happen so what's really going on behind the scenes here has something to do with a particular set of numbers known as the mandal broth set sometimes it's got like how many arms is that seven arms sometimes it's got three arms sometimes it's got something else and sometimes it's just rubbing
