[music] okay so why am i sitting out here in the middle of the night in my best canadian clothing freezing on top of this big battery well it's cuz this video is all about remote power like how can you power a production away from the electrical grid if you know anything about the kind of work i do i do a lot of remote environment stuff so like i spent 120 days in the arctic this year the problem is film making gear is notoriously power hungry and so i'm always looking for tools that can help me stay out shooting longer oh you we're just standing down there's a skunk on our interview scene that would have been an amazing youtube moment if we just got skunk bombed with all this gear right before a big commercial shoot everything just smells like skunk and we've talked about a lot of batteries before on this channel from these usb banks that everybody knows about to slightly bigger ones like this that can power i don't know a drone maybe a handful of times to even bigger ones like this that can power a bunch of v mounts and maybe a few additional accessories keep you running for an extra day maybe today we're going to talk about really really big batteries specifically this 7 kow monster that i'm sitting on that should theoretically be able to charge a laptop like a 100 times or something like that but who really cares about charging a laptop 100 times that doesn't mean anything now what i want to know is how many days of production can i get out of a big battery like this so i'm just going to start plugging things in until we've got everything i would need to recharge at the end of a normal shooting day plugged in here and then we'll see how long it's actually poss to keep going off the grid but before we set up our charging station we need to be able to see what we're doing so the very first thing we're going to plug into this is a [music] [applause] light this is just an old photography backpack and it just happens to perfectly fit all the accessories you need to build these two lights out into little soft [music] boxes so then as a diffuser i'm going to use this china cube which just folds down flat but then pops out really easily and then you just stick it to the top of the cube with velcro so with these two tiny little things you can actually get a pretty nice glowing orb of light that you can use as a key light you can use it to illuminate spaces it's a really versatile lighting tool they've been using china balls in hollywood [music] forever hopefully it's not too bright yeah there we go now we can see everything that's happening in the area the light's not overpowering anything it's not bothering anybody or the neighbors or wherever you are but we have a nice soft glow over this whole area and now we can set up like a professional charging station and not worry about losing stuff in the dark we're about to start plugging stuff in here but i had to go inside and grab these gloves cuz it might not look like it but it is really cold here and that's actually one of the main reasons why i have have this battery this is a mango power e it's a company that reached out to me and asked if i'd be willing to try out some of their stuff and i'll be honest i get a ton of offers and this isn't a sponsored video so it's not like i'm getting paid to do this so it's quite a bit of work and i'm not accepting cash so i usually say no but this one was interesting for a couple reasons one it is much cheaper than the traditional large capacity batteries that i've seen before and also beyond that it has really impressive temperature ratings like this can go down to below -20 c and operate up to i think in the 50s so here in canada the extreme heat isn't such a big deal to me and i don't think i'm going to put this on a plane anytime soon but in other parts of the country minus 20 is really normal so having a battery that can keep charging and keep working at those temperatures is a big reason why i said yes to this one and why i'm making this video so it's january in toronto right now and even though there's no snow on the ground it is pretty chilly out so it'll be interesting to see if that makes any difference in how this thing performs so let's start plugging stuff in one by one sort of in order of how i would need to repower at the end of a shoot day and probably one of the first things that i would plug in is a computer honestly because one of the first things you're going to want to start doing at the end of a shoot is the backups cuz it can take a long time i'm actually going to plug it into a fast charger and instead maximize the ports all right so there we go one macbook pro theoretically backing up no significant change in the total life right now still showing over 52 hours so after you start the backups probably what you plug in next would be your main camera batteries this is a pretty high power thing actually so i wouldn't be surprised if the power consumption increases kind of dramatically after we plug this in one thing i like about this is this can also be used as a table and a seat so i think that's pretty cool okay so just as i suspected this made a massive dent in our total power time and we're down to around 23 hours that's still a lot of charging time considering in about 4 hours everything would be completely cycled through so you know 23 hours doesn't mean oh you can only last two days it means you can last you know seven 4h hour periods which is a lot of power that's not going to stay where it is though so let's keep plugging stuff in because that's not nearly enough to get me through okay next up we're going to plug in a triple charger for my dji mavic 3 drone i mean these days for doc dps or really a lot of small running gun teams operating drones is pretty much expected as part of the job so easily go through three drone batteries over the course of a shoot [music] day not a huge drop off honestly that's quite impressive i thought that was going to plummet but it's still kind of consistent so the dji remotes we'll plug that in next usually the dji remotes last a couple of days but let's just do it anyways okay let's follow that up with my bcam of choice which is the sony fx3 i would probably want to have two of these plugged in i would probably want to go through if i'm using it heavily maybe four of these batteries in a heavy shoot day actually the limiting thing here isn't so much the power up put so far it's the number of ports so i'm actually going to plug in this extra power bar okay for some more power i'm also going to plug in these usb chargeable cam tv batteries these are standard vlock batteries with a whole bunch of usb in and out ports and the reason i carry these around is they can work with all my accessories and lights i can power that light off them i can power my camera off them but they don't need a proprietary charger to work they just power off a usb so they're a little less you know bulky and power consuming so i brought two of these with me okay next we're going to recharge one of these small anchor batteries these things are great for just having on the field obviously this isn't something you're going to actively use during the day as you're shooting you leave this at your base camp or wherever or in your car and then you charge everything off of it so we'll plug that bad boy all right we're kind of running out of ports here and we actually need to wrap this up cuz there is light snow falling so we don't want to be out of here for too long but i'm just going to keep plugging in a couple more things i've got some gopro batteries i don't use gopros all that much but maybe if i was doing a sort of more remote environment shoot or something that involved a lot of vehicles i've got two okay these are good to aladdin lights they're sort of like bougie aperture mc's i mean honestly this is a lot of stuff i mean i guess yeah let's plug in my phone that makes sense probably at the end of a shoot day you'd want to charge up a phone so we'll do an iphone oh we have my old my old nemesis the ronin if you don't know what i'm talking about i love to make fun of these things but the truth is i actually use them a fair bit so we'll plug the ronin in as well okay so after plugging the last few things it did go down it's saying 12 hours of battery time left as some things charge faster and they get taken off the charge earlier the total power consumption is going to go down but it seems to me like 6 hours is a pretty generous amount of charge time for all this stuff if anything that might actually be three full charge cycles which means that you could theoretically arrive into a remote location with full batteries and this thing full as well and then shoot for three more nights totaling four days and three nights of shooting at a pretty professional standard and not worry about running out of power and on top of that you can recharge this as you go with solar panels mango sent me two of them as well obviously there's no point in getting them out right now but i'm really excited to check those out they're like really premium looking and i think they're actually going to recharge this at a pretty decent clip so who is something like this for well i could imagine people like me for example keeping this around the kind of thing that you keep in your garage or in my case in like a separate storage locker for gear where when you have that really big road trip or remote shoot it's the kind of thing that comes out one or two times a year but could really make shoots like my tree planting feature film last summer a whole lot easier the other type of person i could really see using something like this was someone who owned a a van like especially a production van this would be incredible it would mean you could not only drive to remote locations and have all your stuff in there but you could run power for yourself and probably an entire camera team if you needed to for a full day of heavy heavy production the downsides are that it is expensive even though it's much cheaper than some of the other options i've seen out there this is like several thousands of dollars you can go on the link in the description and see how much it costs at the moment at the time of recing it was a really good price i don't know what it'll be when you see this but check it out for yourself and the other problem is the weight this thing is probably close to 100 lb i don't know exactly what it weighs outside the box but it arrived at my house on a pallet so if you are looking for something that you can just sort of carry around in one hand it's not going to happen it's got a big burly handle on it and you're wheeling this thing or if you are carrying it by yourself it's for really short distances because it is heavy so one logical question you might have is how long does this thing take to charge because i thought it was going to be plugged in for days but actually it charges to 100% in like an hour and a half so if you're worried about it being plugged in forever don't be this thing is really really quick oh and also the battery has a 10-year warranty which is crazy for a new company so even though this is a new company to me the fact that there's a 10-year warranty on this battery might make you feel a little bit better about the steep price but i'm seriously impressed i don't know what i thought would happen in this test i didn't really know if it would be able to handle all this electronics plus there's a light on there right now like let's not forget that it's also actively powering a light with the amount of power draw on here now you could probably plug in several lights actively at the same time so like you could set up a charging station and be doing a remote interview with lights if you wanted to and actually speaking of lighting setups on external power i remember watching the andc video where they lit up like an entire forest using a big battery and i'm pretty sure it was quite a bit smaller than this one so there are a ton of creative possibilities if you're able to get your hands on a big battery like this so it's super cool link in the description all that if you want to go into more advanced professional things about how to run remote locations how to run backup programs how to set up complex lighting setups with different levels of gear my documentary cinematography course is opening again on march 4th so get on the waiting list if you're interested in that this video isn't for the course it was just for fun to see what's possible and as it turns out a lot is possible so see you guys next [music] time
