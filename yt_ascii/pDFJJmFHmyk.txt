you know one of the things i found really fascinating about generally sales and marketing is that people are so afraid of rejection and yeah and i think it's selfish i think it's really selfish to be afraid of that rejection because if you believe in what you're selling then you have to ask yourself is my 30 seconds of rejection feeling more important to me than the pain i might be resolving for this person over the next few decades of their life oh [music] hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with serial entrepreneur and public speaker eric ed meads we discuss this early experiences with homelessness the extent and detriment of alcoholism and illness that preoccupied his father the changes you can make to restructure your physiological responses right especially to fear the relationship between trust and sales and marketing general communication and the world of possibility that opens up to you if you embrace the unknown the potentially dangerous and above all that which calls to you so we met mexico yeah puebla right we were there for their festival of ideas yeah right we went to an old library afterwards which was very cool it was the oldest library i think in north america i think in all the americas yeah it was super cool building you know what was fascinating is that they had no electricity in there and no climate control and millions of dollars and more than money the value of all those books but the building was built like well enough to do the climate control the humidity control in the 1500s yeah fascinating yeah yeah that's for sure that was a good trip that was a cool city and a good festival yeah yeah so i was looking at your biography today i figured we might as well walk through it it said let's start with this well living in canada your family was you were born into an apartheid era south africa and then immigrated with your family to canada but he said well living in canada your childhood quickly became what can only be described as a roller coat of experience roller coaster ride of experience including a period of homelessness in northern canada at the vulnerable age of 15. northern canada is not a good place to be homeless actually i would i would put to you and i think you'll you'll be with me on this it's a great place to be homeless because it it forces resolution very quickly so what happened at 15. you know my my dad and my mom split up when i was very young and and it was a very good thing they did in my dad was at that stage having a let's say an irresponsible relationship with alcohol and and so they had split up and then he'd sobered up and my mom and i had a disagreement a teenage disagreement at some stage that resulted in me rebelling and going to live with my father and so off to you know to live with my father after all these years i'll finally get to live with my father and then he found this rebellious teenager very difficult to live with in his two-bedroom apartment and sent me to boarding school and the boarding school that i went to was one of the greatest gifts of my life but it was also very demanding like you know at 13 years old we trained to do a snowshoe race and it was a 26 mile snowshoe race we're 13. it's not a relay race it's 26 actual miles snowshoes are very difficult very heavy and it's minus 40 outside completely different gate yeah it's a very different thing and that's just a sample of what was tough there but the bigger thing that was going on at the school is the school was beginning to wake up to the realities of being in canada you know they used corporal punishment and and and you know very harsh winter programs and they were starting to get a lot of flack for being too hard on kids and so the school was trying to transition to be more acceptable i suppose and during that transition my class in particular was in the wrong space we got the we got the worst of both sides of that and so halfway through grade 10 i made the decision to leave to leave the school and my dad disagreed with this decision quite quite heavily and but as i actually you know control my body they were not able to get my body to the school and i i i just refused to go and then my dad refused to let me just stay in his home and so my response to that was to walk out the door into edmonton and i was 15 years old and it's funny about a week later my dad track me down wherever i was in the city and and he he told me that i had apparently won a two thousand dollar this is a long time ago that's a lot of money two thousand dollar bursary or anniversary for leadership skills or something the school had acknowledged me for and he never told me that before i don't know how they you know that had slipped his mind in my i mean it might have been good to know at the beginning of the year but at that point he he offered me 500 in cash if i would go back to the school and the other fifteen hundred dollars of my bursary he would give me in cash once i finished grade 10. and this was in what year 1986. right so this is about equivalent of about ten thousand dollars yeah it's a lot of money and i said no i said no i i i had strong conviction principles about why i didn't want to go back and and and i would put to you that had it been summer or had it been los angeles and had it been easy to be homeless then i don't know what would have happened i don't know what direction i would have gone in but that wasn't a possibility it was minus 20 minus 30 sometimes minus 40. like i i had to be smarter than that so at first i you know a little bit of couchsurfing where until my friend's parents ran out of patience with that yeah and then one day there was a video arcade called games people play and not inside in in in near the university of alberta and i and one of my friends dad ran the place and and i walked up to him one day and i can't imagine i was 15 and i must have looked 13 or 12. i was a kid and i walked up to and i said you look really tired and he goes i am and i said i can fix that for you and he goes what do you mean and i go well i you know i think part of your tiredness is you're here opening this place for us for at 10 in the morning and then you're here closing it for us at three in the morning or something so and he goes i'm not hiring anybody and i said i'm not looking for a job i said but if you let me sleep in here at night if you let me sleep in here at night i will take over for you at say six in the evening so you can have dinner with your family and i'll keep the place running smooth and i'll close it for you three and you don't have to pay me and as he had no problem with violating the child welfare you know the laws he and i agreed to that deal and that was you know the beginning of my sort of emancipation it's the beginning of my saying i'm responsible for my existence and i did that until for several months until so that deal worked out that deal worked out really well i you know how did you manage to maintain order in the arcade you know it was it was an interesting thing as a kid you know back then you had to pay for video games you know not like now you know to actually put money in the machines but if you had the keys to the machines you didn't have to do that and so i i played a lot of video games you know it kind of was very distracting and i have to say that as computers came out i was in that generation we only really got computers in like grade 12. so we were that generation that was like going to be left behind but i wasn't left behind because i had been like kind of one with the computers like when video games and computers the same thing the logic is the same so that time was very very useful to me later in my life because i was never afraid of computers i was never afraid of ai for example i i've been playing it since i was a kid well that's a good point i i'm i'm afraid of it but willing also to use it not if you if you were 15 and you look 13 what did the other kids that were in the arcade listen to you at night like that's what i was thinking about in terms of order it's funny nobody's ever asked me that before but i can tell you my school gave me a two thousand dollar bursary for leadership skills maybe there was something inherent maybe there was there was something i mean i had a lot of respect with my friends at that stage oddly i was the relationship council counselor for everybody if somebody liked somebody or their relationship i couldn't i had no understanding of of women girls in my life i had no for me i couldn't do it but i was very good at handling that kind of stuff for other people so i think that i had a sort of like coach attitude anyway and so yeah i i had the respect i see i see well let's go right back to the beginning your family moved to canada from south africa in the 70s yeah and how old were you i became canadian at eight we kind of went back and forth a few times before i finally became assistant and do you have any memories of south africa oh yeah and i mean i i feel in many ways i feel just as much south african as i do canadian i i've maintained a very my family's been in south africa they were wagon train people we're talking fourth records like they were original south african settlers so i have a very strong attachment to the country and very strong memories from childhood and beyond my my mother's grand my grandmother's grandfather was the minister in parliament in in the i think it's called foxcrad but he was the minister in paul kruger's cabinet that proposed the formation of the kruger national park which is in my mind one one of the most important pieces of land on the planet and on the other side my my dad's great-grandfather tf dreyer was the archaeologist who discovered the floor spad skull which is until very recently the oldest homo sapiens skull ever found so i i had a very deep deep history there right right right so why did your family move to canada you know you know it's a funny thing my my grandmother had this little dog a little schnauzer type thing and it was the most racist little dog you can imagine like it was terrible you know you'd go to the gas station and the guys would come to fill up the gas station and they were of course black and they would fill up the car and this is apartheid era south africa and the dog would go ballistic but can you blame the dog i mean is it the dog's fault that it's a racist no it's not i mean it was raised that way it was simply picking up on the fears and racism and that my grandparents had in their life so then that always made me question because my grandfather was a racist like a serious racist he wasn't a white supremacist he had an order of things but he was clearly racist but is that his fault if it's not the dog's fault is it his fault maybe not he was brought up that way but for some reason my parents they didn't like it they saw it they didn't like it they were opposed to it and and they they became involved in the anc and and my dad was studying law at vitz university and he became an anthropologist do you know he he really wanted to be because of his grandfather but his parents were insistent then he went to law school so he went to vets and then he went to mcgill here in montreal and then he went then he went to dao and taught law as a professor at dalhousie in halifax but underneath it all what he really wanted to do was sciences and so when he finally kind of left the law that's when i gave you a copy of this i wrote this book yeah book i forgot about it very good book yeah that book details out the what would you say the depredations of human beings over about a fifteen thousand year period the fact that we were integrally involved with the disappearance disappearance of megafauna yeah everywhere around the world but particularly in the western hemisphere right where animals hadn't adapted to the presence of human predators because there's a huge collapse of megafauna species about 15 between 15 000 and 10 000 years ago in in the western hemisphere which pretty much corresponds with the arrival of two-legged hunters right who took everything the mammoths the base the big mammals the after having got rid gotten rid of the giant tortoises your your father writes about that very good book by the way yeah i enjoyed i enjoyed reading i'm glad i thought you would like it it's funny about a week after megafauna i think it's that's right that's right yeah megafuna.com incidentally yeah yeah well and for people who are watching listening if you're interested in such things megaphone is an extremely interesting book it's a jaunt through prehistory on the biological side but also an analysis of the relationship between human hunting capacity and our particular ecological niche which is well you might say which is stunningly effective hunter because we hunt together in groups and virtually no animal all animals had evolved all sorts of protective organisms in relationship to other animals but none of those were particularly useful against human beings well you know it's interesting sometimes when people debate the megaphone extinction human hunting kind of thing they're like but then why are there still megaphone in africa yeah and it doesn't make sense if humans started there but it's exactly that because they they were the frog in the hot water humans evolved that innovative capacity in africa those animals have natural fear avoidance of elephants in africa if you're i've spent a lot of time in africa if you're walking in the bush as i've done many times and i i came for example once walking down into a riverbed and there are 14 lions sitting in the river well those lions they're afraid of you grizzlies are not afraid of you right right you know if a grizzly is afraid of you it's because it learned it in its consciousness in its experience of humans but it doesn't have that dna thing and and so that book has actually been a big part of even my journey because you know my my sort of quest into say health and nutrition that kind of stuff really stem from my dad's fascinating with human human history so that book that's been a good did you establish a good relationship with your father after having things how long did that take after after the the events of your of your adolescence you know you know a very slowly and very quickly you know it it was one of those things it would happen in fits and starts i mean in one sense it was never really that bad it was just brutally honest you know it was it was not it was not i mean i i would say that you know during his when they i think in alcoholism we talk about a practicing alcoholic i'm like i don't know what they're practicing they think it's good enough at that already but during that window i would say that at that time there would have been say you know language or or behavior that you might have thought of as abusive but then after that the discord between us i wouldn't have called it abusive i just would have called it direct it was like we we would disagree on things and strongly and we had our opinions and but we still had respect you know a lot of respect and so that was very easy for us to to rebuild a friendship upon and so we've we've been very close pretty much ever since even even in the month when i went back to him at now 16 i had turned 16 i went to him and i said look i think you get at this point you're not going to win this i'm not going back to school but if you don't let me move back in with you the school will not let me go to school they wouldn't let me go to school without a parent signing off on something actually i was just shy of my 16th birthday and if i waited any longer i'd lose that whole academic year and he found my argument convincing and allowed me to move back in and sign my school paperwork and let me finish grade 10 and despite having missed you know despite missing three months of that year or four months of that so did you go back to school at that not at that school and i did finish that and pretty much from that point on my dad and i you know began rebuilding that relationship but i'd say that relationship was forged by my dad taking us on you know canoe trips in and unlock lorange and and you know it's taking us up to yellowknife and and taking us into into the wilderness i think that even those things formed the the foundation of why we're we have the relationship even we have today okay so let's go back to when you're eight you said that that was when you became a canadian citizen okay so what is your family doing in canada at that point if your dad is in in the legal business yeah then and your mom my mom at that stage she was really a mom and then she wanted to go and finish her own education so she went to dell as well she went to dao and did a master's in social work so i had my dad the at that point practicing alcoholic lawyer or law professor and my mom these you know studying social work but going back to citizenship that was kind of interesting because you see my brother sponsored us for our citizenship ultimately because he was we we apparently we snuck my pregnant mother into the country and she versed my brother in montreal and so on that basis we then made our bid for canadian citizenship and i have vague memories of this but i know the family story we're facing the judge you know we at that i don't know how it works these days but you actually had to prove that you knew some things about canada and so the judge is asking my dad a bunch of questions trivia questions about canada do you guys are you guys really here and he says to my dad how many provinces are there in canada and my dad says nine and the judge goes and the judge it turned out the judge is a frequency or not afrikaans he's from south africa but he's british and we're afrikaans for boers turns out that our relatives would have fired at each other in the boer were so weird you know two generations later he's swearing us in for citizenship in a new country anyway so he says to my dad i'm going to let you take another shot at that question and my dad goes well and this is 1978 not too long after the flq and all that stuff that was happening in early canada and my dad goes well fine 10 if you want to count quebec but it doesn't seem like they want to be here which set up a really fun conversation the the exam was over and we were welcomed into the country yeah so so you're now your father was a law professor where at down at dale and what what branch of law did he teach about and practice i a product liability i think was a big part of where he went and then after that he practiced a lot in contract law employment law that sort of stuff and when he when he went into practice after after sobering up and so forth then he mostly worked in in you know business structuring contract law employment law that sort of thing and you're where was your parents relationship when you were about eight at that time was it starting to shake already yeah yeah and was that alcohol related it was yeah yeah my my dad my dad says there were two causes of his alcoholism one was that my mother used to like to wash her hair with beer you know as the tradition was and she would only ever use half a beer he had to finish the other house so he likes to blame her for that and adam and eve type situation but the but i think the the real uh cause was that time you know at 20 something years old being asked to teach law in a branch of law he didn't learn despite graduating first in his class was stressful for him and he found that again half a beer would take the edge off before his lectures yeah well alcohol is an extraordinarily pernicious drug and if you're inclined towards it you can be inclined towards it because you're sensitive to its anxiety reducing properties or you can be sensitive to it because it enhances social communication or because it produces a cycle motor high like cocaine or all of those at once and if you're particularly predisposed to alcoholism you can experience all three at once i had a friend in montreal frank irvin great old guy looked like ernest hemingway he had a monkey farm on saint kitts and him and his his woman roberta oh i can't remember roberta's last name she was quite a piece of work too a real cool person they had this monkey ranch on saint kitts and they used to go down there and study the effects of alcohol on green monkeys which five percent of whom would drink tacoma on first exposure and they had videotapes of these damn monkeys drinking and it looked like a frat party you know and about five percent of them on first exposure would drink tacoma and those were the monkeys that had a biological predisposition to alcohol to alcoholism and alcohol is a really bad drug you know it's 50 percent of murders take place in an alcohol-fueled environment either the victim or the perpetrator or both is drunk it's it's almost the sole cause of domestic abuse it's almost the sole cause of so-called date rape if you dig into criminal behavior deeply enough well hell you don't have to dig much at all before you find alcohol it's also the only drug we know that actually makes people more aggressive and not not merely because they're not merely because they don't know what they're doing we did experiments at mcgill showing that if you took drunk people and put them in a competitive environment where they could be aggressive and had them keep track of their aggression so they were actually conscious of it they became more aggressive even rather than less so yeah alcohol's bad news and it can turn perfectly good people into into quite the quite the impulsive and dim-witted monsters so well if you give people that massive boost of sugar and then suppress their inhibitions yeah that's gonna happen i was 21 years old in prince george and i had a night like that and i i mean it wasn't terrible i just woke up in the morning you know praying at the porcelain altar i was making that deal with god if you just make me feel better i'll i'll stop this yeah do it anymore and and then i didn't uh-huh i haven't had alcohol since oh really since you were 21. i quit the drinking when i was 27 you know i mean northern albertan culture was pretty damn hard drinking culture like most northern places and a lot number of my friends ended up alcoholic you know and and well all the people that i was in high school with and in college with were extremely hard drinkers and i drank quite a lot till i was 27 and then i found that i couldn't well first of all my life was taking a pretty professional turn and second i found that there was no bloody way i could write seriously and think seriously on an ongoing basis if i was hungover so and i got married and and i was going to have kids and i thought yeah enough of this and so i i had a bit of i i thought when i was 50 that i might be able to drink again socially and i toyed with it for about a year and found out that i was probably just as stupid at 50 as i had been like 25 and decided to dispense with that as to that too which was definitely you know i've watched too as i've gone around the world i've i've met very very many people in many many social occasions and i because i don't drink anything at all now if i go out and watch people drinking it makes everybody stupid and fuzzy minded and you know the problem is is when you're drinking you think you're cool but you know you have those same delusions that that homer simpson's friend barney had when he was drinking that you're this kind of you know elegant and and sophisticated comedian and it just makes everybody stupid i would argue that the real problem is that it does that yeah well that's the first drink does that my dad tells this you know he's he i hope i get the family story right but he's a kid of 17 or' and he's kind of struggling at that point with school and he goes to a family function and he's got that one uncle who's a real jerk yeah and the uncle pins him down at the dining room table and he says to him he goes so baz are your grades a function of your inability to commit to work or are you just stupid and it was such a nasty question and my dad immediately you know he blushed and you know people who blush know that they're blushing and then that causes more blessing which of course causes the eye watering and he just it was a devastating moment for him and then about two weeks later he and his dad are sitting and his dad and unfortunately was it was an alcoholic and you know didn't live there very long as a consequence but they're sitting on the on the deck having a little bit of a beer and then he goes in and and and uncle does the same thing so we solved a great mystery are you stupid or lazy and my dad did not blush and my dad said you know i would entertain your question if i thought there was any sincerity in all of us i recognize that it's just through your own smallness you're attempting to hurt me i'm gonna let it go and then at that point my dad's like it's socially responsible not to go out without at least a beer aha right right right right yeah yeah well it definitely it definitely is a con confidence enhancing substances especially sensitive to that damn right it's an illusion yeah it it you know when i say that as someone who quite enjoyed drinking i mean i had quite the blast as a consequence of it but i also noticed that especially when i was in montreal and starting to grow up let's say and and take on serious responsibilities that every time i had done something or said something that i regretted it was when i was drinking and i thought at one point maybe i don't want to live a life where i'm continually or even sporadically wishing that i hadn't said or done something you know and i'm very much unlikely to do that if i'm sober and clear-headed that's exactly what happened to me in prince george it was exactly that conversation with myself and initially i decided six months off and i just never went back to it yeah yeah yeah well you know the other thing i think that happened too is i started drinking when i was pretty young like 14 you know and i i had a certain degree of social anxiety i mean i'm very extroverted but well i think everybody has a certain degree of social anxiety when they're like 14 because like what the hell do you know you know and that's probably exacerbated around girls and that alcohol because it enhances sociability and also suppresses anxiety is a good social anxiety medication but the problem is is you don't learn how to conduct yourself as a sober individual in social circumstances and you learn very rapidly to rely on the alcohol not only as a social lubricant but as the basis of your social behavior and i would say you know to young people who are watching listening that's a stupid plan you should learn how to be in a social group with others when you're sober so that you bloody well know how to do it especially if you're planning to do anything even vaguely serious and responsible with your life which is you know probably something you should be doing a good friend of mine exactly my age within within a few months i quit at 21 he quit at 31 and we were both 34 or 35 we were out with some friends and we're dancing and having fun and i'm just me and i'm actually more introverted so i'm not super outgoing but i'm still having a great time i'm dancing i'm having fun and and he comes up to me goes how do you do that he goes i don't i can't do that now without the alcohol because i learned to do it with out the alcohol in a world filled with uncertainties it's crucial to be ready for whatever comes your way whether it's a natural disaster a sudden emergency or unforeseen circumstances

let's prepare with peterson.com yeah definitely yeah there's definitely something to that yeah well i found that social occasions were somewhat awkward and and also yeah i would say also that i didn't exactly know what to do without that false camaraderie that alcohol produces and that inflation of confidence and and extroversion as well yeah not not a wise developmental strategy all things considered all right so we're back to when you're eight and now you're a canadian okay so so walk so you're you're not in boarding school at that point and no where are you living halifax nova scotia in halifax yeah how long were you guys in on the east coast i you know i think i left there to go live with my dad at late 12. you know so what was happening with you and your mom and did you idealize the idea of going off to live with your dad i did i did i mean the problem with split families say yeah he'd silvered up and and i didn't get to see him very often maybe once or twice a year he would come out to the east and and and you know my dad i i i i i would say that you know they said i read this thing once that you kind of like sort of typecast yourself or you or you model your personality a little bit on the people that you most admired at the age of say seven eight nine ten yeah you know for me that admiration is four that's that's mirror neurons admiration i'm watching man you bet and so for me it was like a weird combination of like indiana jones and han solo and hogan from hogan's heroes and my dad who encapsulated all of those people and so when he sobered up and became safe and the idea that of going to live with him was possible yeah ideal i idealized the idea of it and of course was at what age that was at 12 like 12 maybe just turning 13. yeah well you know it's a real open question exactly when boys and girls as well for that matter really most need their fathers you know and if your father is a target of emulation it might well be that you most need them especially when you're a boy about the time that you hit puberty and i think part of the reason for that i remember when i lived in montreal there was this kid that lived down the street we lived in poor areas in montreal and there was this kid that lived down the street one of the places we live who who was the son of a single mother she was about 5'4 and he was about six feet tall and he was 14. you know and he was out tromping around the streets in montreal causing trouble and we used to hear his mother we didn't know them we used to hear them you know fighting in the hallway for example and like what the hell could she do about it you know he was six feet tall yeah you know short of telling him to get the hell out and then potentially enforcing that with the police he had her cornered you know for all intents and purposes especially when he had his little gang of friends yeah you know his mother wasn't going to be able to do a damn thing and so you know it it might well be that when you are around 12 and you're a boy especially if you're you know temperamentally inclined to some degree to to be challenging that that's exactly the right time for you to have a father who can step on you around i know that there's some evidence among elephants for example that the older males socialize the younger males and that when when human wildlife curators have attempted to reformulate elephant societies which are extraordinarily complex the young males rampage around like mad unless there are older males to keep them in line there's a very good example of that that you know culling of elephants is a unfortunate necessity if you put elephants into the career national park without the saber-toothed cats that used to hunt them they breed like crazy they breed at a rate of about 12 per year so then they destroy all the trees and you know so then the wwf comes along and says we'll pay you not to shoot your elephants which is to say we'll pay you to let all your trees get destroyed right right so of course they do have to shoot the elephants and it's a terrible thing and so they've tried different mechanisms and they one way that they used to do it was to go in and take out the oldest members right the the the the dominant males and and and and so on but what happened as a result of that is they left young uncultured elephants yeah and those elephants would rampage they would attack cars they they had never been taught and and so i think it is a really good example of the wisdom of elders even in the animal kingdom being very important especially in those complex i mean elephants are unbelievably intelligent yeah and they have a prehensile trunk right and anything that has a prehensile attachment tends to be extraordinarily intelligent like octopuses for example only live three years something like that but appear to be at least as smart as dogs which is you know pretty damn smart and and with that increased intelligence comes a necessity for deeper socialization and then the necessity for something like a continuous historical tradition yeah because with all that additional brain expanse that environmental specific programming that's associated with socialization starts to become increasingly crucial you see that too even if you have a particularly smart breed of dog like it's great to have a smart dog but a smart untrained dog is a really bad dog yeah a stupid untrained dog just lays there like a stupid dog and you know who cares but i always say if you especially if you're a smart breed border collies that's right you have them if you're not training them yeah yeah well that's the thing about it they're training you you have to be smarter than the dog and that's not always that easy yeah yeah yeah well that's also the case if you have a particularly pushy child and they can be socialized very well but this this you know this question of the role of the the father i i actually i think that there's there's two distinct phases at least it feels like to me there's the there's the the contrast between the nurturing mother energy and the disciplinary you know sort of structured father energy and i think that that even has to be their say sub three years old yeah and i was lucky i had that you know it may have been better it could have been better but but i had it but then there does enter that next phase which is where it's not now about boundaries it's not now about discipline but it is about modeling it's about and and i was lucky that while i lost my dad for some time i kind of lost it right in the middle and got it back right at the point that it was necessary again yeah well that maternal love is a kind of all-encompassing acceptance and that's precisely necessary in early infancy where the infant can do no wrong and the paternal role is more like boundary setting and encouragement jointly together and it it you know that seems somewhat paradoxical that you can encourage people by setting boundaries but but the thing about encouragement is it's goal directed and it means that you have to be on the pathway to genuine success and pathways have boundaries so so all right so you're in the normal school system i presume at this time yes and this is in halifax and then you do move to go live with your dad and how long do you live with your dad and when do you when do you start this alternative this this boarding school i'm with him for about half a year before he sent me i think i finished grade seven with him i started grade seven with my mom finished grade seven with my dad and then he put me for grade eight into the so 13. okay okay now you said it was more difficult for you to live with him and vice versa than you guys had presupposed and so you're seven and you're 13 and so what makes you hard to get along with you know rebellion you know tell me to be home at 10 and i'm not gonna be you know i i don't know what was going on but i was in real active rebellion and i'm sure i was rebelling against the divorce i was rebelling against alcoholism what about your friendship no i mean i when i was 13 you know my friends i know like i said i grew up in a small northern town and it was kind of a rough working-class town and there weren't all my friends were rough working-class kids hilarious people extremely good senses of humor most of them with fairly damaged relationships with their father a lot of drinking a fair bit of misbehavior although nothing particularly serious you know like we weren't we weren't criminal gangs or anything like that but there was a fair bit of petty shoplifting and an awful lot of drinking and carousing after hours and my relationship with my dad became somewhat fractured at that point too and i was a smaller kid and intellectual and i probably overcompensated to some degree on that part by hanging around with the rougher kids yeah you know which which i actually think was a pretty damn good strategy it served me well all things considered but was part of my relationship with my with my father who didn't necessarily approve of my friends and and shouldn't have quite frankly you know i think he was probably right i probably thought he was right then even you know that didn't mean you were going to listen well you know what the hell are you gonna do you know if you have any sense when you're 13 and this is the whole issue about being a teenager is that your your ability to fit in with your peer group is a predictor of your success in your life you're going to prioritize fitting in with your peer group over everything else and you know the whole point of parenthood in some real sense is to produce a child who's acceptable to his or her peers because well for obvious reasons and so there is that tension and then of course the other thing you're trying to do when you're 13 is to start pushing the boundaries with regards to independence anyways you're doing that apparently what were your friends like when you were 13. they were exactly you're not my parallels are pretty clear i was i was hanging around with a bunch of people and by the way i still can i some of them write to me on facebook these days even from back then you know and and sorry guys but you were unacceptable but they're unacceptable but there was a camaraderie and and it was exactly that i had a peer group and and and it just made sense that that i fit in there and that and and i felt accepted there and and rebellion you know so that was in edmonton that was in edmond so and you'd move from halifax edmonton was a bigger city much bigger city right so more opportunity to get in trouble too lots more trouble yeah you know there was a moment there and it was a very big growing up moment for me and i think it has a lot to do with the transition from being bullied to no longer being bullied and so first of all when i was a very small child i was five or six years old my babysitter judy park she she she disappeared and i had a big crush on her so her disappearing was a big thing in my life and about three months later they found her and she'd been killed and and her her murder has never been solved you know it's one of those things but clifford olson i'm sure you remember oh yes he took credit for it i think because he had a cast for he had a cash for locations program so he was he took credit for it but then it turned out it had nothing to do with him but this was in my awareness that's a crooked manny it was crooked it was to be a serial killer who will also go to the lengths of of confessing to murders he didn't commit well they were paying him for body locations i mean it's christ that's a whole nother thing but i grew up with that in my awareness and and and so here i was in edmonton and one night and i lived in a a actually the part that i'd left out is after my dad and i reconciled he moved to vancouver and he left me there so i was still living on my own but at least now in an apartment and one night i was walking home i'd missed my last bus it's three in the morning and i was walking home and i had to walk about three kilometers and it was this is in east edmonton it's not the safest area in the world and i'm going up through the alleys because i i it's longer to go on the lit street so i just take the alley route and this car pulls up beside me slowly and there's a guy in the car doing unacceptable things to himself while watching me as he walks oh yeah fun and the first thing i did is i went to my back pocket because it was like routine for me to have a switch later or a butterfly knife but i had just been out with some friends at a club that have metal detectors so i didn't have one so i'm walking down the street and this guy beside me and i'm freaking out and i've grown up with this awareness right like there's we all come to that point where you realize life is actually not permanent and i and i that was fix it for me so i was very aware of this situation the guy kept circling around a bunch of times and as i got closer to my house i didn't want him to see where i lived i live on my own i'm 15 years old 16 years old so i go into the school ground behind because it was flood lit like crazy to keep all the druggies out and stuff so i go into the school ground and i climb up the spiral slide because i figure if i get to the top of the spiral slide i'm safe like there's no way he can get up there without coming up face first right right so i just climb up there flood lit and plus there's apartment buildings on all sides of me so there's witnesses right like i'm in the safest possible place i could be at three o'clock in the morning and he pulls into the school parking lot i could and he sat there for quite a while and then he opened his car door and i i don't i it's all so vivid to me like i i i the car was yellow i that's a long memory to hold on to but and he walked across the grass and as he walked across the grass i contemplated what was going on and i made a very clear decision i'm going to kill him like i'm i'm not i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm just i have no choice if he comes up the ladder then i'm gonna i'm gonna kick him across the bridge of the nose and when he falls i'm gonna jump on him and keep jumping until it's over i'm done i'm done i'm so scared and and and he came right to the bottom of the ladder and he put one foot on the ladder put one hand on the rail and he looked up to me he goes are you looking for company and i'll save the actual vernacular that i used for him at that moment but i was unkind yeah and he turned around he walked back to his car and he sat in his car for three hours and i stayed at the top of the slide for three hours and i did not come down and then eventually that's a learning moment learn and you know but the weirdest thing is i was never bullied after that ever again what changed i was willing to stand up for myself physically i i just yeah so but what do you think changed like you said you weren't bullied did that means you were signaling in a different manner right yeah see i saw this in my clients sometimes as a clinician i would see them integrate their shadow let's say and one of the things i really noticed you can actually see this by the way portrayed in the movie the lion king it's very interesting because simba when he's an adolescent like a child in an adolescent animated has a facial expression sort of like this right it's like everything's coming in he's like a deer in the headlight say then he has this initiation experience where he realizes his affinity with his father and who's and his father has a very commanding visage a very commanding face very differently animated and these of course disney level animators are bloody geniuses so they capture these things and the animators flip simba's facial configuration at that point so that there's a a setness and a harshness to the way that he looks at the world it's as if he's coming out instead of things coming in right he's got a command to him and i'm wondering if that experience that you had restructured the physiognomy of your expression posture yeah posture facial expression and reaction eye contact yeah and reaction you know many years ago and this i i read this article and it set the foundation for almost all the work that i do today and it was like it influences everything i do and it was an article about two women who were sexually assaulted in central park around about the same time and this investigative journalist followed them after it happened the recovery and what their lives were like after them the one woman they they both went through it and of course there's a horrible truth about sexual assault is that once you've been sexually assaulted once you are significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted again yeah and that's because the kind of people who commit those crimes are spineless you know wimpy they go after the weak and so if you yeah they're predators no they're not even they're the wrong predator almost is complementary they're they're worse they're they're scavengers but yeah well that's the parasite element yeah and so they they in any event they both learned this fact that once you've you know because in the clinics in the in the shelters they tell them these things you have to be careful because it you know now it might happen again the one woman hears that news and the meaning she creates is i am now even more of a victim than i was before yeah and she turns to you know a prescription and non-prescription medication and suicide attempts and it ruins their whole life right right so that's the anxiety route the the other woman she she said well why why are you yeah attack the second time it's because you're displaying fear fear so she went to a self-defense class and she learned some useful things like a credit card held in the right way swiped across the throat can accurately cut it and keys held between the knuckles are an incredibly effective weapon and she learned these things yeah and she started walking down the street differently and yeah in one example she was out with some friends and they're like would you would you like us to would you like us to walk you to your car yeah yeah what happened yeah yeah right right you know and she's like no i don't want you to walk me to my car i will walk myself to my car yeah and pretty soon her friends were like would you walk me to my car right right so she starts a self-defense clinic it gets franchised and and she you know she opens a few of them and she hears the telling moment in the interview the the the interviewer says to her if you could go back in time and prevent your own rape would you do that she says no i am significantly more afraid of the woman that i was before it happened than i am of the event itself yeah right and i i when i read that i thought about what those parasitical predatory types you know especially with regards to predation on children as they look for children who are uncertain and easily cowed and so that's another thing for everyone watching and listening to know if you teach your children to be afraid as their fundamental response to the world you are enabling the people who prey on them because the people who do that will watch and they target their children they think they can intimidate into silence yeah yeah so so that that trembling like a rabbit in the in the evil serpent die of the predator that's a very bad strategy for human beings because we're not rabbits and we don't use background camouflage as our defense yeah yeah it's that it's that calling out of aggression that's the right response to predation now it's interesting you know that you said that you weren't bullied again after that eh yeah yeah that's very that's a very interesting transformation all right so now your father has gone off to vancouver and left you to live alone yeah and so and near how old 16 16 and so when do you go off to boarding school that it was i left boarding school that resulted in my dad leaving and right so that was before that then right i finished grade 10 in edmonton and then i moved back to live with my mother and finished high school in halifax and and how did it go when you moved back to your mother much better you know we still had conflict my mom i think you know it was one of those like one of her ways of gaining connection was with raised voices so we would have raised voices and my and my brother wouldn't engage in that stuff so i was the favorite for that but she and i i we were always very close but it was it was a lot of tension and she then her parents are getting older and she wanted to move back to south africa so when i was' my mom's like i'm going back to south africa and i'm taking your little brother with me and you're staying here and that was that that was the beginning of adulthood for me properly' years old yeah but you were figuring it out pretty independent pretty yeah she wasn't worried about me yeah yeah right right and so why did you get along with her better once you moved back to halifax yeah you know i i i i'd grown up and she'd grown up you know it's it's one of those things you you i remember sitting in the guidance counselor's office of my one of my schools and i saw the poster on the wall that says kids you know move out now while you still know everything you know and it's amazing that once you know some things you realize how much your parents have learned in the meantime yeah yeah yeah yeah that's for sure that's for sure all right so now you're this is when this is what year that's like 88th 88. now you it says here in in your bio you're very entrepreneurial as a child selling lemonade in front of your house shoveling snow and raking leaves you got your first professional job in 91 when we became the first full-time employee of rice x so now you're done high school do you go off to college no you know i fell into a i fell into some strange things at that time in canada like for example i was in an industrial accident and i lost i nearly lost this hand in the fire and i was pumping gas at petro canada on bayers road and halifax and my shift boss flicked lighter at me when i had gas all over me and it was pretty bad they had to take the skin off my legs to rebuild my arm and i i lost a bunch of grade 12 as a result of that and then of course because of the way things work sometimes or don't work with government i didn't qualify for i couldn't sue the employer because of the workers compensation act and i couldn't qualify for works compensation payment because i was unemployable because i was in high school that's why i literally got not one dollar or anything i missed all that time work school and so i missed a few credits so at the end of grade 12 i've i'm shy a bunch of credits and i'm trying to figure out how to get to university but now i run into shy of the credits you needed to be accepted yeah like i was missing one credit or 1.5 credits or something and that was fixable over summer school but in the meantime i'm trying to figure out university entrance and here's the tricky part in canada i don't know how it is these days i haven't lived here for a long time now but if you if your parents earned over a certain threshold you couldn't get student loans you couldn't get student funding at that stage my parents traditionally not earned that amount of money my dad had been an alcoholic and and but he had just crossed over like he he was finally he was making some good money but paying off a life of not so my parents could not afford to send me to go to school and equally i couldn't qualify to get a loan to go to school so i i i just literally couldn't go and so i i didn't i went to work and i guess today i'm grateful you know i think you and i talked in public i said there are times when i wish that that i'd had the experience of proper debate with professors and refinement of of academic thought processes and research and that sort of thing but there's a bigger advantage that came to me as a result of that and that is that very often our current education is about moving students toward a singular truth you know a convergent education a child can tell you 26 uses for a brick somebody who's learned about bricks can think of one and that paid off very well for me yeah yeah well you know one of the things i've noticed in my life is that the most often the most interesting people i've met are super smart people who didn't go to university and they still have that native intelligence but the fact that they didn't go through that upper echelon echelon intellectual training meant that they had to formulate their own views of the world and really from whole cloth and you know there's some disadvantages to that because there are things you don't know and avenues of critical thinking that you haven't mastered but my impression has been that those people are often extremely original in their thinking right because they have all that native intelligence but it's manifested itself in a way that's very unique to their circumstances yeah so they have interesting and new things to say rather than the cookie cutter conversation you get that you're more likely to get among people who've been highly educated you also get this multiple perspective view of a problem and here's a great example from from my father i think he talks about this in megaphone is that if you go to the lasko caves and if you've never been i highly recommend the lasko caves a 20 000 year old paintings i think when picasso walked through he looked around these paintings and he said of art we have invented nothing twenty thousand year old art but there's a rhino in there now this is the south of france there's a rhino in there right right and there's four dots behind the rhino on the wall and symbologists have looked at the dots and determined that it means this is the end of the story or something i don't know like everybody's looked at and said what are these four dots all about the trouble is is that if you've had this convergent education and say some or or yeah in say symbology or or let's say an art then you're looking at it only through that lens if you're my father and you've been looking you've got your legal training but then separately you've got all growing up in in africa you've got your you know his father his grandfather was an archaeologist zoologist you look at that and you've spent a lot of time with white rhinos in the bush what you know about white rhinos is that a dominant bull white rhino poops explosive big balls of poop out behind him and he kicks them and he sprays his urine in a huge aerosol cloud and i know remember this present book right if you if you know that then you look at the dots and you go it's this is a painting of a dominant bowl nobody else knows that that happened to me to a large degree because you know when i was say 20 i was very sick all the time and i made some adjustments with food and completely turned my life around but then as i was trying to share those ideas with other people i found out that people don't follow rules very well food rules that is well there's 12 i think that people are following quite well these days yeah they should but the the but then the other thing because i've been involved in entrepreneurship and business and marketing and business coaching i had learned some things that i would call about practical psychology that allowed me to put my interest in nutrition my interest in anthropology and my interest in behavioral change together yeah and i wouldn't have been able to do that if i went to university no no well it's also the case too you know that people who have particularly interesting things to say tend to be masters of more than one discipline that very rarely overlap so one of my friends for example jonathan pajo he exists at the intersection of fine art post-modern theory and classic orthodox christian theology there's like well he's like the guy right because there's no one else who there's no one else like that there's probably no one else like that in the world right and so because he has expertise in those and i've recommended you know to the people who are watching and listening and reading this sorts of things that i've been trying to communicate that they try to get very very good at one thing right to start with that right to develop expertise there but then if you can expand out and get some expertise in multiple areas and and then benefit from the convergence of those man you really i think that's part of what starts to push people up that pareto distribution curve you know that attainment like like success or like failure is non-linear right the more you succeed the faster you succeed yeah and that's why a small that all the money ends up in the hands of a small number of people and a tiny proportion of recording artists have all the records and a tiny proportion of authors sell all the books i mean it's a very very stable phenomenon it's called the matthew principle right to those who have more much more will be given and from those who have nothing everything will be taken away a very harsh reality of life but i think what happens is that you develop these pockets of expertise you bring them together and the effects of that are multiplicative rather than additive and that can really spiral you up the the what would you say the competence ladder towards higher and higher levels of success and if you have a society that opens up the possibility for people to do that then the society also tends to thrive so so anyways you're you're not going to college you start working and apparently you're starting at a startup is that right yeah i i you know i did door-to-door sales and different like sort of you know attempts at at life but then my dad contacted me and he said i had a friend who was starting a tech company or had started a tech company but he was struggling to move past solopreneur you know he hired people and he just he wasn't very good at people and and he told this friend my son can sell ice to you know to the eskimos and you should hire him so were you a good door-to-day sales i was i was really good i sold kirby vacuums and and i was what did you learn from doing that i you know i just i was i i learned rapport skills i learned quickness of thought to trust my speech engine yeah i remember for example knocking on this one door once and this woman says you guys like don't you do any other neighborhoods you're like the sixth guy from your company to knock on my door in the last four months like why do you guys i never let anybody in why why do you keep coming and one thing i can tell you about sales is that the everybody has defense mechanisms against sales yeah like like the hell away right but the stronger your defense is at the outer level the easier it is to pillage on the inside so if if somebody is very firmly won't let you in the door that's because they're really easy to sell to it's just the way it is if somebody lets you in easily you're gonna have a tough go of it it's going to be interesting this woman she's a very sneaky thing to know very very powerful to know is this woman's really i can see she's got the she's got the fortress walls up the drawbridge is up she goes and she goes so what makes you any different and i went i'm cute uh-huh and she busted out laughing and of course laughter the orgasm your brain you know and she opens the door muscular attention all disappeared invites me in for a coffee and you know an hour and a half later she's spending fifteen hundred dollars on a vacuum she didn't know she needed aha uh-huh and how long did you do door-to-door sales two years two and a half years well i did i did about a year of that and then they put me in recruiting and so so you stuck with it i did i like it you know no but i just i knew it was right somehow like there the the i knew that i was developing skills that were used yeah well man there's that ability to sell that's so what do you learn about selling you just thought you related one of the things you learned i mean so selling marketing we have sales and marketing and i don't really like that either of those terms mean because all of this is communication and if it's done properly it's communication in relationship to trust if it's done well were the vacuums you're selling decent vacuums to this day if i i don't i live in i live in the caribbean we don't have carpets but if i had carpets i would have that vacuum no question about it so you were selling something i believed in it yeah okay okay well that's crucial right like if you're if you're embarking on a sales career and you don't believe in what you're selling you're just bloody liar and you're training yourself to be a psychopath so you need and this is good advice for people who are listening who are thinking about doing this is if you're going to sell you need to believe that the thing you're selling is actually worthwhile and does its job properly because otherwise you're just a bloody scam artist and you push me hard enough i'm going to sell you a kirby yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so you stuck with that for quite a while okay now now you've got an opportunity to join a new company that's based on a good idea the guy who's established the company isn't a person who has this easy capacity let's say or well-developed capacity for communication and sales so you step in there what happens i join him and it's with the company lifts off i'm really good at what i do like he tells me and i don't really get much training he basically hands me a binder full of names of people and he says call these people and try to buy or sell barcode equipment you know okay and what was the equipment barcode scanning equipment data capture equipment barcode printing you know and related technology and what did it offer the people that you were talking to you know what we did a lot of times is we would call companies and buy equipment from them because we refurbished it and resold it so when they bought it from us what they were buying is sometimes cheaper sometimes they're buying obsoleted equipment that they couldn't get anymore so we were providing them a valuable service there were a number of different angles that we took but you know one of the things i found really fascinating about generally sales and marketing is that people are so afraid of rejection and yeah and i think it's selfish i think it's really selfish to be afraid of that rejection because if you believe in what you're selling then you have to ask yourself is my 30 seconds of rejection feeling more important to me than the pain i might be resolving for this person over the next few decades of their life right right so like you know in my in my business in wildfit we help people you know reframe their relationships with food and we've we have like literally hundreds of cases of morbid obesity being ended at type 2 diabetes being reversed and so on if i'm sitting with you if i've been sitting with you some years ago when you're dealing with all the autoimmune stuff and i held back from offering you what you now know but you didn't then if i held back offering that because of my fear of rejection how selfish is that how selfish is it for me to not try to well that would also that also i think emerges for people too when they're when they're selling something they don't believe in which basically means that they're lying i mean my then a lot of sales and marketing like a lot and and with some success and with a lot of failure for a variety of complex six reasons and i learned that well first of all you're not selling you're forming relationships because if you're a salesman and you have even the vegas clue you don't lie to your damn customers because you actually want to have a relationship with them for like the next 20 years and so you have to be offering them something genuine and it can't be it can't be nonsense and you have to believe and it has to be the case that what you're offering them this partnership is going to be of clear and outstanding mutual benefit and then when you're selling you're actually not trying to sell or convince right you're trying to establish relationships and i've also learned too that and i don't know what you think about this but my sense too is that this wouldn't be exactly the same as doing it door-to-door but you know if you push and inquire and see if there's a fit and you see that there isn't a fit there's not a lot of sense pushing because if there isn't a fit you should be going to talk to someone else plus if there isn't a fit and you push it the fact that there isn't a fit is just going to cause endless trouble as you move forward in the relationship you know sales networking and dating they're basically the same function and we make exactly the same mistakes in one as we do in the other so very often people try to go for the sale too quickly and date the way that looks you're looking at the at the menu and the one person in the date says oh look they have a kitty menu for when we're back here next year right that might be that's a little premature or or oh by the way i brought the condoms i mean either way that's a little early right that's that's an indicator of a kind of impulsive predatory psychopathy by the way that's focus on immediate gratification in the present is a very bad marker of character exactly and we make that many people make mistakes like that in dating but they but they make that mistake even more commonly in selling yeah for the sale too quickly yeah so one of the ways that i often demonstrate this is you know i've done lectures on this all over the world and i've got an audience and i'll generally pick a woman in the front row and i said can we have a date please and bring her up on the stage she has a microphone and and i'll i'll say hello i'm so glad that you swiped right so we could be here today you know making a bit of a light of it yeah and then and then i'll go so let's let's start the date i i'd like to give you a little bit of my personal background i'm a partner in a law firm we do intellectual property law and by the time i get to that place there's a camera on her and you can see on the big screen for everybody's watching women have two sets of eyelids there's there's this one set of eyelids that close their eyes are open but they're not they're gone yeah and and that's if you talk too long like that they're gone they're gone from the conversation and that again is the problem of networking and selling it's like pushing pushing then i go and everybody notices that i've lost her and go okay now you see what i've done i've lost her can i can i have a re i'm not going to get i'm not gonna get a second date so can we have a do-over all right yeah so now i start to go you know as much as i'd love to share with you about my you know my my law firm and steps what i'd really like to know is what do you like to do for fun yeah yeah yeah now now she starts telling what she likes to do for fun and i keep asking if i'm not pushing i'm asking yeah then invariably and i've done this countless times in countries all over the world invariably she will come to some area where she talks about her passion or hobby her career her dreams and she goes oh i have a book i'm working on and i go you have a book you're working on have you chosen a title yet she goes no i go listen when you start thinking about are there ideas in the book that might be unique and she goes yes i go have you have you considered copyright protections and maybe a registration oh yeah yeah and she goes yeah and i go well listen i'm a partner in it now my fictitious when i was when i was selling so i started out selling so to speak as a professor and my sense was and i knew that this was the case what i was offering to the to the companies i was attempting to sell to i knew would produce a staggering economic return for them and i could demonstrate that statistically and i can demonstrate it through brute fact and i thought to begin with that my job was to just lay out the facts and not to convince but to lay out the facts and let people form their own judgment and what i didn't understand was that people almost never make a judgment based on facts and certainly not on statistical facts like like that just net that hardly happens with data scientists it certainly doesn't happen with with like say typical middle managers in a in a large corporation that never happens and what you have to do is exactly what you just described is you have to find out from the person what's what what are your problems like what's not going well for you at work what sort of things do you want to address and the if the person lays out their problems and you in principle have a solution to one of those problems and then that's not manipulative it's like oh well you know there's something there i think i could help you with if they lay out their whole problem set and nothing you're doing has any bearing on that the probability that you're going to be able to sell to them in my estimation is extremely low because they're preoccupied with a whole set of problems for whom you are not solution and so the trick often trick is to get it's not a trick it's not a trick is that the the the conversation has to be about the person you're talking to and not about you which is also a very good what would you say mode of alleviating social anxiety because if your goal in a social situation is to make the other person comfortable you're not focusing on yourself and you're not anxious but okay so you let me let me offer you you know you said that like facts and statistics aren't the thing that'll drive them and i would say it depends exactly on how interesting those facts and statistics are to them and when they were delivered yeah so years ago i was invited to teach marketing at one of tony robbins you know big business seminars and so in the talk i i i'm telling a story and i'm telling a story about hunting with the hudson people in east africa who i've been visiting now for some 15 years and my very first hunting trip with them i'm out hunting and i'm running i'm trying to keep up behind them and it's like hard you can move fast and and and i realized that if i'm on this hunting trip we're all going to starve to death because i make a lot of noise they don't and so i started watching the way they moved and and you know and i thought to myself and i was on tony robbins stage so i used his language and i said well what would tony robbins say if somebody else was getting the result you wanted he would say model them yeah and so i started looking at the way they were running that's a pretty good tony robbins not bad by the way yeah and so so i started watching they were running they land on the fronts of their feet and i was like why do i have to learn this from the bushman that's how i snuck around the house as a child this is a natural human movement and then i started thinking to myself wait a second i've been running now i'm i i start running with them i run on the fronts of my feet i'm silent i'm i barely make any noise i'm able to pick my foots fall better i i don't impact the ground as and and i know that it was working because one of the bushmen who was supposed to be keeping track of me turned around to make sure i was still there it was working it was working but then after about an hour and a half of running like this i realized something else magical and that was my knee was not hurting my knee that had been hurt so badly by running the london marathon that i had to give up running at 30. it's way too young to give up running you know if you want to run and but now my knee wasn't hurting i'm like why is my knee not hurting i i can never run this long what's going on here i'm running differently i'm running the way you would run if your running shoes did not allow an improper foot strike you see the thing is when you land on your heel you send all of that foot strike up for your skeletal system yeah and and i i sure there's no spring that's right with in the heel the the they put in air to protect your heel from the shock but that doesn't protect your knee or your hip or your neck and and i share this whole idea right now you probably even have forgotten the purpose of why i was beginning to tell this story because stories are like that before i told the story i asked the audience how many people in this room are about to buy a new cell phone three percent how many are buying a new car in the next few months three percent whatever you ask it's three percent i had also asked how many are you going to buy new running shoes it was three percent at the end of my story after giving them facts and statistics about heel strikes and barefoot running shoes i said now how many of you are thinking you might need to buy new running shoes 70 right right facts and data delivered in the right way create the market yeah well and you know what the right way is if you're paying enough attention to the conversation that also means that you can't be concentrating on selling precisely that's exactly right because and well i i think that's true in a conversation in general is that it's a mistake this is part of the reason joe rogan is so successful by the way is rogan doesn't he's not selling his podcast during his podcast all joe is trying to do is have interesting conversations right and then and your point is that something if i've got it right is let the interesting conversation unfold and you may see that there are things that you have to offer that will slot into it naturally without being forced right that's right without any instrumental manipulation on your part selling in our world called sales opportunity selling in our world means manipulating yeah and the truth is when you walk into you know you walk into tim hortons and buy a donut nobody manipulated you well i would we could argue what they did with their advertising and sugar might have been manipulating yeah the transaction was a sale selling is solving a problem for people you're right yes yes you should you need t-shirts with that printed on it because that's exactly right that's yeah yeah and then there's absolutely 100 nothing corrupt about it either you know when salesmen have a they have a bad name in our culture kind of like politicians and i think that is because sales can attract narcissists you know yeah well well they're all in sales politicians people in in entertainment people in media like people have a public life and and who have to communicate to convince they're you're going to attract a larger than normal proportion of psychopaths but that doesn't mean that the bloody endeavor itself is corrupt and immoral at its core and it's not if what you see as a salesman is that what you're trying to do are is to offer genuine solutions to the actual problems that people have which is what you should be doing if you have something reasonable to sell that comment on narcissism you and i talked talked a little bit about that in in mexico you know i told you about my book the evolution gap and one of the features of that is like comparing the idea of the evolution gap is that there's this gap that has begun to open between human evolution which is very very slow and human innovation which is rapidly accelerating and narcissism is quite an interesting one because if you're living in a hunter-gatherer tribe narcissism will only get you so far yeah yeah not very yeah you can dart in your back and derek here here in toronto in new york or in any larger community you can stay put like a like a spider and and you can mess up that relationship with your narcissism and then pick up the next one and pick up the next one yeah narcissism in our world actually becomes an advantage and that's that's a sort of that's a symptom of that guy probably multiplied online yeah this is really frightening me you know because my my understanding of the psychopathic personnel or what what would you say the psychopathic proportion of the population it's about three percent not very high because it's not a very successful strategy it can it has and can run rampant in certain historical epochs that's what happened during the russian revolution for example a very small percentage of people can cause a tremendous amount of trouble now we've evolved mechanisms to keep the psychopathic parasites at bay and a lot of those involve the potential threat of physical force like your the story you told about being on top of the swing zero zero of that applies online and so there's an immense amount of of not even subtle criminal activity online i don't know how much online activity is criminal but if you include pornography it's probably like 40 percent of the total internet environment is criminal in the broader sense that's a lot forty percent it's a lot and there's zero punishment virtually zero punishment for psychopathy online it's also you know when we talk about three percent of the world being like that it's not that three percent of the i don't think i don't think of it that way i think of it everybody's on that spectrum and in one society three percent of the world show up that way in another society people who would have been in the fourth or fifth percentile start showing up that way yeah well that that definitely well so you don't have to wait for that to get naturally selected it starts to awaken yeah yeah well there you can you can imagine that there's there's a temperamental proclivity to that it can be fought on behalf of the people who have the proclivity right so imagine that wherever you are in the five-dimensional personality space you have a set of talents and a set of temptations and the temptation if you're extroverted and disagreeable is to be narcissistic and but that isn't necessarily inviolable outcome okay so there's people without proclivity then there's a space that either opens up for them or doesn't and that space could be you can get away with it or the space could be you get encouraged if it's encouraged it's going to grow it's definitely being encouraged online it's being encouraged and funny enough that's another symptom of this evolution gap because again for the vast majority of human history even we lived in fear can you even imagine what it would have been like to to sleep on the savannah without fire no it would have been terrifying well i felt that to some degree back country camping in the rockies where i know there are grizzlies but that's just like a tiny test after 99. that's after 99 of the megafauna were removed yeah exactly exactly and the grizzlies are smart enough generally to be afraid and they won't bother you unless they're starving and old and you stumble across one right so if you if you think that our ancestors lived really very much fearful lives fearful of things fearful of conditions fearful of others and and that's a very natural instinct that we have in us now you take one of those three percent narcissistic psychopathic people and put them in a position of power and what do they do they offer us safety yeah yeah well and they foster fear yeah yeah well they create the fear they offer us safety but we have to sacrifice our freedom for their safety and our instinct as as frightened primates is to go for that and so that that's the eternal offering of a tyrant it's like here this is why the apocalyptic climate narrative really drives me mad it's like well first first of all i don't think there is a crisis of the proportions that's being like purported let's say by any stretch of the imagination i don't think there's any data to support that whatsoever but also the the problem with it is is that the apocalyptic fear that that generates justifies the acquisition of power by precisely the kind of psychopathic predators that you're describing it's like oh everything's going to fall apart wink wink give all the power to us and we'll keep you safe it's like yeah i don't think so i think you're a bigger threat than the damn climate by a large there's a nice way to look at that too you know climate change you know i mean you'll remember that in the 70s it was global cooling yes and then then it was global warming now it's climate change but here's what's really fascinating i well first of all i think that trying to measure our impact on on climate and so forth a little bit like measuring the height of a flea jump on the back of a white rhino running across the the savannah trying to predict where the rhino is going to go yeah meanwhile we have plastic in the oceans we have air quality problems we have tangible things that you can agree with whether you're whether you're a democrat or whether you're republican or conservative or liberal yeah we have we have very we're not arguing about those things we're arguing about this one massive nebulous thing that can't properly be proven and and giving up our power for it yeah you bet you bet it's a major danger there's no doubt about it all right so now you're alert you're you're making your sales ability more sophisticated you're working with this company what happens then i stay with that company for about six or seven years and i find you know i get to a place where you know i i i've been offered equity a number of times and you know what happens a lot of times with entrepreneurs anyway is that they it's easy to give away equity when it doesn't when it has no value and then once it has value it's like harder to keep your promises apparently for some people it's like well people forget too you know when you make these you know this is another thing for people watching and listening to understand is even if you have established a trusting relationship with people don't overestimate the degree to which people can actually remember i agree i agree but that was not the case here this was a willful case of manipulating i'll give you an example i walk into my office one day and and we're trying to bid for some equipment and we don't really want to buy this equipment we want to keep it off the market you understand so so my boss goes and he negotiates with this company to buy the equipment from them and he sends them a fax and the facts is a blank piece of paper and i go why did you fax them a blank piece of paper and he goes he goes because we agreed on the phone that i could buy that stuff so now he can't sell it to anybody and if he does sell it to one of my competitors in the meantime i have a telephone record that proves that i fax a purchase order to him oh yeah so this is not a man who forgot the promises he made to me this is a man who has a style of thinking that doesn't measure right right let's call it a tangential relationship with the truth yeah yeah yeah well that's very instrumental right so and the irony is i left that company and and he owed me you know maybe 200'0 000 in back commissions and and and and refused to pay it to me because he was afraid this is irony i love irony i i mean i i i i like proper examples of irony like ronald reagan was not shot he wasn't actually shot he was hit by a bullet that ricocheted off his bulletproof limousine you know i i like good examples of irony and so in my case my uh he won't pay me the money because he's afraid that i will set up a competitive venture meantime one of my mentors has offered me a job as a stock broker in grand cayman which is my dream to go and live in the caribbean but i if without that money i can't i you know i need some money so the the ironic twist is that one of my clients calls me and he says you know can you find some equipment for me and i'm like i don't i'm living in england at this point because i've been relocated to england to open the european headquarters i've quit my job i'm not legally allowed to be in the country for work i i have a pregnant wife it's a tough time and and my and my boss won't give me the money so i can relocate the guy says can you find this equipment for me and i'm like yeah i go find it for him and i make money and then i do it again and then i do it again i'm like and then i start a company and what kind of company direct competitor with my previous oh yeah yeah total irony yeah right and i ran that business in the uk for about nine years and then sold it to private buyers and and you know moved on with like got out of the data capture how successful were you at that new enterprise it was and we were we were i mean i i'll say i got my 200 000 back again and again and again and again and and i sold it for a retirable something why hadn't you done that earlier going on on your own earlier do you know i i've often wondered about that because as a kid i did i mean as a kid i was like i was the this i was watching the news report the minute the snow was happening i was like i was out there knocking on the doors like i'm gonna you know i'm gonna shovel your sidewalks and i'm i'm also more introverted so that's not the easiest thing in the world for me to go do so i was off doing that raking leaves and then one year i came up with this genius plan at the beginning of christmas or at the beginning of the snow season which in halifax is usually around christmas i sold insurance i i knocked on doors and said look you can pay me now because you usually pay me like ten dollars to do your walk or five dollars or whatever yeah but if you pay me 25 i'll i'll keep your clue for the winter yeah big gamble you know some years in halifax i would do i and but it works people went for it so i clearly had that mindset and i remember once distinctly what a lesson i was raking leaves for this guy old ornery guy and i i was and i was paying by the by the by the trash bag full you know he had to pay two dollars whatever it was per trash bag and i in a huge garden so i'm i'm making it i'm filling in about trash bag trash bag trash bag he comes out and he squeezes one of the trash bags and he goes no no no no any and he packs it right down yeah yeah i bet and he goes now that's a trash bag and he goes he goes i'm not trying to be cheap he says i'm trying to teach you about value yeah because you got to know that if i come out here and you got light trash bags i'm not hiring you again next year yeah right but if i see that you do it right and i got to tell you that guy massive impact on my life everything i do today is about over delivery on that basis yeah right no kidding no kidding now that was that was good of him that's for sure man he paid you for your worked update he did he did yeah yeah over deliver you bet well and that's the thing is you got to remember when you're selling to people first of all yeah you don't want to sell to the wrong person because you might be in bed with them for a very long time that's a good thing to learn if your so-called fundraising too it's like you should never fundraise you should look for partners yeah and you don't want to take money from the wrong person no that's a very very bad idea so i bought a film studio in northern california years after all this and and it was originally the model shop it was called the model shop and anybody who's a star wars geek knows what i'm talking about it's the original the original like studio of lucasfilm this is where star wars well actually star wars is la this empire strikes back indiana jones pirates and so i bought the studio and and and and now where was i going with that getting in bed with the wrong oh yeah so we had these incredible 3d camera systems that we were building and we did our first we we did a little bit of work on avatar and and it was really good and but then we need to raise some capital we raised capital from a guy 1.2 million and he worked for a huge he was like the second in command of a huge entertainment company so we thought and he said i'll land you the money as long as i get to run company oh yeah and you know i i i could say he ran into the ground let's say we ran it into the ground that particular venture didn't really work but then he sued us for his money from the company that he was running and it was like i that was i got the lesson from now once we're not we're looking for like partners and we've got them as much as we would anybody yeah yeah well there's no such thing as free money you're a bloody fool if you think anybody whose money is easy easy to take first of all you better make sure that it's not a lure second if their money is easy to take that should tell you something about them just means you don't know how you're going to pay yeah yeah that's exactly that's exactly right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so now you've established a company in the uk and you you did that for how long nine years nine years and then you have you have a family developing at the same time yeah unfortunately my my wife at the time decided rather unilaterally that she didn't want to live in england anymore and went on a vacation to canada and took my son with her and that's when i found out that the geneva can or the hague convention only applies up until the 90th day and she called me on the 92nd day and said if you want to be with us you have to come back to canada and i like i had employees and debts and i it would have been personal bankruptcy and ruin and then it also made me really ask an important question about and in this and i'll never know if i didn't even shock it was awful awful but i spoke to my dad and my dad said what would you want your son to do in the exact same situation i said well i wouldn't want him to be bullied that in a lateral way like that i and i wouldn't and i'd want him to take responsibility for if i left everybody loses their jobs most of them were long-term unemployed before i came along because we're in an impoverished part of the uk and and i would have had to file bankruptcy it was a massive impact for me to just suddenly close up my business and i as a kid i was a bit like that you know start something it didn't work go to the next thing yeah i was really in this phase of you start things you got to finish them and so i chose to stay and keep the business in my when my wife and i divorced at that point very very difficult time but you know i learned a great deal and and the business went well in the end and and i sold it and and and you know this is a very interesting thing about purpose you know like i think that when we look at what we value you know initially we value survival and and in our world that means some level of economic survival say but something magical happens if you can transcend the need for money and emotionally or luckily logistically and that's really what happened to me at that point is that i i became free to actually follow my passion and do things that really drove me barcode scanning equipment never drove me as much as i can get fascinated by this so let me ask you about that pat see i i read joseph campbell a lot for for years and he said and and campbell has some very interesting things to say although he learned most of them from carl jung he said follow your passion and you know there's there's a couple of things that aren't right about that i mean the first is it's not that easy to differentiate a true passion from a false passion and impulsivity is passion but it's short-term and so is it passion you follow or is it interest or is it the compelling nature of certain problems that grip you or is it responsibility right i mean these are i think that there's a mix a passion by itself could be good or bad could be vacuous or or deep but passion combined with purpose and what happened for me is i found a purpose that you know when i was a kid i wanted to be a teacher i had this great teacher in grade three in halifax nova scotia mr kolchinski i'm telling you he was amazing he really i i can still almost word for word repeats some of his classes and i was eight years old he was a phenomenal teacher when i was 25 years old i was found myself back in half halifax briefly i called the school board and i said is mr still working we called him mr k because nobody could say coltonski when we were kids but i as mr kolczynski still working with the school yes he is actually can i have his home number please no 15 minutes later to use the star wars like these are not the droids you're looking for i had his phone number and i called him in his house and i said mr kolpinski this is eric edmonds and i'm assuming 30 kids a year for all these years i'm not gonna remember me so but but before i even finished i said hi this is miss i said hi mr colton see this is america mr this is eric edmonds i don't know if you remember me he goes remember you i drove past your house a few days ago i'm wondering did your parents ever move back to africa like wow wow and i just told him that i'm living a phenomenal life and that i believe he was one of the significant contributors to that for me and anyway but then i found out as i was leaving school and i i don't you know like i i feel bad kind of saying this but i just it seems to me at least in the way it was when i was a kid growing up in canada we just we don't really respect teachers very much not economically and not in other ways like the the or the profession or the profession generally and i was like i don't i'm not i i i i want to teach but i don't want to be treated like that yeah yeah yeah and so now that i sold the business i took a couple of years and traveled around the world and i started doing a little bit of business speaking people started inviting me to speak about business because i'd sold my company and that sort of thing but under it under it i had a much deeper passion and that was that at 21 years old i had been really sick like not i'm not talking terminal or you know anything like that i just mean always on medication always uncomfortable what was wrong yeah i had i had a horrible sign a permanent chronic sinus infections throat infections my tonsils would be like golf balls in my throat ear infections digestive really serious digestive cramps that were so bad that i couldn't speak or think a horrible cystic acne oh yeah and i always i mean always dripping from the from the nose it was just generally i was just not a healthy kid and i wasn't like that younger but sometime in somewhere between 12 and 21 that all started developing and i'd been to see doctors and specialists and needles and pills and injections and even surgery finally they recommended and you know i i went to a friend of mine talked me into going to a seminar a sales seminar it was tony robbins you know 21 years old and i i i thought i was going to go there and learn about money and sure i did but on the last day tony spoke about food and i think he and i would agree on this point that many of the things he shared about food back then are are not what he and not what he or i believe about food but they were a lot better than the way i was eating and so i made a bunch of changes and what did you change primarily you know process you know the reduction of processed food elimination of dairy products elimination of meat at that point and i'll come back to that later because that was that was wrong and there's something about there's something about that that's interesting but and and then the increase of of good things and within 30 days i had lost 35 pounds 35 days 30 days yeah jesus shock well remember a lot of it's not fat a lot of inflammation yeah yeah right yeah and which i don't know it's still a shock here's how big a shock it is i go visit my mom i land in johannesburg i come down the the the the back then it was like you came down these escalators into john smith's airport johannesburg international now you come down there and there's greeting area and my mom and i'm there with my girlfriend and my mom looks at at me and looks right through me huh doesn't even see wow then she looks at my girlfriend who had like bright red hair robin i know it's strawberry blonde i'm sorry but yeah strawberry blonde but yeah this bright hair and so my mom saw her and then did the double take back to me and then realized it was me such was the change in my face like i everything had changed and then i had a fascinating conversation with my doctor because he was trying to he was calling me to say well the surgery is coming up yeah they wanted me to have my tonsils yeah which is a serious serious thing to do at 21 years ago right right and i said i don't think i need the surgery anymore and we you know we're having this conversation he goes why not i go i'm not he goes yeah but that happens you know the pain goes away and it'll be back yeah you know you've waited this long yeah and it was a sales pitch it was i i'm looking at this guy going oh my god it's a sales pitch this is not about me this is about revenue i felt it my bones it was just not right and and and and then i i said to him how long did you go to medical school for now you have to know at 21 years old i looked' i was a kid i look young this must have been the most impetuous like what's this he goes six years and i go can i just ask in the six years how much of that time did you spend studying nutrition right do you know the answer yeah none yeah yeah yeah and that is consistent about as much time as they spend studying scientific research it's amazing it is quite stunning and at that moment i suddenly felt the only way i could describe it is i felt like i was on a plane and i just found out the pilot didn't learn how to land yeah i have better learn this myself and i i went in i read everything i could i went i even finally went to university i didn't go very long because it was so painfully slow but i went to go study archeology why would i study archeology when i wanted to learn about food because i had a very interesting moment where i learned about elephants and elephants you know when you when you when you put them in captivity a hundred years ago they would only live 10 years or so like it was a very short-lived life and the zuki person such stumbled upon some you know at that point in time contemporary science and that said that elephants in the wild live seven or eight years and these guys became very concerned about their well i'd like to think they're concerned about their elephants they're concerned about their investment and so what did they figure out and i'm reading this article and the article talks about the elephant's wild diet and the elephant's captive diet and while i i can't look i i i'm a little bit of a grammar fascist sometimes i mean i shouldn't be i don't have the right to be i'm dyslexic and i i probably don't write to me but when i spot something and i look at this wild diet the elephant doesn't have a wild diet it doesn't the elephant does not have a wild diet the elephant has a diet it does not have a wild one right it might have a captive one but it doesn't have a wild one and in that moment i suddenly realized wait a second now the word diet has been stolen it's been hijacked like many words get stolen and it what it actually means is way of life it actually means way of life the original greek latin it's way of life it's not it's not temporary alteration to your current eating patterns in order to fit into that outfit for that special occasion that's not what it means right right and in that moment i i i realized that in order to figure out how to and by the way they took the elephant's wild diet and they reintroduced it to the captivity suddenly the captive elephants were living 30 40 50 years and at that point i said what we have to be doing is looking at our own anthropology our own archeology our own history right because food science has been so hijacked and adulterated that we can't trust it i felt like the roots of the issue were not going to be sold to us by the food pyramid people they weren't going to be sold to us by the food manufacturers the department of agriculture not helpful right and no and certainly say that it's it's so i wrote this article and then about a year or two later oh i read an article by s boyd eaton and he'd written it in like 1985 and it was it basically suggested the same thing he was saying look there's a human diet there is one you know we have less as a population on this planet we have less genetic variants than than the different species of elephant have from each other we're very closely related there's a human diet and then lauren cordain released the paleo diet around about that time and i felt partially robbed and also vindicated all at the same time but that that kind of led me to real passion and purpose the problem was as a teacher nobody would pay for that nobody would pay for me to come and talk to them about you know anthropological nutrition or what we would now call nutritional anthropology or even food psychology that weren't interested in that but they were always interested in how i built a business and how i and i'd been involved in hollywood movies and i built a like for example this is fascinating we're doing hollywood special effects and creatures and stuff for the movies and so then the military through jamie heinemann from mythbusters who used to work at the studio long before i bought it came to us one day and he said can we build a hyper-realistic trauma simulation mannequins for the us army now i don't know if you've ever done cpr training but the dummy you do it on is not real it's it's not even as real as a shop mannequin they are now they are so real that medics opted out of the training program because interacting with our mannequins was too traumatic for them it was a fascinating really really fascinating i mean the the they were simulating ied interaction to use the vernacular sounds like there's an opening on the sex robot manufacturer they approached us the porn industry they we we got a strong approach from him and we were like not at all not at all we were we knew there was there was treasure at the end of that rainbow but there was consequence i had no way but in the end i would get invited to speak about business because i had this most business speakers are either theoreticians yeah or they've had one big success in a particular industry or even they've had two or three successes in the same industry but i'd had a success in data capture mobile computing wireless networking then in hollywood special effects then in medical simulation then in military research and development right and so you're showing cross plots yeah people are willing to pay for the nice seats in the plane and the good fees for business speaking yeah and so i started doing that in fact i mentioned earlier i got that call from tony robbins and and that kind of set me on fire it was like holy i didn't know how did he come across you do you did you ever hear of chet holmes chad holmes wrote you you want to check out chad because you know just because of your fascination in sales and marketing he wrote a book called the ultimate sales machine a phenomenal bestseller and it turned out he and i met at one point and he he said when did you do my program i've never done your program he goes but the way you talk and the way you write marketing campaigns they're so subtle and they don't feel like marketing and they're so converting why why are they so good if you didn't do my training program which is a slightly arrogant question but he was like that and years later we were having dinner one day and he was he was always very inquisitive and he asked lots of questions and he asked me about my history and i mentioned kirby and he goes oh i get it now he used to work for charlie munger and he had designed all of the marketing campaigns that we were using at kirby so i had been trained in sales and marketing by chet holmes as a kid even though he never met i see and so he was working with tony and one day he had told tony about me a few times but i'm i wasn't a speaker so tony was never going to put me on stage but then then then you know weird confluence of events you know happened and chat sadly gets very sick and and and he ends up passing away and but he always said to me i've given you this last gift he always told me that i never knew what the gift was i never knew but then about 11 days after he passed away he was scheduled to speak at a conference in in fiji with tony and i get this phone call would you come and take chet's spot uh-huh and i i i i hadn't been on a stage in three years i had no business that's like i'm not even driving go-karts and you want me to go race formula one today but i said yes and i went and and it just tony and i hit it off immediately he was so good to me in every way we we didn't know about because i've been talking to tony and working with him to some degree over the last i guess it's almost six months two years something like that but i don't think we knew that connection when we met mexico no i don't i don't think yeah yeah no but he was he i i he he immediately i remember flying into fiji and i thought if i really rock this i mean if i really rock it i know it's an opportunity i could get on the list they'd call me again yeah by the time the plane had taxi to the airport i said screw that that's not big enough thinking if i really rock this i will become the list and in effect that happened tony and i hit it off immediately they told me he would only stay in the room for 15 minutes and it was so interesting he calls me and he's his team come says tony wants to meet you in the hallway you know he's never met you and by the way he's only going to stay in the room for 15 minutes when you're on stage if he leaves it's a good sign he's either going to leave or he's going to take you off the stage those are the only options but he wants to meet in the hallway so i walk into the hallway and i and i you know and you know he went to giant he's big and and he goes how are you feeling about your presentation and and the truth is they were asking me to do a presentation on 11 days prep with flying on somebody else's slides i don't even usually use slides and and and i said well it's not the ideal circumstance you know and i just want to be honest yeah and tony goes well you could be a lot more confident yeah and but i remember you know tony tony always said some version of nobody in the history of calming down has ever calmed down because somebody told them to calm down in other words me becoming meek was not going to be helpful at that point so i just said what the hell i mean i mean oh yeah i go oh i'm plenty confident look the reason i'm here is that your other business speakers are too busy operating their businesses i'm a proper business owner that's why i could do this on note of notice so it might not be exactly the presentation you're expecting but it's going to be fantastic oh yeah oh yeah and then tony goes well all right then oh yeah yeah yeah and and and that's better than the scared rabbit approach it was then now this leads to kind of a funny little offsuit here where he goes into his team and he goes i like this guy i think i want to introduce him myself anyway wasn't planning to introduce me because he didn't want to be near what could be a train wreck but now he's met me meanwhile it's mostly a chinese audience so the guy who's introducing me is going to introduce me in chinese not in english so they've changed the translation and and sony tony's like where's where's his bio where they go we threw it out we changed we translated to chinese we threw it out what do you mean we'll translate it back well i don't know if you've played that game very often but english to chinese back to english so it ends up like the bio says you know eric's eric's not really a speaker he's a he's a business guy he started his first business and he sold it nine years later by the time it gets translated back and given to tony tony walks up on stage and he goes you guys i just met our our next speaker out in the hallway i'm so excited to introduce you to him he started his first business when he was only nine years old and it was he was like oh no but he stayed in the room for three and a half hours and he didn't take me off the stage and then he booked me for a year and he coached me and he was sweet to me and generous to me in every possible way and that really turned me on and i and and set me off on the path of i'm gonna be a professional teacher i'm gonna do this for a living so okay so fill me in a bit here on the relationship between the business speaking and you're interested in in diet and also let's let's make a bit of a foray into what the consequences for you and the broader consequences have been of learning to teach and also concentrating on diet maybe we can close this this session up with that sure so the the the the short version is that i believe that the single most valuable professional skill that exists in the world is communication the ability to speak publicly in front of a camera and audience is everything anybody can add a zero to their to their income by learning to communicate effectively in my opinion so that was the first big impact for me when i made that transition it meant that everything accelerated every opportunity accelerated every my network accelerated everything changed when i decided that i was willing to do that put myself at risk put myself in front of an audience or a camera in the meantime of course i had this health focus that was my biggest passion but i couldn't find a venue for it there was no there was no economic venue for that so i kept doing it because i wasn't in it for the money but i had to do something for money separately so i kept teaching but then my clients started asking me well wait a minute where do you get all this energy from you don't do jet lag you're on stage for 15 hours a day you know you you never look tired you never get sick what's going on so i started teaching nutritional principles to my business clients and what i was basically teaching them was an early version of this concept of the evolution gap again this gap that opens up between our innovation and our genetics and and the food industry has raped and pillaged that gap to no end and that's why we have the prolific explosion of type 2 diabetes and obesity and all that stuff that we have is that we have instances unbridled it's it's and and the fact that it's not on the you know if we look at the press today if if the press were forced to cover things equally minute minute to consequence you know equally yeah then there'd be a sliver on gun crime yeah and then there'd be a pie chart of about you know 55 that would be about diabetes obesity yeah it would be pie chart yeah yeah meat pie probably but you know so i started teaching my clients and ultimately teaching them a concept of rewilding personal rewilding rather than sort of the yellowstone national park ecological rewilding this like how do you take advantage of the unbelievable things that exist in the modern world but understand that you're ultimately a stone age human and that your instincts are mismatched with your current environment and and if i started teaching them this and and and i was so excited about it and they loved it but i would see them six months later and they would still be the same yeah yeah so then i got to work hard for people to change their the manner in which they eat or live because they're the same thing then i solve that problem and i solve that by developing something that we call behavioral change dynamics and it sounds a little weird so you're a clinical psychologist and i'm going to talk to you about psychology but i just i you know when you grow up in the household i did you had to become a practical psychologist it was a survival thing and i got very good at figuring out why people do what they do especially around food so i took this concept of behavioral change dynamics which is an educational construct that i use for creating programs but i added it to nutritional principles and i created a 90-day program for people on that that runs them through a week by week strategically designed process of neurological change and nutritional change at perfect intervals and so what happened was i did it for eight people and all eight of them got results which is statistically not likely then i did it for another eight people another eight people and then one of my clients is a fairly famous author in america named paul sheely and he wrote me one day he called me and he goes eric what have you done to me my marketing team just set up a webinar page and the picture on the webinar page doesn't look anything like me and we only took it three months ago and that's how much people change in 90 days but the the the so he said you know where's your website i don't have a website it's not a business it's a hobby i just do it for my business clients he goes you better put up a website i'm about to tell my clients about you we had about 100 clients a year at that point they had to come to me to buy it it was the only way there was no website there was nothing in a week 200 people signed up and it was like and it's and it's 1500 it's not a light expense and then it happened again a guy named collins break in vancouver it did the same thing told his network 200 people then another guy named vision lakyani who's the founder of mindvalley who's my digital publisher he did it and then he did it for 200 of his employees and then he told his clients about it and then where can people find out about this getwildfit.com get well fit get wild get wild get wildfit.com okay well we'll definitely put that in the description make sure you have your people send a descriptor for the for the we will for sure for the description of the video we'll even give them like a a way to do it like a two-week trial you know we'll we'll see okay okay yeah but the so so then he he 1100 people signed up and we got to a place where you know now a hundred thousand people in 130 countries around the world have done this program a hundred thousand 100 000 people and and you know we have countless cases of type type 2 diabetes is a fascinating one we never intended to do that but it just started happening and people would call us and go eric i used to be diabetic now i'm pre-diabetic and like that just irritates me remember i'm a little bit yeah a little a little bit camera fast right that irritates me pre-indicates direction plus from a prescription perspective i would put you more post-diabetic which i which which i i i one day i said that i was talking to mark hyman dr mark hyman and i said no they're post typing yes absolutely and so funny enough that's you know you and i spoke about that book in and you introduced me to michaela to talk about that book yes so we have a book coming out that i co-wrote with a doctor about reversing diabetes which was yeah you know just again closing the evolution gap it's like when you understand why our cravings put us in a certain direction and why the food industry does certain things you can you can find your freedom yeah anyway i suddenly this thing that was never about money that couldn't pay for itself has been become you know the canadian government the canadian i get this letter can you can you come to ottawa please wait yes i can come to ottawa i'm standing i i still again i i you know every now and again the seven-year-old you looks at your life and goes holy crap you know like you can imagine what it was like standing in in kerner studios when i bought the studios and i'm standing where pixar was made star wars photoshop you know and the seven-year-old of me is going well now i'm standing on this senate floor the very day that the legalization of marijuana was ascended to law that day i'm standing on the senate floor and i'm getting a medal from from the speaker of the senate and it's because of our work in improving the quality of you the direct quote was improving lives okay so how did it come about that you got a medal for that and what did that signify and how did they find out and why did they believe you it was a a senator came to a presentation that i had done apparently years before in vancouver and she just started following my work yeah and she started following my work and seeing what we were doing in the world and you know submitted me for a nomination for this thing and and what was that it was it was it was called a senate 150 medal they they struck a bunch of these medals they said in celebration was celebration of the 150 yeah and it was for it was for unsung heroes they said it's for people that are doing stuff behind the scenes and and making which is where things are always done that are real by the way yeah behind the scenes because people just go out and do them it was a huge gift and i have to tell you that on one side i felt very i i don't feel like i go out into the world seeking any kind of recognition but it felt good and but more than that it made me feel responsible i was like well i have to live up to that yeah yeah you know i really have to live up to that and and you know and and i feel like i am i'm i you know i this this work that i'm doing is mission oriented for me i i can't name the country at the moment but i can tell you that a minister of another country's parliament did my program and did very well with it and then contacted me to see if we could work in their country to help fight their very serious obesity and diverse problems great well congratulations man that's a big deal and it's a special country because this country doesn't have food lobbyists or drug lobbyists which means that we can do clinical trials there without interference oh oh oh oh well that's great yeah so fingers crossed that that'll happen yeah yeah yeah that's for sure well look this is a good time and and place to bring this section of our discussion to a close i often as you people who are watching and listening know flip to the daily wire plus side to do something more autobiographical but we've kind of done that here i think what we'll talk about instead on the daily wire plus side is your experience with the hamsa people which and your experiences in africa so if you're interested in that and you should be i would say go over to the daily wire plus side so to speak the dark side you know and you might want to consider sending them some support at the moment anyways because youtube is on our case in a big way on the daily word plus platform you know they've canceled three of my shows in the last month and i think are likely to cancel a few of the ones that i've recorded in the last week by the way and so that's not so good and and they're really on the case so you know on shapiro's case and on candace candace owens case and and of course matt walsh all those people so it's a good time to show them some support if you're inclined to do such things so why don't you join us over there and eric will thank you very much for talking to me today thank you all sorts of real pleasure things it was fun walking through what you've been up to i'm going to be very interested to watch what happens with you on the diet politics front because that's you know if our legacy media such as it is had an ounce of sense there'd be a hell of a lot more front page headlines about the fact that everybody in the whole goddamn west is fat and diabetic and insane because of the diet that they were enticed to eat by by psychopathic marketers on the department of agricultural side who were told by the very bloody consultants that they hired that they were going to produce an epidemic of unparalleled magnitude and then proceeded to do exactly that for generations and right and here we are and let's say this on the other side of the paywall i'm going to suggest that had they not done that if we would not have experienced the pandemic that we did yeah well we know that there is almost no death among people who didn't have comorbidity and one of the major morbidities was being obese and it's a comorbidity with virtually everything terrible that there is so that wouldn't surprise me in the least yeah all right so everyone off to the daily wire plus side and thank you again eric for speaking to me thanks for having me yeah fun you bet you bet [music] thank you
