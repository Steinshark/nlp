what that big thing you don't need that you can fit the full power of amd's ryzen platform in the palm of your hand oh what you want more gpu well guess what she goes in boom right like that all the gpu you could need no compromises no strings attached zero problem wait there are compromises oh man well that sounds like a big problem for a little computer i'm about to get big money from a little segue to our sponsor crucial don't just work faster work better crucial's ddr5 ram is engineered for efficiency so you can load transfer and download files faster with less lag time and more efficiency get your crucial ddr5 ram today using the links below it's been about a year and a half since we last covered minis forum and while we were on break they have received some pretty bad press both gamers nexus and der bauer found them guilty of both false advertising and some pretty embarrassing product design mistakes around liquid metal now from our perspective both of those seemed more like gross incompetence than malice so we're hopeful that minnie's forum has cleaned up their act because this thing looks pretty freaking exciting this puppy the elite mini b550 features a desktop green cpu in a full fat am4 socket meaning you can byo cpu party at mini's forum the i o is good but not groundbreaking you got two and a half gig lan dual hdmi that's nice to have but if we flip over to the bottom we've got these external power connectors that's a four pin and that's some kind of weird tendon thing what the devil is that for then over on this side we've got a little window for the discreet graphics card interface hold on just a gosh darn minute x discrete graphics card interface no way it's a full pcie 16x nail interface this is a lot of expandability for a system like this two and a half inch drive dual 80 millimeter m.2s there's your wi-fi card and then this tray's interesting oh wow basically your system goes here and you put a discreet graphics card on it you've got dual ddr4 sodium slots these are populated by kingston modules did we provide the modules or did it ship as a ship with this but you're also still connected by a cable yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's okay don't worry about this little delicate cable then we've got a large more almost like a gpu style cooler on it really flat really broad with what appears to be an 80 millimeter fan maze form markets the system as user upgradable and while i do have my concerns about the ease of that upgrade especially in light of these extremely difficult to connect wi-fi antenna cables the fact that it does have a completely standard am4 socket means that yes technically you can do that well i shouldn't say completely standard we can already see having removed the two and a half inch drive bracket that the back plate for the cpu is not an am4 standard back plate okay so it's like a totally normal am4 socket you just don't have any of the additional like mounting points around it or anything it comes with a 5700 g oh that makes a ton of sense got that on board graphics in case you don't hook up a discrete gpu but still great performance that's an eight core and that's our thermal paste application because we had to troubleshoot this computer it was crashing all the time switched out every single part and ended up being the cpu oh like it was a bad one the one that they shipped us ended up being the problem wow we very rarely see it i know bad cpu the cheapest configuration is bare bones which is no cpu no ram no ssd that comes in at 400 400 for a motherboard cooler power supply and you also get the external yep that's actually not that stupid no not but not at all and the full spec is 900 okay i'd probably build it myself then i can see where this bracket goes now that's pretty obvious yeah yeah now let's show you guys the party trick just like that and that pcie slot the mail slot essentially is plugged into an extender now that turns it into a female slot meaning that you can either run the on-board gpu or put a full fat discrete gpu on this thing with functionally no size limitations i mean is this the biggest card you got we have a bigger one wait is this that dead one though it is a dummy one oh for well if you have a triple slot card and a large shroud on it it may actually interfere with this little piece of the bracket here that seems like something they could have solved pretty easily by having it not do that we could fix it with a dremel but we're not gonna bother the confusing part right now though is how does power work for all this clearly we've got our wall brick that plugs into there you go the pc itself there are these kind of internal power supply looking cables here oh my goodness what the devil is this you do need this these are extension cables of which we do not know the pin layout they're mail to mail and they go straight ahead they intend for you to use these with your psu don't do that yeah because if your pin out is not the same you will fry your system luckily they've informed us that they are not actually including these in the final release which is good it's a very good way to protect consumers just like how our hats are a good way to protect your skin from the sun lttstore.com get a dad hat 24 pin connector in here then boom just like that goes to the modular interface on our sfx power supply here this is a pretty cool little unit from silverstone 80 plus platinum 750 watt you absolutely do not have to use a fancy one like this just any random desktop atx power supply would work what is that power what is that 12 volt for that'll be for your cpu i think well no because your cpu has to be able to be powered by the brick no you don't power you do not have the brick plugged in at the same time it's all going to do this psu well it's not the kind of thing apple would make apparently a bracket for the power supply is coming yeah there's no details on their website about which power supply will be supported by the bracket i mean for now this is pretty it's something you ready for the big moment i hope you plugged it in all right you said there was some troubleshooting well this it worked before hey it's working classic have you tried unplugging it and plugging it back in she's booted it's working this really is not that small i actually measured it all out yeah to because i was like if you put this the power supply right here yeah it's just a sandwich form factor sfx case like the ghost s1 it's actually exactly that sandwich layout that is whoops man i gotta say you can't fault the performance at 4k ultra nightmare we are sitting at anywhere from 150 to just shy of 200 frames per second in doom eternal i mean that's what you'd expect for a 6800 xt hooked up via pcie 16x interface to a ryzen 8 core cpu i mean that's the point of this thing right it's small sort of and performs fastly i guess the other point is that it's also a it's a fully enclosed mini c computer how's the performance of the system without the rigmarole well by itself it's pretty good the 5700g is a 65w cpu so it's not super hard to keep cool but this thing does it really silently even trying to put it through a thermal torture test it only ever got to about like 67 degrees on the gpu and 72 degrees on the cpu even now the vast majority of the noise is actually from the gpu yeah and if you wanted to you could even run it with pbo position boost overdrive that is really pushing against the 120 watt power supply though yeah i don't know if i'd recommend it i probably wouldn't recommend it i even got it to run a 1050 ti also pushing up against the power limits wait without external power without external power yeah i wouldn't recommend that either but you can the downside is that there's no room to grow with a 5800 x3d it handled it but you never got full boost clocks right so what upgradeability is there really it's basically nothing i'm having a hard time trying to figure out who this is for i can afford a gpu i care about gaming performance or why would i buy this but i don't always want to take my gpu with me i want to be able to pull my cpu storage ram and motherboard off go get a brick power brick to take with me and then i'm going to pack them together i'm going to go but i don't need my gpu i feel like what they could have done is if they made it so that this whole platform has like extensions for all of your power you plug this little platform through here and then you can just slot this in all of the plugs are on the same side you slot it in you take it out power's delivered on the same side your pcie lanes on the same side then it's literally like you walk you go oh i need to get going somewhere yoink why are you taking this with you i don't know maybe a bike to work and like this is a little bit too much you take this to work with you like maybe you're in a co-working space and you have like important documents but you also have the same system like if you're a contractor maybe you want the small computer to take somewhere get a laptop yeah i know but maybe you want more power maybe you want this message from our sponsor see sonic seasonic's prime tx 1000 watt power supply is a great choice for high performance systems it features an 80 plus titanium rating which means less power gets wasted during power conversion the tx1000 is also fully modular and features hybrid fan control to control overall fan noise with fluid dynamic fan bearings plus it comes with a 12 year warranty 12 years if you're building a new system and looking for a power supply you can rely on you can trust sea sonic learn more about them on seasonic.com or through the links below they're always there if you enjoyed this video maybe go check out one of our mini itx builds they make kind of a bit more sense than this especially when you factor in how quick it would be to just unplug the gpu from it and take that with you on the go compared to all these cables you gotta fight with this thing
