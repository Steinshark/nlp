i decided this morning i wanted to wake up and i wanted all of us to become emotionally bruised so we found this lovely article on infoq which is obviously a website that's inspired by geoc cities and i read all these words in order might i add and when i read them in order my brain could not understand them together like every individual one i get but last time i checked my squeal ain't going to be touch in javascript okay so that's your squeal that's not mine nat loio let's go oracle re oracle recently announced that my squeal database server now supports javascript functions and procedures oh it's actually worse than i thought it was i thought they just had some sort of driver i actually just thought it was going to be a driver but it actually somehow is worse than i ever thought it was going to possibly be if you write a javascript function to run in my database i believe i should be allowed to attempt a roundhouse with your face in the middle of it this is unwelcomed this this is the white walkers javascript is officially an extent existential threat on all of program humanity we're going to need theon with his no energy to come in here do some juking get the white walkers all thinking we're weak then get arya in here to lay the final blow to javascript the introduction of javascript supports enables developers to implement advanced data processing logic within the database [music] yay oh i love stored procedures i just love them i just can't wait for more of them when you call like a magic function that you just have to go find somewhere in code and it's like loosely documented and you have no clue what's happening but now you can do a javascript by minimizing data movement between the database server and the client application stored functions and procedures can reduce latency network overhead and eages cost so one thing i do want to just throw out right away and i think this is probably a pretty good observation here a lot of the world is going serverless a lot of the world is refusing at least in the web world to learn anything other than typescript that means that how do you not do this serverless edge database talking back and forth business that's been kind of going on where you're going to have to make a request go get the data come back do some processing make another request have a bunch kind of like a bunch of kind of just a really chatty service well you would probably do it by this and since you don't have to learn yet another language and you can just remain in one single thing typescript i see the reason why they're doing this to me this is a play into the serverless sledge world in which you wish to kind of trap this forever ever only ever learn javascript crowd right i mean it's the same people that think you should only ever use an omm it's like yo dog a little bit of raw squeal can do can do a lot for you learn the squeal and then make a determination between like a stor procedure try out those for a little bit like feel the pain feel the pain in a pet project cuz here's the deal when you do stored procedures and all this they seem really amazing at first and then you start using them more and more and you realize this is hard this is really really hard and you find it to be not the promise that you thought it was once but instead you feel a little lied to at least i felt a little lied i'm not going to lie to you i felt a little lied to i thought it was going to be amazing and then it wasn't you think l would be amazing i i genuinely don't think you want to really here's my take on it it's not about javascript that making it bad it's the fact that we're moving back towards stored procedures i i worry a lot about stored procedures i understand the performance benefits and there really is a lot of performance benefits especially when the server for your database is not even on the same machine as your client server can we all agree to that yeah we can all agree to that that's that's an that's an obv but running v8 lua would have been a better choice cuz at least lua it would have prevented too much programming that's one really nice part about lua is that it's such a stupid language it prevents you from writing too much code stored procedures are the get subm modules of squeal i i i don't i don't agree with that statement actually the thing is is that subm modules sometimes do have a good use vendoring out a third party library sometimes is nice just to have it as a subm module it sucks it doesn't update frequently it's a stupid collision it's when you do stored procedures for your own code and they constantly collide then it's stupid or stored procedure and i'm getting them mixed up subm modules if you do subm modules for your own highly changing repo that everybody's using then it's super duper annoying but there can be some nice parts to submols i always feel like i want to love submols and every time i use them i hate them but i still want to keep on using them you know what i don't know what it is it's like i think i'm sick i think i'm twisted i think i'm broken austin groin senior principal software engineer at oracle and farhan tahid consulting member of technical staff wr the support of javascript stored programs will not only improve developer productivity by leveraging a large ecosystem more developers will now possess the necessary skills to write stored programs in other words organizations may now tap into the broader range of developer talent by utilizing a widely accessible javascript skill for backend development so my simple counter is this the expressiveness of a language determines how much code and abstraction you can write it's very important so that means the more expressive your code is the more potential for it to be complicated rust has some of the most complicated programs i think out there but they can be nice due to some of the ways in which rust has created it but to create the libraries is very in-depth javascript also is very simple to abstract and you can create some pretty impressive stuff but you need to ask yourself one question do you wish to have this level of expressivity in a database this is going to be dude that's such a good point steve dude oh my goodness i feel like all this cloudy stuff just leads to a bunch of vendor locking i feel like this is going to lead into even more vendor lockin the ultimate stored procedures greatest thing it's just going to be another amazing vendor lock in for a bunch of functionality you may or may not need how about they learn squeal now dude you can't just learn squeal okay it's really hard dude there's like select and where and it doesn't go like in the order of in your brain okay it it should be like from this table select that that but it doesn't even do that it goes the other way around so how am i ever supposed to learn this crazy language among the common use cases for the new feature let me hear it oracle highlights data extraction data formatting approximate search data validation ooh compression en coding and data transformation favorably received by the community the announcement provides an example of function where javascript code is embedded directly into the squeal definition create function gcd get done javascript a int b int returns in javas language javascript as give me the dollars let xmath abs abs give me those abs while abs abs yep this is exactly the code i want people to write this is what i would imagine database people write javascript like this is actually i mean there is some level of interest rate here it's just greatest common deviser okay it's not get done so data validation one could make a pretty reasonable argument that having validation on your client server i can't believe i'm saying that word out loud right i'm saying that group of words out loud and people are understanding what i'm trying to say here you have one spot in which validation happens and which everybody else has to pass through like i get the argument i get it compression struggling i'm struggling with that one i'm struggling with compression encoding struggling data transformation again struggle last thing you want to do is have to update your databases stored procedures cuz you want to make a small change to your transformation just use pi piper for your compression oh i cannot wait for react my squeal when a function is invoked using the traditional call statement an implicit type conversion occurs between squeal types and javascript types as per the documentation javascript support is based on the ecma 2021 standard and all variations of integers floating points and car var car types are supported grain and tah ad my squeal javascript integration uses a custom built vm for its specific use case to allow the best endtoend performance okay that's at least cool that they're not just just just ripping up a v8 running this customization is based on the gr vms ahead of time compilation where a language implementation is compiled down to the native binary representation for fast processing gr has its own javascript implementation based on the ecmascript 2021 standard the language implementation is competitive in terms of performance although it's implemented using polyglot framework the gr runtime includes jdk language implementations damn and manage virtual machine with sandboxing capabilities and tooling support while my squeal javascript is available in my squeal enterprise edition myque heatwave cloud service heatwave it's hot heatwave heatwave what a great name i need to call something heatwave heatwave i'm fairly disappointed by this entire thing my squeal is not the first open source relation database supporting javascript and stored routines with pv8 being the most popular javascript extension for pos pv8 is supported by all current releases of poar including manage services like amazon rds and can be used for stored routines and triggers no community edition that's an l select from table users where where my name dude you know this is coming like unironically this is going to happen you know that right my hdmx works great with my sill that's right because htx and my squeal are just two separate islands it's your code that puts them together i'm glad that it's the second day of the new year and not the first day because if it was the first day right now i think i'd be feeling a little bit more sad but i'm not because it's not the first day it's the second day so therefore you know the first day already happened i had mismatching socks i was called a racist unironically and now i'm reading about javascript i i think 2024 is going to be the worst year ever created for me personally i can already feel it happening stored procedure components oh okay come on guys let's not make jokes like that we don't need this wait for 2025 i feel good about 2025 yeah i just lost my phone in repair m can you be sad in listening to a loader loow high you're probably right articles like this make me kind of happy because it makes me feel like no matter how badly i goof someone somewhere has a worse idea it's pretty good it's a good way to look at it you know i always think the same thing except for i i i think it with long long like somewhere someone sat down and said we need a longer integer width than long and somebody's retort was why not long long and then everybody went along with it nobody was like guys wait a second i was thinking about our naming style in general since we're adding long long to begin with maybe we should consider just using bits you know this this whole standard int thing is going on right now and they're using a bunch of different bits you know maybe we should consider it and instead they're like nah long long we're going to abbreviate it capital l capital l capital o capital n capital g we're going to do a little type def long long equals long but you got to shout it long that's how we do it for the win like someone did that the name is the long long aen okay like like and subscribe to my long longs
