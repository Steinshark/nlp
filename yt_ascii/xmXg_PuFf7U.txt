what up gamers today we are reacting to other people reacting to coffeezilla now some of you might be confused steven why would you do that well recently guys i don't know if you noticed we made it into the twitch reactoverse okay what is that basically they're a bunch of really popular twitch streamers who will react to your content if it blows up enough and you know there's some people who will get mad about this right they get upset because usually these people will clip the videos up to youtube and sometimes they'll get a lot of views but i really i don't care honestly i love it it's kind of it's symbiotic because most people who are watching them may never have watched you and so you get exposed to a bunch of new audiences but more than that you know i've made reaction videos myself so i'm not mad about it it's a part of youtube and frankly all i'm doing here today ladies and gentlemen is i'm trying to get a piece of the pie for myself so we're going to react to them reacting to us and that way we can sort of judo some of the the views back in our favor here let's react guys first reaction looks like we got ludwig reacting to coffeezilla big fan of ludwig here been been an early supporter big omega lols if you fellow twitchers get my drift how do you do fellow kids sorry i'm still working on the twitch lingo oh this is actually one of the early videos ludwig may be an early coffeezilla fan that would be very meta it didn't steal from small time streamer ludwig so don't even look into that those are fake allegations interesting very interesting it's not what it looks like guys me having inspired copyzilla who is the person who found phase k now just k to have scammed people means that i'm the person who caught k whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa does that math check out let's do a little back of the napkin math here i'll let him have it old school ludwig fan i'll let him have this one that's the transitive property in action baby wow all right well that's first reaction next reaction gosh i'm so bad at this look i'm learning to react guys good reaction from ludwig i'd give that a 9 out of 10 reaction ladies and gentlemen you guys have been begging me to react to tech lead reacting to me let's get it over with i'm not going to make a full video about this let's just let's just do this by the way button this up hey guys welcome back okay let's talk about coffeezilla you know this guy is a psychopath okay wow this is a very serious thing and coffeezilla is ruining so many lives out there whoa what'd i ever do to deck lead oh that may be what i did this guy is mad it has become a concern for me and for all of society and i am concerned about the effects it is having on the people who watch his type of content coffee they misspelled it coffee that's good man i wish i had a beard like that dude now before we go any further i do want to tell you guys that this whole video that we're watching right now is all about how watching my content will make you a broke depressed loser but i do find it funny that tech lead dm to me like a few weeks before i caught his token to scam and said hey your channel's been fire lately even i've been enjoying to gaunt it and your 10 million dollar studio so to be clear tech lead is a massive fan marriage is a scam sure and people at coffee zilla will probably remain virgins their entire life screaming about how marriage is such a scam while other people are out there dating going out having kids having grandkids and wait i'm married am i not of the two of us correct me if i'm wrong i think i'm the only one married here how am i saying marriage is a scam i'm married what else does tech lead have to say about me and in fact some people have even alleged that coffeezilla is actually a registered offender whoa isn't that the slander that he deleted like on twitter then he's just putting it up that's funny is he saying that i'm a a virgin offender i'm pretty sure those two things are mutually exclusive i mean i'm no biology expert but i'm pretty sure you can't be amazing interesting reaction tech lead i'll give you a reaction six out of ten not bad could have been a little more consistent there next reaction oh hassan we got hassan next ladies and gentlemen this is my favorite rich socialist of all the rich socialists i like this one the best we get some easier investigations some low-hanging fruit here like more regular content i try to get that out to you on those bigger investigations thank you to all our newspapers gosh i'm annoying here let's get to get past me let's get to the reaction dude i think that the reason why these the reason why coffee still is like exploding is because one he's doing great content obviously every twitch streamer watches videos like every single one since he started doing i wonder if it's if it's correlated to that not me no no not me at all is hassan responsible for our growth listen guys this is what i said at the beginning of the video i'm not mad about people reacting because i actually think it does help he's got a point he really does because people get so upset about i've seen other youtubers i'm telling you this is a big gripe of youtubers when twitch streamers react to their content and i don't get it because i'm like if 30 000 people are watching i guess some people see it as like that's 30 000 people who won't watch my video if they're watching their video but i do think he's got a point where if all these new people are watching your content because these twitch streamers are reacting to you hello i have seen incredible growth when everyone just started reacting to me so i don't think it's a coincidence i kind of agree here you don't promote viewership as much as you think literally every single [ __ ] youtuber says that when twitch streamers watch them they [ __ ] spike well people are saying subdim is he not subbed assad let's be fair let's be fair am i subbed to hassan okay i can't talk hassan i'm subscribing to you you gotta do by the transitive property ludwig was talking about i'm pretty sure you have to subscribe too that's the transitive property in action baby good video by the way shout outs out to coffeezilla once again oh thank you thank you hassan shout outs to you my man hassan is actually a cool guy and he's kind of right about the reaction stuff people get mad but i agree i think it's i think it's stupid now our next reactor we're gonna look at here is a guy named xqc i hear he has his own language let's figure it out when's the reacting start dude when's the reacting started oh all the potatoes and all these guys wait hold on go back to make sure that people don't dump the coin automatically they're making a system people can't sell all at once so they were able the influencers the people that are early to instasell while all the other ones who were holding the bomb couldn't dump the potato the hot potato it's like a hot potato incredible analogy this is actually incredible i this is better better put than i think i put it in my own video and you're like oh my god i have a hundred but that was my hands like what you can do with this they're all hot ah right and then and then you're like i'm just gonna dump them and system goes dude imagine if my whole video was all about potatoes the whole thing was a giant potato analogy incredible you know what i like this i like this keep keep going we're this is an agriculture channel now and now the potatoes are put in your hands and now your hands are all completely burnt and that's their fans burnt hands need i say more ladies and gentlemen i feel like the hottest potato right now thank you xqc very cool reaction i think 10 out of 10 here by the way i didn't read hassan's hassan 8 out of 10 reaction but now it's time ladies and gentlemen to talk about the reaction that i've been looking forward to watching the most critical bless you crypto scams is that the i actually don't know about that i'm gonna watch that is that from coffee time what what did this man just call me big moist himself critical coffee time is that gonna be my name now but apparently the video from like a channel called coffee time hey hey do we change her name to coffee time if he yo what have we just changed our name it's like don't even bother relearning it we're just coffee time it is i've actually heard that before people go oh yeah like my friends they'll be like yeah you run a channel because a lot of my friends they don't like watch a lot of youtube and they're like yeah you just run that channel right like coffee time and i'm like sure too much reacting let's go more more watching i like watching beginning and the end of these things see how it is cause i can't just sit here and watch 17 minutes of a video with you guys not only sold save the kids in all right i've got the gist of it now wow guys this this one hurt a little bit he just clicked off the video what like 10 minutes in 15 minutes in all right p listen guys you can't win them all that i i'm just honored to be reacted to by critical and yes i now will answer to coffee time if he says it hey it's fine i'll give that reaction an eight right he didn't get through the whole video that's okay but good good reactions guys that there's your reaction what what'd you think of it do i have a career in
