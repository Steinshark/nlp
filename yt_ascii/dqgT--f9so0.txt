i'm doing 3d printing by this robotic arm it's driven by six axis compared with the conventional 3d printer it can have more flexibility you can print like this like this straight like this this movement because for the fiber reinforced 3d printed object the fiber geometry the fiber part is quite important but for conventional sweet printer it only can do blender printing so there are weakness between layers so that's why i develop those hardwares and also printing logic based on this robotic arm the conventional printing logic is print everything horizontally all the layers is planner but for this one two layers is valued because the robotic arm has six axis it can do it can do and blender layer printing this is the key layers so you can see at the beginning the layer is just a planner just like the conventional so it's printing it's logic it's flat yes but it's gradually changing to curl you see the curl is going deeper and deeper again yes so this can achieve two things one it will much stronger than that in that direction and second it can match the geometry object required so because the old surface is flat this controller is trying to bridge robotic arm and defector the main controlling device in this box is arduino and there are three main functions based on it one is receiving the signal from the robotic controller the second is controlling the temperature or the printing height there are heaters two heaters in this printing height it keeps heating and one temperature sensor which is connected to the arduino so by that it can make sure the printing height can keep specific temperature and for the another the third function is for the motor controlling this motor speed can determine the extruding velocity and this height is only for testing the two parts i just generated and this is the official 3d printing height it has three different resolution heights the resolution for this one is only 0.4 millimeters which is for worry is shooting this is 0.6 is for carbon fiber reinforced polymer and this is thicker maybe also for same material or different material with different resolutions so three heads can bring more flexibility during the printing it can switch different heights during the printing process we can achieve very accurate locate the specific materials maybe especially for carbon fibers so this is the filament this extruder can push this filament until the hot end it will melt and it should extrude out for this one there will be three filaments for each of them so we can switch it during the printing when we print something in some part we want to make a reinforce make it much stronger because maybe this part is a connection with other devices so that's the part we need more carbon fiber and carbon fiber look a location is also determined by the mechanical property analysis we do that software and to know which part is a weak part and we want more carbon fibers and for the other part maybe we can use normal material for example pig for the carbon fiber reinforced peak filament that is quite strong but it's quite expensive and for other parts we all use peak this is pra very normal material for the test i'm testing with single height and with very common material and later i will switch to peak and carbon fiber so this material is also different from here so this is aluminum it's only for the normal materials for pla or abs but this one is frozen it can it can do the peak printing test but maybe for the long long time using it's not a good choice later i will switch to other material yeah especially for for peak and carbon fiber this is a two-part generation because all those are curves i divide all the curves into points each point i can set one comment location for comment for the robot column so it will just follow points by point and then to achieve following this curve can we see it do some printing start printing right yeah yeah okay until i started shooting working enough for this project three years so right now the extruder is printing following the logic i designed you see the head is not always pointing to the ground just because it's following the surface curvature this movement can make sure the nozzle always vertical with a printed surface so that can make sure the connection much stronger with a conventional 3d printer it can even it's always pointing to the ground it can achieve this geometry but connection won't be very form so that's the reason i'm using six axis robot car if the robot is actually here it would probably say that i might be here i might be here or i might be here by van jacobson one of the great creators of the internet he's one of the men who made the internet work and helped
