in today's digital world one pair transforms the simple pixels on your screen into stunning interactive websites and that pair is html and css in today's video you'll be learning the fundamentals of html where by the end of it you'll use your new skills to start recreating the home page of the most iconic website in the world google so let's get started in my last video i gave you guys a high overview of web development where we talked about the front end and the back end it also helped you guys set up your ide where at the end of the video we had our first website and if you haven't watched that video i strongly recommend you to check it out anyways before we get started make sure you have vs code downloaded and also the live server extension since this extension will make our lives so much easier since it automatically updates our website whenever we make changes to our code i'll leave the download link for vs code down in the description okay now let's get started just like in the last video we're going to create a folder and this time we're going to name this folder google underscore homepage open that folder in vs code and then in that folder create a new file called index.html and like i said in the last video make sure it's index.html if it's anything else it's not going to work the reason we name it index.html is because when the browser accesses a website it needs a starting point so it needs a file that it needs to load first in that file as well index.html it's the default file name that browsers look for so whenever you go on google.com it's actually searching for google.com index.html so what happens if we don't have an index.html file so if we don't have this file when the browser sends a request to access it and it doesn't get anything the browser is either gonna display an error or it's going to show a list of all the files in that current directory or it's just going to use a backup file which is where something like 404 comes in yeah so the more you know anyways let's go back to the index.html file so in that file type exclamation point and then you'll see two autocomplete suggestions pick the first one and then now you'll see this file all filled out what you're looking at now is html html stands for hypertext markup language it defines the structure and content of our web pages so on websites when you see the text the images and videos that's all html okay so going back to the index.html file let me explain what we have so far okay so the first part that says doctype html all that's doing is letting the web browser know what version of ht ml we're using as of right now the latest version is html5 now underneath that we have the html element it's also known as the root element of the html document and all that means is that every other element that's inside of this html document will be a descendant slash child of it as for the part that says lang equals en right next to it that stands for language and all that's doing is letting the web browser know well what language this webpage is going to be and this helps the accessibility for our websites because it helps technologies like screen readers the next element we have is the head element this is where we put important metadata about our web page and all that means is just important stuff that we'll need for our web page to render correctly in the browser that's why you see those two meta elements underneath it that first meta element that says car set that's our character encoding and this is important because we need to make sure that our web page will display special symbols and characters from different languages the last meta element helps us display our web page correctly so that it doesn't look all ugly on different devices now the last element we have here is the title element and this is what gets displayed on browser tabs there's a lot of other things that we can put inside of this head element but we'll talk about that later and last but not least is the body element this is the area where we'll display all our content for our web page so all our texts all our images all our videos will be inside of this body element all right now that we're done with that let's actually start writing some html press the go live button in the bottom right of vs code to actually open up your website and currently it's just a white page so let's change that inside the body element i want you to type whatever you want and once you're done i want you to save the file with ctrl s or command s and if you notice right as you saved this actually updated our website and that's because of our live server extension let's make our texts a little bit more fancy we're going to transform our text into an h1 element now this whole time i've been saying tags and elements but you're probably wondering what that is almost all html elements are comprised of three pieces the opening tag the content and then the closing tag opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an html element they're comprised of a key word that's enclosed in angle brackets closing tags tell the browser where an element ends they're almost the same as opening tags where the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword and between the opening tag and the closing tag is the content of the element you can think of html elements as containers for content since the opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains and the browser can use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content so knowing that let's create our h1 tag the h stands for heading so first the opening tag we put h1 and angle brackets and then we put the content inside and now we put the closing tag now save the file again and now our text is a little bit more fancy html has a lot of tags that exist and it's important to understand when to use the correct tag for two main reasons the first reason is seo or search engine optimization and this is simply just making your website better for search engines like google yahoo bing and all that stuff the second reason once again is accessibility since some hd tml tags help technologies like screen readers and this whole area of optimizing the tags you use is called semantic html if you want me to make a video on that let me know but for now the basic html tags that only contain text that i recommend you know since you usually see these a lot are headings paragraphs spans and lists you'll usually see these ones a lot when it comes to text so now that you know that let's start customizing this webpage a little bit more now i want to make a new section in our web page just underneath our h1 tag and the common way that we do this is the div tag the div tag stands for division and this tag is very important for you guys to know i recommend you guys get real comfortable with this one so let's create our empty div our opening tag and now our closing tag alright now in this section i'm going to cover some more special html elements the first one is a button so insider empty div element let's add our button opening tag button closing tag and inside of it just right click me and this this is pretty straightforward the button is just a clickable button it's pretty obvious why this one's important now the next thing is adding links to our web page links send us to other html pages on the web which is why it's called the web now to add a link in our web page we're going to use the anchor tag now underneath the button opening tag anchor closing tag and in between them add whatever you want once again save the page right now the link doesn't do anything because we haven't told it where to go so we can do this using an html attribute html attributes give more information to our elements and we always add these attributes in the opening tag attributes are usually just two parts the name of the attribute and a value but not all attributes need a value for our situation we need to add an href attribute to our anchor tag and that stands for hyperlink reference and the value for this attribute is wherever we want it to link to so in your href attribute just add whatever value you want to give it just copy and paste a random url save the page again and now click your link you can also link videos pdfs images and other stuff but for the most part you'll mainly be linking to other web pages now if you wanted to open this in a new tab we just add another html attribute called target and it's going to have the value of underscore blank now i also have this rel attribute but i want you to do your own research for that one generally there's two different types of links for this the first one is linking to pages on other websites on the internet and the second one is linking to pages on our own website when we link to pages on other websites on the internet that's called absolute links i used an absolute link for my href value and you probably did too absolute links consist of these parts the protocol the domain and the path an absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination as for relative links those are links to pages within our own website the main difference between relative links and absolute links is that relative links don't need to include the domain name and this is because the web browser is smart enough to know that if this is a page on the same website then the domain name is going to be the same so the way we link both pages together is we instead use the file path let's actually create a relative link right now so first we need to create a new page so inside the folder create another file and we'll call this one about html and just like the other page type exclamation point pick the first option to autocomplete and inside the body we're going to create an h1 element and inside of it we'll write about now save everything once again go back to the index.html file and we're going to create another anchor tag so underneath the first anchor tag let's create a new one and this time we'll call this one to about page now here's where the difference is for our href attribute the value is going to be the html file we just made so for our value here we're going to write about dot html now save the file and click our new link and it should send you to our about page now this works because the index and the about page are in the same directory this is why we can just use about.html as the value but with bigger projects we want to organize our files a bit better so let's organize our files and let's make this a bit more practical okay so usually we'll leave index.html where it's at in the root directory but now we're going to create another directory just for our other pages so create another folder and name that pages and then move the about.html file inside of pages now save your changes and then if you've noticed we actually broke a relative link and that's because this about.html is in a new location so now we have to update our anchor tag to now pages slash about.html now this is the reason why it's called a relative link since the location is relative to the file that we're currently on now with the way we wrote this relative link most times it's going to work because sometimes we can still run into some unexpected issues so a better way of doing this is instead of just pages we're going to add a period and a slash before pages so it's going to be dot slash pages slash about.html and the reason this is better is adding this period in slash we're telling the code that it should look for the file relative to the current directory that we're on okay so that's mainly everything you need to know about link things let's start talking about images okay so in order to display an image in html we use the image tag now remember how i said almost all html elements have three parts well image elements don't need a closing tag and for html elements that don't need a closing tag those are called self-closing elements so in order to make an image element all we do is just angle brackets image and that's it and since image elements can't have a closing tag then we can't put content inside of it so it only has an opening tag now adding an image is pretty similar to links where we use an html attribute to give it the information for an image we use the source attribute images also use absolute links and relative links where we have two ways of doing it either one we just link an image from another website or two we provide the image from our own website so it's the same thing as links so if you have an image you want to use from another website copy and paste the image url into the value for our source attribute and if you want to do it relative way then create an image folder to stay organized download an image move that image into the image folder and then for the source value it's going to be the path to the image now the last thing about images is the all attribute the all attribute is used to describe an image so it's going to be used whenever an image can't be loaded and it's also for accessibility so for people with screen readers it's going to describe the image instead okay so that's mainly everything that you need to know about images so let's talk about the last html elements that you'll usually see and those elements are forms and inputs forms let us send information to servers so we can send information like our usernames and passwords what we want to search up on google and all that stuff and inputs are the actual elements that we type into and select and if you really want to be a good web developer there's also labels and these describe the inputs they make the forms more accessible and user friendly let's create a really simple form real quick okay so underneath the image we're going to do the following create our form element so opening tag form closing tag inside of our form we're going to add our label opening tag label closing tag and inside side of it type search and underneath our label we're going to make our input element and just like images inputs are self-closing so all we need is an opening tag so opening tag input and we're done and last but not least we need a submit button so underneath the input we're just going to create a button so opening tag button closing tag and inside of it we'll just say search and now to fully finish the form i'm going to add some attributes and i want you guys to research what they're doing since i want you to get into the habit of just researching things you don't know but some of these attributes are pretty intuitive so you probably know what they're doing now that's all you need to know about forms and inputs for now because we'll come back to these later on since they do become very important all right now let's talk about one more thing if you notice so far we indent any elements that are inside other elements and this is known as nesting when we nest our elements we create what's known as a parent and child relationship between them where the nested elements are the children and the element that they are nested within is the parent okay so that was the fundamentals of html i covered all the elements that you'll most likely see but if you want to dive deeper or you're still feeling a bit lost i'll leave some resources in the description but now you should also be able to just google any questions that you have or just you know get chat ebt to do all your work so now let's start actually making google's homepage i'm gonna go through this like how i usually think just to get you an idea of what it's like creating something so first things first let's look at the home page if you notice on google's homepage there's three main sections the top the middle and the bottom and if you really want to be specific we have the header the body and the footer so this means we need three sections in our web page so i'm going to get started by making three empty divs one for each section so let's look at the top area right now so looking at the top we have about store gmail images and then two icons we'll worry about the icons later for now let's just do the text and each of these text elements seem to be links so this means we have to use anchor tags so inside of this first div let's just create four anchor tags now the next thing is the href attribute so i'm just going to copy and paste where these links take us but if you notice two of them are on the left and the other two on the right so that means there's two different sections so we'll use two developments to represent the left side and the right side now put the anchor elements inside the proper divs okay now for the last two elements the icons these are images so really we can just find random images on the internet and just use them and these images are on the right side so we're going to put these in the right div now underneath the anchor elements we're going to put two image elements and for the source attribute just find any images that fit what you want and for the profile picture you can really use whatever you want all right now we finished everything for the top half let's move on to the middle looking at the middle there's two main parts the google logo and then the search bar so this means there's going to be two sections for this one for the logo and one for the search bar so in the div for our middle section you're going to create two elements an image for the logo and a form for the search bar you can use whatever source value you want for this logo since at the end of the day it's your code but if you want to be perfect you can just use a random google logo on online so let's look at the form now we'll worry about the icons later but for now we see that there's an input and two buttons so inside our form element we're going to create an input and then two buttons bonus points if you add a label to the input now for the icons you can just once again find them online and since there's three icons make three image elements okay so that's everything for the middle section let's move on to the bottom now now as you can see there's seven links so that means seven acre tags so inside our div element for the bottom section let's just create seven anchor elements now for the href attribute you can do whatever you want once again i'm just going to use where the links take us on google's homepage now if we look closer at the bottom section there's also three main parts the left the middle and the right so that means we have to make three divs for each section so create the three divs and then move the anchor tags in the right area so three anchor tags would be at the top one acre attack should be in the middle and the other three should be at the bottom and there we go we technically made a google's homepage now there's definitely some improvements we can make in the structure but i'll let you guys figure that out now even though it doesn't look like google's homepage technically it is it's just missing the styles from css and we'll cover that in the next video so until then practice your html look at the resources i left and see you in the next video
