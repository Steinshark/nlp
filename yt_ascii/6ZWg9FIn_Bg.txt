all right emergency stream it's emergency something is going on that's a little bit wild here look at this so this anon 2.0 says what kind of [ __ ] are these [ __ ] promoting in the name of open source misleading people into making spam prs in the main expressjs repo look at this update read me update read me update read me update read me update read me update read me update read me update read me and look at this if you go onto the expressjs it is literally just update read me just nonstop hello i am new to github please accept my poll request you can compliment you can just compliment my text here smiley face damn not only is not only are you new to github but apparently you're new to syntax as well this is wild oh my goodness i love you too did you see what i just looked at okay what do we got here let's look at a couple of these example it actually doesn't even make any sense we're at two for two it doesn't even make any sense then there's apparently this video right here all right so apparently this is on 2x and she's [laughter] describing okay so so far this looks like an education okay hold on this this looks like an educational video just hold hold hold on let her cook let her cook just let her cook for a second i can't understand anything she saying looking at what she's doing you kind of wait did you see that did you see that hold on did you see that people are making unnecessary changes making reest do not request on essentials that little last part there i don't know if you saw the last part it's kind of hard to read the the the subtitles here it says the subtitle says there is also a limit of uh limit on the number of new users cannot create requests because he too must have experienced such a such people are making unnecessary changes in making poll requests and creating and we will never have to face those do not request on essentials yeah dude the subtitles are totally effed up subtitles are totally effed up but is that is that supposed to be like like hold on hold on am i am i misreading that i don't i don't don't think the subtitles are true it so am i mis am i misunderstanding this or was this literally someone trying to teach a college about how to make an open- source poll request and then all the people who've never done it acd like didn't real like they're so new to programming in general that they never actually like translated in their head that they're not supposed to go and do that go find the you guys go find the original video you guys link it to me is that what's happening dang and then this is what expressjs has to deal with let's see what they got on this one okay so they they've been able to kind of they're able to like prevent any more issues from being opened ap college it means our college it's not a real college okay well what happened i mean is it an online one i i have no idea let's see this is a gem dang so add comment in res status method if code is of typ string or float with fractional part then log to pass proper integer i mean that's not technically that's not technically wrong looks good to me i mean i'm a little bit surprised that this one didn't get at least it's correct at least it's a it's a valid pr at least it actually is going oh wow so this is like a really really really long one and then at some point within here shows you how okay so this is just get and get h to oh that windows that windows 11 to development okay so this is this is literally just it's just a git development going on here is it towards the end it must have been towards the beginning i must have oh no it's right yeah it's like right here huh i don't think i can read these subtitles i don't i don't think i got it guys i don't think i got this i don't think i i got this but this is just like truly an unfortunate situation this is just a tutorial she's an educator and teaching about getting get her but people blindly follow her in pursuit of that making such commits will lend them jobs okay okay does she say i mean i can't tell like by the ending in the the really weak translations it looks like it says something along the lines of don't just make nonsense prs make good prs and if you make good prs then you get job is that like what it what it what it says note do not create prs or issues on the official repository of projects as it is unprofessional try to test all things in your own repo that was five months ago oh my goodness man you know so i'm g we're going to do a little bit of advice here just a little bit of advice for anyone that's that's looking at this when it comes to open source repositories you should really try to get to know the people that are working on it you should try to be involved in the project often they have especially like nowadays there's almost always a discord associated with every project be a part of the conversations really get to know people and that way when it actually comes time to like wanting to get involved you have the relationships you have the understanding you've asked questions you've made movements towards all those things so that way when you do actually try to make a pr it's a meaningful good pr bros stop trying to defend her i don't see anything she's done wrong right like i cannot tell anything about what she's done wrong i obviously i can't speak whatever language i can't read whatever language she is saying i so i don't know i have no idea let's see this teacher is the sort of part of the big scam in in name of upskilling oh interesting they took $75 for a basic ass course in hmail css and a little bit of js in india where the average income is around 8 to $10,000 per year dude please yeah i don't the thing is i don't know anything about this channel the whole clash started from there's a link okay interesting interesting this is getting deeper this is getting deeper because so far what i read so far like based on only what i've seen i wouldn't i like i wouldn't be like oh like i i would not be i would not assume this person has bad intent right i have no i have no i have no proof yet of bad intent yeah this looks like people just trying to find a shortcut to get a job okay hold on all right so a few things have been happening in open source there's some sort of a controversy that that was sort of inevitable if i'm being honest so in this video i'm going to talk about a few dos and don'ts if you're thinking of contributing to open source what are the controversies that are happening how okay so this is just this is just dos and don'ts i mean this looks this doesn't look like this is not a video that's actually getting us uh any closer to what's going on here hold on let's let's go right here bottom here that there of bad things that i'm being tagged on happy to take the blame for it as i said but poting open source i think i am to blame for it but then even digital o is to blame for it no one could have predicted that you know trying to do something good could lead to so much bad it's been 6 months since i've made that last video every video of mine has had huge disclaimers like 2 minute disclaimers guys please don't do it the wrong way do it the right way the maintainers of these projects don't like it i've personally been a maintainer in one of these projects and it i'm a little bit confused by what you saying he's just like hey i'm to blame but don't worry about not blaming and i put a bunch of disclaimers in all this it's pretty painful to look at 30 full requests and get tagged persistently on issues where people have left obvious things and not fix them so just don't make these contributions and lastly there's a stark difference in the day z versus day one attitude of maintainers when i put out a video and i talk to the maintainers on day zero everyone's really happy because the project has suddenly reached github trending they're seeing so many people come in the community and talk so day zero every contributor is happy day one when 30 p requests get put out in the same day is when people tend to realize this is a little unmanageable and then if it keeps on happening for a month is people don't like the fact that the project that's a really good point dude that's such a good i mean i i do like his point that he's saying that on day zero when you say something really nice about a project everyone's all super happy but then when you get into tons and tons of requests coming in saying hey you need to you need to like here look at my change hey look at my change hey look at my change that it becomes like a huge pain i mean i mean these are all interesting points i guess the problem is i have no i we don't have any background on this you guys keep saying oh no trust us oh no trust us no trust us like what i'm seeing right now see the very first part right here the context okay we'll jump over to the context there are a few videos that a few youtubers made which was were related to you know a lot of indians contributing to open source not the right i don't think it's a lot of indians i think it's just simply don't do it this way what's not the right way making a lot of typo changes documentation changes filling up 40 50 po requests in one day tagging a lot of maintainers creating a lot of issues in their heads making the lives generally of maintainers very miserable i have personally been a maintainer and sort of seen this firsthand do i understand the problem the reason this problem sort of happened was because there's a wave of two things in india one you can get a t-shirt vi hob fest two you might get a job if you contribute to open source this led to a lot of indians sort of flocking to these organizations and making bad contributions so that's what's happening this has been happening for a while now it's only that it's come to light now a little too much thanks to people making videos on it so let's talk about if you are still thinking of contributing to open source which if i'm being honest okay yeah i don't think this isn't you know i don't feel like this is getting any any us any closer to to the things you know at the end of the day like this i mean to me this looks like a true just oopsy daisy and it sounds like some people are really upset and some people really deeply dislike whoever this apna college is i don't know anything about apnic colge so i can't say positives or negatives about it i know it's related to the crux of the issue but it's not the issue it's i'm not even sure if it's related to the c i mean the hard part is yeah sure may maybe this guy i mean the problem is is just like he's trying to say and he's trying to kind of defend himself that he didn't think people would go and do whatever they did so i kind of said this before and i'm going to say it again here's the here's the the truest what i think is the real problem here the real problem is that we say hey don't hey don't don't don't don't do all this open source stuff don't do open source for a job don't do any of this stuff don't you know none of these things help you know blah blah blah blah blah blah they say all these things but at the other side we also see people being celebrated for open source getting dream jobs because of open source all these positive things are happening to them and so people get this idea especially beginners who don't understand the entire problem they're going to go off and get this really weird perception yeah chat qu quit being a bunch of dummies right now and so it's like i don't see this as any i don't see any malevolence in this right and so when you especially like you know like there's a lot of people that that will back this up that in india it's a tough time to get a job as a software engineer right you have tons of people flooding into the market and the available jobs are much smaller than bigger and so you have a lot of talent coming in and you have a minimal amount of jobs you have an entire supply chain issue and then you tell people or people see or people go on the internet and see people who have the dream jobs who contribute to open source they see people doing all these things and what happens of course they're going to think it's natural to think this is how you do it supply and demand not a supply chain yeah this is not a supply chain problems it is it is most certainly a supply versus demand so basically apna saw okay hold on so apna college saw this as a punch and they punched back source i bought both their courses and hakarat is a genuine af by a long shot okay yeah but i don't see what i don't know what you mean by i we've seen literally no punch backs from ap i don't i don't i don't have any of that information i don't think there is yeah i don't think there's racis i don't think there's racism in that statement that it's tough in india that's not that's that's a geographical statement by itself statement but plain truth can't be called plain racism either as a beginner what what they don't realize is that good prs are just as open as bad ones are when i recruit if i see bad pr the guy is out of my mind that very moment resume dropped yeah yeah i don't that you don't like guys stop being dumb is let's see it is the dream job not let's see is the dream job not thing not just cor correlation isn't causation so people who contribute to oss and get dream jobs yeah i mean but that's again that causation versus correlation is an extremely extremely diff ult thing for people to sus out you know when you see the same thing happen a bunch of times it's very simple especially when you don't understand something to to make this okay it's not like people just sit there completely analytical at all points in their life you know when you're trying hard and you really wish you had a job and you're scraping by you're at the bottom of the barrel guess what you're going to try as much things that come across okay you're not going to sit there and be like well actually you know when you really think about it this actually this could give a rise to the old correlation versus causation problem right like nobody is going to ain't ain't nobody going to just like go through this nice gentle thought process like when i was poor as [ __ ] and i was eating $2 a day for meals downstairs guy threatening to murder me and my brand new freshly married hot wife you know like things were really hard and i was working like 80 to 100 hours a week and i was doing the best i can to provide and just just barely scraping by so guess what if open source would have been something that i've just seen over and over again guess what i would have done i would have probably tried to commit to open source of course i would have like you know i just try to put myself in these people's shoes because it's so easy to jump in and think ah these people are somehow malicious they're somehow being bad i think they're literally just thinking they see an opportunity to close the the gap and actually have something better in life so please come on and also you know don't don't say stupid things like with racism and all that okay it just makes you look dumb okay you know this clearly this clearly ain't about racism okay come on come on people come on come on come on open source prs are the way to get noticed and prove that you can oh my goodness that you can do things this is a common in a lot of countries where just based on the country you are not taken seriously interesting interesting i see see this this whole perception i think is where a bit of the danger lies you know what i mean like this is where a bit of the danger lies because open source prs are a way that's true it is a way to get noticed absolutely it's a it's a way to prove that you can do things sure it is one way but there's a lot of risks involved with it as well and a lot of people end up working their entire life on open source and guess what their life isn't great they didn't they didn't get anything good yeah here hold on who is this guy sorry i it's oopsies i just pinned it [ __ ] unpin unpin this message okay hold on who who we who we banning who we banning let me see what what do we got here i live in india this is a third world country where most people live in a very rural villages who are suddenly on the internet contact creators need to explain things in a way their audience understands you cannot create content and assume your audience is sophisticated it isn't let's see it simply isn't in this part of the world this this is like taking a 17th century barely literate american peasant and teaching them github without qualifiers i mean i mean the problem is is there is some level of truth to that in the sense that if you have no experience teaching somebody something could make them think that there's a there's a zero like a zero to 60 gap but to say that this comparison is probably pretty far off like i understand what you're trying to say maybe rethink about what you're trying to say here where when someone doesn't have any context at all it's very easy to get to get things wrong and this is the thing and here's the deal this isn't a problem with india this is not some indian exclusive problem you don't think all of the people coming out of america from these boot camps aren't doing the same [ __ ] india kind of a big place i hear there's literally a billion people like are literally boot campers all flying out right now that are just absolutely struggling that's more than 10 absolutely more than 10 absolutely more than 10 less than seven billion i know that i think the thing is is that you got to have grace like it it it feels like everybody in this chat is just looking for like the worst possible stuff you know try to give grace to people and what they're trying to say and try to understand what they're trying to say even if they don't say it in the the best way you know like there's way better ways to say things to tell people that have never ever contributed to open source who are just starting to learn tech and to give them this carrot is a bad intific like that's a good way to say it saying it that other way whoever said it it was not very good you know what i mean it's not very good i don't like it at all it seems the a was already there because they think apnic college is a scam then this happened yeah if you already think apnic college is a scam then you're already going to there's like a whole bunch of baked baked into the cake there you know what i mean not exclusive to india but it but india has a big population of devs of all level across the world comparatively yeah there might be an absolute larger number you know because like real talk let's just say there's the same percentage of devs in india as there is america that literally means there's like five times absolute more devs from india than there is from america which means that by like just accidental statistics and us doing causation versus correl remember all that causation first correlation talk we did earlier you by you know correlation looking at it and seeing on average more than you do you make that dumb mistake right it's true this isn't a limited this isn't limited to india i've seen these type of prs from americans as well but the difference is in population and technology advancement normalization see i i don't i can't i don't know how much of this is or is not true might be a part of why people assume the problem is with india there might also be a cultural difference in europe we are very cautious and there is an expectation to understand something more in depth before trying to accomplish anything that might be a different culture in india yeah i i can't speak to that i mean it's it's a good point like sometimes people sometimes sometime i've seen so many people get heated in exchange and then you'll see like how that it's just like purely like a cultural difference in communication
