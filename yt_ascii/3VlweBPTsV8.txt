your 80,000 hours count now let's get back to the video thanks sponsored gotham this game was played by one of the current superstars of chess in india prag nand ramish babu prague is currently playing in prague i'm not joking he is playing in prague p r a g u e the city in the czech republic his opponent is vincent kaima from germany and you're just going to want to enjoy this game i'm not a huge fan of you know making videos with one game in them i do it you know a decent amount with like low elo chess and every now and then with highle chess but yeah for this one we can just sit back relax and maybe one day chess.com will fix this new bug where our letters get cut off so his name is pr cuz the g's are getting cut off here here we go frog open the game with e4 it's classical game of chess they have 90 minutes on the clock and since it's a long game vincent kimer plays e4 e5 we have knight f3 knight c6 all standard stuff and now bishop to c4 and black here can play bishop c5 or knight f6 generally at the high level black does not play anything else knight f6 and so now a lot of newbies would play knight to g5 going for knight takes f7 very typical stuff for i mean it's it's not even a bad opening at the high level you just have to know your stuff for amateur level knight to g5 going for fried liver is very common but at the high level they just kind of play the position slowly so d3 defends the pawn in the center of the board black develops the bishop to c5 and white castles i mean look top like even top level chess mirrors lowlevel chess i mean you you're supposed to put pawns in the center knight and bishop and castle right and now vincent plays a6 which is an interesting move generally the setup here for black is to play a6 d d6 you could play d6 now a6 or a5 control white's advancement on the queen side and both of these moves get the bishop out of the center where you know white's plan is generally to play c3 d4 because white has not actually moved the knight to c3 whereas black did they had to do that to defend the pawn in the center so these are kind of like the meta strategies of the position so white plays c3 right white plays c3 looking for b4 and looking for d4 vincent gets the bishop out of the center so it's a sniper from a distance white plays a4 taking space and preventing black from playing b5 also opening up the same idea for their bishop rook e1 defending the pawn in the center of the board in order to enable a future pawn to d4 black castles and now white plays this move h3 right preventing bishop to g4 this position has been reached like thousands of times thousands and thousands and thousands of games have been played in this position vincent kimer now plays a move that he himself has played before he played this move in 2022 but but it's a move that now takes the amount of games played in this position to less than 10 so from thousands to less than 10 black can play a lot of things h6 you know like like there's a million different types of setups here he plays knight h5 so vincent is responsible for really the only other major game in the database to play knight h5 and he played it two years ago against grandmaster andre vitan from ukraine at the douglas isle of man grand swiss there was a tournament there and i only know this because i analyzed this before and i did my homework knight h5 is just a very provocative move trying to activate the queen trying to activate the knight and also trying to play f5 in the future as long as you're not going to be hanging your king which by the way should be legal i'm just going to say this right now it should be legal to hang your king and chess like if if if you want to play f5 here and lose you should be able to do that anyway knight h5 and in that that game two years ago white went uh bishop g5 and now the knight went back and you may ask why would black do that why would black repeat well what black wants to do is use the bishop as a battering ram so for example knight bd2 like well that would that would be very terrible not not not h5 what black wants to do is actually play g5 like in a lot of positions you want to go here and you want to start attacking white on this side of the board so it's almost like a bait like you you're kind of like baiting your opponent into playing this move right prong however plays d4 so vincent has only ever had this position once and his opponent went here prague plays d4 and so now we we are in a situation where there is only one ever game played in the database and that person went here retreating the bishop i told you this is sort of black's idea black is baiting in the dark squ bishop and is saying i'm going to you know i'm going to push you out and now prag danda instead of playing bishop g3 and retreating plays knight takes g5 that's bold knight takes g5 is one of the most iconic sacrifices in chess where you sack the knight for two pawns you maintain a pin and the enemy king is open and this this is a good exchange in several situations in situations where only the queen is able to defend the pin knight if the bishop was here this would be idiotic but when the queen has the guard it's a lot harder for black to move another moment where this is good is if white can get a very quick queen f3 so if white can get a few pieces over to help quite fast this sacrifice is pretty good and of course black has to be castell so prague sacrifices the knight and basically says make a move make a move do something right because because white is going to go here here queen f3 so just so you understand if king g7 rook e3 right let's say like pawn takes d4 rook f3 or rook g3 and white is winning like white just immediately wins because white just gets the knight back right away so black needs to act right now the computer recommends immediately shredding open the position and then you know preventing rook e3 if here here rook a3 uhoh uhoh uhoh uhoh king g7 knight c3 knight d5 and i mean all of a sudden the computer's reconsidering so you got to be really really careful vincent plays king h7 now he played that move instantly so clearly vincent actually knows the position vincent knows this sacrifice prag thinks for a bid plays queen f3 you'll notice that prague's time spend of five minutes and you know 3 minutes you he's probably so somewhat knowledgeable in this maybe he vaguely remembers this from some sort of analysis but he's probably on his own now vincent has to go king g6 this is crazy look at this he sacrifices a knight and then he has to walk the king to defend the knight and not just defend the knight it's not just defend the knight he's also threatening the bishop the king triumphantly walks out and then immediately scurries back to safety where he will no longer be under any threat so the black king is out on g6 this is insane prague plays bishop h4 and the idea of bishop h4 was to get out of danger and threaten queen g3 so now the queen is coming in the rook is coming in at this point vincent takes on d4 because that prevents rook e3 and also enables knight e5 so it's a very tense position and prague is down two points he's down a knight for a pawn and right now black is doing an excellent job defending himself so what is pag going to do in this position gives a check on g3 king goes back to h7 now if prague goes queen f3 they're not going to make a draw they're not going to make a draw you know what's going to happen knight e5 boink you get forked so you can't do that so king h7 now prague plays bishop g5 so he sneaks forward a little bit he wants to play queen h4 check which would be absolutely devastating it's a perfect move bishop g5 with the intention of queen h4 and again queen h4 would be decisive because you threaten the knight and you have queen h6 mate so bishop g5 vincent rook h8 that's vincent's first thought right like it seems like he he was familiar with the position he plays rook h8 rook h8 is crazy what does rook h8 even begin to do what rook h8 does is if you give a check i now get my king here and you can't go queen h6 so rook h8 anticipates the check and rook h8 is literally an example of call an ambulance call an ambulance but not for me for you so rook h8 now prog things plays knight d2 right prog is getting a night into the game he has to now the funny thing is is he's not even taking this pawn back he he knows that time is of the essence he needs to bring another piece to the party he has bishop d3 ideas he has knight f3 ideas it's a moment in time here right black here can play knight e5 which is definitely the most natural move i think vincent didn't like this probably because of something like rook a3 this same idea of bringing the rook it's a very dangerous position cuz white is just going to very quickly get some pieces over here and by the way you see how this pin is just eternal but vincent comes up with a brilliant defensive idea of his own vincent plays queen g8 rook h8 and queen g8 look at this giving up the knight completely the knight is just completely for free now but you can't take it because if you do i play queen g3 fg3 every time a piece moves in chess something opens now you get hit with this and that bishop is a sniper and you're going to lose your knight and the rook is hanging so you cannot play bishop f6 so what do you do because if you give black a couple more moves he's going to bring in the heavy artillery he's going to unwind and he's he's up a piece so prague plays the most important move of the game thus far prague plays e5 that is such an important move and he seizes the control back from black now that the queen sid stepped from the pin over here the black king is stuck the black king is stranded a little bit e5 is a ruthless move opening up this diagonal deflecting a defender potentially from the center opening up the rook whatever takes that center is going to open up and enabling knight e4 so you enable this move which you didn't have previously now black has to think you'll notice vincent spent 40 minutes on queen g8 this is the danger of top level preparation vincent had a very sharp line prepared and he didn't remember all the details so now your 20 moves into the game and you have to play queen g8 and now now now that's bad and prague just jumps on e5 now vincent plays knight h5 blocking the king and threatening the queen so now the queen's got to go if bishop d3 the king is going to run to safety so now after knight h5 you have queen h4 another perfect move right queen h4 now black can defend himself with queen g6 or king g6 or king g7 he plays queen g6 now prague is still down a full piece 1 two 3 1 2 3 4 and it yeah you feel it okay because if white falls asleep at the wheel for a second white's going to get busted up so he has to play perfectly so he does he plays bishop f6 what bishop f6 does is of course it threatens the rook but it also defends the center it also removes escape squares for the king it also opens the g 5 square for the knight it also opens up the g file for the rook potentially in the future bishop f6 is a very precise move now rook g8 now you would think prague is silly for forcing his opponent to defend himself right for forcing his opponent to defend himself but rather not defend i use the wrong word there attack himself that's mate yeah but watch this what bishop d5 a perfect setup mate is guarded squares are taken away bishop is coming back to f3 it's a very very tough spot bishop f5 bishop f3 now there is no way to protect the knight prog is going to win the knight pack this is insane manuvering all while down a piece stopping black's king from escaping he's going to go get the knight now this is crazy stuff vincent plays rookie eight he finally got all his pieces in the game it's a very very tense moment now and in this position there is one and only one move the only move that maintains an advantage for white vincent's plan is give up the knight and take back in the center vincent's plan is take the knight take take take on h3 with pressure proc stops all of that he plays the cool calm and collected pawn to g3 and the idea of pawn to g3 is to take the knight with the bishop because he couldn't do that last move bishop h5 last move you got you would have gotten mated so he plays g3 to stop mate so he senses he's got a threat black plays king h6 defending the knight now prague plays g4 what why didn't he just go g4 if he played g4 in the first place black would have gone here knight e5 threatening the bishop and you can't take the pieces cuz you're pinned that would have been the problem what then what is the difference between g3 king h6 g4 and just g4 right away why did prague waste the move to get the king to come forward to then go g4 i don't get it what about knight e5 it's the positioning of the king there would have been pawn to g5 check and when the king is forced back the queen is trapped say no it's not queen f6 he can't take bishop g6 double check and anywhere the king moves it's mate oh my god prague is so smart he played g3 he spent 26 minutes on g3 and the idea was to force the black king up and then hit him with the sneaky g4 because now g5 is the threat the threat is not to take the pieces the threat is to force the king forward force him back and then take on h5 this is insane prague slicing and dicing and understanding the dynamics of the position this is crazy stuff black plays pawn takes c3 this move is overdue the bishop is now opened up and the knight is hanging a very very very tense moment will prague be precise yes he just takes back the threat is still g5 the position is hanging in the balance black really can't do a whole lot so he takes on e5 the tactics here are crazy i mean black is sniping the white king with literally everything i mean every piece is staring but the the idea this whole time was to go pawn to g5 and we know if the king goes to h7 we take let's say queen h6 you can't take right there's no discover check yeah you know what the winning move here is can't take the queen right because you're so why don't you just that's gangster slide the king to the corner look your opponent in the face and smile that's it queen is now hanging queen can't move cuz you just bulldo oh my goodness so sensing that the position is quickly spinning out of control vincent kimer plays queen takes g5 he sacrifices the queen bishop takes rook takes check king h2 now prague is up prague has a queen for a knight and a bishop and a pawn he's winning he's definitely winning black plays knight g6 threatening the queen prague finishes things in style queen is hanging rook is here once again the only move to get any advantage some of you might be inclined to play a move like queen c4 that's not the right move the right move in this position is to give the queen a kiss goodbye and play queen takes g5 check sacrificing the queen with a check and ready to win back a full rook so you give up the queen for both of your opponent's rooks and you're winning because you have two rooks on the board and you're opponent does not have enough pieces to fight off the two rooks if you're actually playing a chess tournament do not pick the queen up and give it a smooch that is disgusting i mean the queen in your life whoever the queen in your life is all right king takes g5 rook e eight and now the way prague has to win this rooks are endgame pieces he's got to go for the pawns he has to not hang his rooks but he's got to go for the pawns he's got to trade some knights for bishops got to go here black plays knight f4 and even this and you may be wondering why didn't vincent play like c6 rook g1 he didn't want his king forced to the edge of the board so he plays knight f4 and prague is simple man he just takes the pawn takes the pawn vincent down to 2 minutes plays a5 getting the pawn out of the way now now rook a8 chasing down the bishop the bishop goes here and walks directly into the knight attack we're going to be taking the pawn and promoting our a pawn or we'll take this and we'll win all the other pawns black's got all these great pieces but white's king is completely safe there is absolutely nothing you can do bishop takes f2 prague captures the pawn on a5 now he's got a passing a pawn which is literally the worst pawn that black could possibly be defending d5 and even this laate into the game with his knigh hanging that could casually move out of the way prag plays the best move prague plays the top computer move the best move in the position rook f1 bringing in the rook with the tempo and the bishop has no safe square the only safe square the bishop has is bishop h4 at which point white would take this pawn and get to the king so black goes here prague is simple simplify black now has three pieces left rook b5 and you're just going to promote this pawn bishop takes h3 sacrificing the rook the knight has to capture and rook takes b6 and it's a red carpet nobody can stop the pawn you would need to lose material bishop f1 a5 and f5 and white can just play a6 and doesn't have to play a6 he can play bishop a he can play a lot of things and so that is why in this position after rook takes b6 vincent kimer resigned and prague played 41 perfect moves the opening was sharp vincent kimer instigated with this variation that he played once before they got into a very sharp tactical fight and it was prague who might have anticipated this sacrificed the knight and slowly methodically played like tetris with his pieces bishop g5 look at this sliding them out of the way making black play passively def but e5 what a what a key idea to open up the position they got tangled bishop f6 bishop d5 the perfect combo of attack and defense and this idea of bishop f3 g3 threatening this getting out of mates and then hitting them with the sneaky followup g4 showing them this getting them to react and g4 with the idea of g5 absolutely lethal absolutely lethal game and this game actually extended prague's unbeaten streak in classical tournaments to 47 games unfortunately he lost the next round cu that's life but he played 47 games without losing a classical chess game and yeah this one was 41 moves of perfection including a couple brilliancies surgical precision late in the game and yeah just awesome i mean it's just really just from start to finish it was a it was a perfect game of chess that's all i have for you today that was a little bit of inspiration for you now all of you can you know feel inspired and go play a chess game and get like 32% accuracy like me like i watch these top players i'm like oh i feel inspired then i go and and and i have diarrhea on the chess board and also but sometimes yeah anyway that's a that's a conversation for another video you know the drill get out of here
