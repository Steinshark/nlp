post factum after the after the moment of grasping christ they said weren't our hearts burning within us he was speaking to us on the road opening the scriptures to us just as he opened the eyes he opened the scriptures but this this tells us that something has been happening all along and he's been working on them unbeknownst to them yeah to me this is absolutely fascinating because you have to assume if christ is in that state of intense luminosity imperceptible to their eyes that this working in them this fire burning in them is of the same kind and this is in fact how our how the early christian tradition reads it this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so hello everyone christ has risen we are still in bright week and we thought it would be a wonderful moment to look at the story of the road to emmaus and i'm very pleased to be with father bogdan father bogdan bukur i'm not sure is that's how you pronounce your last name i'm sorry and father bogdan teaches patriotistics at saint vladimir seminary and he he really suggested that we might look at the story of the road to emmaus to help us understand you know and understand or and turn around the mystery of the resurrected christ kind of understand how the church fathers especially center from the syrian and fathers like him interpret scripture and what it means for us today as we encounter the world around us so father bogdan thanks for talking to me i'm happy to meet you thank you very much for having me very excited about this and so the story of the road to emmaus is is of one of the very strange stories in scripture and i pointed it often i pointed at it often with people who kind of asked me you know what does the resurrection look like when someone says when someone kind of takes for granted that the resurrection is just a dead body you know sitting up in the grave and walking out i say well there's stories in scripture that tend to want to to imply that there's much more going on and the story of the disciples meaning christ of the road to emmaus is definitely one of them because they don't recognize him then he kind of then they recognize him you know and then they take it's a commute it's communion and it's all these things kind of coming together in the story so tell us a little bit about your own thoughts on this on this very particular story in scripture well i'm fascinated by it like like all of us this is one of the one of the stories that we read cyclically at matins at the morning service on sundays in the orthodox church and we all read it orthodox and non-orthodox christians or non-christians as we read scripture i always fails to be how shall i put it open to interpret i mean it is open interpretation but it fails to be cracked yes thing that always remains mysterious as you said as the two disciples are leaving and you have to wonder why are they leaving why are they leaving and the others are staying behind so i suppose they've had it they can't can't deal with this anymore it's they're grieving and at the same time they must have been very disappointed because at some point they explain that they thought this might be a prophet they thought he might even be the messiah and clearly they no longer do these are disciples who leave the community who leave the disciples they leave the center jerusalem and move away and it's suddenly they're there with jesus himself and they have no idea that is the first the first thing is how is it that they walk and talk with jesus for some three hours from jerusalem walking to emmaus and not only do they have no idea that it is jesus they even lecture jesus about jesus they don't you don't know what happened and they they talk down to him you're the only stranger has no clue about all these things that have happened even they even give him a sort of primer on christology which is a faulty christology basically he could have been the messiah but it wasn't and and so that's the first thing how is it that they don't they don't understand secondly how is it that after talking down to him for a while they start to listen and then they become so fascinated let's say by him that they they they don't want to part and they ask him and urge him to stay with them and they defer to him he is the one who actually presides at the the meal that they want to have with him and somehow suddenly their eyes are opened whatever that means because earlier it said their eyes were held from beh from from recognizing him that's also mysterious you know who was holding their eyes their own weakness god satan something else and suddenly now their eyes are opened in the breaking of the bread as he as he performs this their eyes are open fine but then he disappears and so now again mysterious why does he vanish and does he go away does he not go away does he go away from their side or does he remove himself what does that mean and they return why do they return now with much greater energy and with the proclamation of the resurrection so this entire story i find even though i don't think we're going to understand it fully maybe that's the whole point i mean the resurrection is something that is somehow already but not yet yeah this interim this tension is itself what we where we are that's why i like it yeah and and there's something i think that in order to understand it the way that i would tend to approach it would be to look at the other stories that are parallel to this one and so you have the story of course of saint mary of saint mary magdalene who has a similar interaction with the risen christ but then i think this also goes all the way to pentecost in terms of a pattern which is the pattern of the disciples that don't know what's going on that are that are sad that are you know they're hiding there's something and then there's a revelation they receive a revelation which makes them understand what this was all about let's say from from the outset and i think that you know i think you also see that in the story of doubting thomas as well there's something of that as well where thomas doubts he doesn't know and then there's a revelation which reveals a risen christ to him so it seems that the pattern is there in the rotometers is very striking because of the way it's patterned but it seems to be all going all all this goes together and the talking to strangers i think is important because it's there also in the the story of pentecost that is moving away from the center kind of forgetting or not knowing the reason anymore not understanding the reason for why we were together what we were doing and suddenly discovering it as a surprise in the in the strain in in in the strange world like the fish the the story of the fish in scripture has something to do with that or saint peter finding the gold coin in the fish's mouth like moving out towards the ocean and suddenly being surprised by revelation there seems to be all that kind of going on in this this particular story this is just the frame of of the story is a story of conversion literally of turning around because they move away and then they return they abandon the the community of disciples and they return as disciples in fact as better disciples than the ones who had not left perhaps these are more honest disciples honestly honest with their with their doubts with their grief so when they return they return as bearing good news to the to the ones that remain it's a wonderful story also to where in which you can see how christ deals with with these people because he doesn't mind going in the wrong direction apparently away from jerusalem in order to gain them in order to be able to to return them so it's a large a long loop really that he doesn't mind taking with them and incidentally another another story let's say that connects with this is in the gospel of mark specialists call it longer ending of mark it's an addition to the gospel of mark in which somebody who must have had access to to the gospel of luke says two of them were walking in the countryside and they met him he walked with them in another form and this is one perhaps the earliest attempt to to interpret all these mysteries or give some kind of a key what this what this in another form might mean perhaps uh remain i mean i suppose it's to do with a connection between the resurrection appearance of christ and what luca told us about the transfiguration because he's the only one who speaks about a different appearance a different form it is very mysterious yeah that's an interesting it's an interesting idea there's something also which is fascinating when i think about it iconographically the idea of encountering christ in a different form it's something that to a certain extent this is going to sound strange because it's we take taken so much for granted that it it's actually going to be hard to think about but the way that we represent christ in icons is actually as a roman nobleman that's how we represent christ we don't represent christ as a as a first century rabbi or teacher and so there is something even in our iconographic representation of christ which is something of the stranger that is there is in our the way we show it show him that he is that he is something of that stranger that you encounter the surprise of the encounter of something which is not which is not in its original form and so we're so used to it that we don't think about it but yeah do you mind if i show you an image yes go ahead what's your thought over it this is an image that that i actually saw on mount arthur's in careers so this is this image of christ in another form as you can see he doesn't look like like the christ we know in most icons i think and the whole point i mean i don't find anything peculiar except that it doesn't look like him but maybe that's the entire the entire point what is the context of this image where where is it in the in the processes the the over the table of ablation where the gifts are prepared in in church and it doesn't have a any kind of prominence there i was fascinated to to find it there this is not my photograph i found a better one online stole it from there but this is this is the only the only the only image i know of in which you would have something special otherwise i've seen christ and the two disciples on the road and there's nothing but peculiar about it but since you mentioned mary magdalene in the garden how about this one because it seems to me leaving aside the iconographic technique or the the painting technique i can tell us something about this but as far as i can see one obvious element interpretive element here is that even though we are not sold not in the store of a mouse not in the store of magdalene meeting christ in the garden we are not told that christ is luminous or if he's luminous it's not the kind of luminosity that would have been perceived by them i can say a few things about that in a moment but in the icon he is rendered where this isn't really an icon anymore this is an in-between right yeah this renaissance painting but here he is luminous and in fact that's what strikes me how should we paint this how should we render it and you're i think there seems to be definitely a a reference to the transfiguration in the way that christ is represented here because this is usually the way that we think of christ and the transfiguration as being luminous and so relating that the the resurrection to the transfiguration is obviously not not a very big leap it's not something that is it's something that intuitively seems to to connect quite easily and so it seems that that's and but there's also something so mysterious about that moment when christ you know what is he what is he saying and he's saying don't touch me because not yet it's like not yet i'm not yet and it's not totally clear what that what what that implies well on the road to emails it's it's it's different because he allows himself to be to be to to be interacted with and yet there is a veil since luke says their eyes were held so that they would not recognize him and some have suggested well maybe their own their own problems their own sinfulness maybe satan but usually this way of phrasing things in in scripture is hinting at an act of god god holding their eyes so that they would not they would not be overwhelmed maybe they are not in a position in a state that would allow them to understand more than they do and it's it takes a journey and it takes christ's it says that he's interpreting to them in all the scriptures but we're not told which scriptures all the scriptures all the things about himself that remains also somewhat ambiguous and their eyes are not open then but it takes the completion of the journey the meal the breaking of the bread and then everything suddenly comes together and then their eyes were opened again it's in this passive that that hints at god opening their eyes just as god had kept them from recognizing him and they knew him but they cannot sustain this vision just as an as a parallel i think you and i have must have the same experience that pasca is yeah climax and then and then you're you can't sustain you can't hold on to it it's not just pasca it's every time you take communion it's like you know you go up and you take communion and you you have this moment of you know you enter into the mystery and then a few days later you know you're thinking about your taxes or your whatever you're fighting with your wife and you're like oh you know it's like wow none of this is it's not holding but but maybe that's us actually i think that the idea of understanding this as an initiation is possibly one of the ways to see it which is that it seems to parallel the actual structure of the liturgy itself which is you know the the liturgy where we actually have the the epistle and the gospel and then we have we move towards communion and that also seems to mark the way the catechumens were brought into the church as well taught the scripture at first and then revealed the mystery where they would enter into communion in the end at in the after they were baptized and so i'm wondering if there isn't there is an initia initiatory suggestion in this story as well well certainly i can bring in i can bring in send ephraim a little bit of help from saint from mites it's always helpful yes and by the way this is the book where i'm taking it from it's well well well well worth purchasing ephraim's hymns on paradise he has a few reference there you might wonder what does paradise have to do with all of this but if you're thinking a bit we say we have no way of approaching paradise just as we have no way of approaching the risen state in which christ finds himself and the resurrection towards which we are we're being called we can only speak with the language of of ritual i suppose let me show you i'll share screen again to show you a couple of of texts from saint afram all right so first he says that when moses speaks about the structure of the of the intent of meeting and later to be to be the temple same structure he marks a difference between these two rooms the holy place and the holy of holies with the way we have in our churches at the nave and then the the altar area and the tree of knowledge is placed as a gate by which one would have access to the holy of holies to the altar area and god did not permit adam to enter into that tabernacle not because not because the tree of knowledge would be would be bad or the fruit of it would be bad god does not make bad things but first he has other things to do he has to taste of the other things he has to prove himself a well-functioning priest because adam is a sort of priest there his sensing etc he has the taste of the other trees of virtues presumably and this then he says this thing doesn't work properly because adam learned that the tree of knowledge served as a veil for the sanctuary and realized that its fruit was the key of justice that would open the eyes of the bold and he makes bold and and partakes and he and eve have their eyes opened but at the same time closed so as not to see the glory of the inner tabernacle now saint ephraim then connects this with the disciples on the road to emmaus and says that when there when the disciples eyes were clo were closed red was the key now when we say that bread was the key it's obvious that saint ephrem and and many many others in our tradition in fact understand that meal at emmaus to have been a eucharistic meal yeah and bread is the key that opens their eyes and now their eyes behold a vision of joy and are filled with happiness and so there's this ambiguity if properly received it grants access it feels one with joy it is what god intends for us but if improperly partaken of in disobedience and and definitely from the wrong provider you know if you think of adam and eve then their eyes are saddened adam is called the cursed one it's not it's not at all as it should be so to to to recap in a way the the emails meal is how should i put it in in an in an antithetical parallelism with the partaking of the fruit in paradise and resurrection is the undoing of the fall into mortality in paradise for saint ephrem this is nothing novel in fact he's not these hymns are not are not trying to say anything new he's he's giving poetic expression to something that is the common tradition yeah and there's something even in the way that san fran presents it which which almost suggests that in a certain manner the eucharist is the way to access the tree of knowledge properly if this is actually a return to the guardian and a partaking of the fruit even the fruit that was forbidden but done in a way which is not through this kind of arrogant boldness but through humility and receiving and through sacrifice because that is how christ brought that meal to us through self-sacrifice and the disciples in fact if you if we read the story of the disciples as a story of as a i shall be a pattern of any christian's discipleship it is a road that leads from arrogance to humility they start by lecturing jesus yeah you know they accuse him of not knowing what had happened when in fact who is it that doesn't know it's it's them they don't know they don't know who they're talking to they don't know who christ is they don't know that the women had indeed spoken the truth they don't know anything but gradually this arrogance is is diluted more and more and they listen more and more and i suppose this is part of what leads what enables them to see even for a fraction of a second but that is enough that moment is is so so powerful so overwhelming that it is indeed fully transformative same with us and by the way what do we say after we receive communion we have seen the true light and i don't know about you but i can't say that i actually have seen it with my eyes or in any other way though i do believe we have seen it because we wouldn't we wouldn't say such things even though they're quite a bit more than than than our experience allows us to to to grasp it is a reality that we do receive light invisible to us i have something i'd like to show you yeah about about the email story this is the thing that actually i think connects the gospel account with with its environment if first century judaism there is there is a first century judaism a way of understanding what happened to moses moses is also luminous when he comes from from sinai when he comes down from the mountain right well what we read in scripture is that moses moses was so overwhelmingly luminous that the fellow his fellow israelites were were afraid of him he was luminous the scripture says because he had been speaking with god in god's luminosity had been rubbing off on him as it were well it so happens that there is we have a text from roughly the first century palestine in which this episode is retold it's a sort of rewritten bible it's a genre of of writing that as the name says it retells biblical events but this is how we know how people would have understood those things the way in which we retell something colors it well in one of these retellings which is in the in a book called the book of biblical antiquities from the first century as i said this episode is rendered in the following way moses came down from sinai having been bathed with light invisible the light of his face surpassed the splendor of the sun and the moon but he was unaware of it so far it's pretty much what the bible says just in different words but then when he came to the children of israel when they saw him they did not recognize him they did not know him but when he spoke to them then they recognized him and so the strange thing is it doesn't say that they perceived him as being luminous they did not see him luminous they had no clue it was him moses and they were afraid and they recognized him when he spoke to them just as in the episode of mary magdalene yeah say that he's luminous as we've seen in the in the painting by jyoto but it says that she does not recognize him until he speaks to her then he then she recognizes him and in the same book of biblical antiquities the same episode i mean the same notion let's put it of not being able to recognize somebody occurs in the case of david the other great figure in the hebrew bible david is about to slay goliath they i mean the king knows who david is he sends him out it's unlikely that he's going to accomplish anything what is he going to do this little boy he goes you know the story and when he's about to to cut off goliath's head he pour the book of biblical antiquity says he poses for a moment and tells tells goliath look up and see who it is it slays you and goliath looks up and says that he sees his face like the face of a son of god and in other words this is unfair because he's not been fighting some israelite but there is something with him he's being assisted as it were he gets some kind of heavenly assistance he slays him and then comes back to the troops and nobody recognizes who david is once again say he's luminous as goliath had said he saw him luminous but they don't recognize him until he speaks to them and then suddenly they do recognize him so i suppose that when saint luke tells us about about not recognizing christ he's using this kind of tradition that assumes that in this state in which christ finds himself and the disciples do not the state of the resurrection similarly to the transfiguration he is in a different aspect but this is not perceived by people who are not capable of that who our ascetical tradition would say not worthy but it it is effective this this presence this light is effective in creating this kind of confusion or people who don't who who are not compatible with that state yeah would not benefit from it in fact would be harmed are held from from recognizing this person so there's a strange kind of strength no i think i mean i yeah but i think the tradition makes sense in terms of this is just phenomenologically even the the because we think that people's faces are are obvious or just recognizing someone is is an obvious thing but it's actually it's not as obvious as you might think there we have a we have a story you know we have a connection we have a part of us which which recognizes the familiar and it is actually possible it's happened to me where this is on the opposite side of the glorious one which is that i've forgotten who someone is you know i haven't seen them in several years and then i encounter them and i don't recognize them until they speak and when they speak suddenly their face changes in front of me like their their physical attributes actually transforms because my mind is putting them back together to the person that i know and i can see this person i recognize in them and so this is of course has nothing to do with transfiguration but this you could understand that a being that is is in this elated state that is in a very high spiritual state that that they would be transcending their particular face you could say and that it would it would be difficult to recognize them so it doesn't seem that weird for me that that would happen i suppose it's not so much or not only not only the the stories that we have but perhaps broadly in the case of christ and the disciples the gestures the breaking of the bread the familiarity of that meal first meal that that begins all these meals that the risen christ has with the disciples which we continue in our liturgy these are our meals but also what came before they the putting together they put it very nicely you put together all these elements that that make the face that you recognize recomposing as it were the the portrait the icon of the messiah from all all those elements that he finds in scripture and he he he interpreted all the things about himself in all the scriptures and suddenly they recognize the scriptural christ and that gets superimposed upon the figure of the stranger that is with them who becomes to them not a stranger but a teacher not a teacher but a friend and then everything gets put in focus suddenly in that moment of epiphany at the meal it's the structure that we have also as you as you said it's initiatory it is gradual it is liturgical and this is how we in fact do it we read the scriptures we interpret the scriptures we pray and we partake and then say we have seen the true light i think this is the the pattern indeed that we still have and are capable of benefiting from if if we so want to yeah and there's there's something there's something fractally true about that structure which is that it reaches its height in the liturgy and it is like the liturgical and the the the sacramental version of this of this pattern is the is in a way the the source of all the pattern but it's also the way that you pretty much learn about anything right it's the way that you learn about anything you know yet first you you you you look at things everything looks disparate you don't see the pattern you don't see how things connect you know you're if you're learning about history at first it's all facts nothing seems to kind of come together if you're learning about any skill even that you want to learn it all at first it's confusing you don't understand it then you start to tame it things start to to accumulate and accumulate finally you it snaps together things snap and then you can see the higher form coming back down to to govern it you could say and so i think that it's actually the experience of learning anything learning to cook learning to but that christ reveals that pattern in its highest form as how the creation itself exists how the world itself exists through through through this initiatory initiatory pattern we could say but one needs a guide i mean the disciples the disciples have to have a teacher they do but they also have to recognize themselves as disciples and to function as such this is a beauty i think of of this story it's also the story of shaping them back into into being disciples and this is i think how it also connects with with genesis because some elements there i are certainly deliberate in other words that you have that you have a state of not knowing followed by a state of knowing it can be it can be the wrong kind of knowing they they adam and eve knew that they were naked or empty a jewish and christian tradition would say that they were naked of the garment of glory that they had had previously in other words they don't they don't realize they had been naked all along and now they're ashamed of it though this is the text on its surface but nobody reads and takes on its surface not in not in judaism not in christianity in traditional christianity that is but the the understanding would have been and is that the they were clothed in a garment of glory irradiate ear irradiating irradiating light from inside out in that sense they're clothed with it and they've they know themselves naked of it suddenly whereas with the disciples at the exact opposite they knew christ and they have just received the eucharist he is there and they have also partaken of him they have also partaken of him in the exegesis of scripture which is a self exegesis christ interpreted things of himself scriptures so there is this this parallel the opening of the eyes which is exactly the same adam and eve eyes are opened cleopas and his his companion their eyes are opened so that's why i call it an antithetical parallelism and the the main difference is that they are very bad disciples in paradise right i mean they they listen to the the wrong kind of teacher right who says god told you no i'll give you the shortcut right the cliff's notes to doing this cheating on the exam basically whereas these disciples learn how to how to trust how to listen how to part how to commune with christ and therefore so that's my point is that everything you said plus the this relationship of discipleship which is an absolute must yeah and it's and it really is if you see it as this antithetical pattern it really is a return to paradise that's what they're experiencing at that moment you know it's there there are many places in scripture where christ operates that pattern of a return to paradise but this is one which is which is very powerful and clear and links it to how the church will then continue that tradition like you said in terms of discipleship in terms of sacramental participation in terms of catechum in it all of this is continued on in the tradition of the church you know and and the the story of the disciples going to emmaus is the the narrative version of what we now do liturgically all the time basically there is there's also a strange element that the disciples seem to get all kinds of things retrospectively that is after christ vanishes from their sight and i think we should emphasize the fact that he doesn't go away to vanish does not mean that he left them he vanishes from their sight no they can't see him anymore exactly so just as in liturgy we have seen the true light way we might not have grasped it but it was there and it is there so also with the disciple he vanishes from their sight is present but invisibly present but after after that they have another little chat among themselves this time it's not about the the crushing trauma that they had experienced with the crucifixion this time it's about their experience on the road on the road it doesn't say in the text that they would have experienced anything special i mean they don't reflect then but post factum after the after the moment of grasping christ they said weren't our hearts burning within us he was speaking to us on the road opening the scriptures to us just as he opened the eyes he opened the scriptures but this this tells us that something has been happening all along and he's been working on them unbeknownst to them yeah to me this is absolutely fascinating because you have to assume if christ is in that state of intense luminosity imperceptible to their eyes that this working in them this fire burning in them is of the same kind and this is in fact how our how the early christian tradition reads it and and there's something there are so many ver i have all these versions of that story that are just kind of rushing into me because you see in the story of the ethiopian eunuch you see a similar situation where the ethiopian eunuch is reading scripture it doesn't understand it he's confused he has no idea and then you know philip comes and and and shows him you know which leads to sacrament which leads to now not to the communal meal but to the baptism and after the baptism he vanishes too it's like he brings him into the sacrament that he vanishes and and the and the you know the eunuch is left in that state you could say a tran a transformed state so it's interesting to see that def this is definitely something which which is part of of of the resurrected and the body of how the body of christ works let's say after the resurrection and it also shows in the same way this discipleship chain of command because the eunuch reads he just doesn't know what it means who he's reading about in isaiah 53 how to put things together and it takes the guidance of philip but philip himself doesn't know about this until he's prompted by it's not very clear there it's this holy spirit or it's an angel or that's another person maybe but he's receiving from above let's say yes exactly yes that's right so he's received from above the impulse to go and do this and philip could have said not now later not this way not the ethiopian whatever the kind of things that you have plenty of in scripture like moses go but what if pharaoh but what if the israelites send somebody else it doesn't always work so easily with philip who is a disciple it works easily go he goes tell him he tells him and the ethiopian eunuch benefits from it it's a kind of a chain of command if you want but it's not to lord it over god lording it over philip philip lording it over the of the unit it's to serve and to empower and to to help achieve god's god's goal in all these folks and indeed this is this is how it works yeah the the light is carried down and moses is the same it's the same thing most goes up the mountain he receives from god and then he comes down and then brings to the level that each person is able to receive it down the mountain all the way to the bottom you know and you see you know this idea and saying it's a maximus that you know all things participate into in the glory of god to the to the extent that they that they can in their in their being and that appears as this chain this grand chain of light that comes down and and and fills the world ultimately and so and like you said the christian version of that is has something to do with gift and sacrifice and self-sacrifice giving ourselves down to that which is below the father that gives himself for his children and for his wife rather than the way that that authority is understood in a in a more kind of brutal pagan way where it's just it's just a basic control of people that are below it's a different form of hierarchy well we're told how god's authority works it works by washing the feet of the disciples i want to show these these texts about how the fathers understood well this burning of the heart there's this burning heart because it it really goes to the to the heart of our especially the ascetical tradition though that ascetical tradition is the common the common inheritance of all regardless of how much of which one practices with one monastic or monastic or but the fascinating thing is that it seems to be it seems to be how should i put it a a unanimous way of of reading so i have three authors and they're all important one is origin great teacher yes some some heresies and some problematic things but also the one author that everybody reads and benefits from after him sin basil the great who read origin of course corrected him to but benefited from him and the mccarran homilies the fifth homilies so origen says that like earthly fire with its double action burning and giving light spiritual fire is also double in nature it is the light that enlightens every man but it is also the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels and so there isn't really an essential difference between say the light of paradise and the fires of gehenna the difference is simply in the way in which we relate to the presence of god but it is the presence of god yeah it was he says it was the same christ that burned the hearts of the disciples on the road to emmaus and enlightened them by the opening to them by opening to them the scriptures now why are their eyes held because they're not capable yet of sustain that vision in a way that is safe for them so they're slowly being purified you know burned in the hearts as it were to make that heart less less sclerotic in fact this is what christ says your hearts are dull your hearts are slow you're slow of heart ants in basil then starts to find these references in scripture what sort of what sort is this fire which purges sins the sons of aarons the brother of moses were burned up having used an alien fire but the seraph took a live call from the holy fire that was on the noetic the spiritual altar of the true whole burn offerings in the old testament isaiah the prophet receives from the seraph this kind of purification enable him to stand in the presence of god because he says when he sees god you can read this in isaiah chapter six he sees god and he's horrified woe is me i'm a man of unclean lips and i i'm i'm here well the the seraph takes a live call and purifies him akin to this fire was also the fire of the thorn bush that moses saw and then the heart of cleopas and simon was burning with such a fire when the lord was expounding to them the scriptures and he gives other examples as well so the point is this is not some metaphor of some emotion you know stirring up stirring them up it's not it's not some kind of conceptual light bulb that that goes on it is something that is god's very presence god's very presence transformative and finally this is the i think that the the most impressive text sid mcarious or suramar karis it's not really macarius some anonymous author given the name in tradition of macarius but the 50 spiritual homilies say basically put together all scripture references that you have to fire and so forth i've selected a few our god is a consuming fire and this fire exerted its power over the apostles when they spoke with tongues of fire at pentecost this fire surrounded paul in the voice that enlightened his mind while blinding his senses when paul meets the risen christ on the road to to damascus this fire appeared to moses in the bush this fire caught up elijah when he is taken up from the earth and this fire inflamed the heart of cleopas and his companion when the savior spoke to them after the resurrection this fire burns up the beam of the interior eyes this fire drives up demons and has the power of the resurrection and this is really this passage here the last one that i've read travels as such in the in the tradition the jessica's tradition the tradition of of prayer that purifies and leads to the vision of god as light and it becomes it becomes a set text that travels in the manuscripts and the point is that our little verse there about lucas and cleopas oclopus and his unnamed companion is a witness to this experience and so when we're reading a story that is somewhat ambiguous and mysterious and fascinating at the same time but it is not a story that is inaccessible to us in its in its reality that reality is not only accessible to us but definitely for us we must in other words at least embark with the disciples i guess the same road yeah that's that's i think that's wonderful and you know i think that you know i think that that's actually probably a good place for us to to to finish the conversation as a encouragement for people to to understand the light of the resurrection as something which is really the presence of god which is accessible to us through through the church of the sacraments through through also this encounter with christ that we can all have access to you know in our heart which is the good way to describe it and so father bogdan thank you so much for your wisdom and your thoughts on this much for your time and i'm very much looking forward to maybe receiving you so thoughts privately about the iconography of this all
