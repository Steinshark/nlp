today we are going to be making an nft and 
i'm really excited to take you along this   process with me as it's the first nft i'm actually 
making as well and when i'm doing this tutorial   it's i've read it the tutorial before but i've 
never actually taken it so i wanted to make this   video to go through the process of simply that's 
the key word here simply making nft that anyone   can make i've left down in the description a few 
requirements you will need before we get started   one being you will need to install vs code 
it's super simple to install i will link it   down in the description the other being you will 
have to have node installed which once again   super simple and i linked it down the description 
i chose this tutorial because it was very simple   to follow along very clear so whether you have 
a ton of experience with coding or next to none   it's something that you can still follow along 
with and build also i've linked the tutorial down   in the description so make sure to go check it out 
it's from free code camp and i think they just did   a really wonderful job creating this tutorial 
before we get into it though make sure to hit   that subscribe button for more tech coding 
related videos leave in the comments if you   like the style of video going through tutorials 
together and okay let's just jump right into it okay first things first before we even 
get started or write any lines of code   we need a free virtual wallet to manage 
our addresses or our ethereum addresses   for this tutorial they recommend using 
metamask which we are going to use   it's a super simple chrome extension that we can 
easily download so let's go ahead and do that   first things first i'm going to click download 
now and we are going to use for chrome okay we got it running that was our first 
step and i'm sure all of you were able to   successfully do that too so we are off to 
a good start also it's important to note   we're not going to do this at this specific 
step but you also need to download their   mobile app as well so if you want to pause and 
do that now or we can do that together later on you can see here we have our meta mask we went 
through the basic steps and we have made an   account next up we need some test ethereum 
to play around with so for that it's really   cool they have a lot of different test net 
account addresses that you can or type it put   in your address i should say and they will 
give you test ethereum to play around with   for this one in this tutorial we are using 
broxton robston i'm sorry for butchering that   ethereum faucet so first of all we need to 
toggle the network to the test network and   then also get our account address so let's go 
do that okay so you can see here that right   now we're on the ethereum mainnet but if we 
toggle down we can see roxton test network   if you're not seeing this it's simply because 
you need to go show hide test networks   and then ensure test networks is turned on from 
there you can toggle simply to the test network   and then we go back to account and then we will 
copy our account number here and then go to   fawcett.robstenbropston i feel 
like i'm butchering this i'm so sorry   roxton and enter in your account address once 
you've done that click send me test either no while we are waiting patiently i have a feeling 
that we have to put real ethereum in here   because it's taking so long i'm assuming it's 
because so many people are using this right now   which is pretty cool but anyways continuing 
on for now our next step is to interact   with the ethereum network and to do so we 
need to be connected to an ethereum node   that kind of reminds me of known node no 
i've never really put two and two together   so what we have to do now is use alchemy as our 
node provider okay now once you're done signing   up and going through the process i just did 
everything for the free version which i'm sure you   do or will do as well you will now see what i have 
on my screen which is the dashboard essentially   from there we are going to need to retrieve a key 
which we will will use later on according to the   tutorial but for now let's get it so to do that 
we need to click on view details and then view key and it says here to save the http key somewhere as 
we will need it later so make sure to do just that i feel like we're doing pretty good here you 
know we're we're learning together we're doing   this together it feels nice and i'm sure if 
you are following along with this to just like   build stuff together especially 
when it's your first time or   you're rather new to it just to feel like 
you're not alone going through the process   and then as you know i'm just following a tutorial 
as well but if you have any questions or get stuck   on anything feel free to leave them in the 
comments i can't guarantee i can problem solve   what you are facing but i will do my 
absolute best to through the comments   okay next up comes in my opinion the fun parts 
we are going to start doing some coding actually   and to start with we will be using node so 
if you don't have node installed i will leave   some directions down below to install node 
i already do and i'm not going to make this   part of this tutorial but once you have 
node installed we can do the following we   need to first initialize the project so first 
we need to make a directory so in that case now they want us to make another directory   ethereum inside of the nft project we are 
already inside the project as you can see i'm just entering for all of this okay next they want us to install hard hat 
which is essentially a dev tool that they say   makes it easy to deploy and test your ethereum 
software so let's go ahead and do just that i feel like this takes forever while it's 
installing we could like make up a dance   or something how's it going what's going on i'm 
just kidding i'm just kidding this might be weird   okay we're almost there oh sir come on some npm packages honestly take like 
forever to install so i shouldn't be   complaining about this one okay we got it 
going next up we need to do mpx hard hat okay so what do you want to do   we want to create an empty hard hat 
config.js so we just use the arrow keys arrow key we just use the arrow keys to 
get down to that and then we go enter   okay so for this tutorial they are going to 
use next js so we need to go back to the   root directory of the project nft project and 
initialize boilerplate next.js app called web   so let's cd back into the root directory okay there we go success now we can finally 
finally get into some real coding so next up   they are saying we need to define our environment 
variables one being the alchemy key that we   saved if you remember we saved that the https key 
from our from our test project earlier so we're   going to run the following commands to make an 
environment ins environment folder inside of our   ethereum directory or file sorry so we need a cd 
out of the web folder and then back into ethereum okay so i'm pulling up here visual studio 
code because the next step we need to do   is to actually go into our environment 
file and then add in a few different things so we need the alchemy key our meta 
mask private key and metamask address   i'm not going to obviously show you all my 
keys and addresses but they do give really   good instructions to follow to grab 
the private key as well so make sure to   follow those and if you have any questions 
about that let me know down in the comments   okay we got the coffee we have the fuel to 
continue to build our nft i'm really excited   about this i was telling paul that i was who is 
filming he came with me for coffee that we were   building an nft and i mean i think that's all he 
pretty much hears from me recently is about like   blockchain nfts crypto just because i think it's 
so interesting as i know many of you do as well so   back to film back to the dungeon back to the 
dungeon okay we are back so next what we   need to do is get everything set up for the smart 
contract portion of the nfts so to do that we also   need to make a few more folders one for contracts 
and one for scripts so let's do just that okay next up they want us to install open 
zeppelin which is an open source library   with pre-tested reusable code to make smart 
contract development easier i can't speak   today apparently the only thing i can do 
is code so we better stick with the coding finally we are going to be able to start 
writing the smart contract for our nft   so we're going to navigate to our 
contracts directory and create a file   titled emotionalshapes.sol but obviously 
you can name it whatever you choose okay and then if we go to take a look at this okay so in the project they talk all 
about the different pieces of the code   so feel free to read about it more too i'm 
not going to in this video or else i feel   like we'll be here for ever but the next 
step is building the metadata for our nft next up we are going to make another folder 
um in web on web and then inside the pages   so we are going to do that just in vs 
code here i'm going to make a folder   so let's do that i told you we are doing 
literally doing this together new folder pages okay and then here we are 
going to make a dynamic route okay i'm not gonna lie i just spent the last 
like 10 minutes debugging only to realize when   i created when i was installing some dependencies 
i accidentally made a new folder called my app   within the web folder so when i was going to do 
npm run dev and it was failing it was because i   was in the wrong folder this is the reality 
sometimes it takes you way longer than you   want to do the most simplest things so if you are 
struggling with npm rum dev make sure you can   check if you already if you did the same thing as 
me and created an extra folder and in which case   i cd into my app and then did npm render okay you 
can see here now we are successful in compiling   and we have we're inside i just did one dot js 
inside my as you can see here web my app and   then this fla this file here 1.js and then as 
you can see here whatever you put in this object   will show up on screen as the metadata so i'm 
going to show you my screen here so for me i just   literally put for the metadata right now a board 
triangle but feel free to put whatever you want   okay so as you can see this is the metadata 
in here and it's a super easy thing to   do just go to localhost 3030 api into your 
folder erc and then your folder your file id   okay next up when i'm going through the tutorial 
we need to expose the metadata for our nft and   one of the things they say is because our app is 
hosted locally other apps cannot access it so we   need to use a tool such as ngrok ngrok 
maybe i don't know to expose it locally   to a publicly accessible url so we need to 
make this accessible this url accessible   to expose the metadata so let's go ahead 
and sign up for this and then once we have   signed up there is some instructions we need to 
follow first thing being we need to go the   dashboard and get our auth token story and 
then go to the terminal and run the command   so we have to download first for mac and then 
once you're done downloading get your auth token   and then i've already ran these commands so 
i'm just going to put on screen once you have   got to the page which is on my screen these are 
the two commands they are saying to run so one get   your auth token and run the first which i will put 
up here and then the second run this command   they say to create a tunnel to your web app 
hosted on localhost 3000 which you can see here   okay on your terminal they give you an example 
of what you should see i see mine but obviously   i'm not going to share it with you because i don't 
want to share you my address and all of that but   i will put up on screen what they are sharing most 
importantly let's go to it though to make sure our   endpoint is working correctly okay so you can see 
here we still see the metadata and the description   this is good i know it doesn't seem very exciting 
at this point but these are big steps we're making   okay we're getting close last thing we need 
to do is to deploy our nft so first we need   to change the base uri function and put in 
our nj rock address so let's go do just that   so you see here just put in below your address 
which i'm hiding mine but you get the idea   okay they are saying to deploy our nft 
we need to compile it using hard hat   so they are going to they say we need to 
install ethers.js so let's do just that okay now they're saying to 
update the hard hat config   i'm just going to copy the code they 
have provided for us and do just that next up we need to run mpx hard hat compile make sure when you are running the mpx hardhat 
compile you are still in the ethereum folder   i actually cd out of it and was trying to 
run this and getting back to the beginning   but anyways make sure you are in the right folder   okay so we are creating a deploy.js file in 
our scripts folder in the ethereum folder   once again going to copy the code they provide 
us thank you free code count for being amazing   so now let's start seeing hopefully we can view 
the nft on the blockchain so they say to run   the deployment script okay so when i run this 
command for me and maybe for you too it might   say insufficient funds which i'll put on screen 
if that is the case it's simply because your   test ethereum is still in queue i can see mine 
i'm number four so i'll finish this video and view   the nft on the blockchain hopefully very soon once 
we get that test ethereum into our account okay   so once you run this command when you have fake 
ethereum in your test ethereum in your account   you should be able to get an address where you 
can add to the rest of the url which is right here   and when you do that you should be able to see 
your freshly deployed nft congratulations it's a   big deal it's pretty exciting when i first saw it 
i was pretty pumped to small things so next thing   we need to do as i mentioned is mint nft which is 
only a few steps we are almost there okay so first   thing we need to do is install ethers package 
in the scripts folder followed by once again   just populating the mint js file with this code 
provided in the tutorial okay one thing i want to   add is where it says your nft address that's the 
one thing you are going to need to change within   this file so where to find your nft address is 
go to this url here that you already went to   where you put in your the end piece of the address 
from there click on where it says your hash your   hash it will say there'll be information of from 
and to click on where it says to and the contract   the contract number that is where you put in 
your nft address from there run this command   here that will give you a hash which you can 
then enter in this url here and there you go   now it's time to put it on our phone okay you can 
see here we have downloaded metamask onto my phone   and as well ensure you are on the test network if 
you aren't on the test network you can just toggle   by clicking the top there and ensure you are from 
there navigate to nfts and then you are going to   click on import nfts enter in the contract address 
as well as the id for example i started with id 1   because in the nft metadata we have id 1 id2 
and id3 once you have those two done click   import i'm not going to show you my address 
but you get the idea and from there we have   our first nft mine is still loading but you get 
the idea pretty cool okay we finished building the   nft seeing it come up on my phone was so rewarding 
not gonna lie the second it did i was showing paul   i took screenshots and showed my family it was 
pretty simple to do but it just felt really cool   to know that building this can be so simple and 
straightforward and once again we just followed   along a tutorial but you can really modify this 
and make your own nfts based on this based on   the nft metadata we used i'm curious to know your
