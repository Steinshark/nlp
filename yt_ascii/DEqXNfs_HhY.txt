here on the left is a spinning ascii donut and on the right is a donut shaped c code by andy sloan that generates it now with syntax highlighting now i recommend you check out andy's blog post on the mathematics behind a flying spinning taurus aka donut the link to the post is in the description the basic steps are create a circle then create a taurus by rotating the circle about the y-axis then using rotation matrices spin a donut around the x and z axes finally project the donut onto the 2d screen adding illumination by calculating the surface normal after picking a particular light source the cool thing is because this is ascii world there's different characters associated with different levels of luminance we can go back to the de-africated version of the code that i generated adding a microsecond sleeve function to aid in the animation compiling and running the code we get our spinning donut there's a lot of parameters that you can control with this donut including the field of view and the distance of the donor from the viewer i spend at least an hour every day learning and exploring outside my main line of work so i thought it'd be cool to start throwing together quick little videos about things that i find beautiful whether they're basic or advanced in the world of machine learning math computer science programming psychology whatever even biology physics history and philosophy so hope this is a value fun and something you would enjoy
