i'm making i mean reply to comments in my bed i hate when my phone says i have wi-fi but nothing will load you know you're tapping on things as soon as you have bars and nothing's coming up and you know after a while it starts to mess with your mind you know everything you've ever known in your life all of a sudden becomes a lie i hate when you go to shake someone's hand and they just start doing some weird things like things you weren't expecting like you know they'll do that or you know they'll just grab your hand and like pat you on the back ghosts like there needs to be some way of transmitting what type of handshake you're gonna do like you know blink three times if you're gonna do that one like that and then pull them in or something like that is i get scared to shake people's hand cuz like i don't know what they're about to do with my hand you know they start flailing arm and random positions and doing things like whywhy not ever happen just to the you know normal handshake what why i hate when i finished pooping and i look over and there's no toilet paper and then you know you have to do that thing where you open the door and you like someone bring me toilet paper and you know you just sit there contemplating how big of a failure you are at life and why you even bother living and just how miserable you i hate when i dropped my phone like this far off the ground and it just lands flat on his face and it's just shattered to pieces and then i see other people with like no case on their phone drop it from like off the ceiling and it's it's just like perfectly fine it's like you know their phones don't break it's just mine i hate when people say no offense and then continue to offend you wait didn't we already make an entire video about that what
