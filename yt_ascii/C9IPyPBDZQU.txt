the p30 pro is back and it has she got him better since launch the furnace had updates to improve image quality add new features and even increased efficiency so while we asked me if i'd film an extreme at day in the life of this updated phone but with the twist thing it's gonna span pretty much two full days and so as well as using the phone to showcase some of the new features we're gonna try and do it all on one charge i had about an hour to kill before the car came and before i knew it we were off and let me just tell you this stuff we're about to do on this trip is stuff i never thought i would do it is genuinely crazy and so to do this we're headed from england all the way to wales now that journey itself is about three to three-and-a-half hours and so i spent about an hour in total on the phone itself doing a combination of some really bad chess and then taking photos and videos on the phones camera some of which are seeing here we also stopped off on the way a bit before we started again used the p30 pro for about ten minutes of navigation and also played around with the new and improved fingerprint scanner both the speed and the reliability are now better it wasn't long before we lost the ability to actually pronounce the places we were entering and so we knew we were close to wales now there are three massive activities we're about to do on this trip and each of them is gonna show you some feature of the p30 pro that you might not have seen before and so before the first one we arrived in what seems like a pretty empty welsh slate quarry or something they call subterranean at trampolining you head down underground into these pretty chilly pretty dark looking caves where pretty much the first thing i did being the massive camera nerd that i am is sat down and took a night mode photo this is also funnily enough one of those areas where the finish on the back of the phone just completely comes to life the trampoline park itself is pretty surreal is this massive hollowed out cavern with nets all over the place that you start to bounce on and it does not feel safe for the first five minutes but when you get used to it incredible genuinely just before we got out of there the cave walls themselves were just asking to be photographed using the super macro mode i managed to get this photo of a single water drop about to fall from the ceiling i was feeling pretty proud of myself at this point up until i realized that i have the entire imprint of the net i just fallen on on the back of my shirt okay so that entire setup was completely surreal but as far as low-light goes we can actually get lower than that and just before we do we're all here in beautiful wales let's go for a bit of a walk so whilst we're waiting for it to get dark so we could head to event number two we took a bit of a walk we found this nice little waterfall yet another slate quarry and it was all happening whilst the sun was slowly setting in the background kind of beautiful now one of the other things that's massively improved in this phone since launch is a are measure so you might know the phone has its own dedicated time-of-flight sensor it uses that to accurately map out the distances between real-world objects and i remember this not being my favorite feature at launch but it works far better now so for this second activity this second crazy experience to actually work we need it to be dark and so just to sort of stall some time we find this really nice little bar slash pub place that's near where we need to go and the view from there is incredible in fact i she took one of my favourite smartphone photos ever standing at this spot i give it a quick edit in lightroom and it looked even better but little did i realize i was about to capture something way better as the light starts to dip we headed to our second location we're gonna go to something called a dark sky reserve a specific designated area where artificial light pollution is pretty much non-existent and on the way i was on lightroom just editing a few of the photos we've taken earlier all right so we've reached the dark sky reserve now and this place is so quiet you can pretty much whisper and people can hear you clearly it's still a little bit light to see the dark sky and the stars and stuff properly so it's basically gonna set up camp for a couple of hours play around with the phone and the camera and then get to work on that okay all i want to say is just listen to this place it's one of the most serene things i've ever experienced pretty much the only thing you can hear is just the gentle sound of water it was completely breathtaking but we did have one problem all right so it's already 10:00 p.m. and it is nowhere near dark enough to do any kind of night sky shooting so we're just gonna basically camp out for a couple more hours and hopefully we'll see some kind of storage in the sky and sure enough eventually it did start to get dark and in fact so dark because remember there are no artificial lights around here though i managed to trip and fall down a hill oh mate all good though and what happens next completely made up for it so you've probably heard of night nodes the p30 pro takes incredible shots in the dark but set your phone up on a tripod and open up something called star trails mode and you can take it to the next level all right so we just got one shot of the stars and i am blown away i can't show it to you it is one most impressive things i've ever seen in my life so we left the phone to capture for around about eight minutes and in this time because the earth is moving slowly on its axis the phone captures the relative movement of the stars for a point of reference this is what the galaxy s 10 shot looked like using the phone's night mode we're talking a level of darkness where you can barely see meters in front of you anyways this is what the p30 pro managed to capture and let me tell you this was such a surreal moment nobody could believe what came out of this camera after a little edit on lightroom the result went from what our incredible jaw-dropping to just completely unprecedented we thought maybe if you zoom in you'll be able to spot some obvious notable flaw in it but that just wasn't the case and this right here is my best edited version of both these shots on the left is the p30 pro on the right is the s10 5g and here's the thing that one wasn't even my favorite we managed to take two more shots while we were here this one which captures a little bit more of the color in the sky especially with a bit of editing to draw it out and then for this one which we just stuck the phone facing directly upwards no interference just the phone to the sky and if we zoom in and you look closely you can actually see the points we're shooting stars have come and crossed the paths of the static stars the whole thing was such a blur and before i knew we were back again the next morning alright so start of day two and even though the phone was on all night it hasn't lost a lot of battery which is probably a good thing because we're just under fake descent right now i had a pretty sizable breakfast but trust me when i say i was gonna need it today and just before we headed to extreme activity number three we couldn't leave without at least seeing the famous pebble beaches of london no in wales we gave the super slow-motion video another stab with this clip right here of me attempting to skim a rock anyways it wasn't long before we were at the third activity which is actually world's fastest zipline through you might have guessed a welsh slate quarry okay so we're at the zip line and it looks like we've got one tear over here kind of baby levels applying but then the one i'm gonna be going on it's round about there so yeah it's gonna be good all pretty terrifying stuff and of course it wasn't long before we were right at the top with i got to say a pretty incredible view they didn't suddenly allow me to mount a p30 pro onto my forehead but we did manage to get some footage using dual view from the waiting area where we managed to get the 5 x zoom on one side and then the wide-angle zoom on the other side the way back was a pretty long one and battery life was running out as it was so i kept the usage light i did a little bit of editing of some of my favorite shots and a little bit of social media as well when i got back one of the first things i saw was the amazing sight of my cat trying to figure out what on earth a robot vacuum cleaner was doing in its territory i opened up the send anywhere application in order to transfer the 10 gigs or so of footage that had got on the phone to my laptop so i could start editing this video and that i got to say did take quite a significant toll on the phone's battery and so by the time it reached about 9:40 p.m. the phone was just about to go so i got a quick look at some of the battery usage stats over this period it's been on medium power saving for this trip and there's doesn't even one of the contributing factors for how an earth we've managed to get to last to extreme at days of use what an insane trip [music] you
