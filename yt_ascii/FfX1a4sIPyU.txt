this is one of the things that i find puzzling for example about dawkins because dawkins formulated the idea of meme which is by the way the same idea as archetype it's exactly the same idea except he just stopped it's like okay there are memes they're selected for okay selected on what basis exactly does that mean there's a hierarchy of memes are the memes more likely that are the memes that are conserved more likely to be what would you say viable organisms and if they're viable organisms are they microcosms this is really interesting in in terms of the survivability because there's a point i i've spoken to richard dawkins well a number of times but twice on my podcast and the second time somebody pointed out to me that there might be a point of agreement between you two that that has been overlooked which is that i don't know if you've ever come across the the evolutionary argument against naturalism or the argument from reason the idea that if you're a materialist you can't trust your your reasonable faculties so alvin planting formulated this very well very geniusly i think in saying that if you believe that evolution by natural selection happens materially what does natural selection select for survivability so if you're a materialist that means that the very rational faculty that you're using right now evolves not to be sensitive to truth but to survivability yes that's right and if that's the case well definitely why do you believe in the truth of evolution well because you've been rationally convinced of it but the thing that you've just ascented to the belief itself has just undercut the process by which you that bel there's a whole the the the new england pragmatists figured this out in like'80 now i think this is a fascinating i think it really is just a it's exciting it's it's that's for sure that's for sure it's actually a point where darwin and newton do not come together how do you mean well the darwinian definition of true and the newtonian definition not so here's the thing here's the thing you had a conversation with sam harris you've had you've had a number but one of them i don't think it was a live event i think it was before that you're talking about truth yeah and awkward first second talk i had with him i was extremely ill you know it was awkward to listen to because it felt very much like and i remember at the time thinking you know what is this this jordan peterson talking about like truth is like darwinian truth is about like survivability what do you mean truth is true true the way an arrow flies yeah right and now i asked richard dawkins about the evolutionary argument against naturalism i said well well how can you know that what you believe is true and he said because believing true things makes me more likely to survive hey hey boy watch where you go with that i didn't catch it at the time but i thought to myself afterwards it was one of my commenters on on on patreon actually had had mentioned this he was listening to rich and i said but you know but okay maybe but sometimes it's at least possible that something that's false helps you to survive you know the rustling in the bushes believing that that's a lion every time or a tiger even if it's not that helps you to survive because that one time that it is you're still going to run away and it costs you nothing to run away when it's not a tiger so believing it's a tiger even when it's not it's going to help you that's why we have a negativity bias yeah and and and dw says well yeah of course there are some circumstances where believing something false could be beneficial to survival and i said well how do you know that 2 plus 2 equals 4 is not one of those and it seemed as though he would he he was just saying that believing that would not be advantageous to our survival which might well be true but if that's the case then suddenly i'm listening to what you're saying about truth being more sort of darwinian related to survivability and i think maybe you two would agree there and i think well why is it that when you sit down with richard dawkins you find it difficult to have a conversation with each other and and well i think it's partly because we don't know each other very well that's so and also there are things he knows that i don't know and there are things i know that he doesn't know now i would say in my defense that i what would you say i'm more of the aware aware of the things he knows that i don't know than he is of the things i know that he doesn't know right so for example as far as i can tell dawkins doesn't know anything about the yian tradition of literary interpretation and that actually if you're going to talk about religion that's actually a fatal flaw right so and you know he's called me for example drunk on symbols it's like well the imagination is a biological function and it has a structure and a purpose and it has its own logos its own intelligence and if you're not aware that do drunk symbols it just me you don't know what you're talking so that that frustration that that you appeal to there when you when you hear richard dawkins i think terry eagleton said that listening to dawkins on theology is like listening to somebody who write a book about biology whose only knowledge of the subject is having once read the great british book of birds and okay fair enough that but that actually turns out to be a real problem it's a problem with regards even to the meme idea because you don't have to extend daw's work very far to understand that religious stories are memes sure right yeah well and and there's a hierarchy of memes and some of them are very functional but then here's the thing like that frustration that you're sort of throwing in that direction i think people throw it throw towards you and when when you say well religion you don't have to look very far see that religion is a meme well without further clarification and of course it's going to be it you can understand why to to somebody first listening that sounds almost atheistic or religion is a meme no religion is not religion is not a true historical account of you know the the history of the universe it's not a true historical account it's a meme now it's it it when you say that when you say that the resurrection of jesus well what does it mean historically that the spirit of god brooded upon the primordial waters like what does that mean historically no one no one knows think i don't think that at least most of genesis or parts of genesis are supposed to be i mean the bible is a is a is a library right it's not a book and that means that it's going to contain different genres that's for sure and so when when and some of them are more historically accurate and some of them tilt more towards that that kind of elusive i don't mean elusive in the i mean a l l u i sure right that that elusive and symbolic form that characterizes genesis one so because there are different genres here it depends on what story we're talking about and i think what i often observe you doing is we might talk about christianity and if you aren't comfortable committing to a historical ideal you'll start talking about the the spirit moving over the face of the waters which is which is obviously a much more mythological ideal and not not quite equivocating them but but moving between them too quickly and and not delineating them enough so if if i asked you you know do you think that the spirit moved across the face of the waters and you said to me something like i think it's still happening right that is what i would say say hey fair enough yeah that makes sense it always happens it happened at the beginning of time and it's always happening when somebody says did the exodus story happen did did the did the jews enslaved in egypt break free of their slavery and move to the promised land across the desert for 40 years did that happen mh you have also said of the exodus specifically it's still happening yes now to me that's far more inappropriate than saying that the spirit is still moving across the face of the waters because i think what people mean there is do you believe that these people in that time period actually did this in such a way that for instance might show up in an archaeological report well i think that i think that's the simplest answer to that is probably sure and that's that's fine too but then but we don't know i mean there like to the degree that there's been archaeological investigations into the kinds of biblical narratives that you've described the archaeological evidence tends to all on the side of historical accuracy in relationship to the bible quite surprisingly of clearly your your i mean you you spent more time in exodus than probably any person i've ever met in person right clearly the story sort of captivates you and you think it's really important and and and can a lot of course it's infinitely deep story i think most people speaking to you already know that you think that right and so when they ask you a question when when they said suddenly say to you but do you think it really happened well what the hell does that mean you you you must know that what they mean is what i was talking about a second ago which is that sort of what what okay so fine so it's easy just to turn this around it's like okay what exactly happened in in your historical account when moses encountered the burning bush i don't need to know exactly what happened what i need to know is i'm not asking you specifically or or attacking you for that what i need to know is that if i sort of went to the egyptian desert at sort of the time that the story is alleged to have take taken place in history would i see a mass movement of israelites from egypt into the promised land would i see people with feet walking through the desert leaving foot well let's let's let's take it apart rationally so and but you also understand that when when someone's asking that and you like even if you don't like the question you must understand what someone's asking yes well i understand many of the things that they're doing simultaneously you must also understand that when you then say it's still happening yeah people just go what are you talking about yeah well i would say that's not my problem but it's it's it becomes a problem when you understand that someone's asking a quite benal historical question yeah but you don't get to do that but why not because the stories that you're dealing with aren't benel i agree but like one so you can't reduce them to something even if it's even if it's what would you call it even if it's reassuring this actually happened it's well then what do you do with the burning bush it's actually happened one comparison i would make is is between this and talking about fiction more broadly yeah right well you got it right earlier you know i would say you kn you noted that the the the stories in the in in the in the biblical library leap across genres yes right well we know this because sometimes they're poetry and sometimes song yeah exactly and so so in any given story there's going to be historical account plus mythological overlay and you know you have to be a discriminating reader to kind of see what's different and you don't just get to say well all the mythological symbolism is historical reality it's like no it's not but here's the thing for example so like take take a piece of trivial fiction like forest gump yeah right we say like okay did that happen now i i think that what you probably say is something like well i don't think the events literally occurred but i think that they obviously get at something that's sort of perennially true about human nature then suppose i said they happened to they existed as a pattern but there's a scene in forest gump when you know he i think he meets the president is it jfk at the time i think he goes and meets john f kennedy yeah and so i said to you well well is is jfk the the like that part of that specific part of that story is it is it true that jfk was the president right and you would probably just say yeah yeah you you wouldn't say anything more complicated and even though the subject as a whole of like is forest gump true is hamlet true that's a complicated question very but specifically when i say ah but interestingly there's this there's this there's this little point i want to make in this discussion do you think that that jfk was actually the president you would say yes why do you think it matters to people like i don't know these are ancient accounts maybe that's the biggest problem maybe that's the biggest problem that that you have with people who are asking these question it is why why what what point are you trying to make here so the point is i know what the point usually is is the people who are asking the question believe that true in uniring means objectively happened in history like the things that we're seeing right now now happen it's like well no that's not how that's that's not what those stories are like for me some of it is but for a christian when asking you that it's probably because for them they have an understanding of christianity that requires believing in that kind of truth for me yeah i know that and the reason why why i hope that like me asking these questions will be less frustrating to you is because i have no desire for that i i don't care about that i'm genuinely just interested in what you think and so my my my desire to know whether you think exodus historically happened goes no further than a point of interest about your beliefs well so there's there's elements of the especially the setup to the exodus story that strike me as very very plausible historically so for example the the jews before the pharaoh of that time were under the guidance and protection of joseph and the previous pharaoh and they regarded the israelites as benefactors because they had joseph had helped save the kingdom and his people were welcome but that was forgotten and so the new pharaoh and the new egyptians regard the appallingly successful jews as destructive interlopers and they make them slaves it's like well can you believe that well it happens all the time it's happening right now it's very in this particular case saying it's very plaus like saying something like well yeah it could have happened i don't know well i i don't know i don't think anybody knows so when some asks did the exodus really happen that that word really when they say if i just really is the is the if i said did the exodus happen and and i'd understand why you would then say well you've got to understand what kind of story this is fine then if somebody says yeah but did it really happen which parts of it even if they're not expressing it very well like what they're getting at there is they're trying to emphasize the the historicity they're trying to say yeah but did it historically happen probably is what they mean by the word really there right but but the thing is it speaks of their see they have a the problem is is that christians who ask that have a metaphysics that's not christian mh [music]
