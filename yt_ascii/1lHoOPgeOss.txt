have to worry about our air land and water for sure 10 billion people on the planet there were 1 billion in'00 2 billion in 1900 4 billion in 1985 8 billion in 2022 and will peak out at 10 billion by 2073 according to the l we've never had that circumstance before jordan we're going going to have to find ways to live differently more inclusively and more sustainably while we continue to [music] grow hello everyone today i have the privilege of talking to mr terrence keeley terry was a speaker at the recent art conference in london in the business stream he's an expert on so-called esg investing of which he is quite skeptical perhaps the world's most foremost skeptic all things considered we talked about the idea of ethical investing exactly what that means the perils pitfalls and promises of pursuing so-called ethical investing strategies investment strategies we talked about the necessity of formulating a positive vision for the future financial and otherwise and and delved into the details of the 2008 financial crisis and the role played in that by the blindness willful and otherwise of people who were responsible for managing the world's money welcome to the discussion so terry let's start this out with i'd like to ask you some questions about your experience at ark maybe you could tell everybody watching and listening what you experienced there and what the consequences for you generally were with regard to the conference as a whole before we turn our attention to the spefic specific topics that you addressed in the panel that you participated in in london well as you remember jordan we met just this summer at heather higgins home and we ended up having a very interesting conversation on the role of business and finance in fashioning a better world and you kindly extended an invitation to me to be part of an esg panel but what i didn't realize in accepting that invitation it was that i was going to be in the company of 1,500 wonderful people from how many 60 countries i can't remember 70 72 countries 72 countries with a very like mind and that is how can we tell a better story and get humanity on a better path for the very severe challenges that lie in the decades ahead and i i have to say you know through you and to all of the other organizers i just have a profound sense of gratitude i felt frankly like i was coming home i live in a world where i have to be more careful with you about your pronouns and you have to be with me about my religious beliefs and yet i found in london that i was with many like-minded people who share a reverence for god and a reverence for humanity and a and a great desire to keep the planet on the right path a sustainable path but a path of growth and greater inclusivity and the way you and and philippa and others brought together the themes of art of music poetry religion as well as business themes political themes it was just a huge privilege for me in in many ways and i don't know what the status is for many of your listeners but it's difficult to be a conservative in america today you don't really have a political party you don't really have a a common home to to to go to and at ark in london i felt i was with a global community of of like believers jordan and and i came through very very hopeful two weeks earlier i had been at mitt romney's e2 conference i don't know if you know but mitt romney's sponsors an annual events in in park city e2 stands for enthusiasts and experts and i felt similarly there that you know again men and women of faith who have a very deep concern for humanity a very deep concern for the trajectory that we're on but have solutions and ideas for for a better way forward for as i wrote in that article for real clear politics a better story maybe i can share a very personal story already which is that my niece who went to stanford and graduated the 4.0 is one of many thousands if not to say hundreds of thousands of individuals who are in their mid-20s who don't want to have children jordan don't want to have children cu how could you imagine bringing children into a world when on january 1st 2050 the whole world's going to blow up because of climate change how how how could we be so thoughtless and so to have a a clear narrative a much better narrative about how our future is not disastrous our future is up to us we're going to get the globe that we deserve and quite candidly with greater mindfulness it's going to be the greatest possible human achievement ever and so that's how i felt coming out of london and how i felt with the great program that you and your colleagues put together do you do you think this takes us off our topic a bit but i'm going to go there anyways i mean you stressed two things that struck you when you were at the art conference and that that was that you were surrounded by people of faith and you could read that religiously to some degree but you could also read it as being surrounded by people who are willing to have the courage to put forward a positive vision of the future cu that's a form of faith too and it's very important for people who are watching and listening to understand that you can't take a step into the future without faith because you can't predict with anything approximating certainty what's going to happen as you move forward and so you have to adopt an attitude a priority that sees you through regardless of what happens and you can adopt an attitude of corrosive cynicism and bitterness and pessimism and defend yourself that way and there are times when that's appropriate but as a general stance towards the world it tends to be counterproductive and it's also the case that what a fragmented or misplaced faith religious faith even tends to seems to have as a consequence the development of something like an anti-human stance as things that aren't human like nature itself become worshiped instead of what's properly put first and foremost and there is a remarkable concordance i would say between the religious belief that each person is a divine locus of being let's say and and made in the image of god and a pro-human stance and one of the things that's really terrified me about the environmentalist movement which purports to be about the sanctity and security of the planet is easily transformed into something that is clearly and demonst anti-human like i've watched in absolute open-mouthed amazement over the last 10 years as the greens and the radical leftists when push comes to shove immediately demonstrate their willingness to sacrifice the poor to their planetary salvation delusions and it's so interesting he because in principle the left has being the party that puts forward the demand for compassion towards the marginalized and the oppressed economically and otherwise but man when you stack up the oppressed and margin ized against the hypothetical interests of the planet as such the lefties will sacrifice the poor in a tenth of a second and they do that not least with their insistence that energy costs have to skyrocket and consumption come down which to me is tantamount saying when consumption comes down the poor starve that's a necessary consequence of decreased consumption and anyone who thinks otherwise is either willfully blind or ignorant beyond any what would you say any morally acceptable degree so all right so so it was very it was very let let let let me take a moment to respond to that though jordan because it's absolutely clear that everyone implicitly or explicitly has a religious belief for some people the religious belief is that there is no religious belief but that then becomes its own religion that is to say some form of massive uh moral relativism becomes what in fact what they worshiped i stood in awe of you speaking on the stage at a couple of times about jacob's latter in the book of job and you know jordan what's fascinating about you and i know this is your podcast but priests and i i'm i come from a catholic background i worked for pope francis i co-chaired at the vatican financial reform commission i have quite a quite a catholic background but priests cannot put people in pews and yet you can fill the o2 arena with tens of thousands of young men to talk about the book of job and talk about jacob's latter and talk about the uphill struggle as being the moral struggle of our times uh i just congratulate you and your colleagues and i know you give a lot of credit to those around you as well for just being able jordan to enunciate this message in a way where it resonates to those who are genuinely lost to those who are genuinely looking for a a road map of how to have a better and more productive life and i i i i i want to establish early on this call i'm not a climate denier i do believe that there are human influences that are very much putting our land our air and our water at risk by the way the planet has never had 8 billion inhabitants before we're about to be 10 billion inhabitants we're going to have to find ways to behave much more sustainably but i was looking through my book of notes from from the ar conference and one of the things that i wrote down is it's not the climate deny it's the tradeoff deniers and even in loto c in the papal encyclical written by pope francis on the climate crisis he is very clear jordan very clear that there are tradeoffs that we need to have more prosperity there are too many people that are left behind the vast majority of human beings still use less electricity than one refrigerator uses in a year in the west we need to find ways to improve access improve aa ability improve abundance of and we've just finished this cop 28 conference this morning as you know and you know they've come off and finally been able to say let's do let's phase out fossil fuels but they're very quick right they're very quick to add that this must be done in a just way well if it's done in a just way the only way we're going to be able to get ourselves off of fossil fuels is by massively increasing nuclear by massively increasing some other sources and that is not plausible from now to 2050 we we are simply going to be continuing to utilize this mix of fossil fuels that we're dependent on for reasons of justice for reasons of human need for reasons of human necessity and as you pointed out and others at the conference if you look around the globe the wealthiest countries are the ones that actually have the cleanest energy mix so we must prioritize continued economic growth this is the mantra that i come to in my book repeatedly yes we need more economic growth but it needs to be more inclusive and it does need to be more sustainable and i am a member of the the church that says let's optimize between these various trade-offs growth and cleanliness and sustainability there are trade-offs and we're going to have to navigate them it's multivariable calculus it's not as easy as the only thing that matters is net zero by 2050 it's not the only thing that matters many things matter well well that only thing that matters narrative i've been i've been thinking that through in some detail and so part of what we're facing on the pathological culture war front is oversimplification that occurs for two reasons and the first reason is purely factual is that there are human effects on the environment some of which are deleterious i was struck most particularly when investigating such effects of on the effects of unrestricted coastal fishing on fish stocks because i think that's something we've done particularly disastrously there's a variety of problems like that but the important thing is there's a variety and that the the solutions to those problems are actually well they're multi-dimensional and complex and you can collapse all that into a single theory which is that all the there's one fundamental environmental emergency that's climate related and that can be attributed more or less solely to carbon dioxide and so the temptation there is to take this overwhelming complexity on the factual side and reduce it to the kind of simple mantra that anyone can master really in about 15 minutes and then you're done with that whole problem it's like well no the important thing is climate and the solution is carbon dioxide reductions like now now the benefit to you is that you don't have to think anymore but there's an additional benefit to the oversimplification which i think is even more nefarious and it's analogous to the oversimplification that's part and parcel of the victim victimizer narrative you know if you view the world through a lens of power and you assume that every human relationship can be understood in terms of victim and victimizer then all you have to do as a moral agent is claim your allyship with the vi victim and you've solved your moral problem the same thing applies on the environmental front is once you've established that carbon dioxide is the villain then you can make yourself not only a moral agent but something akin to the redeemer himself by merely proclaiming your what would you say your moral commitment to the goal of carbon dioxide reduction and so you eliminate having to think in the factual world and you eliminate actually having to do all the work that a companies genuine moral effort by swallowing the environmentalist narrative and then there's even a darker part of it as far as i'm concerned and this is where things go from merely ignorant and blind to outright malevolent which is that once you've identified the problem and the moral solution you can also take aim at anyone who hypothetically stands in the way and you can demonize them and as a consequence of your demonization you can you can let the worst elements in your char character have full reign in relationship to how you treat those people and you certainly see that with the victim victimizer narrative that's being played out with hamas at the moment the jews are the victimizers the palestinians are the victims and so that means the jews are properly subject to whatever punishment you feel inclined to meet out it's the same with those who hypothetically are compromising the environment and so it's such an ugly mess he because it's oversimplification factor it's ridiculous reductionism on the moral side and then it's the provision of a world that allows your desire for vengeful resentment driven hypothetical justice to have full reign over those you deem to be enemies of you in the planet a very very toxic combination and so that's the sort of thing it's that combination i believe that actually presents the apocalyptic danger and not whatever other problems severe as they are that might confront this on the environ confront us on the environmental side well i i have to give again credit to the arc organizers because i think you had the most definitive speaker steven kunan talk about the science and when i'm in let's i i just spoke at a climate symposium at harvard two weeks ago you you know jordan and i always try to present facts calmly there have been five mass extinction events on planet earth in the last 500 million years every single one of them were caused by the planet cooling too quickly that's how we lost the dinosaurs as you know you can actually give a litany of statistics some of which i've gotten from bjor lomborg over the years from from the copenhagen uh think tank the polar bear population is five times what it was 50 years ago total sea rise in the last 100 years has only been 23 cm 23 cm meaning meanwhile a lot of these atols in these island nations they've grown 123 cm many of them are actually in better position than they were we are having less violent storms but i i think the the steven konan argument which is really an important one is yes human beings have an impact yes carbon dioxide matters but it matters at such a small level relative to many other factors that are actually impacting the climate many of which we don't understand so where i take that and i i try to not oversimplify the climate mess but i always say that it's a complicated two-part problem one it's a collective action problem that is to say the greenhouse gases that are emitted by three countries only china india and russia right now are two and a half times that admitted by the entire north american continent and european union combined so until india china and russia are as serious about greenhouse gases as the rest of us are supposed to be let's not kid ourselves we still have a greenhouse gas problem and then the other one is the latoo c pope francis this is a multivariable calculous problem what we have is people who are denying that there are trade-offs let's recognize that there are trade-offs and let's have a calm uh inclusive fact-based conversation about what's the best thing to do i i brought a prop today this is a a plastic bottle right it has water in it well so i was telling the crew before we started this bt today jordan has onethird the amount of plastic that had in it 3 years ago that's not because of an esg regulation that's because it's cheaper to make it with less plastic and you can do it with less plastic this is the kind of progress that is being made because we are more mindful consumers are changing their investment decisions we are seeing people that want to have greater su sustainability we can look at patagonia this company that now only does clothes that if you bring them back they repair them for you patagonia's products are flying off the shelves people want to have a sustainable future this is one of the reasons why we can be optimistic about humanity's future jordan and i i don't downplay human influences we have to worry about our air land and water for sure 10 billion people on the planet there were 1 billion in'00 2 billion in 1900 4 billion in 1985 8 billion in 2022 and will peak out at 10 billion by 2073 according to the lanet how are we all going to stay here on this planet together allowing everyone to achieve their full potential we're going to have to live differently we're also going to have to live in an era of of aging in 2035 there will be more people over the age of 65 than under the age of' we've never had that circumstance before jordan we're going to have to find ways to live differently more inclusively and more sustainably while we continue to grow and all of that is possible i wrote a book on it and i'm just so incredibly optimistic about humanity's future and the ar conference really helped un for me underscore a lot of those themes well and so one of the things that that we could derive from let's say your discussion of patagonia is that these new ways that we're going to be required to find to live need to be offered to people as an invitation and not forced on them and so here's one of the things that happened in the aftermath of the art conference that i found extremely interesting and so we had quite a range of speakers and the and a quite a range of approach from speakers and political attitude and what happened was that the speakers who were the most political and who were the most tendentious and accusatory let's say in their approach produced the speeches that got by thinking is that john howard who are you thinking ofy mccarthy okay yeah kevin m particularly this isn't an insult you know he's a politician and but okay but but what happens it's so interesting to see is because the talks that really offered a invitational metaphysical vision got exponentially more views in the aftermath of the art conference that's yeah yeah and so so and so but but i think this is very much well worth noting is that as you point out people do understand quite broadly that we have to live in something approximating harmony with the broad natural environment and people are interested in finding ways to do that but if they're forced or manipulated into doing that which i think is it tends to be the approach of organizations like the wef and the un and even the european union to a large degree if they're forced to do that or connived into it or even nudged into it which is a very manipulative way of going about things they're going to resist they're going to fight back and we're not going to get anywhere whereas if people are invited and and and offered an alternative that they can undertake voluntarily the probability that they're going to first attend and and then comply is extraordinarily high not comply that's not the right word but but participate you know you see this in psychotherapy it's a psychotherapeutic truism is that i if you are setting up a situation where someone is pursuing positive behavioral change they have to determine the direction of that change and come to develop and accept the strategies voluntarily or all they do is kick back in all sorts of ways that are counterproductive and produce resistance and but it was so interesting to see that unfold at the arc conference because the speakers who were visionary and invitational had by far the biggest effect and they really set the tone for the conference too and so we really tried to learn that attent that that lesson right this has to be an invitation that could bring us to to our discussion of esgs do you want out let let let i just love to give an exclamation point to some of the points you're making though jordan because you you worry about a top-down solution and there's every reason for you to worry about top down solutions we see it right now i don't know if you know but clean energy stocks this year are down 25% while the stock market is up 25% we've been forcing so much money into some clean energy solution windmills off the coast of maine and others that are simply not working out similarly all these incentives to go buy electric vehicles are not working so there's general motors ford stantis yes they're worried about a uaw strike but they're even more worried about the fact that california is mandating them to create electric vehicles that people are not buying jordan people are not buying those cars so what are we going to do have a bunch of evs out in parking lots that nobody's willing to buy and think that we're solving our global climate crisis we not so there is this danger as you say as you enunciate of top-down solutions that are not being met by bottom up and this is the the beauty of the market you know friedrich hayek has a lot to say to us still you know i was thinking as i was preparing for the show this morning that god himself could not create a better system than the free markets and the reason is that the free markets consist of billions and billions of decisions that are being made by consumers out of their own free will that are ultimately going to drive where we're going to end up and it's so important to remember that that that that consumers attitudes change consumers are going to want to have for example louis vuon is right now designing all of these new luxury leather goods that are made out of mushrooms so that they can say this most this next very luxurious bag is carbon negative and i promise you they're going to sell a lot of those bags to people out there who really want to be able to say look i have a carbon negative bag the the the the beauty of the free markets governed by men and women of conscience who are are mindful with their their their consumption patterns and investment patterns and that's why i say mindfulness we're going to get the world we deserve either in this world or the next we greater mindfulness will lead to greater outcomes but we should let the markets let the markets work because they are better at at at delivering the future than anybody who's guessing what the future will be we're going to have way too many evs start off the new year with balance

that a little bit so the the technical reason for that so that everybody watching and listening understands when people promote the free market that can be an ideological promotion or it can be a an observation of sheer computational power so imagine that you're you're trying to make pricing decisions and purchasing decisions which you have to do all the time in this world when you're trading one thing off against another you could imagine either that you set up a system just think about it computationally you could set up a situation where there are literally millions or even billions of local computers gathering data about local circumstances making tradeoffs with regard to everything that's available to them in terms of data in that local environment and then communicating in a network fashion to indicate trends and future and future probabilities so what needs to be produced for example or you could replace that by a single computer or 10 of them that are trying to gather all of that information with no eyes on the ground relying on their hypothetical ideological expertise and that's the central planning model it's like why the hell would you exchange billions of distributed computers with sensory apparatus on the ground for a handful of centralized computers that can't even in principle have access to the proper data it's a preposterous claim it's an absurd claim and it's not like there's something magic about the free market except for the fact that it's an optimiz system of distributed computation and there is no replacing that with centralized view and you do get this problem that you just described i mean i think with regards to evs i've wondered this for a long time electric vehicles is like we know perfectly well not least because of what happened to california when they announced that everybody couldn't plug in their electric cars at the same time because the grid didn't have the capacity it's like i've been wondering well why are we being enjoined to buy electric cars when they when we don't have the grid power to to recharge them and then i thought oh well if the plan is actually like the c40 plan which is the plan put forward by a consortium of large cities if the plan is to reduce automobile ownership by 95% anyways it doesn't matter if you force people to buy electric cars that no one wants and that we won't be able to recharge because the bloody plan is for people not to have cars at all anyway and that's a that's well right and that's such a terrible plan because cars there's very little difference between a car and freedom and wealth it gives you such an unbelievable range of options at any given time ridiculously efficient use of private time and anybody who objects to that i think is immediately to be viewed with extreme suspicion especially if they're trying to implement top-down compulsory controls you know one of our principles at arc is no policy that requires compulsion is optimized there's a mistake it somewhere you know that gets tricky when you're dealing with criminals you know because sometimes people are in situations where they won't behave socially or in a psychologically in a manner that reflects psychological integrity without compulsion but most of the time the rule of thumb has to be if i have to force you to do something i'm putting forward the proposition improperly at minimum improperly well i i i as as you're speaking you know and i i'll talk about a couple different books today if i'm allowed to but one that's that that really did reach reach me it was written by rag rajan who's a professor of finance at the university of chicago and it's called the third pillar and what the thesis that r rajan has he's also the former chief economist of the imf and former governor of the reserve bank of india but jordan what his thesis is is that societies thrive when they have the three primary pillars of societal good in balance one is the markets if if if you don't have markets you're not driving prosperity the second is the state you need good you need you you need good government i i don't know about you but i like getting my driver's license on time i like it when the stop lights actually work we need good government the government that governs least is not necessarily the one that governs best and i think canada is an example of that but the third one is actually community or civic society and what the the the thesis that that that r rajan puts out i think very effectively is that if you have societies that have either one of those out of kilter where where where markets are too strong then then we run into environmental problems or we run into issues of distribution we we do have externalities negative externalities in markets that need to be corrected by proper government but the role of community and the role of nos and the role of the uh volunteer sector the role of faith in a community the role is equally important if societies have any one of those missing they are not in optimal balance they tend towards crony capitalism which is this topic that paul marshall spoke about as you know at arc or they they tend towards inefficiencies you have to have all three we need markets we need an optimal state and we need the community thriving ngo sector thrive it non for-profits which we do have in the united states in the united states we could use slightly better governments this is where we're where we're falling down quite quite candidly you know i i bring up paul marshall i wrote two articles after after the ar conference and one was inspired by paul marshall but not in the way that he thinks he actually spoke from the stage about the negative impact of uber as if it had you know demolished uh the lives of many livery drivers which it has it has interrupted the lives of many livery drivers but jordan it has vastly expanded the market for livery driving around the world there have been 4.2 billion uber uber ride since it was first and the number of markets there are 5.5 million uber drivers that turn on and off when they want to go to work this was a wonderful market innovation but it's what ef schumacher calls creative destruction markets need to be destructive just as they need to be creative in in in order to maintain that efficiency there's going to be disruptions that take place uber is a good disruption i was talking to philip about this afterwards he said well it helps if you're paul marshall because you always have a driver waiting for you those schmucks like me that come to phoenix and need to find a way to get in from the airport i'd rather just do it on my uber app so but but well the advantage to the market too is that it allows those disruptive forces to operate in a comparatively at a comparatively micro level i mean there's still radical transformations in market economies but the problem with the centralized economy is that they're so st fgy and blind that adaptation only occurs in catastrophic fits whereas in a in a dynamic market there can be local small revolutions that are continuous and like the way of of conceptualizing it technically is that the environment transforms at a rate that slightly exceeds our adaptation so there's always unexpected things happening as a consequence of the action of reality itself and then we have to fight to keep up and we're always a little slow on the uptake and so the adaptation process is can be can be disruptive but the wider the distribution of responsibility for adaptation the larger variety of of revolutionary adaptations that can be on offer and the smaller and more matched they are to the environmental transformation they can be and so you know it is frightening when you see a novel technological move forward like uber which does disrupt industries and cause a certain number of people grief but that's much better than refusing to adapt to the necessity for change and then have having to un involuntarily undergo a cataclysmic form of readaptation i mean that's really what happened when the soviet union collapsed it was that so many things had gone wrong that the only solution was that the whole system had to die well that's that that's that's an obvious evidence of market failure when huge things die small things didn't die fast enough that's really the rule of thumb so i think i think there's so many interesting lessons too right now jordan from ai and from the effective altruism movement many things that we can learn about the governance issues that just came out of open ai and we i i don't want to go down that rabbit hole but a lot of them again i think are are highlight the the principal points we making markets are important let capital move freely uh let let there be innovation as you know the whole idea between open ai was to have an open-source platform that everyone was contributing to make it altruistic so that it could be done in a good way and then they found well we still need billions of dollars how are we going to raise the billions of dollars to create the computational capacity that ai and chat gbt really requires and they knew they had to have that in a for-profit arm if they did not have that in a for-profit arm they would not have found the capital so so important lessons i think uh yes of course we need to be mindful but there's no way to build the world that we want to build where the needs and aspirations of the trillions of people yet to come because by the way if you actually look at where homo sapiens sapiens are in the normal course there are trillions of human beings yet to be born this is the william mcallister arguments that you probably what we owe the future a famous philosopher from oxford university that you need to have on your on your show if you haven't had him on yet and and and so and this is something that the pope speaks about very very eloquently also in l c which is that we do have in many ways jordan we do have responsibilities to future generations and we need to think how often do you think about your grandchildren how often do you think about your grandchildren's grandchildren do you care about them do you love them is is the life of your great great great great grandchild any less important than your life no it's not so let's go about this process of thinking how it is that we're going to create this sustainable planet and i i spent a little bit of time talking about you know the the broad philosophy of rag rajan but where i have spent a great deal of my life and work is in catholic social teaching and i i i'd love to come to catholic social teaching at some point on this podcast because as i say it it happens to be extraordinarily resident and pertinent for the times we live in not because it's catholic it just happens to be catholic it's actually about 150 years old and i think the broad principles of human dignity subsidiarity which you spoke about very eloquently from the stage responsibility personal responsibility and then solidarity the third principle of catholic social teaching which is that we are our brothers and sisters keepers there are too many people jordan that cannot take care of themselves and it is the respon responsibility of the strong to help the weak it is the responsibility for those of us who have more capacities and more capabilities to give that hand up to those who do not have it that is catholic social teaching and what's interesting is that subsidiarity argument you know turns out the declaration of independence is right all men and women are created equal they're obviously in the image of god and they are entitled to a life of liberty and and the pursuit of happiness their own ful fulfillment but the simple fact of the matter is that that cannot be achieved without people taking personal responsibility and families taking responsibilities for their own families and then communities beyond that uh that is how the system is going to work subsidiarity and solidarity there are going to live in constant tension we're never going to have them resolved there's always going to be somebody else who needs to be helped there's always going to be somebody else who needs to have more responsibility and that is that struggle uphill that you spoke so so eloquently about time and again at ark

generations let let's wander into the to the catholic social teaching domain for a moment so i spent a lot of time recently writing this book we who wrestle with god and one of the chapters in that book deals with the story of abraham so abraham is portrayed as the father of of nations and so my sense is that the story of abraham contains it within it the seeds of what would you say it contains within it a representation of what it means to live in the light of eternity so imagine that you could adopt an ethos that set you up in the best possible manner to increase the probability that your children would survive and thrive okay but but then let's extend that so because that's not sufficient and you could even make an evolutionary biology argu in this direction you want to develop an ethos that not only increases the probability that you will have children and that your children will thrive and survive but that establishes a pattern that they imitate that increases the probability that their children and their gr and their children's children will thrive and survive so it's an ethos that has to have a multigenerational that has to have multigenerational implication okay so that's exactly what abraham does now and and that's the the the manner in which that's to be done is actually laid out in the narrative so the first thing that happens that's very very interesting because it has to do with material satiation at the beginning of the story abraham is already he's already in the arms of the of the infantile utopia right because abraham has rich parents and he's privileged and he has everything material that anyone could ever want and yet this voice comes to him it's the voice of his ancestors and god and it says go out away from what is secure and have the adventure of your life and there's a call that's the calling and abraham attends to that calling and moves out into the world to cataclysmic end right because he encounters famine and slavery and the connivance of the aristocrats to steal his wife and battles with his in-laws and like the whole terrible array of potential catastrophes in life present themselves to abraham but he maintains a sacrificial attitude right that's that's emphasized throughout the text because every time abraham embarks on a new adventure start something new he rekindles his affiliation with what is highest and moves forward in faith and that's presented as part of a multigenerational vision and so one of the things that i find very exciting about the potential union of something like evolutionary biology and deep theology is the idea that if we oriented ourselves properly to the highest good which is by the way the message that's in the sermon on the mount we would see in that good the manifestation of the pathway that would enable us to live in a way that would ure that respect for multigenerational continuity that you just spoke about as the so of sustainability and so what that means is that it's the adoption of individual ethical responsibility in the highest manner that constitutes the proper pathway to sustainability and not top down manipulation of the political economic and social systems to bring about some form of of of what plans stability which we can't do right we can't do that no i mean you said the mere fact that you said earlier it's like if you look at china and russia and india first of all we have absolutely no right to tell them that they can't take the same pathway to wealth that we took and that was going to involve the use of coal and it's going to involve the use of fossil fuels and we might as well bloody well just get used to that cuz that's going to happen and then maybe out in the western countries we could be laying the groundwork for a nuclear revolution and and and and show the pathway forward for these countries that will have to transition through fossil fuel but there's no bloody way we're going to be able to do that by imposing our idiot utopian views on china and russia and india they're just going to tell us to go to hell which is what they should do well i i i'm i'm thinking of your your abraham's story you know jordan and just the importance of it and focus on future generations and one of the lines that you used repeatedly in london which has been inscribed into my brain is about tilting the world towards heaven and not towards hell how do we tilt do you know there's a lot that we can't do but how do we you know if the arc of humanity bends towards justice to what degree can we help get that justice arc going in in the right direction and another book that i wanted to give a shout out to that i know you have read and so many people have is pan lor's most recent book best things first and you know let's just be very clear in this book boran lomborg points out 12 different policies five of which are related to health two of which are related to nutrition one of education and four of which are economic that would cost $36 billion a year in a global economy that has 100 12 trillion dollar in 120 depending on pp purchasing power par but less than onethird of 1% would actually save 4.2 million lives and would generate a higher gdp of $1.1 trillion doar particularly in subsaharan africa where this growth is most needed and these are simple tuberculosis malaria ending neglected tropical diseases agricultural abundance you just look through you know i i i would i you know one of the things i'd love to do is give a copy of that book to literally every single policy maker that is to say every single abraham on earth saying look here are things that we can do right now they're very practical ending neglecting tropical diseases doing eprocurement so that there's a a much greater transparency free trade we're all against right now everyone's clamping down on free trade no free trade benefits humanity overall we we've got to continue to find ways where we can trade in accordance with comparative advantage this will in fact lift these billions of people who are not yet within the cycle of abundance not yet in in in in free of energy insecurity i it's another topic that we touched upon in london but that we need to return to there are three billion human beings on earth that live in energy poverty they can't turn on the lights what they want more than anything there not air conditioning they actually would like to have a lamp to read their books at night they can't even read their books so so these types of b lomberg policies these types of i have many of them in in my book as well as a a concept i called exemplars of hope very huge returns on on on investment some of those investments have to be done human to human and i i always say you know jordan there is no marginal tax rate that gets you to heaven if your if your earnings are taxed at 100% there's there's no moral you know paying them yes it's legal but that doesn't get you to heaven to get to heaven it will be by your works alone what you do and how you care for those who are most in need and how you can do that at a societal level which i believe you do with your podcast which i believe you do with your teaching i was listening to one of your joe rogan conversations recently and you were talking with joy absolute joy about how people come to you and talk about how their lives have been transformed because of the type of self-help advice that you've given to them i look at these things much more from a what is an economic solution as you know i've written this book on esg i'm sure we'll get into esg a little bit i'm pro i'm probably the number one critic on the face of the earth at esg not because of what it's trying to do i believe that esg was born of something very good that you know i think there's a lot of great intentions out there i don't i really don't want to discourage or or uh dis disdained the the intentions of even people who are out there protesting uh for for for zeroc carbon emissions their intentions are good jordan we need to work with those intentions but what will actually work what practically will create a globe of greater economic growth that is simultaneously more inclusive welcoming in those who have not yet had the great benefits that they need and should have and have every god-given right to have just like you and i do to have the types of material abundance where they can pursue all their other dreams as well as sustainability sustainability is not going away we're going we're going to you talk about the fisheries and how much cod is off the shore if we're not going to be mindful about these things we're screwed we're going to be screwed so so so so i i i make that case but i can talk about homelessness i can talk about solutions for recidivism i can talk about solutions for infant uh and and mother nutrition there are solutions out there that just like bjorn lorg points out in his book are not that expensive relative to the huge benefits that we can get from them and this is something let's do two let's do two things let's let's wander through the esg territory so maybe you can illuminate my guests as to as to exactly what esg means and why it came about and then why you're you're leery about it and then let's turn to a discussion of solutions so i'll let you go ahead with esg to begin with educate people to begin with because it's it's not easy for people to understand even what esg is so the the truth of the matter is that the environmental social and governance movement the esg movement which is all the rage could not be understood without the context that's provided by the united nations and everything that has happened since the second world war so it's a story i need to tell so as you probably remember at the end of the second world war elanor roosevelt worked together for 42 43 nations and they devised the universal declaration of human rights and this was a very utopic document jordan that said that every human being is entitled to to to obviously to freedom there's a whole range of of of inalienable rights are talking about but then there are anable rights they're entitled to food they're entitled to shelter they're entitled to education they're so this was quite something ambitious to do at the end of the second world war because the world was devastating well we we we didn't know how we were going to rebuild the european continent japan was a complete mess and yet here was this utopic statement of how humanity what humanity should ultimately be striving for fast forward 50 years from the signing of the united nations and you have the united nations then espousing millennial development goals the united nations sustainable development goals of which there are now 17 and what happened over the course of that 50 years is something that is s insufficiently celebrated since the end of the second world war till about 2000 the economic transformation of the globe was beyond anything anyone had possibly imagined possible the the the actual material abundance that has actually emerged since the second world war is simply unfathomable to your grandparents or your great-grandparents they would have no idea so per capita income since 1980 alone went from 25 $0000 to $122,000 what comes with all of the growth here's a statistic that i love jordan from 1990 until covid 128,000 human souls escaped abject poverty every day every day the number of human beings on the planet that were living on a191 a day which is how the world bank defines abject poverty in 1980 was one out of every two one out of every two human beings on the planet planet struggled to find a meal struggled to find where are they going to live would they have any heat overnight that statistic today is one out of 10 and of course that transpired at a time when when population growth was massive along with all of this material and economic abundance has come what always happens greater social educational and health advancements so we've had a a circumstance where life expectancy has expanded by 22% over that same period infant mortality dropped from 81 out of every uh 100,000 births to 25 so infant mortality fell 70% literacy rates massively improved what happens when prosperity grows is other aspects of human existence improve as well so what happened then and i'm i'm coming to esg i'm sorry for the prelude but it's necessary to have there there is no esg without this material abundance in in in in 1999 and 2000 the united nations convened the greatest collection of of political leaders in history and that collection included kings and and and prime ministers and and they designed the millennial development goals do you remember the millennial development goals the 2000 and and and the millennial development goals was let's get rid of poverty completely let's have a k to2 universal education around the globe things that were unfathomable 50 years earlier and let's find a way to make sure that there is greater uh political freedoms broadly speaking what ended up happening though is continued progress was being made on those jordan until about 2005 when kofi anan who was the secretary general of the united nations convened a group of financiers and he said listen i want there to be a group of finers that come up with investment principles that would help promote these united nations sustainable development goals and millennial development goals why don't you very smart people 70 of them he picked go in a room and come back and tell me what those principles for responsible investing are this is where esg came from esg emerged in 2005 with kofi andan ringing the bell at the new york stock exchange announcing these investment principles what were these investment principles they were a series of principles relating to environment mental social and governance factors that this group of financiers had assessed could present material risks material risks if we don't handle these things well enough they will lead to financial failure stocks will go down there there there was so esg actually came out of the united nations declaration for human rights the millennial millennial sustainable and the millennial development goals and the sustainable development goals and the united nation's principles for responsible investing that first went public in 2005 today there are more than 6,000 signatories to the united nations principles for responsible investment jordan those institutions collectively manage 120 trillion dollar in assets that is to say they they they manage one half of all the institutional assets that are available for investment in the world what are these people doing well they've come up with a series of products and ideas and and corporate resolutions and any number of things that are intended to highlight various elements of these environmental social and governance issues of pertinence to them so you know we tell the budlight story right someone decided that it was very important for budlight to expand its market share they need to be expanding in a dei sensitive way what did they do they have a commercial that was misconceived it pissed off two-thirds of the people who were actually drinking their beer and didn't result in any was so the esg rules as they have actually been applied have had a very a very important very series of unintended consequences that haven't always been well that that have been deleterious my principal criticism though of esg as a finer and the work that i write about in the book and the reason why i believe esg has neither done well nor much good is what i is what i say that was a wall street journal oped that i wrote that was read 4.2 million times it hasn't done well because in actual practice jordan what people have done is here's these esg rules in the s&p 500 which of course is comprised of the ostensibly the 500 best companies in in the united states typically what the esg uh enthusiasts do is they take out 400 of those and only invest in 100 of of the remaining stocks in actual practice that mean they were no longer investing in oil and gas they were no longer investing in what they regarded as nonvirtuous companies well this is just so silly this is absolutely silly the idea of you not owning exxon mobile is going to somehow change the temperature of the earth is just the silliest thing imaginable in fact it has the entire thesis on its head there's been this concept of socially responsible investing that has been around for cent i mean for for centuries many people avoided in investing in in in the slave trade right many people religious groups founded absolutely abor but the slave trade continued didn't it why it continued because one quarter of humanity was still willing to invest in it it turned out as a bor as it was it was incredibly lucrative the same thing is true in modern society there have been a number of investors likely most likely religiously based that have avoided what are called sin stocks the sin stocks are in four areas gambling al alcohol tobacco and firearms so many religiously organized religious organizations have not invested in these for but has that stopped smoking has that stopped people drinking has that stopped people from buying a firearm has that stopped people from gambling of course it hasn't so the esg movement investment movement is based on the same principle of if i don't invest in exxon mobile somehow the temperature of the earth is going to improve it's pure silliness jordan it's pure silliness so i i gave quite a quite an exposition there where i wanted to come out is that my criticism of esg as an investment movement is not that it shouldn't be trying to solve the problems of our times but that it hasn't it's done exactly the opposite of what needs to be done and i'm a big proponent of impact investing and i can give you literally a hundred examples affordable housing uh dei opportunities for female minority entrepreneurs that genuinely address some of these issues of inclusivity and sustainability there are ways to invest that take genuinely takes carbon out of the air you can do that with a green bond fund but you cannot do it with these esg equity funds so so let me let me ask you what might be a more fundamental question i mean it seems to me that anan's recommendations were ill-founded a priority and let me walk through this and tell me what you think about it so because he's making the assumption that there is already irresponsible investing that can be rectified by conscious attention to a set of ethical principles and see this strikes me as as ill as an illposed problem because if you have any sense and you're investing you invest as wisely as you possibly can and the reason you all things considered and the reason you do that is because well you don't want to lose your money you're hard-earned money and so you're already very much motivated to invest wisely now you could say well that would open the door to people making a short-term killing at other people's expense and maybe that's what happens with so-called sin investing but my sense is that well you can get away with making a short-term investment at other people's expense once or twice but you're going to get hammered for it sooner or later and so anan's notion was predicated on the idea that there was a way of imposing an a priory ethical framework on the problem of investment that would produce investments that would somehow do better which strikes me as highly improbable and that would actually increase what would you say ethical behavior as such i would say that people are already as motivated to invest wisely as they possibly can be if they're investing their own money or money they take stewardship of and the imposition of some top- down ideological framework is only going to compromise the investment strategy and not only the investment strategy but also the market strategy of companies i mean look we've seen well budweiser is a great example of an absolute bloody catastrophy target put their neck in the same noose i think disney's stock is down something like 50% because they fired everybody who could actually tell a story and brought in people who did nothing but you know produce second rate ideologically oriented narratives of the sort that flew in the face of what their customers demanded and undermined their entire brand and so how deep do you think the conflict between the esg attitude and the fundamental free market principles of responsible investing actually runs because i think like it looks to me that anan took what was essentially a socialist or even a communist view which is that well the market itself can't be trusted and it's necess necessary to generate these a priority ideological frameworks because that would direct everything much more effectively than it would be otherwise in a you know honest free market economy the whole thing to me just strikes first of all there's no bloody way you're going to beat the market with the strategy like that nobody can beat the market not continuously because they just have all the money so there is this problem that it doesn't work in practice but i also think there's a problem that it doesn't work in princip iple that it's the wrong way to go about it it is certainly the wrong way to go about it so much so that i have this article that i just shared with you it's coming out next week with ai that i co-authored with senator phil graham where we talk we call for the end of esg it's it's an irredeemable project at this stage jordan because it is as you say falsely premised and if something is falsely premised from the beginning there there's there's there's no way to adjust it to to make it work and you've said something that's very very wise and you know warren buffett charlie m recently passed away they've lived their lives according to this maximum it is extremely difficult to beat the s&p 500 you can own it for one basis point that's what most people should do but i'm someone you know and my career has been about advising people what to do with their with their assets their investments and i'm somebody who deeply believes jordan that if you're willing to make an investment that's going to have a lower return but it's going to result in i don't you know affordable housing or it's going to bring clean water to a village in rwanda or it's going to and you're willing to take a lower return my god go at it and a $ 51 trillion in wealth is about to be passed from the current generation of billionaires to their let's say less hardworking children and that particular group of individuals are very mindful for double bottom lines that is to say they do want their money to do well and to do good and an important part part of my new business and all the work that i'm doing is to provide uh investors who have this double bottom line mindset that want to do well and do good that are somehow willing to take a lower return as long as they somehow benefit some corner of society well there's going to be a lot of capital that's looking to do that and that's going to be an important part of what creates this inclusive sustainable growth world that we're going to need that's going to be this important this important part of the community that that community you know we said it's the market it's the state and community that have to work together and we're going to need that community to be part of the solution so let me let me ask you a question about that i mean i certainly understand the the the direction that you're trying to aim a certain percentage of investors in and i can imagine that that would also small percent a very small percent well and maybe a percent of someone's portfolio but i'm also wondering you know like one of the principles that i've abided by when a attempting to produce even products that are of particular benefit to people psychologically like i have a suite of psychological interventions online that i've been marketing to people for about two and a half decades i mean one of the principles that we established my business partners and i before we created these interventions was that not only did they have to be useful so to do good not only did they have to have that they had to be of demonstrable good but they also had to do competitively well so if i said well maybe so so is it too much to ask for people for example who are providing affordable housing let's say that they do it in such a canny manner that they also equal or beat what you might expect for standard market returns and couldn't you use that as an indication of the quality of their offering or do you do you feel that there are situations where placing both constraints on people you know you have to do good and you have to do well makes movement forward too difficult well let let let me give some numbers to to to frame the challenge and and then answer your question directly so as you probably remember the name of my company is 1.6 1.6% of institutional assets is $3.5 trillion so this is a little bit like the bond laurberg number if we actually if if institutional investors and ultra high network individuals were to allocate 1.6% of their assets per year to these types of investments that we're talking about true double bottomline investments affordable housing i can come up the a number of health financial inclusion education there are any number of booknook is the number of online learning tools that are we could actually achieve the united nations sustainable development goals by 20130 so that that is the amount of private capital that is needed to fill the gap so just put that number out there so you they frame that but let me respond more specifically to your i think the the the the one area of investment that i've spent most my time on in the united states jordan is affordable housing we we are basically shy i mean we have a homelessness problem we have a affordable housing problem there are only three ways really genuinely to build wealth in a lifetime one is to start a business or be an amazing podcaster like yourself two is to own the s&p 500 for 30 years but the third one is to own your own home rather than rent so we need to have find a way for there to continue to be greater access to home ownership from those who right now come out of college with these student loans and can't make a down payment we're going to have to find it it turns out that the equity returns on some of these affordable housing programs in nashville in austin across the country the equity returns to the investors are between 16 and'% a year well i'm sorry dear friend that is still 12% ahead of you know 14 % ahead of in the inflation rate and well in line with the actuarial needs of a number of the retirees if you can actually have a 15% return you double your money every five years who doesn't want to do that so so so an important part of what we're doing at my company is highlighting where these opportunities for double bottom lines truly exist it's something that i would love a future arc form and we're talking about you know arc in the united states having it's one that i would like there to be a thread on in arc in the united states because i think the united states has a far greater likelihood of leading in philanthropy and leading in these creative solutions than europe where they expect governments to do everything europe that you know there's hardly any philanthropic giving in europe because everyone well it's the state you know there's zero philanthropic g giving in in russia and china because the state is the only thing imagine trying to be a nonprofit in china or or russia solving problems you get outlawed so so the the the very interesting thing though is a lot of creativity is coming from these various organizations and i always give a shout out to my dear friend jim sorenson and the senson impact team which is in salt lake city you should also have jim senson on at some point so he pivoted 100% of his portfolio three years ago jordan to impact the only types of investments he makes now have to have verifiable impact and he's outperforming the market he's outperforming the market by 100 now this to me this is the sweet spot if you're outperforming the market and you're solving some major social and environmental problem of the day i'm all in i'm all in right right so so you are making the case that like with sufficient judgment you can have your cake and eat it too well that that was my sense with regards to the stratey emphasis on emphasis on the sufficient judgment it's hard you have to be mindful and there's a lot of hokum out there there's a lot of there's a lot of pretenders and false gods and cryptocurrency trad that have these you know sols you really must do your homework to make sure that there is verifiable additionality that is to say a dollar that is put into the strategy is going to create a solution that absent that dollar does not happen there needs to be real impact and that's something that you can say in affordable housing that's something you can say in some of these educational initiatives financial inclusion initiatives improving people's fico scores for example gives them direct access to to to to borrowing and direct and that there's a whole business operation hope in atlanta a great ngo one of the one of the organizations i call an exemplar of hope that has a proven pedagogy jordan a proven pedagogy that improves inclusivity and sustainability without compromising economic growth there are literally dozens of these organizations throughout the united states and and a lot of what they're doing can be replicated around the world so i've kind of got the you know born lomborg has done a really good job on these top 12 i got the next one's down on homelessness recidivism uh job opportunities here's a great one from catholic charities fort worth in dallas so it turns out as i'm sure you know 95% of the community college courses that people take in the united states of america which are free basically do not lead to a certification it turns out a lot of people taking those community college courses it's it's a it's a it's a crazy waste of money what did they learn at catholic charities fort worth they learned that if they actually give a casew worker to everyone who's trying to get a community college degree which is an expense it's like a bj laberg cost benefit expense but if you get that the completion rates multiply fivefold and then what happens those mothers then they're usually single mothers you know in their teens or early 20s they go from welfare dependency to to to work in independence and and and this is where we where we got to this is what the call for greater personal responsibility tells us this is what the call for for jacob's letter tells us this is what the call for greater inclusivity tells us this is what abraham would do if he were alive today right okay so that that program that you just described that's something akin to a mentorship program is so that people are going to college but they don't have guidance they don't have any way of of bouncing their plan off someone and everyone say know if you have mom take care of little juju on on tuesday afternoons you can make this course you're able to make it if you just adjust your schedule and drop off and and here's another uh daycare program that could you could use that you haven't heard of that type of additional assistance let me give you one though that i love even more which is teenage recidivism so it turns out the laboratory for economic opportunity at the university of notre dame which is an anti-poverty lab studied what was going on with teenage truants in the state of indiana and you know what they found out jordan they found out that if they teach a course of aristotelian ethics to these 13 14 15 16-year-old kids all of whom are brighter than we give them credit for while they are going through these treny programs recidivism declines 70% the the these these poor children god bless them have never had anybody to tell them this is good this is evil this is this is what an examined life consists of this is what an unexamined life results in this is and and and they're reading the original text they're reading aristotle they're reading plato you know this you know i was very moved by oz guinness for example at at ark it's the kind of thing that oz guinness would have would would would would would have designed himself so when you think of these individual programs that that i'm describing another one that i love in here in new york city is ready willing and able we're in a we're in a new york studio here and i'm sure that folks here have seen there're these guys that are pushing buckets on the street corners around new york city and their job is to sweep up the streets all of those all of those guys are homeless or former incarcerates and they're given a six-month opportunity to decide if they stay clean they stay off of drugs they they sleep in the home that's are that are provided to them there's a communal living circumstance and they clean the streets for which they are paid by new york city they can then choose from more than a dozen accreditation programs ranging from uh becoming a uh a plumber to becoming a a massage therap ist to any other and again jordan they are moved from dependency to independence from a life of of of despair to a life of meaning fulfillment and purpose and the the the these are oftentimes funded by these social bonds that are based on on on on outcomes the the the the things that are going on in this sort of social engineering space social entrepreneurial space it's very exciting it's very exciting and something that i hope future arc forums will will be able to you know really put in bright lights solutions things that are working ways that we are changing individuals lives in in in the moment that is verifiably not only fulfilling them but lowering the burden on society taking people reno nevada has haved homelessness in the last six months do you know how reno nevada haved the homeless rate no they built they built enough affordable housing and then they made it a law you cannot sleep on the streets you are arrested if you stay on the streets so everybody had a place to go they had to go to these places guess what happened when they went to these affordable they were then given career counseling those who had drug problems were given drug attention those who are mentally ill and a good part of our homeless problem in this country is mentally ill people we let them ride the subways here it's crazy no they have to be put into programs jordan that actually matches them with the needs that they have i don't need to tell you this and and there there's so reno nevada has done something that san francisco uh and la need to figure out uh we have more than enough space in the city of new york to to put homeless people in fact there's always enough beds in the city of new york for for homeless people but then combining that with the proper level of of of training counseling to get to independence is what's necessary okay so so i would like to hear some more of these solutions but maybe right now you could also i'm curious too how are people how could people who are watching and listening participate in programs like this and where could they turn to for the kind of investment advice into these programs that you would regard as credible and reliable yeah yeah so i i' i've got to be careful here because this has becomes very self self promotional well that's we can let people start through that themselves okay well my my website www.6.com highlights a whole range of these investment possibilities and i have a what i call a curated town square which is called the solutions forum and on the solutions forum where i post for example my video from arc but any other is an open source anyone who wants to put out their ideas for what they're doing on homelessness what they're doing on these various social issues are able to just so that would be one area that i would suggest an exemplar of hope which is something that i've trademarked is and it's global they have a bunch of these there's there's a wonderful one in the uk called make it click which goes home to home and teaches people how to use internet services and how to actually gain access to the information that's already in their homes that they didn't know that that that was available to them make a click program these various exemplars have many opportunities for for for volunteerism for other forms of of of of of time or talent and treasure that's what the the philanthropic world needs time talent and treasure all three are needed but in terms of scaling some of the very very best ideas i mean anybody out there wants to volunteer to teach aristotelian ethics in their local delinquency center there's ways to learn how to do that and i will promise you jordan the people that choose to it's what you do for a living by the way but the people who do that will find those days to the most fulfilling of their lives the days they're going to come home and just say i did something today you said something that i wrote down at the art conference in london which is that there is no difference between thinking about ourselves and being miserable to the extent that we're focused on ourselves and our own needs and our wants literally that is the recipe for human misery you want to actually be non-m miserable then operate with the third pillar of of of catholic social teaching which is solidarity we are our brothers and sisters keepers and by the way i i i put in that same category civility i think it's very very very possible for all of us to contribute to a greater culture of civility and and and by the way that means being better listeners as as as as a as a start and trying to respond to i've had my niece the one that i worry about not wanting to have children i think she's changing her mind come to my lectures and and read my and just say please you know claire criticize me what did i wrong tell tell me what is did you have a chance to read this did you see this and i can't give up you know i can't i can't i i can't give up jordan it would be wrong for me to give up and it's wrong for any of us to give up abraham didn't give up did he so this 1.6.1 n one one is numeric 6 is alphabetic i also have my own book sustainable which was endorsed by pope francis and larry think wrote the forward that talks about these doz dozens of these exemplars of hope just as examples and also provides this criticism of the esg which i'm not going to leave i believe that we would be better off just abandoning the whole project moving on acronym based investing remember the bricks we were supposed to only invest in the bricks for a while brazil russia india china well that's not the right investment strategy then there was the fang a facebook alphabet netfli google that made no sense anymore so so we just we we need to move on from esg understand that it was well- intended but that there's better solutions there's better ways for us to achieve greater inclusivity there's better ways for us to achieve greater sustainability and i put it another fine point on this i think b corporations you probably know b corporations are these corporations that promis to operate in very in accordance with very strict ethical rules very strict environmental rules i say great working for a b corporation is wonderful it leads to a great conscience just don't have any of those in your 401k because you won't be able to retire yeah well that well what that shows is that what what happens is that the appearance of moral effort is substituted for actual moral effort and that's why those companies underperform like what one of the things we should point out to people who are watching and listening in keeping with what you just said is that there is no magic bullet to invest it is no simpler to invest your money than it is to earn it those are equivalent problems and you have to be one wise and awake person to figure out where to put your money so that it will generate a return and that's probably the first thing you should be looking for because if the people who are who have your money can't do that they probably can't do anything else and then the second thing you should consider is well is this the sort of enterprise that you believe in your soul is worth supporting because you're actually morally obligated to do wise things with your money as well well not least to demonstrate to yourself that you have some respect for the time and effort you invested into generating the money to begin with and i suppose not least because poorly invested money can do an awful lot of damage right the last thing you want to do is give dangerous idiots money i i need to give you an amen a double amen a triple amen on all of that and just maybe add for listeners that we think a lot about our physical health we think a lot about our emotional health we think a lot about our mental health we we go to the gym we're careful with what we eat we need to be equally mindful about our financial health particularly in this age of aging almost everyone listening to this podcast is going to end up outliving their parents and they're going to be there in their 80s not and if all they have is social security they do not have a meaningful life you're going to have to have some type of nest egg we are living longer and i'm saying this to everybody in the room as well what you have to do with your 401k is put it in the stock market when you're young and forget about it don't even look at it until you turn 65 when you turn 65 you're going to open and say wow i've got $2 million in savings how did i do that you did it by not bothering with it you just let it go be mindful about your savings patterns be mindful about your investment patterns if you are so wealthy and you have so much time and you want to go for double bottom line investing or you have a desire to have your money do well and do good well that's fine too but it's still going to ire mindfulness it's still going to require deep care it's still going to require discernment because there's no easy way to just like you have to be careful about your physical health you have to be care careful about your financial health yeah well i studied for a while the phenomenon of money managers because i was interested in investigating the possibility that there were statistical ways of predicting market behavior and i basically concluded not that this was unique to me but at least to my own satisfaction that that was was actually a technically impossible outcome to perform except in very rare cases and so that your best bet and this is the advice that you gave earlier is if you're especially if you're the average investor is to buy something like an index fund with a low manager fee and just leave it the hell alone because you're not going to beat you're not going to beat that now let me give you a statistic for that only one out of five managers beats the s&p 500 over a 5year period only one out of 10 over a 10-e period and they aren't the same manager right they aren't the same manager precisely so so so so the idea that somehow you're smart enough oh i'm going to buy netflix and google and hang on to it and see what i can it's nuts you cannot be smarter than the market something so easy you can buy for one basis point at vanguard fidelity any number of places and just put it in place and forget it and the older you get start buying some bonds and having an income stream and then but more importantly volunteer your time look after your community be involved with those in need around you be there for your brothers and sisters your grandkids and others that's where you're going to want to spend your time right right right now you said that you had that larry thinkink wrote the intro to your book and that's interesting because larry think is probably the world's most famous proponent of the esg strategy and so how how did that come about and well i i presume you you obviously must know larry and what does he think of your your ideas and why did he write the forward to your book well this is how many people are listening to this podcast jordan because this is quite a personal story oh somewhere between 350,000 and a million but but know i'm g to tell the story i'm gon to tell i'm gonna i'm going to tell the story it's a story worth telling and it reflects very well on larry think and and my colleagues at black rock so i was a very senior executive black rock i went to the group executive board i said i wanted to write this book on esg i didn't know where it was going to take me jordan esg was a relatively new thing i i i wanted to spend time i i didn't have my my ideas so forly as i went into the book and as i started studying all these esg ratings and the fact that they're completely uncorrelated and frankly they're a bunch of nonsense they they made no sense i ended up becoming more critical of what was coming out on on esg and i'm still submitting all of these chapters to my colleagues in columbia university press columia is the my publisher and i'm thinking that i'm you know huny dory on my way well it turns out when the book finished my senior executives at black rock said you can't publish this book this this book is a little too racy i said well i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm sorry i i think that we agreed that that that we would well go speak to the boss so i went to speak to larry and i said larry larry go and he said this is very simple i have a simple solution i'll write the forward to the book and what does larry write in the forward to the book i i commend it to you he's very complimentary of me he's very complimentary of the work that i do the book but says i don't agree with everything terry says so very simple very simple you know get out of jail and larry to his great credit and i have nothing but great things to say about larry think he is a close friend always welcom the debate today larry think does not use the term esg he has tricken it from his vocabulary because he's decided it is overly politicized and it means the the wrong thing it's not so i would say i i probably get some credit for that you know larry think's not using esg you know one down four billion to go let's focus on impact investing let's f focus on true double bottom line and let's focus on making sure that asset owners those who investors get what they really want i mean i advise the pope you know on finances advised the world's largest sovereign wealth funds i always only ask one question jordan what are you trying to do if i if i were your financial adviser i would do the same thing what are you jordan peterson trying to do what are your goals lay it out give me your plan what's what what what are you trying to do and then it is my fiduciary duty to make sure that i devise the most coste effective efficient and highest probability portfolio solution that will actually achieve what your goals are that's what being a fiduciary means and i can say with my heart my hand on my heart that in the 13 years that i was at black rock i never did anything but that i never sold a single esg fund when i was at black rock and i did more than $130 trillion worth of transactions which is a lot of transactions and never once sold an esg fund because they were never the right solution they were never the right solution you you you said that you had you had worked with pope francis and i've been struck and i would say primarily negatively by what i've seen as his emphasis on climate responsibility let's say my sense is that the proper responsibility of the church is the salvation of individual souls and that that sort of thing is contentious and political enough so that it's actually not the proper business of the church now i don't know much about po pope francis and apart from that particular criticism i would say and my the small knowledge that was required to generate it i'm quite ignorant would you tell me and your viewer and our viewers what your experience was in working with pope francis on such on such ideas and and i i would i will do so with joy i always say you know uh jordan that my catholic church has the heart of pope francis the brains of benedict v 16th and the fortitude of john paul ii and it turns out those three individuals didn't agree on a lot and pope francis is someone who has definitely veered into a number of economic and social topics that i do not personally agree with but having been a catholic all 64 years of my life i note that the church's teachings evolve let me tell you though a personal story about pope francis so during the time that i was working on this vatican financial reform commission i lived in the exact same residence where he lived which is santa marta within at the vatican city state and every morning i was allowed to go to mass and one morning i was at mass and there was a just a horrible smell and i couldn't figure out what this horrible smell was this is a fairly curated audience and i look over my my right shoulder and i see there's a homeless guy with two dogs right behind me and i'm thinking to myself well you know security was a little lack today not sure how this happened so we go out to to breakfast and breakfast at at santa marta is served a cafeteria style so the pope is helping himself to eggs just as you're leaning over for a piece of bacon and you're smiling with one another and it's a very cordial affair but i sat down i said you know there was some people in the back of the chapel this morning does anybody know what's going oh yeah you don't know he said no i don't know i said well yes every night pope francis sends one of his emissaries out to the bridges in rome and finds homeless people and invites them to come to mass the next morning he they usually do that between 11: and 1:00 in the morning 11:00 p.m. 1:00 in the morning and this particular individual said well i'd like to come but i can't because i have two dogs and they said you're allowed to bring the dogs so this person was the personal invit invitee of pope francis to come and hear the word of the lord by the way he was also given a shower a shampoo and a shave at the end of it pope francis instituted in the vatican city state a free barber shop for anybody in rome who wants to come in and get cleaned up that's paid for by by by the vatican so i think this is a story that i hope you know reveals the heart of pope francis who is a good man i don't know about you jordan but being in charge of 1.2 billion souls on the planet that's one hell of a burden being in charge of a of an organization that is as political as as as the church is with as wide views politically as as you can possibly imagine from from liberation theologists who are full-blown marxists to some of the most conservative people on the planet all of those people are catholics under one roof uh to actually try to be the shepherd for that flock is not a task that i envy and i'll also just point out that there are only three monarchies left on the planet pope francis's is one of them crown prince muhammad bin salon of saudi arabia is another and the sultan of brunai what these three guys say goes in their country whatever they do that's the law and so the uh heavy is the head that bears the crown heavy is the head that bears the pontiff uh hat and my my my respect for pope francis and what he's trying to do is eternal i respectfully disagree with him on things but the catholic church like every church like any any listener believer it's it's it's the the community of believers that ultimately make that community there is such a thing as the congregation of the le the le within the catholic church has a lot to say and those of us who have disagreements with church i'm writing this article with erica castelow right now on the issue of of of children erica by the way another wonderful speaker at the art conference in london somebody i had dinner with two nights ago with her husband and we believe that we can push the church a little bit further we should not have unwanted children jordan we should not bring being bringing people into this world that we cannot properly take care of if that involves some form of birth control will so be it and so we're going to have to have more of a grown-up conversation inspired by the teachings of jesus inspired by the teachings of the church that that that takes into account that we live in this new world of 10 billion people 10 billion people trying to make this little ball of and water and a little little little sliver of air on top of it work for centuries and centuries to come because like abraham we have to care about our great great great great grandchildren well you know that's a pretty good place to end and it's perfectly timed so i think we'll take that opportunity to do exactly that i'm going to reiterate for the viewers and listeners the websites that you described the first one was www. 1.6 . with one numeric and six written out i've got that right i hope and point is also written out one one is numeric point is written out p o i n ts ix.com okay okay and you you talked about the solutions for there you also mentioned a site in the uk u makeit click.com if i got that right we'll put all this in the description of the video speaker notes yes absolutely absolutely so well thank you very much for discussion today cleared up a lot of things for me i was very particularly curious about your comments about larry fink and i'm i'm very glad to hear that he had the largess of mind of spirit let's say to to enthusiastically promote your book despite the fact that you had substantive disagreements with him i thought you did a a remarkable job of being evenhanded in your discussion of the esg movement pointing out that you know it's a mistake to assume that the motivations that gave rise to the to the movement were all to be treated with cynicism exactly yeah well and i think the same thing is true of the un millennium goals i mean the we need ambitions and we need to figure out how to implement them without undo top- down control and that's actually a very difficult problem right it's something we're wrestling with at arc is like well how can we provide leadership without d d what transforming across even a few short years into just another organization that issues top down you know moral pronouncements it's very difficult thing to get right for any length of time so i appreciate all that i want to thank everybody who's watching and listening for your time and attention i repeat that after every episode but it's always true i'm i'm very thrilled to have the privilege to talk to as many people as i do get to talk to and i'm also heartened by the fact that these podcasts which are very technically complex and that i what put forward at the highest level of my intellectual ability that they meet with such a receptive audience and that all these people like you sir who can bring their wisdom out into the world are being welcomed in their attempts to do so i think that's absolutely remarkable and and another reason for hope in a in a in a future that's going to be very challenging but that is rife with an unbelievable amount of opportunities which is also something that you made clear today so and thank you again to the dailywire plus people for making these conversations possible in the film crew here in on vancouver island where i am with my family i'm going to continue my discussion with terry on the daily we plus platform i'd like to delve a little bit into his personal background find out i want to find out where he came from and why and what motivates him and so if you want to join us on the daily weare plus side that also offers you an opportunity to throw some support the daily wire way and i think that's a useful thing to do given what they're attempting to accomplish in the world there's a organization that's trying to do good and do well at the same time and my experience with them really indicates that that is what they're attempting to do and quite successfully so hopefully we'll join some of you there thanks again mr key much much appreciated it's an honor jordan genuinely an honor thank you so much for having [music] me
