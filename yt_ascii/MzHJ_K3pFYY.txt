at the end of 2019 i had everything i'd ever wanted as a filmmaker i was living in mexico city working for huge clients like netflix and national geographic and i had more work coming in than i could handle i was working on crazy stories about all sorts of intense subject matter and for a guy who started out 15 years ago wanting to be a war photographer i thought i'd hit the professional jackpot my main specialty during all this was filming with drug cartels and because of the risk involved i was able to charge a great day rate everything was going really well until they tried to kill me i'll tell you the full story of how all that happened in a minute but trust me it was very very close my camera and tripod took three bullets less than six inches from where i was standing and three out of the seven people in the house with us were shot now obviously i survived or i wouldn't be here making this video but in that moment when i thought i was about to die i learned a few things about filmmaking and life that i'll never forget and that's what i'm going to share today six lessons about life is a documentary filmmaker i learned the hard way so that you don't have to the last one literally changed the entire way i view this industry in my place so let's get right into what i learned from four years of filming narcos [music] this channel i teach the skills and tricks i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer so at the end of 2019 i'd been living in mexico for almost four years and through a weird series of coincidences i ended up becoming one of the go-to guys that international documentary crews would hire if they wanted to film with drug cartels i covered everything from assassins to fentanyl cooks to loading 20 million dollars worth of cocaine onto speed boats in the middle of the night i didn't exactly plan for this to happen but i'd be lying if i said i didn't think the work was pretty exciting i was seeing things that most people never would and i had crazier work stories than almost anyone else i knew then one day i was shooting for national geographic on the outskirts of juarez one of the most dangerous cities in mexico and i think in 2010 was considered the most dangerous city in the world we were setting up for an interview with a group of assassins connected to one of the larger cartels operating in the area when a group of six or so gunmen snuck over the backyard fence and opened fire into the house i'm gonna leave out the most graphic details but it's enough to say that half of the seven people i was with were hit right away i dove for cover behind a concrete wall in the kitchen and lay there in a little ball for what seemed like an eternity it was probably more like 30 seconds and in that time a bunch of things became really clear to me in a way that i'd never experienced before it wasn't a near-death experience in the way of seeing my life flash before my eyes or anything like that but more like finally noticing some things about work and life clearly for the first time and they hit me all at once in a fraction of a second and those are what i wanted to share with you today because i don't want anyone else to have to learn them in the same way that i did as i lay there on that dirty old linoleum floor and literally washed blood pump out of a hole in my director's leg the first thing i remember thinking was well this wasn't worth it i'm being totally honest the show we were working on even though it was really about intense subject matter was probably not going to be all that good i'm not saying that it was bad or anything like that more like we all sort of knew was the kind of thing that would play a few times on a sunday afternoon but probably wouldn't make much of an impact on the world and when i thought i was gonna die i didn't want it to be for something that didn't really matter and that's the first lesson i want to share when it comes to your own filmmaking careers try to really care about what you're making now i know we all need money and we have to take all sorts of jobs over the course of our lives to get by not everything we shoot is going to be super meaningful all the time and that's okay but even if you're not getting shot at a career in filmmaking is going to require a lot of sacrifices and they're only worth it in my opinion if you care that could be just a matter of investing time into personal projects or working with non-profits that you think are doing important work but try to find some way to do work that means something to you otherwise the sacrifices might not be worth it after the initial round of shooting stopped i remember this weird calm where everything just went quiet in the room then suddenly we're all up and running out the door and piling into the trunk of a car there's a whole bunch to this story but the short version is that i was eventually dropped off in front of a small medical clinic with my camera assistant and the director who still had a bullet in his leg and was going to shock now i'm no combat medic or anything like that but i have done a lot of first aid and hostile environment training which is like war zone training for journalists if you've never heard of it and so i knew enough to be able to slow down his blood loss until we could get to a hospital i'm not saying i saved his life or anything heroic like that but having some idea what to do in a crazy situation like that made me feel so much more in control and calm and that's my next piece of advice get as much training as you can before you need it first aid is always a good one but you don't have to go and do battlefield medical courses like i did in order to make yourself a more versatile filmmaker learn to drive off-road or get your scuba license or learn spanish or teach yourself after effects i feel like all the experiences and skills you have surrounding filmmaking end up shaping the course of your career almost as much as the camera skills do in the long run becoming a more well-rounded person in general and i think you'll be surprised when those abilities pop up and save the day i personally did the hostile environment training after one of my photojournalism icons tim hetherington was killed by a mortar in libya but i never really expected to need it when i did need it though i think you can probably imagine i was glad i had it anyways when we finally made it to the hospital we realized that some of the other people who'd been hurt in the shooting were in the room next door actually the guy we'd been interviewing who was in reality a cartel hitman died in the middle of the night and i will never forget the sound of his wife screaming through the curtains even though they were both criminals and had done some horrible things in their lives they were still human beings with people in their lives they loved and who loved them back and that's a pretty heavy story i know but it demonstrates the next point i wanted to share and that's how important empathy is for filmmakers the people you film could easily be you in another life and it was pure luck that my director survived and the man next door didn't if you want to tell good stories about the lives of other people you need to be able to put yourself in their shoes after working with cartels for years i know that i could have just as easily been sucked into that world if i'd been born poor on the outskirts of juarez instead of in toronto and because of that i tried to never judge the people i was filming of course i didn't agree with a lot of the things they did but that doesn't mean i didn't empathize with how they got where they were and how lucky i was by comparison you might not be able to walk a mile in the shoes of everyone you film but if you can at least try and empathize with what being in their shoes might feel like i think you'll have a much better chance of connecting to the stories you're trying to tell speaking of being lucky once the director had been stabilized and his leg was in a cast i was able to call in some favors with let's just call it an unnamed american government agency i had worked with on similar stories in the past and an agent from set agency came out in the middle of the night and helped us cross the border into the u.s without having to deal with all the crazy questions from the border guards about what we were doing there it wasn't until we actually got to the hospital in texas that i realized that the rest of the crew and i'm talking about our mexican producer and camera system hadn't been able to cross the border with us in fact they'd just been taken to a local hotel by police and told to stay there which was not at all where they wanted to be considering what had just happened now i'm not trying to make this video preachy or political at all but that night reinforced to me how much of a real thing privileges in this world and i have never forgotten it i had a canadian passport instead of a mexican one so i was taken to safety and escorted back across the border the next day in an armored car initially my mexican crew were told they'd be taken to safety as well but as soon as we'd cleared the border they were told there was a change of plans and that they should just stay where they were crazy unfair and it seriously pissed me off but the lesson is an important one for all documentary filmmakers to keep in mind just to be able to even consider the idea of making our are living by following our passions and telling stories makes us some of the luckiest people to ever have lived so many people out there are caught in cycles of poverty or violence and if you want to tell stories that matter and create meaningful changes it's important to remember that acknowledging that privilege exists in this world will help you empathize better with your subjects and it's going to keep you going when things get hard because at the end of the day if we get to live our lives as filmmakers we're already doing great in this world that night after the director was admitted to the icu i got dropped off in a scummy motel on the outskirts of el paso and told to wait till the morning this place literally had one of those weird coin slot machines for vibrating the bed so that should tell you all you need to know about it i remember lying there on this lumpy mattress and being so surprised that this had actually happened to me i've been doing some really risky stuff for years by that point from filming with cartels to riding freight trains across mexico with migrant caravans to reporting on natural disasters and kidnappings it's somehow i thought none of it could ever impact me like somehow the camera and my status as a filmmaker protected me from the events where bad things were happening in front of my lens so when everything went wrong in an instant and i realized that i was very much not protected my first reaction was surprise being a filmmaker doesn't make you invulnerable and even though it might seem like it's worth it to take any risk for the sake of your filmmaking career it might not be worth it or you might care so much about the story and the people you're filming that you decide it is worth it and that's valid too but camera has a way of acting as a weird barrier between you and the real world and it's important to understand that it doesn't remove you from your story as much as it might seem the next morning i cleaned all the gunpowder off my camera gear and got on a flight back to my apartment in mexico city i was in a pretty weird days as you can probably imagine but i remember the thing that got me through where all the messages of support and love from my colleagues the shooting of a national geographic reporter was pretty big news it was written about in the la times and a few other big papers so by the time i woke up pretty much everyone in my social circle knew all the support i got from those people is what kept me sane and calm during the week after so it taught me what's probably the most important lesson of them all about filmmaking community matters when i first started out as a photojournalist and later a filmmaker i was struggling really hard to get those early jobs now i'm not proud of it but i remember kind of feeling resentful when other people at my level got great gigs or scored some big success i sometimes felt like why didn't i get that job or win that award and instead of them and i found it pretty hard to be happy for them took me years to realize that this is totally the wrong way to look at things filmmaking is a team sport and without a thriving and supportive network you're not going to get very far it isn't me versus the world it's all of us together advancing the art of storytelling what's good for your peers is also good for you and the people you start with will be the big time professionals of the future one day down the road instead of competing with each other help each other and everyone will rise up together when things are good you can pass each other jobs and share contacts when things are bad like when you almost die behind the juarez airport they'll let you sleep in their guest room and make you dinner without the community i built up around me i am really not sure how i would have gotten through that period so don't ignore that aspect of the industry on your rush to the top make friends share information help people with less experience than you reach out to people you admire strong communities last longer and staying in the game is the only real way to make it so in the end that experience was a big time reality show and i decided to call it quits on the narco stuff and come back to canada where i am now a lot of the work i do today is still fairly out there and extreme by most people's standards but the hardcore violence of that world just wasn't worth it anymore for me at least not as my full-time job but even though that day sucked a lot the insights i got into my own life and filmmaking career in that instant as i thought i was about to die were so powerful and impactful that i'm actually grateful it happened if you could get wisdom like this in pill form it would make billions but unfortunately for now it still has to be learned the hard way i guess i haven't really talked about much of that stuff on the channel before but i hope that that story was interesting and that some of those lessons i learned help you think about your career in a different way if you want to hear more about that kind of work let me know in the comments i'm happy to share just because i haven't talked about it doesn't mean i'm not willing to so let me know what you want to see if you have any stories or life lessons that you learned the hard way also share those in the comments i love the community aspect of youtube and i want to hear from you all so thanks for watching as always and if you like that video and want more you might also like this other one about how i got my first job shooting for national geographic see ya [music]
