- this is my friend tyler's car and it recently stopped working. so we thought it'd be a
good idea to smash it. fill it with slime. his car just got slimed. blow it up. and then take him to the
dealership to buy a new car. now i needed chuck e. cheese tokens for an up and coming video. so i paid tyler to drive all day to the nearest chuck e.
cheese and get tokens. and while he was gone, this
is what we did to his car. - hello? - hey, so for that garret video coming up, we need some chuck e. cheese tokens. can you run to the nearest one? - yeah, where's it at? - i don't honestly know. i think there's one in but obviously it's gonna
take you a couple hours. so if you could leave
soon, that'd be great. 'cause we do need that tomorrow. - yeah, that's cool. as long as you know, it'll
take me a little time. - yep. we just bought a slow mo camera. so let's see what a bullet looks like going through a window. - shoot. - good boy, way to stay in place. what gun you got there? this is the nerf blaster that we use. - yeah, youtube gods. this is a -
- it's a nerf gun. we probably shouldn't say that. 'cause it's not a nerf gun. - it's the water gun. - yeah, there you go. - three, two, one, two. - the bullet didn't even go through. - so. - it got stopped by this really heavy boy. - the window disappeared. hey chris, how many minivans
does it take to stop an ak? - i guess, one. - there's glass on this door and. - pro window removers here. - did they teach you
that in viking school? - they did, second grade. - alright guys, we got about two hours till tyler comes back
and i'm not a big fan of destroying cars but you
guys seem really excited. so have fun. and jake, please don't kill anyone. - stand clear. - aw, hey car, give him
his pickax back car. it took my -
- you know what? fortnite's a lie. you see fortnite cars taking pickaxes? wow jake, that's a lot of force. - giving it all i have. - oh, man. - oh yeah, work it ladies. - this might get our female viewership up. - jimmy, what radio station do you like? - i kinda like pop. give me some taylor swift. - alright. this a good song? - nah, this is a bad song. - alright, ow about this? - nah better one, man. - hey actually i do like this song. - good. - - this sounds like my outro song. - it's stuck on this one. - alright, well it looks like they're stuck listening to it. - oh god, it's terrible! okay, i really can't get it out.. - alright, let's have a competition. let's see who can
shatter the front window. chris, you go first. - oh god. viewers, rate chris's swing. window, that's stealing. it's not your pick ax, give it back. jake is now, oh ladies first. katie, it's your turn. nice, nice. chris, her dent's a little
bit bigger than yours. that was. - wow, oh my god. - here, can i just see that ax real quick? just throw that over there. alright yeah, you can go home. - i think there's like some
puppies that need cuddlin'. - yeah. you wanna go work at the
daycare or something? - anybody remember this
from the last car video? - nah, last video was funnier. cut to the last video. oh god. chris. - yeah. - this car called your mom fat. i'm just kidding. i'm just kidding, said
she was very attractive. - you what? - do you think your brother will care about what we're doing to his car? - nah. - that's a really big headlight. i really wanna smash it. just 'cause it's so large. - wait! chris headlight matters lives too. jake, are you not part of the headlight matter lives too moment? - this is because toyota
doesn't sponsor us. - for my next trick, i'll
make a hammer disappear. [chris] you gonna cook us lunch? - yeah guys, you've
been doing it all wrong. everyone knows the best way to
destroy a car is a microwave. my hot pocket's still not ready. - hey, give it one more throw. see now it's plugged
in and now it'll work. see, ding they're ready. - hey chris. remember when you found
spaghetti right here? - yeah. - let's see if we can find some more. - oh yeah lookit all
this spaghet right here. - dude i see some red ones. does that mean it has tomato sauce? - that's the tomato sauce. the yellow ones ain't got no sauce. - i'm allergic to spaghetti. close that up man. oh, geez. viewers, sorry about that. wait, is that a speaker? - that's a speaker. - dude speakers are really good at jenga. - yeah, they are. let's see if they're
good at getting kicked. - can you tell us something really embarrassing about tyler that he wouldn't want the world to know? did he poop his pants in
first grade or something? - our first grade we were homeschooled. - was your teacher hot? - oh wait, there is a sunroof. - you just break it open
and it's a moon roof. - okay. - moon roof. - now we have no roof, dummy. are you the mailman? - yes, here you go. - you sound like mario. - oh my goodness. there's a golf ball in here. - oh, we're doing it. - we're gonna hit that golf ball in there with the slow mo camera. alright, jake show us
that golf swing then. - oh, are you ready for this hole in one. - yeah. - two, one. - jake, you missed! - the car has a tail now it's a monkey. - look, it's happy. look it's wagging it's tail. - good boy, who's a good boy? you're a good boy. - i'm gonna blow this entire bumper off. there we go. - yep. - wait, so you're telling me all i have to do is scream
and i'll sound like that. - yeah. - hey jake, let's hear you scream. but see we didn't edit
yours just, what a weirdo. - what? that's not how you scream? - my scream sounds like. - nice. - what you doing? - looking for blockbuster gift cards. - how many you got so far? - zero bro, they don't sell 'em. so like i'm trying to go
to pawn shops and stuff. - oh, okay. i'm gonna talk to delaware and
then i'm gonna call you back. see what he wants you to do. - alright. - alright, i'll see you. - to make it not obvious, i wanted you to call him 'cause i've already called him twice. - yeah. - alright, jake, i don't want him to die, but i think it'd be funny if we put it on the front of his car just 'cause. i don't know, it'd just be funny. but obviously i don't mean
this, and like he's my friend and he'll think it's really funny. - um. - we don't have that much slime and obviously we don't
wanna be super wasteful. so what we're doing is
we're putting saran wrap and covering up certain parts so we don't need to use tons of slime and we just need to fill
the parts of the car that he can see, like the
windshields and stuff like that. so what they're gonna do is pour slime in the car tipped over. - get over the windshield, yeah. - dude, tyler's gonna be so pissed. - he's gotta be surprised. - that's for sure. alright, his car just got slimed. it blends in with his car. this was a horrible idea. - hey, hello? - hey, can you head over here? - yeah, jake just called. - okay. yeah, we're at the farm. - alright see ya'. - see ya'. i've done something similar
to this in the past. and tyler's probably seen that video. so to spice it up, we're
gonna be acting like we destroyed his sister's car and that we're gonna buy
his sister a new car. so he is gonna be really confused 'cause he is gonna be like,
"you guys destroyed my car. why is my sister getting a new car?" because you know, he
knows how things work. so if we just showed him his
destroyed car, he'd be like "oh i'm getting a new car". so we're gonna prank him and act like we're getting his sister a new car. yeah, we wanted to show you something. come over here. we took your sister's
car and we destroyed it. and then we're gonna go buy her a new one. we just wanted to get
your reaction to the car. - oh my gosh. that is all jacked up. wait, why does she get a car before me? i don't under, i was
work, i got you this job. - she said she really needed it. she said her car didn't
even start anymore. - are you joking right now? - it doesn't work. - oh, i oh that's oh man. oh you want me to die bro, come on. - that's for clickbait. i don't want you to
die, i want you to live. - it's her car. - this is her car? - yeah. - we totaled her. - i drove this to school
and was called a soccer mom. no this is like, this is i
take full credit for this car. - you have that car, that's your car. - yeah. tyler, what car? if this isn't your car,
what did you pull up in? - illuminati confirmed. - that's right. - she said she wanted a new camry. so we're getting her a new camry. - alright well, let's go buy her car. i'm, it's getting late. -
- can you clean this up? - are you for real right now? - yeah. - so funny. she have my job title now? does she get my pay? - hey she got one before me too, so. - that's messed up. - for me. - jake, can you just
like go touch his nipple and tell him something. - you're not getting a car. - rejected. - alright, we can stop the joke. yes of course tyler, we're
gonna go buy you a new car. - thank you. - but wait a minute, we gotta do something with this car. - yeah, we're gonna blow
up your car with tannerite. is that okay? -
- are you serious? - you're not mad at me
for destroying your car? - no, please do it. can i do it first? - well, what was your car worth? - this? - $500, it was terrible. - and it didn't even work. - no, i couldn't drive it. - i just don't want people
to think i'm an asshole. and the other thing is
that's purely for clickbait. like i don't want you to die. - i am no longer the soccer mom. so happy right now. - viewers, still refer to
him as a soccer mom though in the comment section of every video just like chris is moisture
boy, he is soccer mom. actually let's upgrade you to soccer dad. everyone refer to him as soccer dad. before we take tyler to
buy whatever car he wants, we thought it'd be a good idea to blow up the car we smashed. - two, one, shoot. - alright. time to buy tyler a new car. alright guys, we just got
done destroying his car. obviously you saw the
clip of his reaction. now we're gonna take him to the dealership and he has $10,000 to put
towards whatever car he wants. which,
- shopping! - shopping! just like he said, his old car was $500. so i think that's good for him. right chris? - i don't know. that's, we should probably
should have gave him $250. - so tyler, what car are you getting? - i'm gonna get the 2015 lincoln mkz. - ooh, fancy boy. - i don't know anything about
cars, but it sounds good. - it's very nice. it's better than the soccer dad's car. - oh yeah? - we're still gonna call you soccer dad. - do i get to stop
being called meat lover? - you're moisture boy. - okay, there we go. - moisture boy, soccer dad, mr beast. - 150 k likes, i'll get another spray tan. - what was that? i got that. i got that. - did you really? don't put it in. - ethan, put that in. put that in, a hundred. dude, i did not tell chris to say that. i swear if we get 150,000
likes he's getting a spray tan. - i'll get another one. - the video gets 300,000 likes, we'll all get spray tans, which we can easily get 300,000 likes. wait now i'm switching it
half a million, half a million or no spray tan. so tyler picked out the car he wanted. and ironically, this
is the same dealership where we bought my brother
a car using only $1 bills. - you smashed another one? - we smashed his car. this guy worked at the nissan place that we pranked three weeks ago. and now he works here. - you just can't get enough of us. - that's why i was just messing with him. and he said "a customer", i said, "they're not our customers,
they're pranksters." - you got some slime on your leg. - thanks tyler. - we took his car and we smashed it and filled it with slime. and now we're buying him new one. - hey, that's the best deal that you can ever get right there. - you should tell them to subscribe, so they never miss one - subscribe, so you never miss mr. beast. he's a-ok with me. - yeah, thank you. [jimmy] so they gave tyler
a $500 discount on his car. so shout out, shout out to tony. this is his store right here. i said i'd put the sign in the video if he gave him a little bit of money off. so this is their sign. - go see it. - yeah, go visit the sign. okay, touchscreen control. alright we get it, you're cool. - i know. max a/c. now they can't hear us. we can say anything. - my viewers suck. aw man, i didn't mean it guys. maybe it's just 'cause like
he said, i could say anything. so now it's time for our interview. tyler, how many wheels does the car have? - four. - is that how many you wanted? - four is what i wanted. - think we did a good job. - that's everything a car needs really. that's everything a car really needs. - you just said that. now you might be wondering where the money for
this new car came from, and the answer is shopmrbeast.com. home of the funniest
shirts on the internet. every shirt we sell on
shopmrbeats.com is hilarious. and the money made off
the shirts allows me to do nice things like this,
