going to know that we recorded two episodes back tob back because i changed hoodies and i'm not going to put this into youtube i'm going to edit it right here here d4 london f5 okay london solid stonewall set up by black nice nice okay bishops are having a staring contest that's actually probably a top computer move but i never i never play that move i don't like that move but i guess it's fine yeah now now i would change the plant a c4 knight c3 but white does knight d2 yeah you're not really supposed to play knight d2 unless this survives knight d2 only makes sense with the stone wall with the structure intact now you should play for c4 knight c3 so you can actually put some meaningful pressure on the position okay knight d2 a3 yeah your position is yeah see if you're going to play c4 the knight belongs on c3 okay takes takes now knight b3 and go after this or play the top computer move cuz i don't understand anything about chess this is crazy white is playing better moves than i would play what wow queen h oh my god yeah there's a mate here this is this is like the boomerang you go in you get the move taken and then you come back queen g6 gg mate if takes h file is open you come back that's very tough to see very very tough to see all right rook d1 misses it okay now oh that's really bad oh all the advantage is gone now oh no whoa what just happened all the advantage is gone everything is gone what you had to go for the kill there uh-oh oh something's wrong here uh-oh oh here comes the attack roaring in yeah queen h6 is mate and bishop g7 and rook c8 bishop g7 rook c8 wow wow the second wave of attack delivered and black resigns because rook g7 rook c8 infiltrates along the back rank and wow move away from getting mated yourself probably what the that was a crazy game that was like what that was super high level super high level wow very very very well played game okay i wouldn't have taken here but i guess white saw nothing better okay here's my guess 2100 or or 1,200 for the first time because i really don't know i actually don't know like this could either be a super master level game or trash like they just super super like lucky i don't think this is played by like a 1600 i i just i just don't get that vibe i think white played either accidentally genius or white is just straight up like 2,300 like i i i but but i can't i i can't i can't decide i want to say like yeah yeah i'm going to say like 2100 so let's see i would wow this person submitted i think once before i said 2100 yeah 22 22 vers 23 wow yeah they were even better than i thought nice good start good start and people are now submitting to guest the elo by like i'm pretty sure like i i can't even see your usernames anymore when you submit because discord just made it super easy to like hide all that or like i had like streamer mode on so i used to track like who submitted before but i mean i don't i don't i don't really mind if somebody submits multiple times it's it's kind of fun that that was a very very well played game 21 i i thought black played i thought the reason it was 21 i thought black played a bit carelessly but white played quite well yeah p mat which means beer in hand made in board made on board okay e4 d6 knight f3 knight f6 f okay okay i don't know how to say anything else i i can only speak russian and spanish i can't speak anything else takes okay trade the queens nice what the f okay i'm just going to guess like 700 i don't king d1 what all i know because i i i like watching mma and there's a lot of mexican fighters they always end their interviews with we go which is always very fun i enjoy when they yell i mean not playing rook takes d1 here is like criminal so white had a hanging bishop and proceeded to play this move which not only attacks the knight and propels it into the capture of the bishop it also blunders the pawn which proceeds to create two threats one of which is an attack on the knight and this which is which is really something that is that is really special so that is that is good wow that is impressive now that did not happen instead the bishop was simply captured bishop there okay nice nice bishop d5 okay wow losing to a trip fork okay so this seems like one of the games that was submitted because the gotham sub just played really well sometimes they do that they play really well by the way it is better to take the knight than to take the rook for the bishop why do you play so bad today not my game dude thought this was my game oh my oh my wow uh wow dude said wow what okay i mean black did not make a black played straight up a perfect game of chess so if these two are the same level then like 1100 but i don't think these two are the same level i think this is like a person that played a streamer cuz you know sometimes people do that they submit games that are really big mismatches if they're the same level then i think that it's like 1,000 to 1100 because i think black just played way too well i say like a thousand but i i i think yeah really weird really really weird very weird very weird i i have no idea let's see so i said if they were the same rating then then black then they would be 1100 it's 9003 versus 1380 so it's a huge mismatch but i mean black also did play very well but yeah i mean i think probably black performed at like 2,000 i mean seriously black did not make like a single inaccuracy that was crazy the winner of the game is the player who makes the next to last mistake what if the guy makes like 80 mistakes ah i said 2000 and it gave him 1950 damn me and yes guys yes if a person won a nice game it means they cheated yes thank you chat very good so you actually that's okay if you click no problem no problem if you pretend to want a game review will you make it into the youtube video probably probably guys why are some of you like fighting each other in the comments you realize like the comments end up on youtube your argument with a random chat member is going to be it's like if you got into a fight with somebody at your local bus stop you know in your town and then it made it to youtube like it's embarrassing just behave just watch the show you know i the secondhand embarrass would kill me i could never even before i had a career in in social media like i would never i could never in a million years get into like a fight with somebody like in i'd be so embarrassed i'd be like oh my god ew just want to behave myself you know come on guys go go go argue in a discord server somewhere oh my god sometimes i'm looking trying to like go through guo you guys don't talk to me man you say it to my face man sh damn all right anyway d4 d5 angland i mean albin counter gambit albin gambit nice oh b be4 crazy dude straight up straight up doesn't know the trap of the album gamut i mean i'm not sure i'm not sure you would have landed it but come on dude crazy oh my god now you can't even play oh god oh oh okay if this game is four digits i'm not doing the rest of the episode okay okay if this game four digits that the next two games are not happening the pawn on d4 is just hanging it's just a free pawn when you play a gambit you have to justify the position you have to play bishop b4 so this dude watched the video how many of you guys have done that you watch a youtube short and you guys are just like like oh i watched the gotham albin counter game at youtube you watch the video that's like here's the way you talk to a girl we'll start with d4 d5 you know you guys have seen enough my content this is how you talk to a girl we'll start with d4 d5 c4 e5 this is the albin counter game and now d e d4 you know and after e3 play bishop you just forget and then you oh i disconnected the camera that's very funny the camera is officially disconnected hilarious there we go that was the camera the camera got excited all right terrible oh my goodness what a move he's going to take the bishop he's gonna take the bishop but now b takes c5 takes what it's a crazy game oh my god knight b5 nasty but then you lose the pawn apocalyptic takes bishop takes oh my oh my oh fork still forked still forked still forked bro he still forked no y'all trolling stop it somebody make a move bro thank god oh my god still forked oh f3 this this game feels like a troll game this straight it feels like two people who are just like what why did you abandon your pawns dude definitely what what draw it's winning i mean white has more pawns it's got to be winning i don't know how but it's not my job to figure it out i go i got to think how it's winning maybe it's not winning i mean it was winning before but wow maybe it's not winning but there was like there was negative opening knowledge i mean oh my goodness negative disgusting discusting oh i hate this what about the but then you know then this this okay luck or skill luck or skill was this lucky i it looks like skill to me i want to amend what i said previously this might actually be wow avoiding the doubling still not taking crazy wow walking the king up what was the thought process here was it like this was that but you completely lose like you completely lose the race i mean even if you play you push your most advanced pawn it you just lose the race by far so aside from this random move 14 1300 133 to 1400 maybe 13 14 i i think i think probably like like 1300 i would say i'm going to say 1300 pre moove that was the only mistake really i want to say 1300 there's no way it's 700 stop no way 1380 versus 1440 get absolutely clowned 7 that's why i do the guest to elo and that's why you watch it oh my goodness oh my goodness now how much time was left when that move happened yeah roka not taking is is banette what's up roka i mean that is dude thought for a minute dude thought for a minute on this move boss next time somebody offers you two pawns and a pawn game like you just got you just got to take him like there's a really really really good chance really good chance that it's winning but because the the tough thing here is to not go after the pawn the tough thing is like eat eat and then boing and bing and you win wow yeah i don't even have to do the game review for that one that was yeah i mean the opening was awful but i thought that they played way too controlled in the middle game i think that like the middle game show like de was was crazy no no no i i amended it i amended my guess i said in the middle that you know i i from the opening i thought they were really really low rated but then it got better so how do i feel about hikaru having four times the amount of viewers as me right now you haven't written a message in 10 months and 10 months ago you wrote when are you becoming a gm and six mon months prior to that was your previous message boss i can't help but feel like you try to come here to say negative things to me now we're going to pause the guest the elo for a minute or two youtube is going to going to be here for this as well i would like you to tell me why you come here every 6 to 10 months just to try to get under my skin please proceed that's what twitch is for that's what he said he said twitch is for that not just twitch you must be on kick because you are watching hikaro there as well how do i feel about it don't feel bad at all you want my honest answer i don't i barely stream i stream like three four times a month you know why i stream to play title tuesday and record guest the elo you know why i don't stream number one dealing with folks like you number two and on a more serious note it's not worth the hours for me to put in so youtube you getting a little glimp you know i i like making youtube videos because i can make a nice fun piece of content and package it well you know so i don't mind if hearo has four times as many viewers you know what i'm happy i'm happy people are still watching chess so and i think the stream just crashed for like the fourth time today so youtube heard that beautiful story of mine and now the stream crashed tough wow all right well i guess we're going to have to finish this guest the ela recording d4 f5 dutch defense c4 knight f6 youtube if twitch never comes back it's just going to be us and we're going to power through that's what that's what's going to happen here we go knight f6 knight c3 g6 dutch defense len and grab b variation pawn to f3 white is trying to play pawn to e4 it's not a very good move but it's also not the dumbest move in the world i i think i actually covered this in the dutch course so d6 e4 bishop g7 yep and now now white has a lot of issues kind of trying to defend the position a3 e5 okay yep bring the knight back nice castles now what i would play is h6 and i would stop these pieces from getting any activity here and then i would create an attack on this side of the board that's what i would do but white is going to try to expand over here if white makes progress on that side okay nice knight f4 okay h6 kick out the bishop nice both are good actually ef and rook takes both look really good rook takes is nice and this attack is nice good play here nice nice put the knight behind the pawn that's what we like that's what we like we like that we like that a lot we like that a lot play g4 more often than not going backwards is not the right answer i think the stream is like dead or something but it's fine rook f oh my goodness g4 g why did we have to put the knight there why did why now we play g4 now we're going to play queen no que g5 que g5 h5 boom nice bishop h6 here queen g5 g3 h4 all this all this stuff c6 queen g5 maybe queen g5 nice knight h3 check is a massive threat we don't want to take and unclog the toilet i mean you do want to unclog a toilet but oh the attack is there knight b5 oh rook f7 you got to go rook f7 you got to play defense rook f7 no no no no no no no no no no no no no oh my god do you know do you know that oh my goodness this is so wild this is so wild going to remove the chat because they're just complaining about but we're recording this for youtube too so youtube you guys are going to enjoy and twitch is just going to have this collapsing [laughter] stream this is very funny i'm having a blast i don't know why this has been happening but it's life yeah now black here loses the i i don't know why black did that there there was absolutely no need for this the idea was knight takes c7 and yeah i mean that's that that that's it's still going to happen and you have not what queen a2 is ridiculous oh my that is that is wild that is he did not play queen tak d6 he found queen a2 that is a crazy move and what rook down there's nothing there's not there's no even queen d3 here is brutal okay this pawn is just oh my go the idea is that the knight cannot protect the king rook takes e1 sacrificing the rook in order to play queen takes c6 the pawn which is supposed to be an asset for white that's twoo squares away from queening but instead you lose it and you get mate on the next move one two and three pieces can stop the check but none of them can stop the mate wow wow and that is why you got to just push things to your opponent's king you never know you got to win the squares near the opponent's king that is one of the only ways to make a comeback in chess and in this case that's what happened that wow wow crazy rook e one what white should have done instead is got the knight out got to get the knight out go to e7 go to g8 and then if this i mean it's still tricky like look knight e7 i mean you know you're attacking the queen but gotta be really careful rook f7 was a mouse slip it was a mouse slip i don't i don't know how you could possibly mouse slip this move it just seems like a blunder but you know maybe king h8 there's still knight c7 yeah it was a tough game i mean white finding queen a2 is like minimum 1,600 let's see and then yeah i mean that's that's crazy okay f3 this game has a3 is weird a3 is a weird that's a weird move it's not 1500 there's no way it's 1500 you guys don't even understand what 1500 chest looks like now rook f8 is a crazy move i feel like most players here just play g4 ah crack my neck you lose you're definitely not 2,000 i don't think a 2,000 plays rook f8 i think a 2,000 just goes here so i'm getting like 17'00 level vibes from this that's what i would say so i'm gna get i think it was very controlled game then you lost material then you found a beautiful tactic so i'm going to say like close to'00'50 versus 1900 there you go there you go i mean you know i thought it wasn't 2,000 but i said'00 it was, 1900 all right no problem one dude was 1,800 i i said it wasn't 2000 you you definitely lost some points for playing rook f8 you want to get to 2000 plus you got to play you just got to go i mean you can't be playing like there's no reason to go rook f8 the knight is just supporting the attack you don't actually know what you want there yet cuz this guy pressuring stuff very nice game i mean that was a that was a nice game of chess that was a high level game it's a high level episode all right what did chess.com think let's see bing binging binging binging binging binging bing binging binging i i think it's going to criticize them wow criticize white but black played like a 199 black play like a very coordinated game and then hung a rook and then checkm it i feel like 1500 is not nice yeah the brilliant move is rook takes e1 it's the sacrifice of the rook very nice clearing out that and the reason this works and it's winning even if they don't take is there's no checks that is always the reason any of you have tactics masterclass any of you bought the tactics masterclass course on chesley what is like the number one thing that i say in that course constantly a tactic works because there is no check that's why like rookie one worked in this game because there was no response by by white you if you couldn't take the rook there was nothing that you could there was nothing that could be done nothing so all right there was nothing that could be done nice oh and queen f5 fails because you just take the queen thank you thank you yes casually carrying wired yes i was in another wired video i will going to be in a fourth wired video and that's coming out in december and then i'm going to be in a fifth wired video which is also coming out in december so i'm going to be has any other person been in five wired videos or am i in like a am i literally alone at the top so i don't know don't know the cameraman oh i'm not laughing you bought my book and it's addicting that's that's good to hear better there's worse things to be addicted to all right e4 let's go scotch bang bang bang bang a mainline scotch hangs pawn hangs pawn pawn's hanging it's just hanging why did nobody take the pawn what nobody why did nobody they could have just free pawn on e4 okay the the line here goes e5 to knight d5 c4 zin then white can play h4 b3 knight d2 there's a lot of different lines here okay bishop f4 pogy pogy pogy froggy okay okay oh nice move nice move utilizing the opening of oh free pawn pawn takes nice i would i would have went bishop f4 but king b1 is fine best move actually bishop c4 bishop d4 bishop c4 bishop d3 get the light squ bishop out fine get the light squ bish ah what what what's he doing why would you open up the rook for the what the queen h5 oh oh come on hit him bishop c4 get more p why are you trading bishop h oh my god bishop h what w you want to checkmate the guy you're trading your most powerful piece oh my god oh my god what what don't hang the [applause] roof the rook is just hing why would you what oh my oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god now black is just winning just give a check stop giving checks stop giving checks stop giving checks oh my god oh my this is oh my stop giving checks stop giving checks stop giving checks stop giving checks very lucky this doesn't win a night because of g5 check oh my goodness oh oh my goodness now you lost your pawns well done and you're still giving checks still giving oh my god he gave a check too good lord that's why i used to yell at my students stop giving checks in the end game and you lost that's it unbelievable unbelievable oh my that's it yep and state i don't know bro i don't 700 i don't se 680 to 730 that's the range 680 to 730 129 4 versus 12 is this the same game now we're done done
