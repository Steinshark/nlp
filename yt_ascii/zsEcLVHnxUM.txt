[music] sup guys and phd here so we're approaching the end of the year but it's still tech tober and one of my favorite phones of this year 2019 was the oneplus 7 pro so i guess oneplus felt the need to update their lineup right for the holiday season so they did and our newest phone is this the oneplus 7t pro now a lot of you guys have been asking me how i feel about this phone it might be the smallest incremental update from phone to phone that i've ever seen so if i put these phones right next to each other you might not know which one is which on the left is the 1 + 7 pro and on the right is a 1 plus 70 pro but if you couldn't tell just by that glance allow me to show you all of the differences so on the back we have a slightly new color it's still blue but instead of nebula blue it's what they call haze blue you know it's a little bit lighter honestly i like it a little bit less it's a bit fingerprint tea and it's also less matte but hey at least now you know which one is which this is haze blue and you can see the oneplus 70 pro has a laser autofocus cut out next to the camera module which looks like an addition but that may just be a bit of a psychological trick because the 7 pro already had a laser autofocus module built into the camera module in between the cameras there so this isn't a new sensor or anything they just moved it to the outside of the module and now it looks like a new one anyway then on the inside you're looking at snapdragon 855 + + 8 gigabytes of ram and 256 as the only speck so there's no 12 gig option in the regular one + 70 pro anymore but the new processor is a little bump and then the battery situation technically also got an upgrade you're now looking at a very slightly larger 4000 85 milliamp hour battery and that's coming from the four thousand milliamp hour battery we already had in the oneplus 7 pro do we even count that as an upgrade technically yeah i mean it's not smaller so i guess we should be happy about that but yeah slightly just very slightly larger sure the real upgrade here is the slightly faster warp charge 30 t and package that's the same size so the charger comes in the box it supports 23% faster charging because of the new battery tech it's already an extremely fast charger i do appreciate that cameras i i'd say same triple cameras i believe the exact same three sensors but with the added macro mode which is a hardware adjustment they added a little motor to the main camera that lets you get super super close for minimum focus distance in a macro mode same thing we saw on the 70 it's pretty cool lets you get super close to subjects if you're into macro photography on your phone and that's it that's all that's new for the 70 pro the rest in case you forgot is basically the same as they already excellent 7 pro same 6 point 6 7 inch 1440p 90 hertz oled notch list display one my favorites of the year same pop up camera mechanism to achieve that nautilus design same super fast ufs 3.0 storage these are all pretty much things i loved about that 1 plus 7 pro the thing i dislike the most was the curved edges on the screen but i'm not shocked that they didn't change that yet i'll hold out hope for next version so there's no all new cameras to bring it up to compete with the pixel there's no 5g version there's no wireless charging there's no major features added to the 7 t pro it's just basically a little bit of a tweak to their already great phone to bring it up to the end of 2019 standards tech moves fast i get it so that's this is the latest and greatest if you already have their latest phone obviously you don't have to upgrade but this is their greatest available option but of course we can't forget to include the mclaren edition that they also introduced next to it so this is the oneplus 70 pro mclaren edition a pretty long name with a bit of a different design for a hundred extra bucks this is going to be your dramatic dark forged carbon fiber looking design and papaya orange accents that mclaren is famous for i think it looks pretty badass but it's also a huge fingerprint magnet with this glossy finish so i kind of wish it was sort of a hybrid of like a frosted glass version of this may be a little more matte to get this this crazy carbon fiber look to through but not attract finger prints but just the way it is it really catches the light a certain way and you can see more and more of the carbon pattern under the glass very cool and i think people who appreciate supercars will really appreciate this one and the mclaren edition is available with 12 gigs of ram so that is the only spec difference if you're looking for a reason for the mclaren edition to be faster which they've done in the past that's the only thing 12 gigs of ram on the mclaren edition eight gigs of ram on the regular phone that's it so they have it you know you guys wanted me to cover it and now we have our hands on it and it's like i said maybe the smallest upgrade i've ever seen in a phone which i guess makes sense with the t version - a phone that came out just eight months ago of course the point is it's a slight upgrade from what was already the fastest phone i've ever used and was one of my favorites so you know a little tweaks here and there just increase the lead a little bit on one of the best smartphone experiences of 2019 for me with this new one the strangest thing about this phone might be their decision not to bring it to north america they're not selling it in the us they're not continuing their push with higher priced phones in this expensive market putting in carrier stores and things like that they chose not to do that with this phone so special thanks to south from super staff tv he is the only reason i got to check out these phones he brought them over here with him so i'm gonna have to give it right back to him big shout-out to super staff i'll have a link to his channel below so i guess i'm not mad you know i already have a 1 + 7 pro it's in the u.s. it's basically the same thing and i can live without the slightly faster charging and the new chip and macro mode i guess i'll live with that but as hope to franco would say i'm gonna pass the question off to you have you ever seen a one to one upgrade this small in smartphones before you don't have to answer that it's probably no i guess basically oneplus wanted to have something available right around october october for the holiday season they got it out you can get it in certain markets if you don't you can get a one plus seven pro that's mainly the gist there you have it i've covered it we're out here tech tober rolls on thanks for watching this one gadget has the next one pace
