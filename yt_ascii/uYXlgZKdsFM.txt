this might be the greatest article ever written i'm i'm already excited about it haven't read it but this is this is for me the five stages of vim a humbling experience okay okay let's hear about him i'll tell you before i even look at before i even look at this i'm just don't even look at it for me it started off with vim motions in idea vim in intellig that was so much fun by like two days into it i already knew i liked it more than anything else by like one week into it i discovered f and f blue my mind f and t oh i was flying then the percent sign i used to do this motion that i do shift v for highlight the whole line f squirely brace percent sign d loved deleting a function that way it was so good it was so so so good all right and then i had to learn about the vimrc and then i felt really really really really really confused all right as i started typing this post in my editor of choice spoiler alert it's neovim got him i can't help but think about where i was just a few months months ago blissfully ignorant and content in what i thought was the only obvious choice vs code this article's just give this this article has excited my jimmies okay hasn't ruffled excited them to me vim was something to check carefully for when copying and pasting commands it had to be delicately replaced with nano what or risk rebooting the server this dude's a th% prime enjoyer probably i had no idea what it was why anyone would use it absolutely this is good stage one ignorance okay vs code is great it had everything i could possibly want dude i was literally this person net beans though or intellig it became intellig but net beans was the original one net beans was the one where it was just like i still remember that i would look at my friend randy his name was literally randy and i was like randy why are you using vim and he's just like f's the best he was like such a dork and i was sitting there thinking me being the cool guy okay i was super cool okay i was like playing basketball being super cool going to bed bed early and i thought man only dorks use vim i had no idea what was about to happen in my life okay i had no idea if i'd clare voyance i'd be laughing at myself then but man i thought vim was stupid and if i didn't there was an extension for it i was fami familiar with the shortcuts and the interface i could run and debug my code with a single click my configuration was carefully curated i had a theme that i liked i had a few extensions that i couldn't live without i was happy i was productive i was ignorant okay you knew he you knew he was i i hurt my microphone he was cool then vim hit him in the knee then i got vimed right in the knee and then i went from hanging out with babes to learning vim motion okay stage two curiosity pre-at pre-read i started watching videos from the creator called the prime a charismatic and entertaining netflix engineer who is clearly passionate about the topic i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't disagree with that statement about being charismatic kind of funny kind of funny quoted that one watching it mov so gracefully through a file i couldn't help but wonder if i was missing out on something i was happy i was productive i was curious literally this exact same like i can see myself in this person's shoes by the way anders backin netflix engineer walked over to his desk and i went hey could you show me why these two versions of the tv application are behaving differently and he's just like oh yeah yeah yeah jumped in his emac it was emac okay didn't even type properly types like this cuz he uses emac because i mean i don't know how else you type without with emac is all weird looking and he just gets on there and just just starts moving and things are flying he's moving so fast i'm over there in intellig with my vim plugin thinking i'm swift and i have never seen somebody move like this and i thought i have done everything wrong hands down that was like that day it dawned on me that i was so wrong about my development and that was like what 2015 2016 somewhere right in there and i just thought enough with these vim motions it's time vim it is i went deep i decided to give it a try i installed neo and opened up a file now i'd seen enough videos to know that i needed to start with vim tutor so i did this is awful how could you possibly be productive you're telling me that instead of clicking where i need to go i should spam hj k and l until i get there and what's with all these weird commands right quit quit bang quit all this is ridiculous i quit this cycle repeated itself a few times some something would spark my curiosity or inspiration and i jump head first into vim get frustrated go back to vs code i was happy i was productive i was in denial wrong it's like one of my favorite memes of all time whenever i get a chance to use this one i will use this one when possible stage four embracing the suck i'm not sure why i made that sound it just felt right in the moment but afterwards it didn't make any sense sense so we're just going to move on from that situation that just just happened i sucked the zuck okay i zuck sucked right there okay that's all that was robin robin vibes i gave some heavy robin vibes okay life doesn't make sense sometimes you just got to go for it okay i decided to give it one more try i was going to stick with it no matter how much it sucked i was going to learn vim i wasn't going to give up this is always easier said than done really sucking at something is hard it's frustrating it's humbling it's uncomfortable but it's also the only way to get better growing up i was pretty good at most things i tried sports school music generally things would come pretty easily what i noticed now that i'm in the beginnings of adulthood is how big of an impact this has on my adult life if i don't pick something up almost immediately there's a good chance i'm not going to try it again this is an incredibly insightful observation right here by the way this is like this is really good i've seen this a lot of times this is something like even rockstar the one that we all laughed at earlier really sweet endearing very nice gentle rockstar that we all laughed at together collectively he talked about the exact same thing this has led me to miss opportunities unfinished projects and a lot of wasted time i've slowly started to realize that the things that are worth doing are the things that are hard the things that are worth doing are the things that you suck at by this time i was going to stick with it i was going to embrace the suck i was going to learn vim and i wasn't going to give up i was unhappy i was unproductive i was learning i like it i like it stage five enlightenment i'm not going to lie i'm still not great at vin but i was learning new things every day but i'm getting better i'm getting faster i'm getting more productive i wrote my own configuration from scratch nice job use kickstart by the way for those that don't know literally just go to kick kickstarter or neovim kickstart use this it's a great place to start they don't have harpoon because they're ignorant and i feel like i'm going to throw chop them but everything else about this is fantastic okay absolutely check this out 100% of the time best place to start right here absolutely best place to start every time i have a theme that i like there are several plugin that i now can't live without there are things i have learned throughout this process that i would never feasibly come across if i'd stuck with vss code i have a greater appreciation for open source and all the hard work that goes into maintaining the software that powers the world most importantly i'm thankful to myself for sucking at something long enough to see the results i am happy i am productive i am grateful you got to suck long enough to see the results i know that phrase doesn't work with twitch chat i know that's just not a phrase twitch chat's going to going to accept but it's true if you're not willing to suck long enough you will not see results i loved this article by the way i loved it this was so good this was so good people love this okay love this article it's fantastic thank you very much do we got like a hey hey scott scott mckendry where's your like little where's your like little twitter links okay i don't even see like a
