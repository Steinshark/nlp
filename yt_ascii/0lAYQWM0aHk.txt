you were the chief scientist of hanson robotics you're still involved with hanson robotics doing a lot of really interesting stuff there this is for people who don't know the company that created sophia the robot can you tell me who sophia is i'd rather start by telling you who david hanson is david is the brilliant mind behind this sophia roba and he remains so far he remains more interesting than his creation although although she may be improving faster than he yeah so yeah i make a point i met david maybe 2007 or something at some futurist conference we were both speaking it and i could see we had a great great deal in common i mean we were both kind of crazy but we also we both had a passion for agi and and the singularity and we're both huge fans of the work of the science fiction writer and i wanted to create benevolent agi that would you know create massively better life for all humans and all sentient beings including animals plants and superhuman beings and david he wanted exactly the same thing but he had a different idea of how to do it he wanted to get computational compassion like he wanted to get machines that that would would love people and empathize with people and he thought the way to do that was to make a machine that could know look people either eye face to face look at look at people and make people love the machine and the machine loves the people back so i thought that was a very different way of looking at it because i'm very math oriented you know i'm just thinking like what is the abstract cognitive algorithm that will let this system you know internalize the complex patterns of human values blah blah blah whereas he's like look you in the face in the eye and love you so i we hit it off quite well and we talked to each other off and on then i moved to hong kong in 20 2011 so i've been i mean i've been i've been living all over the place i've been in australia and new zealand and my academic career then in the las vegas for a while within new york in the late 90s starting my my entrepreneurial career within dc for nine years doing a bunch of us government consulting stuff then moved to hong kong in 2011 mostly because i met a chinese girl who i fell in love with him we got married she's actually not from hong kong he's from him lunch on but we converged together in hong kong so married now have a have a two-year-old babyhood i went to hong kong to see about a girl i guess yeah pretty pretty pretty much yeah and on the other hand i started doing some cool research there with gino you at hong kong polytechnic university i got involved with a project called idea using machine learning for stock and futures prediction which was quite interesting and i also got to know something about the consumer electronics and hardware manufacturer ecosystem in shenzhen across the border which is like the only place in the world that makes sense to make complex consumer electronics at large scale in low costs it's just it's astounding the hardware ecosystem the oven in in south china like you u.s. key people here cannot imagine with it with it with it's like so david was starting to explore that also i invited him to hong kong to give a talk at hong kong paulo you and i introduced him in hong kong just some investors who were interested in his robots and he didn't have sofia then he had a robot of philip k dick our favorite science fiction writer he had a robot einstein he had some little toy robots that looked like his his son zeno so through the investors i connected him to he managed to get some funding to basically port hanson robotics to hong kong and when he first moved to hong kong i was working on a gi research and also on this machine learning trading project so i didn't get that tightly involved with with hanson robotics but as as i hung out with david more and more as we were both there in the same place i started to get i start to think about what you could do to make his robots smarter than they were and so we started working together and for a few years i was chief scientist and head of software at that hanson robotics then when i got deeply into the blockchain side of things i stepped back from that and co-founded and singularity net david henson was also one of the cofounders of singularity in that so part of our goal there had been to make the blockchain based like cloud 9 platform for sofia and the other other ever her sofia will be just one of the robots in this in a singularity net yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly sofia many copies of the sofia robot would would would be you know among the user interfaces to the globally distributed the singularity net cloud mind and i mean david and i talked about that for quite a while before co-founding singularity by the way in his in his vision and your vision was was sofia tightly coupled to a particular ai system or was the idea that you can plug oh he's just so keep plugging in different systems but then not everyone david's david's if you was always that sofia would be a platform much like say the pepper robot is a platform from softbank should be a platform with a set of nicely designed api's that anyone can use to experiment with their different ai algorithms on that platform and singularity net of course fits right into that right because singular unit it's an api marketplace so anyone can put their ai on their opencog is a little bit different i mean david likes it but i'd say it's my thing it's not his like david has a little more passion for biologically based approaches to ai than i do which which makes sense i mean he's really into human physiology and bal jesus character sculptor right yeah so yeah he's interested in but he also worked a lot with rule-based and logic based ai systems too so yeah he's interested in not just sofia but albin hansson robots as a powerful social and emotional robotics platform and you know what i saw in sofia was a way to you know get ai algorithms out there in front of a whole lot of different people in an emotionally compelling way and part of my thought was really kind of abstract connected to agi ethics and you know many people are concerned agi is gonna enslave everybody or turn everybody into into computronium to make extra hard drives further their cognitive engine or whatever and you know emotionally i'm not driven to that sort of paranoia i'm really just an optimist by nature but intellectually i have to assign the nonzero probability to those sorts of nasty outcomes because if you're making something 10 times as smart as you how can you know what it's gonna do there's an irreducible answer uncertainty there just as my dog can't predict what i'm gonna do tomorrow so it seemed to me that based on our current state of knowledge the best way to bias the ag is we create toward benevolence would be to infuse them with love and compassion the way the way that we do our own children so you want to interact with ai's in the context of doing compassionate loving and beneficial things and in that way as your children will learn by doing compassionate beneficial loving things along side you and that way the ai will learn in practice what it means to be compassionate beneficial and loving it will get a sort of ingrained intuitive sense of this which you can then abstract in the in its own way as it gets more and more intelligent now david saw this the same way that's why he came up with the name sophia which means which means wisdom so it seemed to me making these like beautiful loving robots to be rolled out for beneficial applications would be the perfect way to roll out early-stage agi systems so they can learn from people and not just learn fact from the homes but learn human human values and ethics from people while being their you know their home service robots their education assistants their nursing robots so that that was the grand vision know if you've ever worked with robots the reality is is quite different right like the first principle is the robot is always broken working i mean i work with robots in the 90s a bunch and you had to solder them together yourself and i put neuron that's doing reinforcement learning on like overturned solid ball type robots and in the 90s when i was a professor things of course advanced a lot but but the principal stole the robots always broken stole yeah yes so faced with the reality of making sophia do stuff many of my robo agi aspirations were temporarily cast aside and and i mean there's just a practical problem of making this robot interact in the meaningful way cuz like you know you put nice computer vision on there but there's always glare and then the or it you have a dialog system but at the time i was there like no speech-to-text algorithm could deal with hong kong hong hong kong ease people's english accents yeah so the the speech detect was always bad so the robot always sounded stupid yeah because it wasn't getting the right text right so i started to view that really as what what in software engineering you call a walking skeleton which is maybe the wrong metaphor to use for sophia or maybe the right one but i mean with a walking skeleton is and software development is if you're building a complex system how do you get started but one way is to first build part one well then build part - well then build part three well and so on another way if you make like a simple version of the whole system and put something in the place of every part the whole system will need so that you have a whole system that does something and then you work on improving each part in the context of that whole integrated system so that's what we did on the software level in sophia we made like a walking sky software system were so there's something that sees there's something that hears there's something that moves there's something that there's something that remembers there's something that learns you put a simple version of each thing in there and you connect them all together so that the system will do its thing so there's there's a lot of ai am there there's not any agi in there i mean there's computer vision to recognize people's faces recognize when someone comes in the room and leaves trying to recognize whether two people are together or not i mean the dialog system it's a mix of like hand-coded rules with deep neural nets that come out with with whether with their own responses and there's some attempt to have a narrative structure and sort of try to pull the conversation into something with a beginning beginning middle and end in this sort of story arc so it's i mean like if you look at the lubna prize and the systems that beat the turing test currently they're heavily rule-based because like you had said narrative structure to create compelling conversations you currently neural networks cannot do that well even what google mena when you actually look at full-scale conversations issues yeah this is the thing so we've been i've actually been running an experiment the last couple weeks taking sophia's chatbot and then the facebook's transformer chat bot which they open the model we've had them chatting to each other for a number of weeks on the server just that's funny we're generating training data of what sophia says in a wide variety of conversations but we can see compared to sophia's current chat bot the facebook deep neural chat bot comes up with a wider variety of fluent sounding sentences on the other hand it rambles like mad this sophia chat bot it's a little more repetitive in in the sentence structures it uses on the other hand it's able to keep like a conversation arc over a much longer longer period right so they're know you can probably surmount that using reformer and like eat using various other deep neural architectures and to improve the way these transform are trained but in the end neither one of them really understands what's going on and i mean that's the challenge i had with sophia is if i were doing a robotics project aimed at agi i would make like a robo toddler that was just learning about what it was seeing because then the language is grounded in the experience of the robot but what sophia needs to do to be sophia is talk about sports or the weather or robotics or the conference she's talking at but yeah she needs to be fluent talking about any damn thing in the world and she doesn't have grounding for all for all those all those things so there's there's this just like i mean google mena and facebook's chat but i don't have grounding for what they're talking about about either so in a way the need to speak fluently about things where there's no non linguistic grounding pushes what you can do for sophia in the short term a bit a bit away from from asia i mean pushes you towards i'd be in watson situation where you basically have to heuristic and hardcore stuff a rule-based though i have to ask you about this okay so because you know in in part sophia as i can is an art creation because it's beautiful it's she's beautiful because she inspires through our human nature of anthropomorphize things we immediately see an intelligent being there because david is a great sculptor is this gary salter that's right so in fact if sophia just had nothing inside her head said nothing if she just sat there we already prescribed some intelligence - it's a long selfie line in front of her after every time that's right so it captivated the imagination of the of many people i was gonna say the world but yeah i mean a lot of people and billions of people which is amazing it's amazing right now of course many people prescribed much great prescribe essentially gi type of capabilities to sophia when they see here and of course friendly french folk like yamla kun immediately see that of the people from the ag community and get really frustrated because understandable so what and then they criticize people like you who sit back and don't say anything about like basically allow the imagination of the world allow the world to continue being captivated so what what's your what's your sense of that kind of annoyance that the ai community has i think there's several parts to my reaction there first of all if i weren't involved with hanson robots and didn't know david hanson personally i probably would have been very annoyed initially at sophia as well i mean i can understand the reaction i would have been like wait all these stupid people out there think this is an agi yeah but it's not an agi but they're tricking people that this very cool robot is an agi and now those of us you know trying to raise funding to build agi you know people will think it's already there already works right so i yeah on the other hand i think even if i weren't directly involved with it once i dug a little deeper into david and the robot and the intentions behind it i think i would have stopped being being pissed off worse folks like young mccune have remained pissed off after their after their after their initial well he and they're in this thing that's this thing yeah i think that in particular struck me as somewhat ironic because young mccune is working for facebook which is using machine learning to program the brains of the people in the world toward vapid consumerism and political extremism so if if your ethics allows you to use machine learning in such a blatantly destructive way why would your ethics not allow you to use machine learning to make a lovable theatrical robot that draws some foolish people into its theatrical illusion like if if if the if the pushback had come from yoshua bengio i would have felt much more humbled by it because he's he's not using ai for blatant evil right on the other hand he also is a super nice guy and doesn't bother to go out there trashing other other people's work for no good reason shots fired but i'm gonna answer for sure i think we'll go back and forth i'll talk to you on again i would add on this though i mean david hanson is an artist and he often speaks off-the-cuff and i have not agreed with everything that david has said or done regarding sofia and david also was not agree with everything david has said i don't know about about foreign point i mean david david is an artistic wild men and that's that's that's part of his charm that that's that's part of his genius so certainly there have been conversations with enhancing robotics in between me and david where i was like let's let's be more open about how this thing is working and i did have some influence in nudging henson robotics to be more open about about how sofia was working and and david wasn't especially opposed to this and you know he was actually quite right about it what he said was you can tell people exactly how it's working and they won't care they want to be drawn into the illusion and he was 100% 100% correct i'll tell you what yeah this wasn't sofia this was philip k dick but we did some interactions between humans and philip k dick robot in austin texas a few years back and in this case the folk connect was just tell about another human in the other room so during the conversations we didn't tell people the robot was teller operated we just said here have a conversation with phil dick we're gonna film you right and they had a great conversation with phil kaduk tell operated by my friend stefano guy after the conversation we brought the people in the back room to see stefan who was controlling the the philip k dick robot but they didn't believe it these people were like well yeah but i know i was talking to phil like yeah maybe stefan was typing but the spirit of phil was animating his mind while he was typing yeah so like even though they knew was a human in the loop even seeing the guy there they still believe that was phil they were talking to her a small part of me believes that they were right actually because our understand well we don't understand the universe i mean there is a cosmic mind field that we're all embedded in that yields many strange synchronicities in the world which is a topic we don't have time to go into too much i mean there's there's some nature there's something to this where our imagination about sophia and people yet young laocoon being frustrated about it is all part of this beautiful dance of creating artificial intelligence that's almost essential you see with boston dynamics i'm a huge fan of as well you know the kind of i mean these robots are very far from intelligent i played with their last was a spot meeting yeah very cool yeah it reacts quite in the fluid and flexible way but we immediately ascribe the kind of intelligence we media describe a gi to them yeah yeah if you kick it and it falls down and goes out you feel bad right you'll get help and i mean that's that's that's part of that's gonna be part of our journey in creating intelligent systems more and more and more and more like as sofia starts out with a walking skeleton is you add more and more intelligence i mean we're gonna have to deal with this kind of idea lutely enough about sofia i would say i mean first of all i have nothing against young look you know this is fun this is all nice guys if you if he wants to play the media media banter game i'm happy to play he's a good researcher and and a good human being he'd happily work with the guy but yeah the other thing i was going to say is i have been explicit about how sofia works and i've posted online and that what eight-plus magazine an online web zine i mean i posted a moderately detailed article explaining like there are three software systems we've used inside sofia there's there's a timeline editor which is like a rule-based authoring system where she's really just being an outlet for where the human scripted there's a chatbot which has some real base and some neural aspects and then sometimes we've used opencog behind sofia where there's more learning learning and reasoning and you know the funny thing is i can't always tell which system is operating there right i mean so once you whether she's really learning yeah we're thinking or just appears to be over half hour i could tell but over like three or four minutes of interaction i got even having three systems that's already sufficiently complex where you can't really tell right away yeah the thing is even if you get up onstage and tell people how sophia is working and then they talk to her they still contribute more agency and consciousness to her then then is is is really there so i think there's there's a couple levels of ethical issue there one issue is should you be transparent about how sophia is working and i think you should and i think i think we we have been i mean i mean it's there's articles online that there's some tv special that goes through me explaining the three sub systems behind sophia so the way sophia works is is out there much more clearly than how facebook's ai works or something right i mean we've been fairly explicit about it the other is given that telling people how it works doesn't cause them to not attribute too much intelligence agency to it anyway and then then should you keep fooling them when they want to be fools and i mean that you know the whole media industry is based on fooling people the way they want to be fooled and we we are fooling people a hundred percent toward a good end i mean i mean we are we are playing on people's sense of empathy and compassion so that we can give them a good user experience with helpful robots yeah and so that we can we can fill the a eyes mind with love and compassion so i've been i've been talking a lot with hanson robotics lately about collaborations in the area of of medical robotics and we we haven't quite pulled the trigger on the project on that domain yet but we may well do so quite soon so we've been we've been talking a lot about you know robots can help with with elder care robots can help with kids david's and a lot of things with with autism therapy and robots robots before in the covin era having a robot that can be a nursing assistant in various senses can be quite valuable the robots don't spread infection and they can also deliver more attention than human nurses can give right so if you have a robot that's helping a patient with kovat if that patient attributes more understanding and compassion and agency to that robot then it really has because it looks like a human i mean is that really bad i mean we can tell them it doesn't fully understand you and and they don't care because they're lying there with a fever and they're sick but they'll react better to that robot with its loving more and facial expression than they would to a pepper robot or a metallic looking looking robot so it's it's really it's about how you use it right if you made a human looking like door-to-door sales robot that used it's it's human looking appearance to to scam people out of their money yeah then you're using that that connection in a bad way but you could also use it in a good way and that but then that's the same the same problem with every technology beautifully put you
