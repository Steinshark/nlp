did you know 96 of people quit online courses 
yes according to the university of pennsylvania   only four percent four percent of people who 
start online courses actually complete them   that number is crazy high and the next question 
is well why is this why do so many of us start   online courses only to not finish them 
today i'm going to be sharing with you   why it is how you can be that four 
percent who actually complete the courses   and why the system is kind of broken before 
we get into it though make sure to hit that   subscribe button for more tech coding career 
videos and okay let's just jump right into it one of the biggest things that people really 
underestimate when they are purchasing courses   is time a lot of times we purchase these courses 
and we think oh you know i'll do an hour a day   for the next x amount of days but there are two 
problems and one the course really sets you up   for failure to begin with a lot of courses 
are between 30 to 50 hours in length and   let's be real if you have a full-time job or 
are in school studying to have time every day to   actually complete those courses is very rare so i 
think one of the biggest things that when you are   purchasing a course or thinking of committing 
to a course is you really need to understand   the amount of time involved in that course do you 
have that amount of time and even if you do have   that time are you going to stick to it one thing 
that really helps me when i'm taking a course   especially a technical course because kind of 
can be dry a lot of the times is breaking it down   breaking down the course by section so a lot 
of times they have this section will take 39   minutes this will take an hour and so on and it 
really helps if i do it by in my google calendar   i will put on every day okay i'm going to do two 
sections today for a total of an hour and a half   and not just commit to doing it but actually 
commit to when i am going to do it because   that's two different things you can say yeah 
i'll spend an hour tomorrow doing it but   when are you doing it are you doing that at 
your lunch are you doing it after work are   you doing it before work these things really 
matter in order to hold yourself accountable   okay another thing i think that is huge 
in setting people up for failure right   out of the gate is we are easily distracted 
and when we go online to purchase a course   you know what i'm talking about there are 
so many to choose from we end up buying   multiple at once or buying a package but in 
turn because there is so much out there to   learn so much exciting things you want to learn 
everything at once you end up learning nothing   and i think one of the biggest takeaways from 
this isn't to not purchase multiple courses or   not have multiple interests but before what i make 
myself do which is really hard actually is before   you purchase a second course before you purchase 
anything else finish the first course and i think   especially in tech i mean really any industry but 
especially in the tech industry it's so easy to be   like you feel like you're falling behind you want 
to learn more and you want to learn it quicker so   you end up thinking i'll take many courses at 
once or i'll take i'll buy multiple courses   courses only to get distracted by the next latest 
and greatest thing in tech and the reality is   that's really setting yourself up for failure 
you really need to focus at one thing at one time   we're not that as humans we're not very good 
at multitasking if we're going to be completely   honest with ourselves so don't try and be this 
hero by learning multiple things at once but   rather focus on completing one course before you 
move on to the next one another reason i think   this is probably one of the biggest things for 
me as far as why many people fail and including   why i fail so often not often i would say but 
i still sometimes fail at completing courses is   if i'm purchasing a course and it doesn't have any 
support whether it be community support someone   to answer my question someone to keep me engaged 
virtually there's no hope and i think courses that   you if you purchase a course and you can see 
that there is no support on any level like   there's no discord channel there's no q a 
portion of it don't even purchase the course   it's not worth your time because you're going to 
get stuck at some point during this course and   if you have no one to ask for help or support 
then how are you going to complete the course   you're going to get stuck and stay that way 
and in turn just not finish it in the end   so so that's a huge thing for me if i'm 
purchasing a course i need to know that   there's going to be some form of support even if 
it's just like i said even discord channel where   you can ask your questions in a group setting 
it really can make or break the course okay we are back home now and i was actually 
just i had my computer here i was just reading   an article a research paper actually on this 
entire topic about why people fail on completing   online courses and i'll link it down below 
but there's something they say in here which   i think is really interesting and important to 
note and they're talking about in here they're   talking about motivational factors motivational 
aspects can cause high attrition rates in online   classes because online courses are heavily 
self-directed and self-learned motivation   or lack thereof can be a deciding factor in how 
focused people are going to be and i completely   agree with this i think this is something that if 
you have no motivation or if you're starting out   motivated but you have nothing to continue that 
motivation or keep you motivated moving forward   you're gonna fall off in the course okay let's 
go outside for a bit so back to the question   where are you going to find this motivation 
you know if motivation is such a big factor and   you're learning on your own maybe you don't 
have a roommate or maybe you don't have   anyone you feel comfortable sharing what you're 
doing with where are you going to find this   motivation this is something i really struggled 
with when i was taking online courses is yes i   would tell my friends and family i was learning 
especially when i was learning how to code i was   taking this tutorial i was learning this course 
but they really they were supportive but they   really just didn't get it and that's expected if 
they're not in technology so then your question   probably is well tiff where did you end up getting 
motivation from to stick with online courses and   for me it was through strangers it was through 
connecting with people online especially through   discord channels or when i was learning code way 
back in the day insert kane here it was not   discord it was slack channels actually going in 
different groups it was a lot of girls who code   or different react developers different kind of 
channels and slack now i would do discord that   really everyone around you is learning as well 
and that was such a great way to stay motivated   being surrounded by people even online that are 
learning as well so i really highly encourage you   if you are going to be taking an online course to 
find external motivating factors to find people   who are taking the course as well taking any 
course but on the subject you are learning as well   because that can really go a long way and it makes 
it become more of this exciting fun thing that   you are learning together you are held accountable 
which is something that is often missing in online   courses because yes the benefit is you are doing 
them at your own time your own pace but it's also   the the enemy because you're learning at your own 
time and your own pace and it's a lot more fun   to watch tv or go hang out with friends than 
it is to stay focused and keep on learning   the last thing i really want to talk to you about 
which kind of ties into motivation is you need to   have a really honest conversation with yourself 
as to why you're taking this course is it because   it's the latest greatest technology you've heard 
about or is it because you want to get a job or   learn a new skill having an understanding 
as to why you're taking the course like a   true understanding rather than just buying a 
course to buy a course will really help you   know what the next step will be will keep you 
motivated because you know okay i bought this   course for the reason of getting a promotion or 
for the reason of simply learning and that will   whatever your reason is will really depict 
how your learning progression is determined   because if you are just learning for fun for 
something new i can almost guarantee that you are   going to have a harder time sticking to a course 
than if it is for a specific purpose so how do you   find that specific purpose well if you are just 
learning because you want a new job that's a huge   purpose but you need to break it down so say to 
yourself once i have done this course i can add   it to my resume i can start networking with people 
who have taken this course as well i can join some   discord channels with others who are taking 
this course like you can build out this whole   vision of what it will look like as you take this 
course and i think that's really important because   you need to have rewards at the end of this 
course and especially if the course doesn't have a   certification associated with it you need to have 
a reason a purpose for taking the course other   than this cool new sexy thing to learn at the end 
of the day though i think it's really important to   highlight that it's not you it's the courses the 
courses oftentimes do not set you up for success   there is often little support aligned with the 
course sometimes they are some of the courses   i want to take are 52 plus hours in length and 
it's ridiculous i'm i know if i purchase it i'm   not going to complete it like it's 52 hours how 
do you have that much time they really do not   set you up for success there are some amazing 
courses out there but the way they are created   the way they are built out are really hard for 
individuals to be successful with those courses   and that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do those 
courses i really want to highlight that i do those   courses all the time with the understanding that 
sometimes i won't complete them other times maybe   i will but the important thing is to realize 
sometimes it's not you it's just the course   and i thought that's really important to highlight 
because i know our community i know the people who   are watching this are really ambitious learners 
people who want to be very successful who are very   successful and i don't want you to be so hard on 
yourself when you are taking a course if you don't   complete it thinking i can't stay committed to 
anything this i'm a failure because i can never   follow through with the course no 
that's not the case a lot of times   it's simply just the course and the way it 
was designed now these tips i'm sharing with   you can help follow through on completing 
the course but it doesn't mean it's an easy   task so make sure to pat yourself on the 
back like truly pat yourself on the back   if you are able to finish a course because 
it's tough out there i'm curious though what   are some of your favorite courses now now we got
