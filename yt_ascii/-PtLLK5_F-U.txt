ladies and gentlemen there is a saying that in life we are only guaranteed a handful of things death taxes although that one might be debatable not in my case but in some of yours and third is magnus carlson winning a chess tournament when he participates fourth might be me wearing hoodies in my videos but sometimes magnus participates in a tournament and the chess gods are not too fond and something completely insane happens and this is one of those days see a couple of days ago the first tournament of the 2024 champions chester completed and magnus carlson had an uncharacteristic conclusion to his event at the hands of the one and only ali resa fua ali resa fua originally born in iran now representing france aliv resa fuja was the chosen one magnus carlson once said he would literally not defend his title against anybody not named perua crazy and sometimes they meet and they put on a show when they play and today i'm going to take you through that show so this was the finale but magnus was in the winner's bracket so magnus had not gotten knocked out which meant ali resa fua had to not only defeat magnus once he had to then reset the final and beat him again and the circumstances under which he did this will blow your mind they will absolutely blow your mind so this was game number one they sit down they're playing against each other and magnus by the way had a reaction that was so epic he like chucked the water bottle i mean i love seeing that that emotion out of the players cuz you know chess players when they play games look like this they look like this and then they look like this and then they look like and that's as much emotion as we get out of a chest player but i love these online rapid and and and blitz events because these guys are like throwing things across the room so game begins we have e4 e5 knight of3 knight c6 we have a spanish and we have a spanish with this move d6 and g6 all right magnus commits to the d3 spanish not a spanish where you're going to play d4 right away and ali resa plays kind of like a king's indian setup putting the bishop on the g7 square it's one of the ways to play this opening and because you're going to support your center in an uncharacteristic way where usually you have a bishop on e7 that actually enables you to play moves like d5 but you don't generally just get to do this with black and the spanish so fua accepts the damaging of his structure because he gets the light squared bishop magnus tries to explode the center we have knight takes on e5 and then we have another trade here on d4 as he was trying to undermine magnus's knight and magnus takes on h6 bishop takes right bishop takes takes b3 not really sure why this game is from black's perspective but regardless queen takes d4 knight takes g6 magna sacrificing a knight early in this game let me just flip that back magna sacrificed the knight to open up ali's king but everything was well protected and even though magnus look at that move look at that move from magnus carlson that's by the way that's just a full rook sacrifice you can't take it though because after queen f6 my rook gets in on the seventh rank and i win just super you know lowkey but yeah fuja just goes for a counterattack and actually has the upper hand by the time the game is nearing its conclusion but i think he didn't want to take any risk and the players just shuffle the pieces and make a drop so that was the first game that they played right remember magnus at this point leads the the head-to-head because magnus is in the winner's final which means that's how double elimination works so we go to a second game right the score is now half to half right fuja plays a london magnus plays a very provocative london and i mean i got to tell you f6 and g5 is some wild stuff i actually have a video where i cover this really ridiculous system that you can play against the london and it's surprisingly resilient and there's another way to play this which is where you you take the center like this and that's very very tough to meet if you don't know what you're doing with the white side now magnus plays g5 and bishop f5 i can't believe this is a real thing it is it's actually one of the more annoying ways to deal with as a london player london players watching this will know we y'all hate this stuff right because the london you play cuz you're lazy boring have no interest in life no just kidding that's the stereotype about the london london you play because you want an easy tolay opening with white which is the greatest opening ever invented but you don't want to deal with this i mean you play the london cuz cuz you don't want all of this stuff and and yeah magnus brings the fight to ali resa but i got to tell you he makes a lot of weak is in his position and ali reza is so good at dynamics so good at making a game exciting magnus continues to push pawns which is something he almost never does he does not push this many pawns he is very very very careful with his play and suddenly he's pushed them too far and now fuja is going to make a breakthrough and yeah magnus did say he was uncharacteristically playing poorly that day which is and he's also getting away from the game he normally plays he usually doesn't move this many pawns he he he generally keeps his pawns very very responsibly positioned ali reza just has to find a way forward now but but suddenly he can't and he doesn't have a lot of time he's got less than a minute magnus plays knight c5 he's losing he's losing he loses a pawn but look at alira getting all his pieces into the position has magnus on the ropes it is a plus three advantage but you got to beat magnus like 20 times in the same game and even though you get all of this he saves himself in this position it was ali resa's perhaps final moment he needed to play queen to c3 the idea of queen c3 is let's say i go here rook c5 can't take because knight b6 is a discovered attack and if queen c3 and the king had run this way rook e6 is winning because after knight e6 there is this absolutely beautiful checkmate that is just straight up checkmate the king is stuck and the rook is pinning the knight to the king so yeah oops but ali r's advantage goes away and magnus saves the yet to find rook b4 magnus is losing again completely losing knight e3 is knight is starting back g3 one final attempt at complicating oh my goodness ali reza had to go king to f2 he had to go king f2 he played a move with 7 seconds on the clock that looked like it it did the right thing but after this oh my goodness and now we we get a draw magnus takes literally all of o r's pawns okay so fua was really close to winning this game he failed right again allow me to remind you they have two games remaining fua has to win one of them to not go down okay okay so magnus is in the winners bracket fuja is not right fu's got a win so here we go magnus has the white pieces in this game let me rotate it back to wh side and he plays a catalan an opening that he used to win the world chess championship in 2021 and he's playing it against you bishop g2 a very solid system black playing a5 very professional stuff here magnus taking on d5 playing on the c file all right knight c3 queen a4 fuja trying to make it wacky he goes back to d1 and now now magnus is like oh i got a target i i'm going to target the rook on c4 i'm going to bring my bishop right i'm going to play a4 i'm using everything ali resa did to punish him now i'm going to plant the knight on b5 i mean magnus is playing his game this is a really really bad situation for ali resa look at this rook c1 you know why magnus is trading everything because who's going to protect the pawn on a5 when the queens side clears nobody nobody's going to defend the pawn on a5 when the queen clears nobody's going to defend it in fact i'm threatening bishop i'm threatening bishop c7 now because i'm defending it through the rook that's called x-ray defense you just learn something today look at that hey if you're watching on like the smart tv look at the screen bishop c7 the idea of bishop c7 you target the queen and the pawn rook can't take for the two pieces because the rook guards through the enemy rook right because the knight is also guarding x-ray defense all right use that in your next corporate call and magnus plays h4 very common h6 h5 taking space knight d2 bishop b2 just slowly improving knight e4 night okay slowly improving magnus playing his game and as always ali rza is down a lot on time ali resa is slow man not not in the head i'm saying he's slow on the chessboard he's a he's brilliant in the head he's just slow on the chessboard he's he's slow in every format except blitz and bullet because you can't be that slow it's kind of like ironic but he is always down to like a minute and it just doesn't work it didn't work in the last game and magnus even has the luxury to allow this and he plays bishop to b bro this is straight up one of the most disrespectful moves i have ever seen do you understand what the idea of bishop 2 b8 is my friends the idea is to trap the queen because the knights prevent the escape what the what bro just straight up move the bishop to the other to his opponent side of the board and he yeah and he doesn't convert it the way the engine wants but he goes to an end game the knights are still on the board and and he puts the knight on d6 and again the engine was yelling here but ultimately yeah ultimately magnus is just up a night and chess is hard when you play the best player in the world it's a lot harder when you are down a night i'm just i'm look hot take all right i know you guys don't come here for a lot of my controversial opinions but that is one of my most controversial i i will tell you i think it's hard to beat magnus carlson when you are down a night fua still does a very nice job creating counterplay may i say trying to do it but it's just too little too late you're not going to beat him down a bishop either you're down down a bishop there are no knights on the board and the only way that you can draw this game is if you somehow get rid of the pawn and you survive one bishop versus two that you cannot win but white has all the pawns and bishop d6 stops it this one is over after 59 moves and magnus carlson defeats alza fua normal i mean you would think this is just a normal video where magnus beats his opponent that's it but fua said i ain't gna go away you kind of know what happens in this video you just kind of want to see what happens and how it happens and really yeah well i'm i was not exaggerating when i said this was kind of nuts this was a very very very crazy video is a very crazy storyline here as well so d4 d5 we go for n exchange queen's gam declined the setting and the premise of this game is magnus leads 2 to one ali resa not only has to win this game he also has to win the armageddon so they're going to tie this he has to win the playoff and then he has to reset the final which is ridiculous stuff magnus has to not lose and if there was an opening that the chess gods invented to not lose a chess game it is the queen's gambit declined the queen's gambit declined is the toyota camry of chess openings old reliable doesn't need many upgrades occasional feature changes excellent gas mileage and all the ubers use it so h6 bishop to h4 if there's an opening that you play to be solid boring relatively uneventful and get you to where you need to go it is the queen's gambit declined f3 b and i am not i'm not saying anything bad about the toyota camry toyota camry is a great car it's a great car all right bishop f2 bishop h7 and magnus just has an uber solid position so oli resa knows he's got to play for a win how do you beat magnus carlson like he's in a situation where the the planet will blow up unless he beats magnus charlson so he plays e4 you got to go for it provocative play allowing magnus to now have a target rook d8 and all these types of things right c5 magnus does try to utilize his target right but now e5 the thing is when you have a desperate opponent you kind of have to play enterprising chess you kind of have to play exciting chess c takes d4 bishop d4 magnus opts for a bishop trade but he stumbles into a fork i he doesn't stumble into it he absolutely knew this was coming and now after knight c5 knight c5 he actually loses a piece he loses a piece the the knight on f6 can be taken but he planned that it was actually better for fua to take here first he didn't like this he thought that in this position he's going to have a very difficult time but as it turns out queen c3 everything is protected and if you play here to try to get me to not castle i'm going to offer a rook trade and then i'm going to trade all the pieces ali resa takes the knight first and now he's in trouble he should have traded the bishop for the knight now that he can't trade the bishop for the knight magnus targets the bishop so fua had a chance there to just straight up win the game for a second time doesn't he doesn't quite catch all the details and now he will probably lose his dark squared bishop and he does lose his dark squired bishop queen d4 not only does he lose the dark squ bishop magnus trades the pieces the game is over yes al resa can take on b7 but we have 92 check takes takes magnus carlson literally invented rook end games you can fact check that it will not be correct but it sounded very very interesting for me to say and that is what content creation is all about lying to the audience no just kidding unless you're not going to name any names not going to name any names content creation should be a very very large amount of truth and some exaggeration b4 king g7 rook f4 ali res is going to work we have two pawns over here two pawns over here here two and one he's up a pawn a4 there there he goes ali res has also got one minute again like he always does bishop b1 whoa i don't actually know what that move does it just looks very interesting bishop e bishop f3 back plays f5 oh that was the idea oh my god defending himself and gaining some space h3 king f6 and just like magnus can win a rook end game he can defend one like a freaking demon ali reza just can't get anything going and he has 10 seconds on the clock and not only does he have 10 seconds on the clock bro tell me how this man magnus is playing for a win he is playing for a win this man is down two pawns in a rook end game that is a ridiculous amount of material and he's playing for a win he's making ali russa play moves like g4 it's over it's over rook c8 it's a ladder mate rook f6 it's over it's over if you give a check and push the e pawn it's over if you give a check trade the rook and push the e pawn why is it over if you play rook c1 rook f1 and by the way that happens because for take take e3 black has a very simple plan and white cannot stop it g5 i don't go stop the pawn although i might do that that might be a draw but no i'm not going to lose my pawn i go here here it's mate you get m king g1 rook here i take the pawn and then you get mated rook c1 rook c2 you could have also just played rook to e you could have just played e3 you didn't have to play rook c1 he could have just went e3 and done all of that rook c1 rook f1 and in this position magnus plays rook c2 and the idea of rook c2 is he's making a draw so if rook d1 you know even if the king goes back it's a draw because you cannot stop perpetual check and magnus is going to win the entire championship but he accidentally makes ali resa find the only move which is rook here stopping rook g2 and it's accidentally winning for white it is winning for white and it is not complicated because you literally push the that is it magnus was was shaking off the poor play and was still winning he was defending games he was still getting you know he was still winning his results were still and all of a sudden he was screaming he was cursing in norwegian english spanish dutch i don't know how many languages he speaks suddenly he can't do anything if you play2 rookie one that's it you straight up can't stop the pawn you start running backwards i push you start block oh well i mean sure but and i'm going to push the other pawn too and i'm going to play king f2 if this just rook f3 or king g2 everything is winning it doesn't matter because you can't cross the third rank you can't stop protecting your pawn route g8 i just play h4 h4 king e5 h5 i'm completely winning this is insanity and all of a sudden from the absolute depths of defeat king e1 rook b2 magnus was iate bide himself threatened one last check mate if you make a queen you get mated so don't make the queen don't make the queen rook b1 king g2 you can't even push the pawn absolutely unbelievable magnus could not believe it he loses the game at the final moment ali resa fua kept on fighting what a man that's why his profile photo was then changed to tyson fury all right speaking of i'm watching this a couple days before fury usk should be a crazy fight and now not only did win this game ali resa held the armageddon it was like a it was a draw it wasn't a particularly exciting game and and and the armageddon he he wins it with black by forcing the draw that's how chess works in chess we have armageddon which is where white and black play a game white has more time but black has draw odds meaning they win if the game ends in a draw and that takes us to the grand final reset ali resa survives fights and fights and fights and fights magnus and will not go away and he forces a grand final reset magnus opens with e4 in the first game now these two it's a brand new series first series is over we have a d3 we have a italian joo piano h3 this line has been played many many times queen b3 is a sideline i think generally white plays rook e1 knight f1 queen b3 is a move and then magnus plays this move a5 preventing the black knight from going there ali reza meanwhile says all right magnus dink dink let's attack you instead bishop e3 let's bring the other horse look at this planting the knights firmly on the king side and then he's ready to fight over there as well d d but knight e5 by the way the bishop's ready to come back like if you wait a couple more moves with white not to make the trade it's going to be a huge problem for example like if i play bishop 2 e2 here already there are insane sacrifices brewing around the white king which is why magnus trades the dark squared bishop whoa oliv res doesn't take he takes on e4 he's threatening the bishop and he's threatening maid oh my goodness so he takes this bishop we have opposite colored bishops and he's just straight up up a pawn ali reza is just cleanly up a pawn in the first game of the next rapid knight to d2 puts the queen back and magnus is just the he's two pawns okay wait not i thought he was going to take on d6 but he's two pawns down queen e5 check and ali resa says you know what i'm not interested we're not going to do any funny business we're going to play play this position even if you're magnus you can't beat me it's not possible bishop c5 rook d8 it's just not possible you could take this pawn here comes h6 by the way f5 is apparently like a solid minus one advantage for black because if knight g5 the bishop goes here and black just keeps keeps going just keeps pushing so again though fuja a bit low on time we've been here before 3 minutes versus one like i don't know how he stumbles into the same situation every single time maybe winning this particular game was on his mind it was sort of like i'm better i'm calling the shots and we kind of effortlessly rook d8 and the players just agreed to a draw here players just agreed to a draw so nothing happens in game number one which means we have two games left that's it two games left here we go fuja magnus now fuja gets white magnus plays the petro magnus does not play the petro bro like ever literally ever like i the go look i'm going to go look this up there's a website which is not the prettiest but it's just chessgames.com player black is carlson and the opening is petro let's see magnus carlson has played 15 pets in his life in his life the last time magnus carlson played a petro in a high high lev game 2013 before he was the world champion versus anand do dog he hates this opening like he never plays this opening fua had this man doing stuff he would never ever do he was like you know what i'm going to play the petro like because whatever you know and now d4 now obviously magnus knows literally every opening right he plays def he knows every opening he doesn't like certain openings hence he doesn't go for them knight d2 plays queen d7 what the what even is this bishop d3 knight c5 now the knight comes back to e6 all relatively normal stuff and he gets a completely normal position but it's still the petro it's still fascinating that he played an opening he literally hasn't played in a decade in a decade 10 years online offline like serious tournaments he has not played it maybe he's played it in blitz but better chance that he's playing like e4 h5 in blitz or h6 than the petro anyway game got very tense fua kept attacking magnus looking for queen h6 look i me by the way that's just completely winning like if black doesn't fight like if black plays rook d8 you just play queen h6 you win the game because knight g5 queen g7 queen h7 you just win complet this mate it's mate m right so magnus sees that of course goes for a queen trade and gives up a pawn but tries to create tactical complications but fu's got a nice advantage here he actually could have gone for gf3 instead and you can't take on f3 because of rook e4 apparently and some attacks maybe kicking out the queen a little bit later maybe bishop e2 to trap the queen hello hello by the way but okay instead of that queen f4 knight f4 and this position where fuja once again is down two minutes versus our main protagonist g5 and in this game ali resa had a very pleasant edge but slowly magnus unraveled the position and here fuja offered a draw he played bishop c2 and he said magnus i'm giving you a way out i'm threatening your king but please take the draw because once i take you're going to take and i'm actually kind of surprised but magnus took the draw and i say surprised because you know he could have went like let's say knight c6 and he could have just set well fues got a minute so i'm going to you know but he was like nope draw which means my friends this is the end of the game this is the end of the video this is the end of the of the match they played seven games against each other the first pair eight eight games the first miniseries was won by fuja revenge from a position of down to one down in game four he came back like a monster like fifth round you know nadal jokovic style like and now they go to an armageddon and you'll notice magnus has 7 minutes and 24 seconds that's because if the game ends in a draw he wins that's the way armageddon works in chess why 724 they bid they submit a bid that says i want to play black my wager is 7 minutes and 24 seconds and the person that bids lowest will win so ali resa creates a bishop's opening right this is the bishop opening and it it allows black to play like this it's why you play bishop c4 whereas if you develop knight f3 knight c6 black would not have c6 so that is the major difference between these two openings the point alyza has to make here is he needs to get a slightly worse position he doesn't need to but the point is he keeps as many pieces on the board as possible with his time advantage now admittedly alza gets down on time in literally every game he plays but dde all right bishop back to c7 and now b4 notice ali's only traded one pawn and knowing what he knows about magnus being slightly off form right he keeps the tension and magnus makes a mistake plays knight to f4 which allows this very powerful response which ali resa spots bishop takes f4 and e5 opening up this attack remember magnus just needs a draw knight to d5 now there is a winning idea here for white the winning idea is not queen d3 because then just g6 but knight d6 and only when the bishop takes queen d3 setting up a sniper on the rook and the queen that is the maj that's the winning idea aliva spends a minute and he misses it he misses the idea now he's only a minute away from magnus that's not a lot of time in a seven to six minute game at this level it's not a lot of time magnus quickly plays g6 now we have queen d2 and again magnus should have respected ed the knight d6 idea because i think al resa spots it now and magnus kind of just plays bishop e6 and now once again this is working and it's working in a different way in the previous position i had these ideas that's all gone but the reason this works is because the queen has shifted over to d2 and that's very important because the queen defends the knight remember we talked about x-ray defense we talked about defending a piece through an enemy piece this is not x-ray defense but it kind of is i defend the the knight through the enemy knight because of the pin because of the pin c4 is a pin and if you take i'm not going to take back but i'm going to go here because my queen is protected so knight d6 uhoh magnus plays rook d8 spend a minute and a half on that move that's a lot of time that's like 20ish per of his remaining time and ali razza absolutely dominates absolutely clamps that down he has firmly placed the knight in the black position and black has massive dark squired weaknesses now he's just going to keep improving magnus begins fighting back ala playing quickly and confidently that's the most important thing magnus by playing the move b6 created a max of weakness in his position of the pawn on c6 the bishop goes back to d7 now ali resa has to surgically precisely cut his way through like gordon ramsey blindfolded cutting that chicken that was a real clip seriously nice clip and he does he finds it and he finds it in 9 seconds the cleanest cut of the meat take take very simple take the pawn now he is a pawn up and he has all the remaining benefits of his position there is absolutely nothing to be done magnus tries to take over the b file ali res is right there it doesn't matter black can't do anything take take he goes for a rook trade might as well you might get to an end game that you might hold just kn back to f3 now he spent a minute on that move he spent a minute moving the night back he could have just kept going forward right knight f3 you got magnus in an end game but it's only upon disadvantage bishop c7 other res plays queen b4 trying to take the b file once again bishop has blocked the queen's infiltration so the queen so the knight goes in right to take advantage of the of the bishop move knight goes to c8 knight takes on a7 that's two pawns that's a lot i don't care if you're magnus that is a lot the bishop goes to a4 the queen goes into b7 oh my goodness he can't move anything d4 only thing he's got left by the way alyza is now very close to him on time queen d8 how do you break through this blockade by coming back by coming back by creating the threat on the two pawns bishop to c2 now we go for the pawn but first we go for the bishop bishop e4 removing one of magnus's two remaining powerful pieces and winning his pawn and winning his pawn and after queen takes e5 queen c4 is on the board the c pawn has a jet pack ali resa is two pawns up despite still getting lower on the clock but there is nothing you can do you can not give a check you cannot get you can give this check but then i just move my king king goes to h1 there is no way to give me endless checks if the bishop moves all i have to do is take it and push and in this position magnus carlson resigned and ali resa fuja won the chess.com classic the first event of the year in the champions chess tour monumental comeback epic fight and sometimes magnus carlson does not win the chess tournament that he plays in the chosen one ali rua gets the job done incredible stuff now get out of here
