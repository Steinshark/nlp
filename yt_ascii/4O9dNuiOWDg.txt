[music] hey what's up guys i'm caboose t here and apples back at it again there is a new color for the iphone eight red and so of course we're here with our first look and our first impressions in our unboxing of the new red iphone and it's a little bit different from last year so the product red iphone tradition that started last year continues this year of course we have more iphones than normal we have the 10 to 8 and the 8 plus but this red is only for the 8 and the 8 plus but what's really new this time is apple actually listen to their customers and this iphone looks a little bit different so let's hop right in so the unboxing experience is gonna be the same as any other iphone 8 or 8 plus but of course now you have the red box here with a red text on a red apple logo and it's the 256 gig 8 plus just for the record you take a look at it it's the same accessories in the box the same order of everything and of course now you get the pamphlet if you purchase any product red item from apple if you didn't know donates a portion of what you spend to support hiv and aids programs and research for them now i don't know what portion exactly that is but it's for sure going to a good cause but then after the paperwork you get that red iphone in all its glory and right off the bat you can see is really really red it's a different red from last year which was that anodized matte red and aluminum finish this is under glass now as the iphone eight and eight plus r so it's more of like this ferrari red or ruby or candy red and i can't even explain to you exactly how red this is the camera will have to do it justice and then of course you flip it over and you'll see that they did in fact listen to us a lot of the big complaints with last year's red iphone if we had any where that it had a white front this year it's a straight up red and black mkbhd edition iphone eight we all want it so super red back all black front there's no other apple device like this right on black i really really like the look of it the more i look at it it's really hard to capture in photos i was trying to share them on instagram and twitter but it's difficult this is a seriously red phone now seeing what they've done with this i really want an iphone 10 in this red also i brought it up they wouldn't say if they would do it or not but obviously it's the same glass that's on the back of the iphone 8 and the iphone 10 so i would love to see a red iphone 10 maybe sometime soon but anyway all the way around the edges you have your matching red anodized aluminum still which is kind of a nice contrast with the black front and then of course the fingerprint reader touch id and the display everything else the internals it's the exact same phone as all the other iphone eights just with different colors and that's basically it all we're doing is admiring a new color here should you buy it maybe i mean as beautiful as it is you got to think you know it's six months into the apple product cycle there's gonna be a new iphone like iphone 9 within like six months like clockwork so if you're gonna upgrade anyway go for it but you got to know what's just around the corner or maybe let's say you're happy with your phone right now and you don't want to spend a ton of money but you still want a little bit of red in your life if that guy you can of course grab a skin for the iphone which will make it look a bit more red it's not exactly the same as this ferrari red iphone but of course the advantage is you can make any phone look this way so iphone 10 for example you can turn red which apple didn't do yet so that's out there i'll link to it below but bottom line is we're just looking at a mid-cycle refresh of a really cool new color for the iphone that goes to a good cause and i'm not mad at all about this but anyway this is your first look feel free to share this video with anyone who you think might be interested in this super bright red iphone it's on sale now it's on their site and i think it'll be in stores in a couple of days officially but let me know if you'd cop this let me know if this speaks to you the way it does to me either way quick video just want to share this thanks for watching talk to you the next one pace
