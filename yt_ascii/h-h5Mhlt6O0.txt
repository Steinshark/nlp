[music] hey what is up guys i'm could be hd here and this is the imac pro we were waiting for this well okay maybe maybe not this specifically but we were waiting for a new apple pro desktop we being creative professionals that use you know final cut pro and motion or just generally mac os10 stuff like that but we finally got it so this is the imac pro in the flesh it's probably looking pretty familiar to anyone who's seen any imac before because on the outside it's almost identical to any other 27-inch 5k imac if you paint everything dark grey or space grey that used to be silver plus a couple extra microphones and improved front facing camera some slightly improved speakers so minor stuff like that but generally the main stuff the design the stand the display the bezels it's all the same but what makes this imac pro an imac pro is all on the inside so i've had this thing here for about a week now which has been really exciting obviously it's been hard to not talk about it and not show it at all in the background of instagram wise and stuff like that but it's been here been editing videos on it working with the new final cut pro this video you're watching this on is edited on the imac pro and it's replaced the mac pro that's been sitting on my desk since 2013 and we needed that upgrade and i did say that before their new modular full desktop mac pro comes out sometime in 2018 that i would give imac pro a chance so shout out to apple for actually getting one here to the studio and so this has been my experience so far so this is a ten core imac pro with 128 gigs of ram the sixteen gig vega gpu and there's a bunch of new specs as you probably know this being somewhere in the sweet spot i guess between number of cores versus clock speed but here are all the available specs the eight core and ten core are available early but if you're going to go for the 14 or' core you'll be waiting till early next year for it to ship and it's all these intel xeon w chips and amd vega gpus so all this new workstation grade hardware like we were expecting so with all that new workstation grade hardware replacing the typical consumer parts you kind of have to redesign the entire inside of the imac pro which they did but you'll never see it because they don't let you get inside there is the bigger ventilation slots on the back of the imac pro but the door to get inside an upgrade any ram even is gone it's a completely sealed non upgradable machine from the speck you buy on day one so really the main way you'd know it's an imac pro other than the new space gray is the performance in theory that's why people are gonna be buying imac pro over a regular imac because it offers that workstation grade hardware that finally upgraded inside that can handle like if you're someone like me who's pushing a lot of big raw frames if you're in final cut pro if you do motion graphics if you're pushing a lot of data around if you're doing a lot of rendering this will all be faster on a machine like this that can actually handle it and i my pro is indeed faster than a regular imac it shows up in synthetic benchmarks which you'd expect given the newer hardware and it also shows up in real-world performance differences in render times like this over the long term add up to a lot of save time which is great where it matters and workstation parts in case you didn't know make a big difference seriously besides just obviously the intel xeon w chips a hundred and twenty eight gigs of ddr for ram that's absolutely ridiculous for a normal person but you already know premiere and after effects and final cut pro will eat that right up it has a pcie ssd that's getting the 3,000 megabytes per second read and write speeds which is nuts obviously the massive cpu core is there's hyper threading 16 gigs of video ram on the graphics card it's clearly a super capable machine with the ports on the back you're getting 4 full size usb 3 ports and then four thunderbolt 3 usb c ports which are good to see along with of course your sd card slot your gigabit ethernet port headphone jack stuff like that the funny thing is i think it's really easy to just hate on the new imac pro because it's very expensive and then also not upgradeable at all what what kind of pro machine isn't upgradeable and that's definitely its biggest weakness for sure but for the hardware inside and the actual specs are getting it's actually a fairly priced machine i priced out a roughly equivalent pc obviously a lot of these parts are brand new so you can't do it one for one but it came out to around 50 100 bucks and that's not accounting for the fact that this is all-in-one it's a beautiful 5k display stealth black obviously it's not a mac and you would build a pc for different reasons and you would buy an imac pro but i actually don't think the price is that insane so this guy has a lot of things going for it that professionals value it just sits on your desk perfectly quietly doesn't make any noise through the days i've had it i like that about it it stays pretty cool too stuffing all these workstation parts into such a small space has to be a thermal nightmare and of course the final cut pro workflow that i have isn't as taxing to the limits as someone using say after effects or motion but even still i'm pushing around these big 8k raw frames and i'm able to playback high resolution previews on the timeline smoothly in final cut pro without dropping that many frames if any at all with plugins and color correction applied so this stuff that would normally choke my mac pro is seeing an improvement right off the bat i like the all-black accessories the black keyboard the great trackpad even the black lightning cable that comes with it i don't think i've seen that anywhere else before so that's pretty cool but long story short i really like it so far it feels like the ideal high-end youtuber final cut pro machine the main question will be is it worth the extra money because it's clearly much more expensive than a normal imac and there are other things to consider like will the thermal situation hold up over time will it stay cool will the' core version be that much better than the 8 or 10 core version for certain applications you know these are all big questions it's gonna take a couple more projects and some time of really putting it through its paces for a full review but honestly so far i'm not mad at all also for those who i know are wondering my imac pro here is sitting on top of a 12 south high rise pro also just got announced today it's also the stealth black so it's pretty sweet kind of goes with it i'll link it below and just generally i think i can finally do another new set up tour or like a desk tour maybe thumbs up if you're interested in that this this has been on my desk for so long that my setup never really changed for like the last five years but it's now finally very different also shout out to john who is also dropping his imac pro setup tour this all black suites set up to our video today i'll link that below so if you want to see a finished imac pro setup that's there but yeah thinking about doing mine soon in video form as i keep using this that's pretty much it thank you for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [music] you
