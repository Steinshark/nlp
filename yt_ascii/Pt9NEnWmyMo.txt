the photo mask is one of three critical parts in a photo lithography system can you guess the other two i'll give you a minute or so to think about it anyway the mask contains a master image with a chip design or part of a chip design as a fundamental part of the lithography puzzle it has a fascinating history that goes all the way back to the very beginning so in this video we're going to look at this essential piece of the semiconductor manufacturing process from ruby lift to euv the photo mask the first the asian armature patreon early access members get to watch new videos and selected references for them before the release of the public it helps support the videos and i appreciate every pledge thanks and on with the show all right time is up did you get it the other two parts of the lithography process are the exposure tool and the resist during the lithography process the exposure tool sends high powered light through and off of that mask and onto the wafer the wafer surface is coated with a light sensitive substance the resist the resist reacts to the light so that the chip pattern gets printed onto the wafer after that the pattern can then be etched in using further processes back in the earliest days like the 1960s or so people used a method called contact printing to make integrated circuits this very crude and simple method was used for making chips with feature sizes of about 200 micrometers making a photo mask in those days was as much kindergarten arts and crafts as it was a science you first start with a hand-drawn circuit design on graph paper to enhance the design's precision you would draw it up at a much larger scale than the final actual size say 50 200 or even 500 times then you have to cut that design onto a special type of two-layer photographic film called ruby lift ruby lift has two layers a light blocking red film laminated to a second layer of polymer usually mylar or something he used a knife to scrape away the ruby this softer red layer leaving the clear polymer layer behind this was delicate work and because the designs were often so large cutters had to be mindful of their sharp toenails when they climbed all over the tables fresh socks were considered essential the completed ruby lift design was often referred to as an artwork ruby lift itself was originally developed by the yolano company for screen printing and the graphic arts and in fact this whole method comes out of the printing industry the semiconductor industry adopted it for their own nefarious purposes so it's kind of interesting to think about the shared technical ancestors between a leading edge apple m2 chip and your average screen printed shirt the next step would then be to reduce the artwork down from its 500 time scale this is done in an intermediary step using special cameras the pattern is backlit with a mercury lamp onto a photographic glass plate you would then end up with a 10x reticle which contains a small piece of your final mask i love the german phrase for it though i obviously can't pronounce it joachim negative at this point the reticle is still about 10x the size of its final intended size you need to arrange many reticles in a repeating pattern onto a single one-time sized master mask in 1961 a company called david mann introduced a tool called a photo repeater it does two things first it reduces the reticle to its final size second it prints the reticle's design onto a glass substrate slowly step by step this step and repeat camera as it was called is the technical precursor to today's wafer steppers the master mask is then used to create multiple working masks for the actual contact printing process they call it contact printing because the photo mask comes directly in contact with the resist coated wafer you press a mask hard against the wafer in a vacuum so to get good contact and avoid any flatness errors sophisticated metrology tools did not exist back then like at all to be honest people looked for errors with a steel measuring tool and a 10x magnifying eye loop like those used by jewelers obviously this manual method is not very scalable it works fine if you're trying to get a proof of concept design out but for high volume production you're going to want something a bit more sophisticated much of the value and expense in early semiconductor manufacturing came from the actual act of making the masks rather than printing the wafers the industry realized that they needed new technologies to improve throughput and accuracy one of the first improvements they added was a tool called a coordinator graph which was borrowed from cartography and kind of looks like a light table it mechanically adds stops in the x and y axis so to help guide your hand in both the direction and length of the ruby lift cut i really do love how early semiconductor people were just borrowing here and there from all sorts of different industries after that came artwork generators sometimes also called pattern generators like david mann's man 3600 these use primitive computer numerical controls to improve on the original coordinator graph design and automate the tedious knife cutting work as these artwork generators got better at mechanical drawing the industry was able to altogether eliminate the need to manually draw the design as well as the intermediary step of reducing that hand-drawn design from 500 times to 10x scale going into the 1970s chip designers can now create the design in cad software and use a projection camera to print out a reticle at 10x this allowed design complexity to take another step forward with the contact printing method constant contact between the working masks and the wafers caused them to quickly wear out this not only means you have to replace the mask a lot but you have to also increasingly watch out for print defects which ruin wafers and affect yield as chips got bigger and defect reduction got more important it got to the point where you could only use a mask for 10 wafer exposures and no more this was not economically sustainable to lengthen a working mask's working life the industry swapped out the materials from soft groups to hard more persistent metals like iron and chromium this worked but only to a certain extent so what do you do remove the contact variable entirely that is what the perkin elmer corporation did in 1973 with the microline the first projection aligner i mentioned this device earlier in another video in that video i mentioned how manufacturers are able to improve yield rates from 10 percent to 70 percent with the micro line but never exactly how this is how in using a system of mirrors and lenses to make it so that the mask and the wafer do not touch the now quartz glass mask stays pristine over many more exposures the original microline worked beautifully it can project a 2 micrometer feature design over a 4 inch wafer at a rate of about 40 wafers per hour but its fatal flaw was that it projected one image from a mask across the whole wafer when feature sizes shrank into the one micrometer range semiconductor manufacturers required more detail and precision than this method can provide things got fuzzy so gca nikon and canon built on the aforementioned step and repeat cameras concepts to create the wafer stepper steppers fired small exposures across the whole wafer trading speed and throughput for accuracy today's advanced duv and euv lithography machines retained the concept the late 1970s also came with it a variety of brand new tools developed to protect inspect and repair the mask during the wafer exposure step for instance one of kla instruments as breakthrough items was the kla-100 this was a defect inspection tool that scanned and compared parts of the photo mask for anomalies it saved operators from having to stare at masks through a microscope all day and since the mask is now transmissive with light passing through it we have to worry a lot more now about keeping particles away from it so the industry introduced thin transparent membranes called pellicles you stretch a pellicle over a metal frame so that it keeps aberrant particles from reaching the mask today pellicles are an essential part of the lithography process and not using them is sort of crazy also by the 1970s semiconductor designs were starting to get so complicated that traditional artwork generators were having trouble printing them all out a 64k dram pattern had over 100 000 components projecting all of them onto a 10x reticle could take up to one to two whole days so how do we improve on that the most obvious successor was electron beam technology or e-beams these are essentially small particle accelerators sending streams of electrons at a target originally developed as a microlithography method for enhancing resolution the industry realized that the technology was more suited for making masks right at one x scale in 1974 bell labs developed meeps or the manufacturing electron beam exposure system roughly speaking meebs fires a steady e-beam that sweeps across a table not unlike a crt monitor the table moves at about 0.256 micrometers in the x and y directions when a pattern needs to be printed onto the reticle the beam is allowed through if not then it is blanked off mebes remained the industry's mask making technology of choice for a decade until atec largely replaced it with a cheaper more economical argon ion laser beam system lasers cost less than e-beams but at the same time offered more accuracy 0.05 micrometers and stability the 1970s can be best described as a period of non-stop growth and innovation for the mask making industry you had this flowering of brand new technologies many of which remain in use to this day the 1980s on the other hand saw this cambrian explosion and mask making come to an end new e-beam and laser writing technologies required very high investments while also allowing people to make more finely featured masks than what the industry actually needed at the time mask making became commoditized some companies like micron seeing it as a critical differentiator took it in-house and with the semiconductor industry experiencing its first macroeconomic downturns the third-party mask making industry consolidated dozens exited the industry companies focused not on the smallest possible resolution but rather on speeding up throughput raising their yields or lowering costs this helped improve their competitiveness in the long run but in the short term there was a lot of pain this dark time in the mask making industry would not end until the 1990s when the rest of the semiconductor industry finally caught up with feature sizes shrinking below one micrometer one of the big mask makers emerging out of this era and remains so to this day is topan a japanese global printing company founded in 1900 topan first made their bones printing authenticity marks for cigarette packs and banknotes they then diversified into packaging decor materials and finally high precision electronics they leveraged their experience making filters for the sugar refinery industry which required making micrometer-sized holes to make photo masks in 2004 topan completed the market's consolidation with the acquisition of texas-based mask maker dupont photo masks an acquisition that i doubt would have been allowed today this year they're spinning off their photo mask business off into a new independent japanese entity topan photo masks other relevant third-party companies in the industry include compugraphics advanced reproductions corporation and photronics fabs like tsmc also offer their own mask making services there is so much more to talk about modern duv photo masks but we need to move on to the cutting edge uv uv shrinks the laser wavelength size to 13.5 nanometers a move that requires a re-engineering of decades of prior lithography techniques i have talked about ev before in quite some detail in previous videos feel free to review them on your own before euv masks and reticles were transmissive which means that they were transparent but with the uv this was no longer feasible the light wavelength is so small that even normally transparent quartz glass absorbs it so euv engineers decide to turn it into a mirror in order to create an uv mask you have to first create a mask blank basically a purely blank euv mirror without any chip design data on it based on the semi p370613 standard it is about 6.35 millimeters or a quarter of an inch thick and 142 millimeters by 142 millimeters large at its very top is the mirror layer a multi-layer brag reflector with 40 to 50 alternating layer pairs of molybdenum and the silicon i talked about this before the mirror layer sits on top of what has to be a very thermally stable substrate according to semi standards the substrate can only expand or shrink some six to ten parts per billion for each kelvin otherwise you get print errors so for each millimeter of mirror substrate that's about 0.00006 millimeters of variance eight zeros i think i got that right comment down below if i didn't it is presumed that the current uv substrate is either ultra low expansion glass or ule from corning which was used for the hubble space telescope or zeroder from the german glassmaker shot a g used for the keck 2 telescope after that a protective capping layer ruthenium about 2.5 nanometers thick is applied this protects the mirror layer from damage in the later stages of the mask making process on the very bottom of the reticle underneath the substrate you have a layer of some chromium nitrate substance not clear what about 70 to 100 nanometers thick this is for solidly clamping the reticle during the wafer exposure step i love the name they use for this electrostatic chuck finally in order to turn the mask blank into something useful you have to pattern it this is done by applying an absorber layer of tantalum on top of the capping layer basically doing the same thing as the chromium patterning in duv quartz glass masks all of this is hard enough as it is but wait there is more asml asks carl zeiss that the mask blank should have only 0.003 defects per square centimeter considering the reticle is 142 millimeters by 142 millimeters large that is basically zero defects on the reticle zero defectivity is one of euv lithography's key challenges to overcome this requires you to protect the reticle from particles be able to detect reticle defects and finally be able to repair those defects when found that means tools this is really important there is no commercial point in being able to make quote unquote an euv mask if you do not also have the accompanying ecosystem of metrology and repair tools around them you essentially have a multi-million dollar boondoggle between the p-37 1101 and p-381102 standards there are over 30 separate specifications that the euv mirror has to meet relevant tools to measure them include the dilotometer flatness interferometer a transmission electron microscope and an euv reflectometer the big problem is that many current instruments are not sensitive enough to detect when things go wrong the extreme nature of the technology contributes to the difficulty in inspecting it for instance trying to probe the mirror layer structures for defects is exceptionally challenging because well it reflects really well uv based tools can only penetrate 2 to 13 of the mirror layers 40 layers so if the technician finds a bump on the mirror layer surface they cannot actually find where the offending defect is underneath the layers i can go on but this video has gotten quite long i'll maybe do a video later on uev defect science and technology later down the line perhaps if this video gets 5 000 likes or something in the span of half a century the semiconductor industry has gone from hand cutting arts and crafts and ruby lift to ultra sophisticated euv mirrors made with exotic materials like tantalum the progress is astounding to think about structurally the mask making industry has also changed a great deal with consolidation into a few very technically advanced players it is a reflection of the semiconductor industry as a whole where lithography goes from here nobody really knows but wherever it will go the photo masks and reticles will go along with it alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see
