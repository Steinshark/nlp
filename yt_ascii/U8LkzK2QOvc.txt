know one of the things that i did when i was doing marital counseling for my clients was if they were dissatisfied with their with their spouse let's say said well what are you fantasized about in relationship to a new relationship right what what fantasies spontaneously enter the theater of your imagination and they they would tell me you know in as much detail as was necessary and i would say well why is it impossible for you to seek that within the confines of this relationship you know it might be well she's not like that or he's not like that or she would never do that or he would never act that way it's like well people are pretty damn strange and there's a lot of mystery in them and if if you're a dancer you can get a lot of interesting possibility out of people where you thought there was only a stultified actuality one of the things i noticed as a therapist and as an interviewer you know if my clinical session got boring it was because i wasn't paying enough attention i was substituting my presumption for the person and so if i have attended more deeply they would start revealing more of themsel and then they'd become like and this was even true for so-called simp there's no simple people but i had lots of clients who were they weren't intellectually gifted put it that way you know they were people who would have been struggling you know often they didn't have a high school education some of them weren't even literate but if you got them out of the box that maybe you wanted to put them in they were just as unbearably interesting as anyone else and that's there's a norwgian writer fiction writer called axel sandu who who wrote in one of his books that that man which does not who does not understand that any woman contains every woman in right right he's an idiot i mean the the way you approach your spouse is is understanding she is every woman in this universe and that that could be someone you don't like or someone you like all aspects of being a a human being is present in that other human being and the same of course goes for me as a man in that same relationship that i'm the best of men and i'm the worst of men y y y y and and the one of the reasons that it's it's it's a it's a good thing to to stick to your relationship to to be faithful to your relationship is then you allow this multitude of possible persons to be there the moment you start thinking oh i would like rather to go over here over there or i would like to change things in that that way and have have another object of my love then you reduce that person and you don't see the the depth the the richness inside inside that other person and i think that's what a strong and good relationship is about that is what love and openness is about is to allow the other person to be fully rich fully full wonder my wife just about died a couple of years ago and and so did i at about time time like like it was a narrow was a narrow path pathway you know and i had a pretty good relationship with her before that very good i would say i've known her since she was like 8 years old so we've known each other mostly our whole life you know and she changed quite a bit after she was ill and really for the better once she started to recover and i was much more i would say grateful to have her around i mean not that that wasn't there to begin with it was already there i loved my wife but the the like the demonstrative like a true demonstration of the possibility of her absence woke me up a bit more and one of the things that's happened is that now when i see her i can see her at every stage of her life at the same time it's really something and also what's happened like she shed a lot of herself self imposed constraints in the aftermath of her brush with mortality it lasted like nine months it was very torturous experience so she changed a lot it's taken multiple years for the full manifestation of that change and it still hasn't happened but it's a wonderful thing to see her and maybe it's also reflection of my change in attitude like she's taken off a lot of self-imposed constraints i think we're afraid of our own entropy and know our own possibility and in doing that i would say she's become more like a child again you know and and there's there's insistence in that in wordsworth for example also biblical insistence you know that unless you become as little child you can't enter the kingdom of heaven and it has something to do with that imaginative plurality that you described right because one of the things that's magical about children is their capacity to magically transform and to enchant the world and they do that because they're going in many directions they're not narrowed and you know that makes them in need of discipline and civilization but there's something wonderful about that so i'd like you comment on that but i'd also like to ask you you know what you just said about relationships that's not something that everybody knows so i'd like to know how you figured that out hard hard work how did i figured that out yeah that well and you can say it not only did you figure it out but you can articulate it and so yeah that's a good question i don't know the answer to it actually uh but i i i i think that it's it's i've always had a tendency to be very monogamous is that what how you say the word in english yeah yeah and faithful to but in in the modern world i mean you you're serly monoc you have you you have have more than one relationship but one after the other as a young person you have several girlfriends but you're faithful to each of them all the time is is that understandable absolutely yeah and and so i i and that was unusual in the circles i live were living in in the 70s that people were sort of all over the place all of them and i was like sort of i had this instinct for monogamy and i was sort of wondering why is that so and i realized that it it it was because it made me discover and and explore the richness of the other person instead of just comparing to someone else and and wanting to change someone else and then of course i've been cultivating that emotion and that way of living for for quite some decades now and and it it i think it's very obvious that that the moment you start comparing people yeah that's a commodification yeah and you see the label this guy i'm talking to has these opinions and this track record and so on and and and you you you confuse the person for for the label yeah and all you see is the labeling h and and life becomes very boring and of course what i've been doing with food and agriculture what i've been doing with how we how how our cognition system works what consciousness is all about out i've been doing a lot of work also with environmental issues and so on it it's the same basic story all the time that we confuse sort of the the label for the real thing we confuse the terrain for the map yeah the concept for the real stuff and and i think that what we do when we are not sort of faithful in our love relationship is that we we do comparisons all the time instead of saying okay this is it i'm not a perfect man in any sense but all aspects of masculinity and many aspects of femininity is in me yep and and and and that's every person is a universe right right well this is certainly something that i learned in this is why i love doing psychotherapy because the the art of psychotherapy is to have that realization making itself manifest constantly during the conversation right because that and that means the person is on the cusp of optimized transformation [music]
