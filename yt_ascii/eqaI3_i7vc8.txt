who controls alibaba group the answer is of course jack ma china's richest man if you want to be a smart mouth you might also answer with the communist party of china but the answer is jack ma okay so we're done with the video right if you want but the way he exercises that control i found to be pretty interesting chinese companies are well known for their insanely complicated structures alibaba is more complicated than most in this short video i want to look at how jack ma maintains control of two of china's biggest companies even if jack ma was to retire as he has already and sell every share of alibaba group and probably ant as well control of both companies can likely never be taken away from him but first i want to talk again about the patreon for those who have not signed up for the early access tier you can get access to a large backlog of videos queued up and waiting to be released to the public it will help support the channel especially when it comes to researching brand new topics that i have never written before right now i'm looking at commercial aircraft in china so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thank you and on with the show in the united states and other western countries the amount of control a person or entity exercises over a company depends on their share ownership largely shareholders elect a board of directors the board is then able to fire and replace senior management as needed for most normal western corporations it is possible for shareholders to buy a stake in the company and agitate for change they could attempt to convince fellow shareholders to elect their own nominees to a company's board in a process known as a proxy battle i recently discussed one such proxy battle in my video about broadcom attempting to buy out qualcomm these type of investors are known as activist shareholders and a lot of people have bad impressions of these activist shareholders calling them corporate raiders greedy such and such such people can definitely exist but positive things can come out of activism as well one example can be found in microsoft and a hedge fund called value act this one bought two billion dollars in microsoft stock and then quietly worked with the company to replace then ceo steve ballmer with satya nadella this new ceo led microsoft into a new era as a cloud-focused services company and the stock has soared ever since now value act was able to do that because microsoft's structure has a simple concept one share is one vote there are a few companies that do not follow this structure google and facebook for example have different classes of shares that have unequal number of votes it will be very hard to attempt to vote out mark zuckerberg for example tech investors usually tolerate this because they highly value company founders alibaba group founder jack ma today owns less than five percent of the 500 billion dollar company joe tai his close co-founder and owner of the brooklyn nets holds even less something like three percent the stake is quite low for a founder and is today dwarfed by that held by softbank which i believe is the single largest investor so there is some risk that softbank or some other large shareholder can decide to remove jack from the company so to protect the founder's control alibaba goes beyond a simple multi-class shareholder vote structure [music] when alibaba was founded february 20th 1999 in jack ma's lakeside gardens apartment jack ma could have funded the corporation all by himself he chose not to asking 17 other people to invest and be his co-founders these' partners would lay the future of alibaba's early growth and help it become the e-commerce titan it is today in 2010 alibaba solidified the quote-unquote partnership structure by creating a cayman islands partnership called lakeside partners lp alibaba's group stock is publicly traded in the united states as an american depository share or ats you can buy an ads today through normal brokerages like robinhood or something like that there is one class of ads out there unlike those other founder-led tech companies like facebook and google the structure could place potential voting control of the company in the hands of those with the most shares and that wouldn't be fair right so alibaba's charter gives lakeside partners the aforementioned cayman partnership the power to appoint a simple majority of the board at all times the 36 current members of the lakeside partnership are almost all either alibaba or ant group executives 27 alibaba and eight aunt jack ma can control the vote of these nominees in a few ways first either ant and alibaba directly employs these people if they piss off jack then they can lose their jobs but second these directors only have their positions as members because they were chosen by a subcommittee within the lakeside partnership the partnership committee stick with me here even within this exclusive group of people there is another even more exclusive group this group of five to seven directors cycles out every five years except for two guys guess who they might be jack ma and joe tai the two continuity partners jack and joe will remain continuity partners for as long as they want until the age of 70 unless removed through death or incapacitation every other partner must retire by the age of 60. it is commonly memed in investor forums that when you buy shares of the alibaba ads you're not buying shares in the actual corporate entity that owns the licenses for taobao and timo instead you're buying shares in a cayman islands domiciled corporation that has signed contracts with the actual chinese entity to receive its profits this chinese entity is referred to as a variable interest entity the chinese vies hold the actual chinese licenses that allow alibaba to do its business the four most important vies are tsochang taobao network co-limited zhang team all network co-limited alibaba cloud computing limited and yoko information technology beijing company limited as you can guess from their names they correspond to alibaba's most important corporate assets if you go strictly by chinese law vis are illegal and in prior years chinese courts have invalidated a similar structure but because the government has never actually been called to test the vi structure in court and do something about it it leaves the whole thing alone as a matter of strategic ambiguity what this practically means is that nobody is going to try to sue jack over alibaba's control neither in china nor anywhere else if someone tried they run the risk of the court declaring the vie illegal and dissolving the whole thing the outside investors as such would be entirely host i would call this path of action though a last resort a big red button but it has been exercised kinda before it was this big red button that jack pushed in transferring ownership of alipay from alibaba to himself and group is the paypal to alibaba's ebay and group used to be just alipay which helped facilitate financial transactions between customers and sellers the company renamed itself and became the biggest single fintech player in the country and has been in the news a lot recently largely because of its cancelled ipo and certain comments jack ma has made in public i did a video about it but another thing to keep in mind about ant group is that jack has total control over it as well and is the key that keeps alibaba group locked up in moz pocket in 2010 alipay applied to the people's bank of china for a license to transact payments the pboc faxed a request to alipay asking whether or not there was a vie contract arrangement between itself and foreign owned investors the answer was yes the foreign owners at the time were then yahoo and softbank jack ma judged his request to be assigned that the pboc will cancel the alipay license he thus cancelled the vie contract between alipay and the foreign owned investors yahoo and softbank and transferred it to himself it was a whole kerfuffle jack maul has complete control of ant alibaba might have 33 equity share part of the settlement that arose from the kerfuffle but jack controls it through two general partnerships of which he owns a 100 percent share these two partnerships have at least 50 percent of the voting interest furthermore the ant board is chosen by ant and alibaba together and as you remember alibaba has eight ant group executives in its lakeside partnership so it all flows back to jack ma jack controls ant jack uses that control to control alibaba and vice versa one helps with the other the thing that i kind of find interesting is that the partnership committee's elevated status within the alibaba partnership kind of reflects the chinese communist party's powerful politburo standing committee structure i wonder if that was intentional probably not you can make an argument that this whole structure this whole rigamole hurts minority and shareholders there's a real precedent of it happening after all as when jackmaul transferred alipay to himself if alibaba was an american company then this can be labeled as a self-dealing transaction and open jack to litigation after all he enriched himself even if it claims it had been necessary people and investors tolerate this because they are tempted by the size of the market and they like jack ma he's small and cute and all that the company and its founder are tightly bound and i think ma knows this as he's not given up these powers in control even as he has stepped down from various positions and essentially retired he's not even on the senior management page on alibaba even though joe tai is jack will continue to play a part in the company's direction for the foreseeable future whether investors like it or not unless of course the party decides otherwise alright everyone take care of yourselves out there if you like the stuff that's on this channel feel free to sign up for the newsletter or check out the patreon i send out
