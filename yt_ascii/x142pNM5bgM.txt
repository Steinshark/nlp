welcome to one of the most hyped burt divisive brilliant but at the same time problematic phones the world has ever seen we've literally just had the p30 pro a few months ago which had an incredible camera and an off-the-charts battery life but now the mate 30 pro is huawei's new kingpin and let me tell you it really is something wally's mate series has always been there plus-sized maxed out smartphone lineup for the pro user and that has not changed here compared to the p30 pros six point four seven inch display which was pretty good the mate comes with a six point five three inch oled horizon display or to put that another way one massive curve you've probably already seen the curve displays on samsung phones well this is another level it almost bends and 90 degrees around the sides pretty reminiscent of vivos recent next device but there's a difference whilst vivo sides work completely for sure huawei uses them you can double tap and slide to adjust volume or you can use it for a customizable shutter button in the camera i didn't actually find accidental touch as a problem either it looks like the sides disabled themselves depending on the situation worth noting is that the resolution has remained 1080p which means it's not going to be as sharp as samsung or apple's best but at the same time it's a massive improvement over the p30 pros with a completely new color rendering engine the only notable caveat being this not just when it looked like quawi had decided to trim this protrusion down on their phones the mate 30 pro has a pretty sizable thing up there the notches there so that it can house the sensors needed for 3d face unlocking which should be even faster and more secure than before but i got to say on first impression i don't love the asymmetry going on here the fact that the sides are really slim is great but then the bottom chin is one way and the top are completely different with i'd always rather just have a consistent border like the last phone in contrast i think the back looks pretty amazing it's out there enough to feel next-generation but the way they've done it still feels somewhat familiar in the hand it's not entirely different to the p30 pro with familiar champers and curves and the rounded corners do somewhat help with the grip that said you can all tell the camera has become an even more significant part of this phones proposition with their now dominating the entire top half and the color options now extend you've got black which is simple but effective you've got space silver cosmic purple and then what i thought was really cool emerald green in terms of the color itself i think i prefer the purple is the kind of phone i could imagine an alien race from the future using but the green has a new coating its top is glossy glasper transitions to a matte fingerprint resistant and anti-slip coating at the bottom pretty genius this is what i want to see more off there's also a couple of vegan leather options which are more durable than glass and i don't hate the way they look at all and i can't stress what a benefit it is to not need to keep cleaning your phone every two minutes final bit of hardware to note is in terms of audio there is no headphone jack here and because of how the earpiece is embedded in the display it's not loud enough to form a stereo pair so when you're listening to music the audio is pretty much just coming from the bottom of the phone now aside from what i've just mentioned there are four areas where the mate is even better than the p30 pro powerful reasons to want to go out and buy one but also two serious caveats in case there was any doubt at all one of the most significant upgrades comes in the form of its cameras whilst it did have some notable weaknesses the p30 pro was already my favourites marfan camera and the mate only extends this the phone has a brand-new 40 megapixel ultra wide cinema camera which is specialized for taking video and in the admittedly limited environment i had to try it in it looks like a leap above any other smartphone out there you remember how huawei completely changed the game with night mode photos on that p20 pro it kind of looks like they've just done the same thing for video here this new camera means it can now also record 4k video at 60 frames per second something that was lagging on past huawei phones and this is my favorite bit record slow motion video at seven thousand six hundred and eighty frames per second yeah you heard that right that is eight times slower than samsung's super slow motion video so slow that everyday scenes literally look like static photos and that's on top of this standard slow motion modes which are now cleaner and sharper than before the phone also has a new level of stabilization which i'm really curious to test against the new iphones you might remember the p30 pros five times optical zoom camera it made headlines was revolutionary but at the same time a hallway must have decided that the sacrifices weren't worth it here because the meat sticks to three times number two you might well know that huawei is one of the only companies that makes its own chips to power its own smartphones well the may 30 pro is their first phone ever to use the kiran 990 the actual performance gain is going to depend a lot on the scenario you're in but to give you an idea the 10 graphics calls we had before have been bumped up to 16 and the cpu itself has been overclocked also worth noting is that the 5g version of this phone will have a slightly different even faster version of this chip which has 5g built into it number three i'm weirdly excited about this phone's battery especially after seeing how their last phone could last two full days with medium usage this new device takes the 4200 milliamp hours we had before and ups it to 4500 man combined with the ever more aggressive battery management of their new software i've got high hopes but we shall see in a detailed battery test soon the mate has the same a 40 watt super charging as before but now brings 27 watt superfast wireless charging to with the whole suite of accessories to take advantage of it and i get it in a lot of senses wireless charging is old news but with that amount of power this has got the potential to be as fast as many phones wired solutions now the last main advantage is that security has been bolstered the fingerprint scanner in the display has been upgraded and the face scanning faster than before plus that new notch actually hides a gesture sensor which lets you do crazy stuff like this i really don't know why okay that's all well and good but two main issues let's start by talking about the elephant in the room you've probably heard of the u.s. bam everyone was talking about it a few months ago but even though the conversation has died down the implications very much remain so to answer one question yes this phone is running android android 10 to be exact and with mui 10 on top of that it's as aesthetically slick as ever with polished animations and improved performance the camera app has been overhauled having ditched the licker style font and interface in exchange for something far cleaner and i also like the new status bar which has a transparency layer for that extra touch of minimalism but there's no google play store and in fact no google services at all here's what i think is happening huawei wants to and is planning to onto the phone in europe otherwise they wouldn't have given us a european price like this but i think they have not actually set an official date in the hopes that google play services arrive soon as a back-up plan in case those services don't arrive while we talked about how they've invested a billion dollars in incentivizing new developers to come on board into their own app gallery which they may use as a complete alternative fingers cross they get google services back though that would be better second thing is price at 10 99 euros for 8 gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage wow is this expensive but if it's any consolation the storage can be expanded using the company's nm cards so in summary there is so much to be excited about here the fact that we've just had this brand new chipset the fact that video quality has not been brought on to par with photo quality the new battery and charging speeds also impressive but all these improvements all this exciting stuff makes what actually happened all the more disappointing the u.s. ban is real it is here the consequences are felt now but the fact that huawei is having this event in europe the fact that they're inviting global media means they clearly have their sights set on western markets and that they're not giving up yet if you enjoyed this video a sub would be amazing and there's plenty more stuff on this phone the iphones as well as whatever oneplus is up to coming very soon thanks a lot for watching my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i will catch you in the next one [music]
