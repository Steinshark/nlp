hey everyone welcome back to talk tech with tiff in this episode i sat down with brooke who is a senior developer advocate at aws we covered her unconventional journey into devell what exactly does a developer advocate or developer relations individual do and also she shared tips and advice around public speaking specifically around how to overcome fear around public speaking also i linked my newsletter down below be sure to go check it out for free tech tips job postings and so much more let's get into it welcome to talk tech with tiff the new york edition where i am sitting down with industry professionals to hear about their career journeys and current roles i created this series to hear from people who are established in the tech industry so that we can all learn what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities out there [applause] hi broe how are you today hi great to be with you it's so nice to be with you i feel like i've seen you on in different videos with aws so it's nice to connect with the the imperson brooke yeah when the fo you page becomes real l it's always i know i know we were just talking a little bit about your background and your career journey but i'd love to hear more about it yeah i have a very wild career path i get a lot of questions about how i got my carent because it's a very it's a fake sounding j title but a real job and it's i don't know how to give other people advice on how to get into this because i have such a chaotic journey to get here yes and i never planed to have this job it's just the stars sort of aligned but if i hadn't done everything i had done along the way i don't know how i would be doing this so i actually studied pure mathematics in my undergrad i then started and dropped out of my masters of financial maths i wanted to become a quant if you know what that is in finance give me the i i've heard of it but i need a i need a refresher yeah there's people that do lots of maths essentially to do various finance things so they could work at a big bank or a hedge fund or a vc or something using really good statistics to better estimate or predict financial numbers is how i would talk about it so yeah i'm definitely a closeted finance person but luckily i came to my censes and then i dropped out of that and then i wanted to do not maths so i became a marketing manager okay with no experience toal'0 and this is all this is all while you were living in australia yeah yeah yeah so then i went to like work at an e-commerce company i built them up from really small to really really big by applying data science to digital marketing which wild and then especially at that time too like even a few years ago it was still so new yeah it was really really early on so i got a lot of first mover advantage i just be wanting the only people to be doing any sort of data analytics wow on any of the numbers coming out cuz this was way before lots of people were even using any analytics at all people were still just going by vibes yeah just throwing things out there seeing what's stuck yeah and i was not like that at all so it just seemed like a fun analytics problem to solve which is weird then what did i do i worked as a ux manager i've worked as an analytics manager at a startup that did smart building smart workplace iot technology when i left i think there were 400,000 end users worldwide maybe like a lot there was like a big yeah yeah so which was really cool and then i worked at professional services in the leadership team for an ai and machine learning firm got to do lots of really cool ai machine learning so i've definitely come back through in the middle there i also went back to university i did a graduate certificate in data engineering oh wow which was yeah just a wild time during co we all needed a co hobby yeah and then along the side of all of this i was an aws community builder which is a community program everyone should apply if you haven't and then from there i also became an aws hero which when i was an aws hero for machine learning there was 30 34 or 37 in the world okay oh wow yeah so there's only three in australia and i think worldwide i was one of maybe like four women wow in the program so it's like very very niche yeah and then i got offered the job at aws and then moved to new york city as part of this job yes yeah from australia huge huge leap never looked back since yeah so it's a wild ride i don't there's so many parts of that that i don't know necessarily if i would encourage other people do but i really like risk taking as you can tell and i like diving into things so yeah depending on how that works out for people i don't know it's very weird it's yeah yeah when you when you were starting to get into aws what what was your reasoning initially for getting into it like starting to use some of the tools and and was it from one of your job specifically or was it from the postgrad course you were taking or what what part of it was that initiated aws yeah so it really came from me doing a lot of analytics work really early on i used to use actually lots of google products for that yeah and then i got really involved in i realized there was a whole community around all of these tech things and i did not have that at the places i was working i didn't have any sort of like tech support network or people learning alongside me and i found out like i would go to these big microsoft google aws events and everyone was so friendly and i got to meet so many people i heard someone say kubernetes out loud for the first time exhilarating and then i got more into it so i definitely came in from the community side which is really exciting because now i work in a community role but yeah it wasn't that i was doing it for a job necessarily i knew that i was really interested in this and i was just really focused on how i could better upskill and get through on things and this just seemed like a really nice way to learn alongside everything else that i did i think there's a lot of people actually in digital marketing roles that would do really well in cloud and techh cuz there's still certifications so i don't know what they're called now but it used to be like google analytics individual qualification or g iq and it's like a full certification that you do in all of the tools that underpin all of this and i think if anyone could do that they could absolutely do aws cloud practitioner yeah cuz it's the same idea of being able to study for a certificate and i think there's a lot of really data driven marketers who would benefit from or would enjoy it or they would be so good at it because it's not just going through and seeing like who's working on what or who's building what being the journey of people are doing really good analytics and this would just give them more tools to be able to do that and communicate along the way they just don't necessarily know that it's an option yeah or they think that oh it might not be for me or it's not even an option like you said for me yeah what you mentioned at the beginning of this conversation that i have a fictitious job title you know and i i love that because as someone who is a developer advocate as well and and this is you know i i've been one now for eight months from software developer to developer advocate and i completely agree with you on that it's so hard to how do you expl what do you do yeah and it's even weirder because even within developer advocates everyone thinks it's so different and at some companies it's under engineering and at some companies it's under marketing and the whole thing about being a da or ende deval is just that you're in the middle yes you're in between the big either company or product or service or something like that and the builders who are trying to build stuff with it so overall we're just making it easier for builders to build on aws or making it easier for aws to make products that are better for builders to build with so it's like really going both sides of that one of my co-workers said this in a meeting i don't remember which one if i remember i will credit them in a comment but yeah it's just being in the middle so you can help both sides talk to each other which is what i really liked about working in ux as well and it's what i also really liked about working in just like a straight up marketting role so it's nice to see that applied to tech especially now that's becoming more common cuz it really wasn't common before yeah i definitely feel that as tech continues to evolve and grow the need for someone who is able to understand the product have that technical aspect to varying degrees and then also to be able to communicate that is becoming more and more important yeah and then going the other way as well so important if you don't know how to do us of research interviews or stakeholder interviews you don't really how to get feedback from people who are having problems cuz i'll just reply to a tweet that something sucks and unless you know really how to dig deep into figuring out what specifically sucks at what time and what they're trying to do yes you can't then relay that to improve the product to stop it sucking so i think it's more about like how do you know how to ask open ethnic questions or do you know how to actually just like get through to the root cause of something which is a big part of this as well that i some das really focus in on that side and they don't do a lot of content or some people do a lot of content and not the other way but yeah being in the middle is very very valuable it's so valuable and it is it is you're wearing a lot of a lot of hats you know for example i see on on on social media on different platforms the content that you create and then also the ne you might be sharing a video one day and the next day you're speaking at a conference then the next day you know so what if even possible to explain what what is a day to-day like for you yeah and it's really hot as well i made a video about this like day in the life of a developer adv down below and there was a whole portion of this where i'm just talking i'm like i can't show you what i'm doing because lots of what we're doing is we're making content for releases that are coming up which obviously we can't tell you about or we're trying to fix a problem in something which you can't tell you about till it's fixed so there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle that just are not very public yes but lots of what i'm doing is making so there's like really shortterm things so if i need to make a video that's really quick i will just do that or if there's a really long-term project that i'm working on how can i do lots of like stakeholder interviews us research sessions to really understand the problems that people are facing and then synthesize that down so i can come up with a long-term solution for it so it's actually fixed yes and then if something has been fixed then being able to say what's the best way to communicate that it has been fixed or what's the best way to show something working as well is always really difficult to do because sometimes that will be a very easy decision and other times it's not like figuring out what's the best way to show a new feature working can take a really long time to make a 20 second video 100% that's almost even more challenging in some cases than making a longer v video on it finding how to condense it down into that 20 second kind of yeah that's the biggest thing about doing tik tok or any form of short form video is lots of people i did really competitive dancing when i was younger okay and the most important thing with that was just to make it look easy yes yeah irish dancing is in fact not easy oh was i did irish dancing i did scottish dancing like highland dancing is what it's called with the kilt and everything but the whole thing with especially irish dancing is making it look easy and that's what tik tok is all about as well just like making it look really easy to crank out a 20 to 30 second video for beginners but that's really hard ex and a lot of people will see content and then they'll just say oh why didn't you do this other thing or why didn't you also do this or why didn't you cover this weird edge case that 1% of people it's like specifically how yeah could fit into video and it's always people that haven tried to do it themselves they don't realize how difficult it is in practice 100% and doing it over and over again as you would know makes that easier but it's still there's so much strategy that goes into it exactly and planning and just knowing the mechanisms that you need to use to make it really repeatable is it's huge so huge yeah and i feel like when you were saying there's different ways to announce about a new feature or share different announcements or information coming up do you use your background in math and data to to make those decisions sometimes or does it vary 100% i am the type of person that will run a full-on like custom clustering model on the back end on data that i have sourced myself because the data doesn't exist cuz l the best thing about working in emerging tech is that you're probably doing something for the first time yes yeah which is also the worst thing because if you're the first one to solve a problem it's not unstack overflow there's not an existing data set probably of stuff thatly need to work with so it's about how you can be a problem solver to figure out what you're actually trying to do but then it's so exciting cuz you may be the actually the first person to try and do something which is always super exciting i 100% agree when you share your journey of how you got to where you are today with devell and developer advocate it's it's very unconventional well i mean i don't even know what is conventional anymore for this ro it's so many different paths but but what would you what advice would you give others who are watching this who want to to explore dev or dev advocate type rules i think showing you can do something rather than saying you can do something is so important for this so instead of saying i can communicate technical content yes give examples of you communicating technical content stop making videos cuz when you get in a job like this no one's showing you how to shoot an edit video like i work with incredibly supportive people who are cheering me on but i am scripting storyboarding shooting editing the works myself there's no one that shows you how to make a really catchy thumbnail there's no one that shows you how to do copywriting for websites and tweets and things like that so it's just about showing you can actually do something which you only get by trying even things like i know how to use the entire adobe suite yeah because i learned that on my own when i was a marketing manager exactly no one went back and showed me oh this is how you like do animation in after effects no one's no so but now it's such a skill to be able to have cuz even needing a custom icon for something cuz maybe i'm the first person to need an icon mhm you can go do it yourself the magic of adobe not sponsored i can do this myself now which is really exciting cuz that means i can be really quick amazon is all about like leadership principles and stuff it's very weird if you've ever interviewed there you will know this but one of them is bias for action okay and just being able to get things going instead of like it's a like making sure you don't have analysis paralysis necessarily so just like getting in doing something and having all of these weird side skills in like design video editing even photography so much so that when i get anidea for a concept of how to communicate something really technical i know i can execute on that which is really important and like if you have come from being like an sre or an sd or a software engineer or devops whatever maybe you don't necessarily know how to do those things but also no one's going to show you how to do that in the job 100% it's more important would you say the one of the most important things is to being being able to teach yourself new skills or being open to to learning on the fly yeah and being okay with being really bad at something i love that so important being okay with being really bad at something yeah i don't know anything about front-end development anything i was so excited last week cuz i got a whole demo running with like a full front end back end i was like yes you're learning on the i'm not dating my linkedin to 10x developer this is incredible but like it's just being able to learn things because the amount of times that i will be the one going through the beginner documents for something and i'll find issues in there that other people did not find cuz they're glossing over them because they already know them so not knowing something but then also knowing how to figure out what's actually happening so important so valuable yes even like you said for that initial feedback for the doc writers or different things like that as well being like hey you know when i was going through this for the first time here are some areas where i got stuck on and and getting even that not that not only that data from your actual users or who will see that but also to immediate feedback as well from from yourself for example who's going through it the first time yeah cuz if i make a video about something best case scenario someone will see the video and try to do the thing so i don't want to send people like the big core backbone of deell is trust like people trust me because of the content that i have spent years and hours and hours of my life making and all of the relationships i built over time have been making that trust so i don't want to break that trust cuz that your whole brand in deal is just a sort of like a trust handshake with people right so if you break that trust i don't know how you get that back so i am always super like making sure if i'm sending people to something that is as robust as i can possibly make sure it is beforehand so if i'm going through something and i put myself in the shoes of someone that's doing it for the first time so making sure even if it's like you know to click the next button but it says click okay and it's different text like making sure that it's updated for people is super important yes i'm making sure that anyone that's seeing it is having the best time that they could possibly have along that or else they're not or else what's going to happen is next time they'll they'll go to a different resource or a different individual they'll be like oh well you know i i tried going through this with with brooke or whomever and it didn't really work out so i'll try someone else next time but if they go through and they're like wow this is really great it's just continuing to build that relationship yeah it's just making it as easy as possible and making sure i think it's all about being it's sort of like being a good host like if you're hosting a dinner party or something you want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to be involved and it's just like if the dinner party was developed som like how you can make it as easy as possible for everyone to have the best possible experience i like that you do a lot of public speaking it is an area that i'm interested in but terrified of right but i wanted you know you're terrified of something you're like like i'm terrified of skydiving i'm never going to do it don't want to do it i'm terrified at public speaking but i really want to do more of it what is some advice you would give to myself and others watching around public speaking from you know overcoming those those fears yeah and the fears are real like i used to be too anxious to even go to events i would have such terrible panic attacks i would always force myself to get ready and like go on the bus or the train to get there cuz i knew i could do that and then i would fully have a panic attack outside the door being like absolutely not i'm not going in and then it's like a 5-year process for me really of like how can i like i'll go in i'll at least get my name tag this time perfect and then i'll leave after five minutes because just absolutely not and then just being really tenacious and working your weight up super important because lots of people that this is why i try to do lots about like how to become a speaker because lots of people that do speaker training are just really naturally good at it yes i yeah they just are like you just do it like right it's like when someone has really fantastic hair just normally and then they try to do a hair tut tour or something i'm like i do not believe you yeah this is not real you have not had to try like 100% or the perfect skin now their whole life or anything and then they're doing like a foundation demonstration on already nice skin i'm like i do not trust you at all is use oh my goodness so so accurate yeah so i think the biggest thing is just working your way up to it there's a full i did an hourong conference talk on this a few years ago i really need to update it cuz i fully have a coughing fit in the middle of the video it's like a virtual one and i can't stop coughing it's really funny but i will redo it so that i at least don't have to keep sending that to people but it's like how to become a tech conference speaker and there's a whole thing that steps through even like how to write your bio and everything else yes but i think it's all about if you want to be successful so what happens when you're applying to do a talk do something called a cfp which is a call for proposal so anytime there's a conference they'll say we want talks about like devops or running a technical team or machine learning and then so what you do is you fill out like a session description so saying what you're going to be talking about with a nice title but the thing is is a person that's probably doing the first path pass of those is someone in marketing at the conference being like i'm running a conference and i need to get sponsorships and i need to get rsvps yes how do i tesselate this in a way that people want to come to these talks yes is this going to be something that people want to come to right cuz you only have to write the talk once you've been accepted to do the talk true so like getting really good at understanding like even as an attendee of conferences what are the sessions that i really want to attend or like which session descriptions really stick out to me by being really like engaged when you're looking at things like this you'll get so much information so that when you go to write it you know what you're at least excited about so maybe other people will be excited about that as well i always also look at conferences which sessions have really big lines at the door which like usually it's something with graphql or rust or like machine learning that's what people are really excited about being really just engaged and involved in what you're looking at will help you when you go to be more active cuz for a lot of people me included that was a big phase where i was like i knew i wanted to do speaking but i knew i wasn't ready to do it okay so just being really mindful in what you're consuming will mean that when you're ready you have so much more information how did you know broe how did you know you weren't ready if that makes sense like how did you what was that feeling or how yeah how did you know i didn't have a solid reason for why i wanted to do speaking for a long time and it's really hard for me to do something when i don't have a good reason for it and then like now when i speak my only goal is to make sure one person in the audience feels like they could give a talk after this i like that cu it just making it look super attainable yeah i don't care if people think i'm smart afterwards i don't care that's not my some people go up and they'll try to talk to be the smartest genius that's ever existed and like that's not good to watch i don't like watching sessions like that 100% but i love going to sessions where i've got a really big like connection with the person speaking or they've been super engaging and i'm like oh i'd love to try that or getting people really engaged which does translate well from social media so just finding out a reason that you actually want to chase something will help you so much more i love that that's so important when you have been giving talks one of my biggest fears is that i'm going to mess up during it right you're on stage it's live what what happens if you mess up so so as some an experienced speaker how do you even overcome that fear of it happening right this is where modeling comes in really handy cuz the worst things that could possibly happen have already happened to me like i've walked a runway and they the dress was too big so like pinning me into it beforehand and then i get out there in front of hundreds of people and the whole thing falls down and it's just me out there in a thong like and i know that can't happen at a tech conference right like i know the worst possible thing has already happened to me mhm and so it just doesn't seem as bad i love that like if my clothes are still on it's fine right it's fine yeah i'm walking off the stage i'm still clothed yeah bad is it really yeah and all of that comes back down to like why am i actually doing this as well i think it would be really crushing if you were going in my goal is to be the smartest person in the room yes you're just setting yourself up to fail then right cuz if you make any mistakes or you want to be i want to be the best presenter at this conference if you do anything that is not the best presenter at that conference you're you're going to fail you're going to think you're failing yes right cuz you're just setting yourself up to fail so think about like what you are actually pushing for and then it just makes everything else seem so much more relative in what you're actually doing i love that that's such i needed that advice i think we naturally put so much pressure often on ourselves or i do anyways that i need to give this perfect talk or it's going to reflect poorly on me or you know you really get it it's easy to get in your head but i like your takeaway of if i'm up there and there's one person who who takes away you know i'm enabling to to take away something from this talk or that they can speak about it afterwards yeah it takes a lot of the pressure away 100% yeah and then it takes pressure off you because if you make a mistake when you're talking yeah and you just bounce back from it so i'll be watching that and then say oh brooke totally messed that up but they just went straight back into it yeah that's fine and you just are not hard on other people like if you were doing a talk regardless of what you did i would be cheering for you 100% right so it's just like making it more of a way that you could feel that way about yourself which is really hard but just getting into the mindset of like being really mindful when you are watching other people's talks like what makes you think someone else is doing a good job and then you'll start noticing those good things in yourself as well it's really there's a trap where you can start looking at what makes someone a bad speaker and making sure i won't do that or sure i won't do that but then you're just putting all those negative things that you're looking for onto yourself and that's all you're going to be thinking about yes like i always forget the name of this thing but like when you're going to buy a new car and then you start seeing that car everywhere just because your brain's like training to look for it that happens with like if you're trying to nitpick other speakers or other content creators so just instead think about what's making them look like they're doing a really good job or like what's a really nice design element they've used on the slides it's like effective yeah like flipping it yeah yeah and then it just makes it seem so much more attainable cuz yeah i could totally do that i could totally do this that is i'm going to steal that that's brilliant it's so and it's so easy to do just flip the script you know i know you just gave some some really incredible advice around speaking but i always like to end these chats with what advice would you give to your younger self yeah in my house in australia there's like a big a piece that said be who you needed when you were younger cuz i saw it it was like a tumbl meme for a long time was someone i can't remember the name but they had it on a slide deck and this just stuck with me for so long and it's been at any stage of your career or your life there's always something that you can do to make it easier for other people to come through and paving that pathway for other people to come through so this is how i think lots of junior developers can start mentoring earlier or even just making sure like if you're at an event saying hello to the person who it might be their first time being at an event is so helpful because then they'll be there to do that for another person so that advice but also just stay as stubborn as you are i wouldn't like had a very weird career to get here but i wouldn't have had any of that if i wasn't just so horribly stubborn determined some say tenacious but yeah it's just really stubborn and if i had stopped every time someone told me to i wouldn't have gotten to move to new york city i wouldn't have had so many other opportunities that have come so just yeah believe in yourself even when no one else really is is cheering you on maybe or you're you're getting a lot of doors closed just keep on being st i like that be stubborn well it's like the best thing that comes from modeling it fully desensitizes you to to just rejection constantly the amount of times i would go to a casting especially in australia lots of models are like very blonde very t bikini goals and then i'm there and i'm like yeah if they're getting the job i not getting the job but if i'm getting the job it's just like a different it's what they're looking for and it just really desensitizes you to rejection early on cuz that's the thing with tech conferences like i have had the worst things you could possibly think of said to me at castings and i know no one when they're reading my tech conference application to be a speaker will say or think any of those things like it's just never going to happen again so like being able to make sure you're fine with however it works out is so helpful long term if you're in deo or speaking or even in tech generally i love that be the person you your younger self needs is that what it was be who you needed when you were younger be who you needed when you were younger yeah i love that yeah cuz even if people are in high school right there still something you could have done yes yeah yeah yeah that's great advice to to end this chat with thank you so much it was great to connect with you yeah thank you for having me thank [music] you
