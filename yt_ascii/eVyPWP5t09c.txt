hello everyone and welcome in this video i have teamed up with progressive and we are talking about what happens if you forget to change your oil on time now if your question is is it okay if i forget to change my oil on time the answer is no the end very simple however this is engineering explained we can do a little bit better than that so if your question is how bad will it be for my engine if i forget to change the oil on time well suddenly that's a much more complicated question with a much more complicated answer and so that's what we're going to get into in this video now one of the most important properties of an oil is its viscosity rating so if you take a look at a bottle of oil it may say something like 5w30 and that number is giving you its viscosity rating so the 5w is indicating the viscosity rating when the oil is cold the w standing for winter and then the 30 is indicating that oil's viscosity when it is hot now generally speaking the viscosity of that oil will remain the same throughout the useful life of that oil but as that oil is used it oxidizes and so that oxidation occurs because of the heat the oxygen the pressure the environment that this oil is within and so as that oxidation occurs within that oil eventually its viscosity starts to increase so there's multiple reasons for that increase in viscosity part of it being the oxidation part of it being that the volatile components within that oil the lighter components that cause it to be a bit more thin start to burn off and you also as time goes on you start to include and increase the number of contaminants within that oil so all of that results in the viscosity eventually starting to go up as you have that within your engine for longer and longer now how long does that take that's unknown you know it's going to depend on the oil that you're using and it's going to depend on the engine that you're using but at a certain point as you start to hit this point of the curve where the viscosity starts to really go upwards that's where you're going to start to run into danger because you're not going to have proper flow within your engine and without that proper oil flow within the engine you're not going to have proper protection and you're going to start to increase wear another thing we need to consider is oil consumption within an engine so all engines will burn oil and so in preparation for this video one of the things that i did was i started closely monitoring the oil consumption within my own car and to my surprise and i was happy to find out the oil consumption was actually pretty low so i changed the oil about every 6 000 miles and the oil level was still within the perimeter of where it should fall during those 6 000 miles now it only has 20 000 miles on the car itself so it's still a relatively new engine and so you wouldn't expect to see too much oil consumption as engines age they tend to increase the amount of oil that they start to consume so why do engines consume oil well there's three major sources for that oil getting into the combustion chamber and then burning off the first one being the valve guide so as your intake valve is moving up and down you have oil lubricating that interaction and that oil can leak down within to your intake and then eventually work its way into the engine where it is burned in the combustion chamber you also have a positive crankcase ventilation system so within your engine you build up this high pressure beneath your pistons and that high pressure needs somewhere to go so there's a ventilation system which allows that high pressure to be routed back to your intake well some of the oil mist that forms within your crank case can then be routed back into your intake and as a result then you can burn that oil mist within your engine and finally you use oil to lubricate the cylinder walls with that piston cylinder interaction so a third location where that oil will be interacting with the combustion chamber and thus burning off so what is the danger of burning off oil well obviously our worst case scenario is we just burn off literally all of it so there's no oil remaining and our engine has no lubricant and as a result it gets way too hot a ton of wear is going to occur because you're going to have metal on metal interaction and it's going to lead to catastrophic failure so that's of course the worst case scenario what's more likely to actually happen is if you're just you know a little bit late on getting to your oil change is you're just going to have less overall oil within the engine and this poses a problem because as you have less and less oil in that engine working well then that remaining oil is going to have to work even harder to protect your engine so because there's less of it overall within the engine it's going to start to oxidize faster and as a result you're going to start to have more negative effects occurring more rapidly as that oil level starts to decrease also if the oil starts burning off but you leave behind contaminants the percentage of contaminants especially those dangerous metal contaminants which could be wear from the engine are going to increase within that oil which can lead to additional wear so it starts to kind of spiral out of control and that's where you kind of start to see you know these these curves right here where all of a sudden that oil is now oxidizing significantly quicker it's getting significantly thicker and the contaminants are increasing rapidly within it now motor oils are actually really complicated and they include all kinds of different additives which are important for your engine's health and so this is not a complete list of all the additives you can expect to find in an oil but we are going to touch on some of the major ones here and so we're going to work through different additives talk about what they are what they are used for within the oil and then what the consequence is of you know using that oil for far too long and not changing your oil on time so the first one antioxidants and oxidation is the primary cause of oil degradation so antioxidants are super important in reducing that rate of oxidation so the consequence of waiting too long is that this oil starts to break down more and more losing its effectiveness and you have an increase in wear within your engine we also have anti-wear additives for example zinc can be used to do this and these zinc additives help react with rough surfaces to create a sacrificial barrier and to help smooth out that surface so that you reduce the friction there and reduce the amount of wear that you have so over time as you start to use up that zinc and start to remove those sacrificial barriers it loses its effectiveness and of course you're going to have more wear if you have something preventing wear and it goes away or it's not as effective anymore you have more wear detergents are very important for preventing corrosion within the engine and helping to prevent sludge from building up within the engine so over time as that sludge starts to build up and your detergents start to lose their effectiveness well that sludge can get within passageways and reduce oil flow within those passageways and so if you reduce that oil flow through those passageways well of course you're getting less oil through them you're getting less protection you're increasing friction and you are increasing wear this can also lead to if you have a decrease in the effectiveness of your detergents you can have excessive carbon deposits starting to form within your engine also helping to prevent carbon deposits we have dispersants and dispersants are really cool they'll actually surround deposit precursors they'll attach themselves to it and they'll suspend that deposit precursor within the oil oil so it just circulates within the engine perhaps the filter will be able to filter it out and if not it just continues to circulate within that engine but it doesn't attach to anything and form a harmful carbon deposit so these dispersants help to suspend that deposit and in doing so you don't have those deposits forming within your engine of course the longer you wait the more these you know deposit precursors are going to be held within your engine so if you don't change it out well you've got all those deposits floating around in your oil just waiting and waiting and waiting to attach to something and you're never actually removing that removing all those deposits from your engine it's actually a good thing you know to see that dark oil coming out it means you're taking out all of those contaminants when you change the oil however you don't want those contaminants in there forever so you need to change your oil on time now viscosity modifiers are also a very interesting additive and so these can be used to allow for multi-grade oils so for example if you look at a graph of a viscosity versus temperature viscosity being our vertical axis temperature being our horizontal axis low temperature over here high temperature over here very thick fluids up top low thickness fluids down here at the bottom and if you look at different grades of oil so say an sae 30 which is thicker than an sae 5 now both of these oils as you heat them up their viscosity will decrease however if you add viscosity modifiers to an sae 5 you can change the characteristic of it so at low temperatures it will remain the same it'll remain a sae 5 rated viscosity oil however as you get to those higher temperatures these viscosity modifiers start to expand out and as they expand out they start to thicken that oil and so it acts more like an sae 30 oil at higher temperatures and so if you start to have these break down well then you will notice a decrease in the viscosity of the oil once it's at operating temperature so you may see initially a drop in the oil's viscosity as you start running it within your engine and that's because those viscosity modifiers as they expand out they're susceptible to being sheared split into different parts and then you have a decrease in viscosity because those viscosity modifiers are no longer being effective now ultimately oxidation is going to play a stronger role and your viscosity is going to increase but you may see an initial dip as a result of these viscosity modifiers being worn out motor oils can also contain poor point depressants and so these are really important for improving low temperature flow so if you live in a cold area it's important to have these poor point depressants to make sure that you have plenty of flow on startup of course during startup it's a critical time to make sure the oil is flowing within the engine to make sure you don't have too much wear and so if these poor point depressants start to wear out then your oil is too thick at startup and you don't have proper flow within the engine so in that really critical moment where you need that oil circulating within the engine on startup when the engine is cold you're going to have excessive wear occurring because you can't get that thick fluid to flow within the engine and finally we get to foam inhibitors so if you look within the crankcase of your engine you've got that crankshaft and it's rotating around and it's splashing the oil all over the place and in splashing that oil it can create a foam and start to create bubbles so these foam inhibitors work to reduce that air and oil bubble surface tension so those bubbles pop very easily and you don't create a foam within the engine so if these are no longer useful then you're going to have that oil foam up it's going to reduce your oil pressure and it can cause cavitation where you have that sloshing of the oil which means you won't have protection and without that protection it can lead to additional wear so going back to our original question how do we know you know if we waited too long to change our oil how do we know if we did any damage well thankfully there are actually labs out there where you can submit a sample of your oil so you take some of the oil from your engine and you submit it to this lab and they can tell you you know they'll analyze it based on its viscosity looking at metals within the oil and they can tell you hey here's where your oil's at this was way too long you should not have waited this long you did some damage to these components of your engine or hey you were fine actually everything was in the normal spec of an engine oil so you're okay you don't need to worry about it so if you're really curious oops i waited too long i went 5 000 miles over whatever it may be and you want to know did i actually cause some damage you can take a sample of your oil send it to these third-party labs that will test it and then say hey here's what's going on with your oil and you know they're kind of looking at these things and saying this is what changed with your oil here's where you're at was it okay was it not so huge thank you to progressive for sponsoring the video and thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or
