okay i'm at home for the holidays hence the 
different setup actually let's pause here   quickly look at my view this is the snow this is 
the level of snow i'm in saskatchewan by the way   and it gets really cold really quickly here in 
winter anyways that's not the point the point   of this video is i was thinking over the holidays 
of about deals there's always a lot of deals going   on or new products coming up and it takes a long 
time to monitor these deals sometimes they go up   sometimes they go down i think how did i miss that 
this technology this product was on sale for so   much cheaper i wish there was a way that i would 
get notified when a product drops below a certain   price and naturally of course as the programmers 
technologists we are i decided to write a python   script to do this for me well let's back up a 
sec here before i wrote the python script the   most important part of this was actually to scrape 
data and i needed to think of a way to build a web   scraper and there's really two ways that i could 
have done this or that i thought of doing this   the first is the manual way meaning literally bill 
building a web scraper to scrape data and in this   case from amazon now there are some downfalls 
to this way though the first is you have to   maintain the code the second is well what if 
the html element tree actually changes so if   you are scraping data based on the structure of 
the html it's very common that it can change and   in turn break your application now this is an 
application for you or i just building for fun   that's one thing but when you start thinking of 
large companies that you work for oftentimes if   they're building a web scraper how this could 
be detrimental then i thought well what is the   alternative what is a better solution and for 
this i found bright data this is a tool that   i was blown away by i've been using it tinkering 
around with it for quite some time and i'm going   to take you along today in how i was able to in 
minute scrape amazon daily daily for whatever   product i'm looking for i'm getting ahead of 
myself here let's just get right into it so   to sum it up two parts of this project first is 
actually getting the data through a web scraper   and in my case i want to get daily data so i want 
this to be data that is scraped daily the second   part is actually building the script for this to 
notify me a desktop notification when the price   drops to a certain point actually speaking of 
that when i was playing around with this i ran   into an error and i thought you know what'd be fun 
let's try using chat gpt for it and that's what   i did so i'll share that with you in the video 
as well all right got my computer here [music]   okay i'm gonna put up on screen here right there 
this is a tool that i mentioned we are going to be   using bright data essentially is a comprehensive 
platform that allows businesses to easily manage   integrate and analyze their data from multiple 
sources so this could include structured data from   databases or unstructured data from sources like 
social media emails and documents one of the key   benefits that i noted right away when using bright 
data is its ability to quickly and easy integrate   data from different sources this can save yourself 
the businesses you work for resources and time   by eliminating the need for manual data entry 
and reconciliation all right let's dive into it   foreign okay so as you can see on screen here i 
am logged into my bright data account and you can   focus on proxy infrastructure web data platform 
in this case i'm already going to go into the data   collection platform and go into collectors now 
in here you can see i have some data sets i've   been playing around as i mentioned with bright 
data already so that's why there's some existing   ones for this though i'm going to go through 
developing a new self-managed collector and kind   of going back to the beginning of this video we 
are going to be creating a amazon product search   that searches for iphones so for this they already 
have some templates that you can build upon so go   develop a self-managed collector and then from 
here you can see there are a ton of different   templates now you can start from scratch you don't 
have to use one of these templates this using one   of these templates i found really helped save 
time and you can modify them to your specific   needs which is a benefit as well so for this 
let's go amazon product search use template okay so as you can see here it already has some 
code for you it's already doing the pagination   for you too which is huge and let's go into scroll 
down you can type in a keyword what is the latest   iphone 13. let's do iphone 11. let's keep it this 
way because what i think this will do is the whole   purpose of this project is to search for products 
that might be on sale and i feel like iphone 11 is   in that sweet spot that might be on sale now and 
actually totally off topic but this is something   i really need because one of my friends is looking 
for a used iphone so this might be the way to go   all right from here let's simply click on preview 
and we can see it running here the run log which   is great and we can see the preview here so 
right now it returned us the preview in html   scroll down we can see it all right and as you can 
see you can modify this code if you would like i   really like as well how they leave comments 
for what each part of the code is doing so   you can get very specific but in this case let's 
finish editing okay and then you can see we have   a save template here and the output configuration 
there is a ton of different options that it gives   you from search title url i mean you're not just 
getting one thing we want to focus more so on the   price but as you can see you can really build upon 
with many different outputs so once again you saw   how many different templates there are it's really 
cool okay let's start getting this integrating   this into our code okay so next up we can go to 
the three dots here and let's initiate this by api and there are some commands that we need to 
run one thing i want to note though as you   can see here you need to get your api token 
and for this all you need to do is go into   settings account settings so first what i 
want to do is actually go into api tokens   add token user permissions expiration date 
yes this all looks good save okay enter in   my two-step verification code save and it will 
generate a unique token [music] copy my token   and i'm actually going to be able to show you 
this token so i'm going to delete it afterwards   i'm going to dismiss now if 
i go back into my collectors   and then go into initiate by api where we 
were initially let's copy this curl here [music] and let's go i just want to show you how 
simple it is and just pasted it in a bit better   okay let's try this again now we 
have my api token in there enter   all right and this now makes available the ability 
to receive the result of the data collection so   let's go ahead and do that copy once again i'm 
just going to update it with my token first data set is not ready yet okay i'm 
getting a little too ahead of myself   let's try again in a few seconds in the me 
time let's go take a coffee break [music] let it be good okay you can go back to it now okay 
now we're back let's try this again   amazing look how cool that is 
so quickly you have received   all of the data it's amazing and there's 
so much you can do with this now all right   speaking of all we can do with this let's get 
into building a python project to utilize this   data now to turn a notification a desktop 
notification every time the price is under   300. okay you can see here i just created a new 
empty project called python desktop notification   next i'm going to open a new terminal here and 
i'm using python 3 so we need to initiate the   virtual environment and to do so i just copy 
and pasted in this command here click enter all right all right and you can see now we 
have this file that contains other folders   for the virtual environment i always forget the 
scripts you think after using python for many   years you remember it okay so i actually was in 
the wrong documentation but i'll link this down   below because it was really helpful for me 
when i was starting out in python and as you   can see i still use it if i forget commands it's 
essentially visual studio code documentation on   how to get python up and running it's so helpful 
regardless if you've been using python for a long   time or not if you forget anything so we did the 
virtual environment creation we just forgot to go   inside of it so let's do that now and now you can 
see we are inside the virtual environment so next   up we need to install some packages let's 
create a new file called main.pi to start   with and now let's start by importing requests 
import requests let's go pip install requests all right it is installed come on go away we 
installed you there we go and we also need to   install plier from notification and this is 
for to use a package to implement actually   notifying us or showing the notifications 
on our desktop pip install here we go   all right perfect so now just as we did we 
created that command in the terminal using   curl we're going to do the same thing but in 
our project here so first we need to define our   headers so this would include the content type and 
also to the token that we created in bright data one sec here all right so i jumped ahead a bit and just copied 
this code that i created i already did this   project and i'm redoing it of course to share 
with you okay so as you can see authorization   bear and then your token here content type 
this is a json then let's use this requests   so let's go response equals requests get and 
then we are going to use the url that was in here   to break data actually and copy this url here 
okay we're recording screen as you can see on my   screen here i am now getting the response printing 
out the data as you can see so i thought we'd do   something really fun here let's let's utilize 
let's harness chat gpt we always talk about it   and is it going to take over programmers jobs and 
all that why not test it out so what i'm going to   do actually is copy this code here and go into 
chat gpt you can see i've been playing around   with it already for this and i'm going to paste 
it in and i'm going to say what should we tell   it to do let's say use this code to write 
more code in python to get the prices for   prices for each object and notify the user when 
it is under 300 go 300. i don't know this might   not be word in the best way but this is really 
fun just to see what it does okay we're going [music] all right that's good it's doing pretty good prices for item and data a pen item this 
looks really good like scarily good are   we out of a job no i think you know even to go 
through this part and get this code back which   i just did you need to understand exactly as 
to what you are typing in how to utilize it   what does this code do and it does tell you that 
but there definitely is need for the human touch   still so let's give this a try just for fun 
here copy code [music] so it's looping over   each item in data and then appending the item 
to price all right this is good and then let's   go over here for price and prices if price is 
under 300 let's use the notification employer let's open up our terminal a bit and let's see what happens when we run this oh you know what i was getting this error 
before so type error list must be integers   or slices not strings so right now we're getting 
a string back okay so i'm not going to show you   in this video but i was getting this error 
before and i literally that's how i started   playing around with chat gpt i was sharing 
with chat gpt this error and finding other   ways to resolve this so i'm going to actually 
update this code to the way that i resolved   it so you know why it was causing that error 
is because i wasn't using data so as you can   see here i'm actually not using data at all 
so i can get rid of this and now we can see   we are going through looping over the response 
in json format which then now should work so as   you can see here using notification in the from 
plier you can add in title message app icon and   for this case it's not under 200 it's under 300. 
now let's run this and it should work no usable no module oh yes we need to install this i got 
this as well no module so let's go pip install   so this is another module within plier now let's 
try again we're gonna get this one time [music]   my friends okay i'm back in a different location 
this is tiffany coming from the future and the   reason being is when i was going through this 
video and working on it i thought you know what   this is something that i really want to use on 
an ongoing basis on a daily basis i want to get   these notifications every day so i decided to 
use ap scheduler and we'll go through the code   here essentially it is a python module that will 
allow your python library that will allow you to   schedule when the code executes so this could 
be on a daily basis this could be on a monthly   whatever the case may be now you have to keep 
your application running for this to executive   course but it's still but it's super interesting 
and it's very simple i've never scheduled a job   to run on an ongoing basis before for one 
of these projects so i was really excited   to play around with it so let's dive into it 
to make us get this notification if there is   an iphone that is under a certain price every 
single day and you can see how handy this is   for various projects actually i use this library 
on new year's when it was at 12 a.m i scheduled   because i would be sleeping i was a very i had a 
very quiet new years and i knew i'd be sleeping   so i scheduled that at midnight for text messages 
to go out i use twilio and this library here for   text messages to go out saying happy new year 
so there's so many different things you can   use with this library that let's dive into it 
for this project and it's just a great tool to   use for various projects so okay enough of me 
talking let's get back into it okay so as you   can see here i added in ap scheduler now let's 
go and install that so pip install ap scheduler go oh come on all right perfect okay i also 
imported pits pipes pits i'm not 100 sure but   essentially what this is is it will be a python 
library that we can use to define date and time   so with blocking scheduler it automatically is 
set to utc time i'm in eastern time so i want   to set it to my time zone is why i imported 
it now if we scroll down let's initiate this   function here so let's call or say scheduler 
equals blocking scheduler then what we will do   is on top of our for loop here let's create a 
function called it's called send notification   you can't spell today what is new that's 
the story of my life all right and then here let's also choose we're going to use 
uh pits so let's go time zone equals   hits and then get the time zone and we are 
setting it to for me anyways i am setting it   to us eastern you can read the documentation 
if you're sending it to something else   all right there we go it is mad about us 
don't need to be mad go we're not mad anymore   not gonna lie i'm a javascript script girl 
i feel like python with its indentations   all right so now let's actually 
schedule the function to run daily so   scheduler dot add job you can see we have 
some different options here we are going   to do send notification which we created up 
here and for this it's going to be a cron job i'm telling you if you could count 
how many times i mess up my spelling   if i give you a dollar for each one we'd be 
you'd be rich all right day of the week we're   gonna set the day of the week let's should we 
set the day a week what do you want every day   we want every day let's just do every day but 
if you want you could do day of the week like   i just did to get specific days all right now 
let's do our we want it to be 10. i'm gonna do a   minute two because i set it for 10 but now it's 
1004 so let's do 10 of 6. companies like that i   gotta double check i think it's like that 
then time zone will be tz that we just set all right minute let me double check that this is 
how to do a minute give me a sec here okay so yes   this is how you do minute let's quickly change to 
eight save and i already started running this and   as i mentioned you have to keep this running so 
let's see well you can't see the time but it's   1007 right now so let's give this a minute and 
let's see if the notification pops up i know it   did because it already did for 1007. for some 
reason the notifications are giving me grief   when i'm using quicktime so be curious to see if 
it actually shows up because last time i had to   insert a screenshot of it i don't know why it's 
uh kicking the notifications away with quicktime   because that's what i'm using to record my screen 
but okay it's 1008 come on notification are you   gonna appear i don't know why it doesn't appear 
with quicktime anyways i'll insert a screenshot   here because it will work on your computer it does 
work on mine it's just for some reason with   quicktime it won't appear anyways okay we were 
able to make that within a few minutes so imagine   using bright data in a larger application or at 
work hint if you want to stand out to your   bosses i would definitely suggest you share with 
them about bright data but i also want to share   with you other things it has to offer so right 
now as you can see i'm in proxy manager and this   is a great way an advanced open source tool to 
really help speed up development time and manage   any proxy operations so there's a few features 
that i want to highlight here from live preview of   the whole traffic logs and statistics ip rotation 
session management it's just incredible and it's   all in one platform so also too they have a chrome 
extension different api and integrations and then   of course where i was in the data collection 
platform so bright data has a range of options   that you can utilize all within your company 
or if you are building your own product okay   i don't know about you but that was really fun 
to do and it's literally something i'm going to   be using on a regular basis now to notify me for 
product updates especially for the iphone but as   i mentioned this can be used for any product 
and there are so many different templates to   choose from if you're wondering why i'm sitting on 
the floors because the camera keeps on dying and   we're just keeping it real and organic over here 
i linked bright data down below so make sure to go   sign up give them a checkout it's i i have so much 
fun playing around with them and just seeing all   the possibilities also too i will link this code 
down below so you can add on to this project build   it as well and if you haven't hit that subscribe 
button for more coding tech and career related   videos and it's boxing day here so i feel like 
i need to go eat some more treats bye everyone foreign [music]
