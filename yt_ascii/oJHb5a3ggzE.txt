and now for something completely different do you mind doing a a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great the powerful pewdiepie let's say 1 to 11 just go over a few documents print it out we can try let's try this i present to you document numero uno okay vladimi paler discovers marshmallows that's not bad so you get it because yes are you failing things yes i know three whatever oh that's not very good this is grounded in some engineering some history yeah give us an eight out of ten what do you think about nuclear power i'm in favor of nuclear power i think it's i in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters i think it's a nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity i don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations yeah but what about chernobyl exactly so [music] i think i think people there's like a lot of fear of radiation and stuff and it's i guess the problem is like a lot of people just don't underst they didn't study engineering or physics so they don't it's just the word radiation just sounds scary you know so they don't they ha they can't calibrate what radiation means but radiation is much less dangerous than than you'd think so like for example fukushima you know when the fukushima problem happened to the tsunami the i got people in california asking me if they should worry about radiation from fukushima i'm like definitely not not even slightly not at all that is crazy and just to show like look this is how like the dangers is so much overplayed compared to what what it really is that i actually flew to fukushima and i actually i donated a a solar power system for water treatment plant and and and i made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on tv in fukushima like i'm still alive okay so it's not even at the risk of these events is low but the impact of them is impact is greatly exaggerated it's it's just human nature it's people people don't know what radiation is like i've had people ask me like what about radiation from cell phones according to causing brain cancer i'm like when you say radiation do you mean photons or particles then like that i don't know what what do you mean protons particles so do you mean let's say photons what what frequency or wavelength and they're like no i have no idea like do you know that everything's radiating all the time like what do you mean like yeah everything's radiating all the time photons are being emitted by all objects all the time basically so and if you want to know what it's it's what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire go outside the sun is a gigantic you know thermonuclear reactor that you're staring right at it are you still alive yes okay amazing yeah i guess radiation is one of the words that can be used as a tool to to fear monger by certain people that's it and i think people just don't understand so that's the way to fight that that fear i suppose is to understand this to learn yeah just say like okay how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents it's like practically nothing and say how many people have died from you know coal plants and it's a very big number so like obviously we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants just doesn't make any sense at all coal plants like i don't know 100 to a thousand times worse for for health than nuclear power plants you want to go to the next one it's really bad it's that 90'0 and 360 degrees everybody loves the math nobody gives a shit about 270. it's not super funny yeah i don't like two or three yeah this is not a you know lol situation [laughter] that was pretty good the united states oscillating between establishing and destroying dictatorships it's like a metro is that a match yeah yeah yeah it's a on a 7 out of 10. it's kind of true oh yeah this is this is kind of personal for me next one oh man this is leica yeah well no is this or it's like referring to like or something as like as like a husband husband yeah yeah hello yes this is dog your wife was launched into space and then the last one is him with his eyes closed and a bottle of vodka yeah like it didn't come back no they don't tell you the full story of you know what what the love the impact they had in the loved ones yeah true that one gets an 11 for me oh yeah it just keeps going on the russian theme first man in space nobody cares first man on the moon well i think people do care no i know but there is uruguay gardens names will will be forever in history i think there is something special about placing like stepping foot onto another totally foreign land it's it's not the journey like people that explored the oceans it's not as important to explore the oceans is to land on a whole new continent yeah this is about you oh yeah i'd love to get your comment on this elon musk after sending 6.6 billion dollars to the u.n to end world hunger you have three hours you know i mean obviously 6 billion is not going to end well to hunger so so i mean the reality is at this point the world is producing far more food than it can really consume like we don't have a caloric constraint to this point so where there is hunger it is almost always due to it's like like civil war or strife or some like it's it's not a thing that is it's extremely rare for it to be just a matter of like like lack of money it's like you know it's like some there's a civil war in some some country and and like one part of the country's literally trying to starve the other part of the country so it's much more complex than something that money could solve it's politics geopolitics it's it's a lot of things it's human nature it's governments it's monies monetary systems all that kind of stuff yeah food is extremely cheap these days it's like it's i mean the u.s at this point you know among low-income families obesity is actually another problem it's not like obviously it's not hunger it's it's like too much you know too many calories so it's not that nobody's hungry hungry anywhere it's just it's just this is not not a simple matter of adding money and solving it what do you think that one gets just kidding two this is going after empires world where did you get those artifacts the british museum shout out to monty python we found them yeah the british museum is it's pretty great i mean yeah it admittedly britain did take these historical artifacts from all around the world and put them in london but you know it it's not like people can't go see them so it is like a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is is london for you know for a large segment of the world so i think you know on balance the british museum is a net good although i'm sure a lot of countries argue about that yeah it's like you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as possible and the british museum i think does a good job of that even if there's a darker aspect to like the history of empire in general whatever the empire is however things were done this it is the history that happened you can't sort of erase that history unfortunately you could just become better in the future that's the point yeah i mean it's like well how how are we gonna pass moral judgment on these these things like it's like if you you know if one is going to judge say the russian empire you've got to judge you know what everyone was doing at the time and how were the british relative to everyone and i think they would brush would actually get like a relatively good grade relatively good grade not in absolute terms but compared to what everyone else was doing they were not the worst like i said you gotta look at these things in the context of the history at the time and say what what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against yes and i'd i do not think it would be the case that britain would get a a bad grade in in when looking at history at the time you know if you judge history from you know from what is morally acceptable today you basically are going to give everyone a failing grade yeah i'm not clear it's not i don't think anyone would get a passing grade in in their morality of like you go back 300 years ago like who's getting a passing grade basically no one and we might not get a passing grade from generations but they come after us what does that one get sure success seven for the monty python maybe i always love magic python they're great michael bryan and the quest of holy grail are incredible yeah yeah yeah those serious eyebrows impressions like you know how important is facial hair to great leadership well you got a new haircut is that is that is this how does that affect your leadership i don't know hopefully not it doesn't yeah the second is no one there is no one competing with friends i have no one too those are like epic eyebrows so sure that's ridiculous six or seven i don't know i like this like shakespearean analysis of memes he had a flair for drama as well like you know showmanship yeah yeah it must come from the eyebrows all right invention great engineering look what i invented yeah that's the best thing since ripped up bread yeah cause they invented they're just sliced bread am i just explaining memes at this point this is what my life has become a meme like you know like a scribe that like runs around with the kings and just like writes down memes i mean when was a cheeseburger invented that's like an epic invention yeah like like wow you know that was versus just like a burger or a burger i guess a burger in general it's like you know then there's like what is a burger what's what's a sandwich and then you start getting it's a pizza sandwich and what is the original it's it's it gets into an ontology argument yeah but everybody knows like if you order like a burger or cheeseburger whatever you like you get like you know tomato and some lettuce and onions and whatever and you know mayor and ketchup and mustard it's like epic yeah but i'm sure they've had bread and meat separately for a long time and it was kind of a burger on the same plate but somebody who actually combined them into the same thing and yeah you bite it and hold it make makes it convenient it's a materials problem like your hands don't get dirty and whatever yeah it's brilliant well that is not what i would have guessed but everyone knows like you you like if you order a cheeseburger you know what you're getting you know it's not like some obtuse like i wonder what i'll get you know you know fries are i mean great i mean they're the devil but fries are awesome and yeah pizza is incredible food innovation doesn't get enough love yeah i guess is what we're getting at it's great what about the matthew mcconaughey austinite here president kennedy do you know how to put men on the moon yet nasa no president kennedy be a lot cooler if you did pretty much sure six six or seven i suppose it's the last one that's funny someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls sistine chapel boys bathroom sure i'll give it nine it's super it's really true all right this is our highest ranking meme for today i mean it's true like how do they get away with that lots of nakedness i mean dick pics are i mean just something throughout history as long as people can draw things there's been a dick pic it's a staple of human history it's a staple consistent throughout human history you
