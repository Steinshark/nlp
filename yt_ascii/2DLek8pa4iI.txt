alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman coined the phrase a rational exuberance to describe a phenomenon where investors were pumping the price of the market with little regard to actual underlying fundamentals fast forward three decades or so we've reached new levels of speculation meme coins are worth more than entire car companies a car company who loses money is worth more than all the other car companies who make money combined and yet alan greenspan said only a few years ago that he sees no irrational exuberance in today's market you foresaw what was to occur in markets long before it actually happened when you said irrational exuberance mr chairman do you see similarities between today's market and what you saw back in the late 90s very little well there you have it guys no irrational exuberance i agree with chairman greenbacks this isn't irrational it's complete insanity you guys are absolutely killing it this is what i'm talking about i stopped checking my truck's wallet man going you guys are insane no we aren't insane you're insane that's tick-tock sort of the millennial version of the bloomberg terminal in this walking panic attack he's talking about something called safe mode a cryptocurrency that bills itself is safely trying to get you to the moon for anyone over 45 years old by the way to the moon is slang for like your investment made a lot of money now this cryptocurrency launched a little over a month ago but it's already worth more than a billion dollars in its market cap actually i think at its peak it was worth six billion dollars but don't worry guys it's not a bubble now in this video i'm going to be addressing the newest in a long line of meme coins like dogecoin but they're a lot more like safe moon that have popped up and similar coins like hogecoin there's safe mars safe galaxy safe star safe anything cosmic okay just know that and just assume i'm applying this analysis to all of them because one they're gonna come and go but the scheme is the same forever because yes they're all slightly different but their destiny is the same and i'm gonna try to tell you why hola mi gente and welcome back to the channel this is sean what's good what's good and welcome back to investing with jax welcome back everybody to a safe moon price update on this video we are going to talk about dogecoin and we're also going to talk about safe moon all right moon boys listen i know you guys are in the crypto space and it's the wolf here jb you know i'm bullish on crypto these days i used to be a bear now i'm a bull ah yes what could be wrong with taking the advice of a convicted felon who got in trouble for yes hyping garbage but i think we all agree when jordan belfort starts shilling it you know it's bad now all these tokens we're going to be discussing today are kind of colloquially called meme tokens they're structured not to be useful necessarily as a currency but rather to maximize something called pumpamentals papamentals are the feature of a coin to generate hype virality buzz with little regard to the usefulness of the coin buzz for its own sake the reason you name a coin after a meme it's just a joke it's to attract the hype which is why rather than having a white paper which is actually about something the whole project is built around things like to the moon or becoming millionaires or more specifically in the case of safe moon one of the things they did was the first things by the way was confirmed a dogecoin trading pair because what better way to pump a new meme coin with an older meme coin and then later in their white paper they talk about begin architecting the nft exchange as well as video game integrations like there's no real good reason for video game integrations and nft exchanges as your first move as a currency unless it's a publicity stunt a gimmick to attract hype for its own sake now another common pump of mental technique is minting trillions of tokens to keep your token below one cent psychologically this makes people feel like it's affordable and easy to own whereas most people feel like one bitcoin might be way outside their budget what's a hundred million times zero again i forgot the other factor here is that it gets people thinking about oh my gosh what if it hits a penny are you guys so this is safe moon safe moon check it out look at this current price right now all right so let's say you invest only like 30 right so you take that 30 times the current value of this coin right now and you get about roughly 19 million coins so let's say this thing goes up to about just one cent your potential almost 200 thousand dollars now what this tick tock man doesn't tell you is that in order for safe moon to reach one penny that would make the market cap of safe moon six trillion dollars triple the entire crypto market so what sounds like super simple would break crypto now the other papa mentals are things like they all say they're deflationary currencies they're burning tokens a rug pull is impossible there's no way you possibly could get gypped off by this coin guys but one thing these all have in common is that the only goal of the crypto project is literally just to make the price go up literally in the name safe moon it's like it's telling you it's a scam look what do all get rich quick schemes do they all say two things they say i'm gonna get you rich and this is definitely not a scam that's what all scams have in common i'll get you rich fast and it's not a scam and safe mood is literally telling you both of those things in one name it's genius like like they're like we'll get you safely to the moon don't worry this rocket will not explode we safe are to the moon imagine for a second like the us dollar the only reason people bought it was literally just because everyone was hyping the fact that if enough of us bought dollars the value would go up instead of like actually to buy things and the whole value of the asset is the price goes up isn't that a ponzi scheme i mean literally your whole thing is like i gotta get as many people in otherwise i'm gonna lose money if i don't get more people in i can't get my money out that's the whole thing nothing actually behind it and at the end of the day all these cryptos have more in common than differences which is why i wanted to address them all at the same time like they quibble about our development team is you know more open and they give amas some are literal rug pulls right some are just moon shots but all of them have one thing in common they're all just trying to get the price to the moon it's a giant gamble there's nothing serious about it if you're doing it to gamble i have no problem with you but as you're putting a thousand dollars into safe moon ask yourself would you put a thousand dollars in the lottery tickets if that's the kind of person you are fine go with god but you know a lot of people wouldn't do that but they feel totally fine and like they're they're missing out if they're not doing that with safe moon but okay look you're sitting there and maybe some of you still aren't convinced so let me try one last ditch effort to try to convince you that maybe this is gambling and maybe a bad gamble there's no rule right that when people are talking about something it's over when your grandma starts talking about bitcoin is it such a good buy probably not right when everyone talks about something the chances are the opportunity's mostly over so look at the people who are talking about safe moon hyping it to the moon right and ask yourself is this a bubble jake paul lance stewart ben phillips you know icons of financial advice okay they don't understand just let him go dude how funny would it be if that's what convinced people they're like hey a coin that launched a month ago being worth a billion dollars i wasn't on board with it being a scam but now that i know jake paul is involved i'm out what if that's what got him like literally jake paul being involved you're like well i was in till that moment he got me there i hope you enjoyed the video diving into these cryptos is fun for me let me know if you get anything out of it am i preaching to the choir here is everyone who like actually likes these things like no no no no no like fud foot foot either way whether you're invested in dogecoin safe moon meme coins whatever there's one coin one stock you can always pump costs nothing pump zilla guys to the moon like and subscribe it's free respect the pup and i'll see you guys in the next one i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
