alireza fieruja and will magnus carlson make a comeback we've got all eyes on him this was an absolutely insane round with some absurd games and openings and before we jump into the recap i want to thank the sponsor of today's video babble babble is one of the top language learning apps in the world and chess is one of the top board games in the world so it's a perfect match personally i love

usage as well yeah my pronunciation's not great but with babel i'm sure it will get there so you should get started with babel today folks you know how this works click the link in the description or scan the qr code to get 60 off your babel subscription all right let's get back to the video as always a big thank you and shout out to my partner in crime sponsored gotham my friends it's magnus carlson versus ali raza fieruja this is the world championship that could have been as magnus famously said that if alireza ferrugia were to have won the candidates tournament magnus would have considered sticking around e4 from magnus c5 the sicilian defense the most combative opening knight f3 the most combative response white is ready to play the move d4 will alireza play knight c6 or d6 e6 all right oliver is a clearly looking to play a taimanov with knight to c6 or potentially asics something happens here our recap is gonna get interesting on move number three because in this position magnus carlson did not play the move d4 he did not play the move knight c3 he did not play the move b3 he did not play the move g3 he did not play c4 in this position magnus carlson played bishop to d3 let me tell you something right now if any of you played the move bishop to d3 in this position i would call the police i would call the police to arrest you all right if you had an older sibling i would give them permission to throw you across a room that is a terrible move for most players you see bishop d3 is ridiculous it breaks every principle in chess you're gonna have to move that bishop a second time you are blocking your center upon your bishop has absolutely no scope in the position magnus plays it because he knows that at the very worst he's gonna get an equal position white has given up all chances for the advantage at the very best ali reza will respond in a very aggressive way like his playing style ali reza will now no longer be in any sort of comfort zone and ali rosa will lose knight c6 castles and magnus's concerns are very quickly justified as in this position alireza plays the move g5 my friends ali reza and magnus are sitting front row on a roller coaster with loosely fastened seat belts there's the they're not gonna fall out but they might throw up here we go only recipes g5 with the very clear intention of playing the move g4 now magnus plays bishop b5 i mean this is just utterly ridiculous this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen and the fact that he is you know what you know what fine let him get away with it he is the best player in the world he's been the best player for over a decade what is this bishop d3 bishop b5 business there are children watching when magnus leaves the playing hall he's gonna sign autographs for five-year-olds you'll think those five-year-olds are supposed to be playing bishop d3 bishop b5 do you think that shut up you don't think that bishop b5 and magnus plays take take this this man played bishop d3 bishop b5 and he took the knight half of his first six moves were played with the bishop and it's not even there anymore d3 you trade your light squared bishop you should put pawns on light squares that pawn is hanging magnus inviting the pawn in g4 by the way you will notice look at the time spent on these moves eight minutes to move the bishop again another five to capture another 11 to play pawn to d3 this is fascinating stuff i gotta tell you this is this is dank stuff g4 the knight goes back to d2 because it wants to go to b3 and target the pawn on c5 i'll leave bro this is this man's not stopping ali raza can play d6 d5 he can develop his knight those moves are not that good because the pawn is hanging but i'm just saying this man plays h5 what this looks like two six hundreds had some brownies and are now playing chess against each other okay i mean i just don't unders i i don't i don't what even what knight b3 and magnus plays f4 he plays f4 because if ali reza plays on passong queen f3 threatens queen f7 if alireza does not play then well magnus is gonna have good attacking possibilities and his f file will be open and now liverzo might be living in france but actually contrary to popular belief just because you live in france doesn't mean you have to play on person plays knight e7 and so far my friends everything has been looking pretty good for white now magnus plays bishop d2 listen man this dude hangs upon magnus played bishop b bishop d2 because it's disrespectful he could have played here or here or knight c3 or knight d2 knight c4 or maybe c3 this man plays bishop d2 for one reason because it's disrespectful that's that's it that's why he played the move and also he might have thought it was the best move the idea of the move is twofold first of all bishop c3 okay so for example a5 bishop c3 bishop c3 knight c3 you just want to get rid of black's bishop second of all if black plays bishop b2 he's gonna go bishop a5 attacking the queen and then he's gonna go here and he's sacrificing the rook and it is way too dangerous to take this for black white not only attacks the rook back if black goes here white now plays queen f6 e5 and white is dominating knight c4 knight e4 knight d6 knight f6 knight c5 knight d7 so for that reason alireza now has to go home but ali rosa won a pawn magnus his whole little game plan here costs some pawn and now he plays queen e1 and rook d1 and ali reza plays f5 i mean this is one of the most absurd games of chess i have ever seen two super grand masters play the average rating my friends of this game is something like 2810 the average rating these are these are two of the top four rated players on planet earth what even is this position all right you got bishops firing away into you know you got the bishop over here you got the insane pawn cluster one guy's king is probably not going to be happy castling on either side of the board e5 now is trying to knock on the door it looks like black's position is on the verge of collapse he plays knight g6 he plays knight g6 because if you take on d6 black just goes here can magnus play knight c4 probably he probably should go for this but instead he goes knight c4 right away and that gives alirez a time to play take take and d5 ali raza is just giving up the pawn on c5 this is a necessary defensive measure to slide his queen back how could a man have four of his six most important pieces completely on the back rank after 20 moves and not be worse i don't know i told you nothing about this game makes sense it looks like white should just be completely winning but black's position is shockingly resilient and he castles not only does he castle he begins consolidating and counter-attacking his pieces here are doing literally when i say literally i am not exaggerating they are doing nothing they are doing nothing nothing you could just play g3 they are doing nothing and somehow alireza is not worse and in this position ali reza had to play the move c5 giving back the pawn to open up the c file and queen c4 alireza doesn't do that magnus now consolidates and now magnus is back in business this is a vintage position for magnus to go to work ali raza is going to is going to suffer knight d4 rook doubling on the open only file in the game magnus's knight on d4 is going to see three different pawns that it can target at any moment and as i said a long time ago these pieces are doing nothing this piece is doing nothing that piece is doing nothing this is magnus's position to win 94 look at ferocious pieces just standing around like absolute bozos okay he plays h4 okay and so what a5 magnus methodically that's it there's nothing there absolutely nothing there ali reza here does something which is one of the only ways to save a losing position he creates confusion if only reza sits back and defends himself he will lose so he sacrifices a bishop sacrifices a bishop infiltrates with the knight forces a retreat from magnus and now we have the following position rook h7 alirez has got pawns a knight and rook and he's coming down magnus unafraid unafraid grabs the pawn for free magnus is gonna come back or go forward and push the c pawn and the game is over alireza is still creating confusion he's still creating confusion because if you play something like rook takes a4 here comes rook h3 and then here comes king g7 rook h8 wait a minute that looks kind of scary so here magnus sacks the rook and now we have the following position where did magnus's advantage go well as it turns out sacrificing the rook was actually unnecessary and a move like rook h1 or 97 check could have been a little bit better magnus goes here and just assumes that you know this position is a winning end game and he gets the pawn to c7 and naturally that looks like it should win but somehow ali res is knocking on the door and i got news for you magnus goes knight c6 rook h2 alireza goes here the rook is gonna stop the pawn the rook is gonna stop the pawn and both rooks are going to harass the king knight d8 king g6 ferocious saving the game not only is this man saving the game magnus might get mated rook f3 takes takes oh my goodness and the rook is stopping promotion and if in this position you play bishop c5 i have f2 f1 as a check queen queen but i got news for you i'm mating you i am checkmating your king king g3 and in this position ali raza could have continued the game with f2 and if magnus had played something like knight c5 white can play f1 knight and mate but you can go king g2 and hold the game but instead of all of that alireza ferruja repeated moves and made a draw now my friends charles not over we're gonna see another magnus game don't go anywhere just yet ali reza fieruja was busted in this game it was plus one and a half magnus doesn't let advantages like this go and ali reza swarms in with a bishop sacrifice trades the queens activates the knight activates the rook and gets magnus shook magnus had to just pause here and go i'm up a piece i gotta chill out but it's not that simple rook h3 is coming at four is coming the computer actually wants you to sack the knight back now we have an armageddon to play my friends oh my goodness magnus in this game went completely galaxy brain played bishop to d3 which is utter just insanity but it doesn't work and now in this game we have e45 10 minutes for white 7 minutes for black alireza ferrugia plays a petrov take take bishop d3 magnus is a man of memes he played bishop d3 in one game he's gonna play bishop d3 in the other game this man is a meme god putting the bishop in front of the d-pawn utter nonsense all right we have a totally symmetrical position this is it no rooks completely symmetrical pawn structure no e-pawns magnus plays d4 magnus plays c4 magnus plays knight c3 and brings out his queen and advances in the center and trades knights and centralizes his bishop and brings his rook and activates his knight on the queen side trying to play c5 and play c5 and plays knight takes c5 and attacks the queen counter-attacking measure ali has a place here now magnus blocks the rook and is gonna take the pawn on a7 and he's gonna drive his rook into the position completely suffocating all the black pieces he's gonna grab the bishop on d6 if you take his queen he's gonna take your queen right back takes queen c3 and now there are targets on e5 and c7 and a7 which would allow white to get a winning position to do the queen side pass pawn bishop b4 rook c7 bishop f1 alireza resigns he resigned because he's forked and if queen d5 there was take take rook d7 and this end game is lost how does he make it look so simple how does this man magnus meme lord extraordinaire put a bishop on d3 in two games that's the only reason he put the bishop on d3 do you understand that he didn't play bishop d3 because he thought it was a brilliant move he thought it was hilarious this man magnus is making content for mine and his youtube channels and hikarus and all the other people in the middle of the rounds this man is a content savon ridiculous magnus wins my friends many of you are going to depart now that you've seen the games of magnus but you shouldn't because there was memes galore like people losing games with one second on the clock i will now take you to the matchup between this is the armageddon game this game was decided by clock this was also an armageddon game this was also decided by clock two games where players lost on time d5 c5 hikaru takes the knight on f6 damaging the pawn structure and now replaces his pawns on the dark squared like a good positional player g3 bishop g2 castles look at all these beautiful dark squirt pawns with hikaru not having a dark scored bishop hikaru plays knight e1 and puts the knight in the center and puts the knight on f4 targeting the pawn on d5 we have bishop e4 bishop h3 bishop h6 all the bishops are staring at important pieces or squares bishop f3 and it is mummy yarov who is just marching down hikaru's pieces look at all this stuff sacrifices his bishop in comes the queen king f1 hikaru's king is on life support gasping for oxygen as all these pieces stare down rook to e8 chakra is about to absolutely brutalize this man hikaru plays knight d2 look at this battleship of pieces i mean this is terrible stuff here now shock plays bishop e2 queen e2 gallops out of the position with eyes on the queen with eyes on the night with eyes on the bishop the only move queen to g2 and now knight takes d4 shock on fire capturing all of hikaru's pieces as hikaru king stumbles around drunkenly in the middle of the night bishop g4 knight c2 is a fork but not only is this a fork this is a giga fork because not only do you fork the rook in the rookie you also fork the square which would be another fork have you ever seen a giga fork what's up tick tock what's up youtube shorts i know a lot of people are going to edit that so just want to say hello subscribe to gotham chess knight e3 check and it is my man chakra are mamaziar of calling the shots he is winning his armageddon game he's winning his armageddon game because normally a bishop and a knight are better than a rook but they're not better than a a rook when they have extra pawns a4 d4 check look at mommy gr of go rook d7 hey carlos king in the center of the board hikaru watched my video a long time ago on how to make a comeback in chess at the low elo and he knew it was just to run the king into the center of the board and that's exactly what he did king to g7 knight to e3 it's chakra asking questions of the position but hikaru playing quickly hikaru playing quickly making sure that shock doesn't have an easy game keeping pieces on the board chakra are down to below one minute b4 king f3 and we keep shuffling and now we have knight c3 and king e3 and hikaru's back to the center it's deadlocked can mommy dear have save this game with 20 seconds on the clock he plays g5 takes takes mamajarov has secured past pawns but maybe hikaru is going to secure some of his own takes takes a6 hikaru plays bishop c4 oh my goodness chakrai are still looking to hold the game will kikaru find a way to win it apparently in this position after bishop to c6 rook g4 and rook h4 and mummy jarvis broken in e3 check the king walks up f4 the pawns are coming down the board rook h2 attacks the knight the knight cannot easily move out of the way because the rook is going to stop the pawn and there is rook c2 check hikaru plays bishop f3 holding everything together pawn to a6 rook takes f3 the rook is traps the rook is trapped a7 rook f2 knight c3 and now the only move rook a2 sacrificing itself so that the epon queens plays it but loses the game because he lost on time put his rook on a2 and hit the clock but he did it too slowly and he loses the game on time and hikaru wins the armageddon unbelievable stuff utterly unbelievable oh my goodness hikaru wins in armageddon and this game was also decided by one second this is the armageddon game between fabiano caruana and d gukesh gukesh d aka tamaraju cash it's a spanish it's an anti-berlin take take remember white has three minutes extra but black has draw odds i have explained this in every single one of my recaps a4 it's a very close position it's a great position for white to have in an armageddon because black is down over three minutes and all the pieces are on the board to maneuver and oh my goodness fabiano is going to maneuver them here comes the knight to f5 the bishops get traded off the board it is queens it is rooks it is knights and it is a pressure position for fabi g3 the knight gets pushed back the rooks are gonna get traded and fabi has carte blanche he has queens and he has knights and he is going to try to grind this down into an end game king f2 not into an end game into a winning end game queen g4 knight f5 go cash is down to 19 seconds on the clock 2-1 53. now if you trade everything this is a draw this is not winnable because neither side is able to break through if you trade the knights as he does in the game only white can win because white's queen is very active and black's pawns are falling go cash is down one minute and 20 seconds it's over fabiano caruana is simply going to march up into the position and he is going to find a way to trade the queens or the pawns and he is going to win no he's not because it's a fortress you can't break in anymore and now they're both down to 10 seconds wait a minute what is going on in this game is fabi gonna throw oh my goodness fabi's winning there it is gives a check takes one oh bobby's thrown into a draw farmy's thrown into a draw despite being three pawns up an incredible counter-attacking measure from gukash a fantastic practical decision here in this position fabi had to give one more check first he had to give one more check first and then he had to give this check and then he had to take with check and then he would have gotten back like something like this and then he would have been winning he would have taken every single one of the pawns would check and even then this position is utterly ridiculous to try to win but he would have taken on b6 and he would have been winning but instead of that fabi has thrown a draw but gukesh throws it right back queen g6 check and now fabi has a way out queen f6 queen g5 he's looking for the way out now it's winning again bobby loses on time bobby plays queen d8 check and loses on time in this position black was threatening queen b1 check and it would have been a perpetual and that would have ended in a draw apparently the winning sequence is king h7 queen d7 let's say black goes back to where he is white plays queen b5 and after this you have king c3 and after this you have king to d2 if you have queen e1 in this position over here king goes here but fabi loses a game in armageddon with one second on the clock one man who made a comeback in this round was wesley so if you made it this far wesley so had the white pieces against nodier back abdul soturov it was a queen's gambit accepted it was a line where black takes the pawn and decides i ain't giving it back again we've had a crazy round if you're 21 minutes into this recap 24 minutes because we have the sponsor integration you are probably you're probably here to stay those other people left you're better than them tell me in the comments if you're still watching at the 22nd minute 24th wherever i mention this queen g6 look at this position nordyprick says i'm gonna take the money and i'm gonna run i am not giving you the pawn back you gave me the pawn in the early opening you had a chance to win it back you decided to take that pawn well now i'm not going to give you the pawn who could develop all the pieces you can do all of this all this good stuff we're gonna trade wesley that's what's gonna happen and then you're not gonna win this pawn back we're gonna trade and you're not gonna win the pawn back you could do this and then take on d4 that's great then i'm gonna go here and you're not gonna win the pawn back so wesley says okay who cares i never wanted the pawn back in the first place look at this i never wanted the pawn back in the first place know your back you're giving me the pawn back i'm gonna you know what maybe i will get the pump but i'm gonna get it on my terms i'm gonna get the pawn back on my terms i am not going to be a charity case i'm gonna take the pawn back and i'm gonna attack your queen what do you think you're gonna mate me there's a night guarding this puzzle you think you're gonna think this like the same night as guarding it bozo bishop d7 rook h6 bishop a4 the rook goes back to h5 now wesley says no job that was a really cute opening that you played where you thought you were gonna escape with the pawn up because now not only did i win my pawn back you're probably gonna lose this one and you are probably gonna lose that one and when i get in there i'm gonna take that one too and don't think i'm gonna leave your king alone either knight f6 rook a5 e5 knight jumps into the middle it's a cluster he takes the knight he takes the bishop i told you my friends a long time ago this will fall that will fall that will fall and then we are going to go for the king the outskirts of the village this the the sad little security on the outskirts of the village will be captured and then we will make a beeline for the king and while we're at it we will go and promote a couple of pawns maybe to two more rooks so we can massively disrespect our opponents rook c7 rook f7 pawn takes f6 and in this position if you take back i imagine wesley will go here so rook d8 king f1 and in this position not your back resigned he resigned because this is falling that's falling that's falling risky opening against wesley did not pay off and wesley gets a win in classical to boost himself up by three points my friends you know the drill at the end of the recaps we take a look at the standings and if you are still here you are incredible 14 and a half for fabiano caruana who today was cheated out of half a point not the chi is not cheap he lost on time in a winning position in the armageddon so instead of one and a half he gets one there was no cheating bobby has 14 and a half hikaru 12 and a half my man wesley so leaping up to ten and a half anish giri today beat arientarian classical chess he has 10 kukasha's 10. magnus has nine points magnus gotta win the next two games he is not mathematically eliminated from winning this tournament but pretty soon he might be mathematically eliminated from finishing in the top half somebody find the last time that magnus carlson did not finish in the top half of a tournament go go find it now get out of here
