ladies and gentlemen oh this is a water bottle excuse me [music] ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the elo if you're new to this series this is a series where i take my subscriber games while i'm live on twitch i analyze them without knowing their chest strength and then i try to estimate their chess elo and i compare it to chess.com's game review normally this series is extremely ridiculous and chaotic and stupid and bad and entertaining but in this episode we had some brilliant moves we had some extremely high quality chess you're going to learn you're going to laugh but of course it wouldn't be against the elo if we didn't have a circus also stay tuned for the later games in this video because you are not going to believe your eyes enjoy we are never going to get the same magic that we got last time we're never gonna get it and already the gotham sub plays an opening i do not support bishop to b5 97. this is called the kozio defense the kozio variation of the rue lopez i don't think anybody knew that who was participating in this game but you know just in case d3 is completely fine although in this opening you are supposed to play c3 and d4 like that is really what you're trying to do but this is fine bishop a4 obviously the idea is to do this this so you should not you should not take good okay castle okay it's still like ah okay all right yeah this is this is a wee bit ooga for me this is a bit weird i mean it's still fine now my friend should you trade the bishop or not is a very tough question i would say don't trade because your bishop is of a higher quality it's actually got but of course okay all right and now yeah b4 is triple digit stuff that or like very very very low four-digit stuff now the second that black castles white also castles very funny right like white plays great opening doesn't castle doesn't castle because the bishop was hanging doesn't castle doesn't castle trades the bishop chases the knight doesn't kill oh i got a castle right knight g6 is apparently a mistake yeah so opposite side counseling if any of you have the middle games master class your brain will just immediately be wired that is the whole point of taking my courses you don't have to take my courses to watch guest elo but your brain will just be like oh opposite side castling so what's a good move here that prepares an attack you want to play a4 b5 a lot of you would just go here i would like to take with a pawn though so you would play a4 but then you would hang the pawn so let's play rook b1 right there you go or like or knight d5 to defend that all right knight g5 is just not playing on the right side of the board excellent plan now this is also just not a good move because you remove the main defender and now with c6 there is knight b6 okay a4 b5 just go for an attack okay don't hate that move free pawn fantastic a4 b5 c4 b5 oh knight b6 okay so wow wow that's not you don't need to do that there's i mean you could just like go here or yeah or or triple triple triple all right so we're starting guess the elo okay they even know okay now i'm back to thinking it's quadruple the digits oh my god removing the defender look at this bishop takes knight queen c6 on the way wow why did you submit this game this is a very interesting question by the way there was pawn pawn b7 was was was brutal but okay very okay that was just i mean you just killed him i don't even wow i have a feeling it's a three three digit elo game or a very low like a thousand or something because again i i'm my theory is that this is a game submitted by a low rated player who wants you know who wants like to be hyped up and i mean the spanish right like lopez maybe 11 1200. black playing whatever on earth this is like night before is weird that's a weird move and then a3b4 is weird you know the tunnel vision not castling i'm gonna say 1100 that just seems like a safe guess i don't know if it seems like a safe guess to y'all it seems like a safe guess to me i i that's just what i think i mean it really let's see 1100 ish 813 blitz 800 wow damn soccer okay well his his username is 13.95 so you know he's playing the way he wants to play and what does chess.com think 1300 okay so i said 1100 chesscom thinks you're you're 1300 wow and yeah your opponent unfortunately got yeah white overpowered yeah white op s didn't need the didn't need the political views of the game review there and that's that's a little bit weird maybe you should get a bit more well-adjusted game review anyway that's a joke again guess the elo i guess the elo screen yes game two now that was that was a wow that was that was unbelievable i mean that might be that might have been the best game you've ever played i don't know why i had to sound a bit irish there uh okay game number two that was a that was a good start i mean my god that was a high level game of chess okay okay scandi take queen d5 scandy's one of the easiest openings to learn you can you can learn the scandinavian in 60 seconds it's basically put the queen here you develop your pieces and try to castle and if they try to go after your queen the second they start doing that you play c6 and you get away like that's that's literally it so good okay so black doesn't know what they're doing they don't know how to play this opening black you're not supposed to do that you're supposed to go here if white ever does this you make a getaway you put the pawns you put the bishop with the knight like that and then you castle okay c5 is not a huge mistake but it's just not a good move because you can play d5 wow holy moly we're off we're off to we're off to a good start today no we're not i take that back wow yeah this is not i mean you can't learn an opening like this and not know it past the third move fourth move but i think the fourth move i mean c5 e5 is crazy that is cr that is just that is the cleanest free pawn of all time i mean it's just that now you got a passer and you're a pawn up and you got knight c4 yeah i would stay aggressive right i would stay aggressive but i don't hate this move now a lesson for the beginners beginner chess lesson if you have not castled yet and you still need to move a bishop to castle but your opponent has castled always and i mean always be careful of this check so the best move here is probably bishop here because if you play bishop here you're probably gonna have to go back and if you block with this bishop your bishop is just going to be a target so bishop d3 rookie 8 and now one of these two moves this is a bit spooky because knight g4 the computer thinks it's fine because after knight g4 it's completely unafraid of this but for the beginners it's just good to have that in mind that doesn't happen that's i don't know what this even begins to do i would just play h3 queen c7 and this is called the fishing pole that's called the fishing pole and this is something that you can do if your opponent has castled but you have not so that when they take you have a rook this is not the fishing pole this is this is you falling off the boat with with the fishing rod this is not that's this is not a real thing this is not a real thing that now there is no actual attack whatsoever that's not that's just a free bishop okay yeah there is nothing here i mean if these two could do like a like a flipperoni jutsu then maybe yeah now black goes g6 and and white just traps the bishop yeah that and and wins it too wow both bishops died there that's incredible and and just knight e4 good i would fight back on the h file trade the rook queen gotta be trapped somehow yep rook h not check is good take the pawn what it what is this episode oh my god oh my god it's a little a little bit getting a little ooga now a little bit ooga but okay okay don't panic nice protect the king at all times go check very important move oh he found it wow wow that was weird that was that was a weird one like black played horribly white played what what is this episode y'all today y'all y'all stop messing around man y'all really just playing really good moves this was really nice took the center took the pawn castle defended your king called the bluff and just calmly trapped the bishop now black's best move here is to take and to try to do this and i mean as long as you don't panic just look where they have a check you know you can even bring the bishop back to g1 probably ah then there's queen h4 but maybe bishop f2 there's no queen nation there's no check no check we need us to leave yeah i'm i'm getting and then another very important lesson f3 very high level move very high level move understanding to defend this and right here a lot of people would freak out with all this coming they might try to block the king queen e5 is a nice and cerebral move and of course black blundered i'm gonna say like 1400. i think this is like a 13 1400 level game i really think so let's see 1680 [music] how was black that high rated what 1680 is ridiculous oh no nah i mean white played well but what yo black was smoking something i mean that is wow yeah white got 1750 credit black ford black was hot 14.50 hold up yo find me a 1450 on planet earth that plays e5 that's a crit was that a mouse slip i mean but this was also crazy just like losing the bit i mean my friends can i just say something can i y'all get me so tight bro can i say something real quick yo hold up hold up why are you starting a 15 minute game and ending the game with 17 minutes on the clock foreign what is wrong with you what is the matter with you this is why y'all never get better y'all want to play that fast play bullet play three minute you better be the world champion of blitz what the hell is the matter with you why are you giving yourself 15 minutes on the clock to have 17 minutes at the end i mean i i don't even know what to say i don't even know somebody just donated 15 and said my birthday is coming up should you ask your wife for chester courses yeah sure we're in the middle of recording do you see oh god he ended with nearly two minutes more on the clock guys this is why you don't get better this is why you don't get better because like what are you doing why oh my goodness yeah yeah ask ask her for a course ask her for ask her to get your course we used to have gifting we turned that off for now we're gonna offer a different alternative how much are the courses i'm not telling you it takes you 10 seconds to research that and as i always say if you can't be bothered to begin the research for a course you don't actually want the course i try to make you put in the work ah nice nice nice nice wow sensational stuff what do you send the games i don't know send them to your local post office d4 d5 c4 queen's gambit accepted okay e4 a lot of different stuff to play against this i would not play that if you're gonna play the queen's gambit accepted you i mean this is the only thing that's scary like you have to know what you're doing here the way you play this is you play e5 you don't play c5 you could play c5 but it's not the best move gotta strike back because then they lose their right to castle this is not a good move because they're gonna take the center and i don't think you're good enough to deal with this yep you're not okay but neither is white i mean like this is a this is queen's gambit 101. i mean yeah bishop c4 is okay thanks you could take that it's a very these positions always confuse intermediate players because they don't know like do they take do they just develop if you don't have to take you you don't you know you don't need to but taking is also okay as long as the queen's not causing you any harm now i would just go here in castle okay light f3 do i coach still absolutely not no i coach the internet now develop the rest of the pieces maybe v5 is interesting okay that's a little slow i get oh you're trying to go here aha well this is this is this is a crazy amount of tunnel vision i mean this is a crazy amount tunnel vision i mean this this is wild i mean like look at this come on i think black is struggling here because of the congestion and i don't blame you i would try to get your pieces out a different way like knight a6 night before try to lead with your pieces right c5 is hanging no it's definitely not hanging c4 is hanging but it's kind of not hanging because there's this there's like this stuff anyway bishop h7 and white goes here which is a bad move because if you follow the rules of checks captures and attacks in this position you will find the best move for black well we have a sale in it i'm trying to record guess the elo i i mean listen i love y'all but like you're just feeling are we gonna have a sale gotham is there gonna be a sale on the court gotham earth to gotham stop the recording is there going to be okay just let me finish it i you know it's not that important for me to address that at this very moment probably will be you know i would i you know are we gonna have a i probably let me finish we're analyzing we're doing guess the elo here you know see that's what i like about youtube they just watch they can't interrupt why are the courses 300 bro let's do this on another website entirely that dude is on a different website course is 300 if you follow the philosophy of checks captures attacks you'll realize you'll realize that there are no checks there are no captures that make sense but attacks right bishop is trapped okay you're down two pawns you're starting your own attack i lie like this i don't hate it now white should probably trade the queens trade the queens okay now you're gonna see look how easy the game is once your pieces start flowing knight e5 oh that's pretty wild he sacrificed the rook wow i mean it doesn't work but it's the thought that counts the idea is this and then that that that now unfortunately white gets moves too so he can play like queen d3 you know queen d4 she could play queen d3 queen diva queen g4 by the way hits this and this good queen g4 or queen d4 check great move take the knight wow yep oh you are never winning this we need seven d7 [music] easy that's all right white's gonna win queen f4 queen h4 now the craziest part is this is still losing the craziest part is this is still losing even if you lose the the rook if the king just went to g1 it's just d8 queen you lost the queen you lost the rook you're still winning oh man that's how bad your position was bud oh man all right shaq now let's just not blunder a checkmate king just runs to safety don't run forward all right you're fine don't stop running for thank you yo yo yo go to stop and just hide oh my god he hung that oh [music] credit to the gotham subscriber for not resigning but oh dear lord oh god oh my that was incredible dude was losing the whole time literally just the whole he was black was losing for 56 moves but one in 57. i don't even know what the elo is man that was crazy i got i have no idea i mean i still think that a good amount of control was demonstrated i mean it's got to be like a thousand right gotta be like a i mean this was this was creative i mean a 1000 would not find that no yeah i'm thinking a bit higher maybe oh one more thing queen a4 check would not be played by anybody below like 1500. 1500 don't even know queen's community so i'm gonna say like i'm gonna say like 1600 like 15 1600. that's my guess let's see ah this time i was wrong one thousand damn no no no no no hey hey i straight up thought everybody thus far was good these guys happen to be lower rated nothing i can do about that also guys why are you mad all right it doesn't matter if you're 1600 or a thousand y'all all garbage anyway man y'all all play like this too stop it that's offensive have you seen some of the games that have been submitted talking about offensive crazy all right gotham sub all right scotch scotch declined okay taking queen trade takes the night okay this is either like an'00 who's damaging the pawn structure of the opponent or this is like a 800 who's just taking pieces okay castles okay typical 900 level play wow defending the oh this is this is a lot of information right this is four digits right here for sure wow look at that bring the rook to the center oh the other night is going maybe c4 oh i like that and then and then okay rook f2 will give a lot of information rook f2 rook d2 is like a 1500 level maneuver if you play rookie one you're like 11 1200. b3 c4 oh oh damn now i'm kind of back thinking this might be a 1500 oh good light square setup and now this is a backwards pawn oh now maybe knight f2 and double the rooks how we doing no no that's not no what are you doing stop what is black doing what is oh rook d6 oh oh he snuck it through g4 was completely idiotic but black just let the pawn go black never took black just never took the pawn back what what is rook b7 what is that that's a crazy move oh i guess this is the idea but for some reason they just look staged i mean the opening was sophisticated damaging the structure good play i told you this f3 move replacing the knight anticipating that the knight would be hit right that's an anticipating move if this h6 you're gonna lose the pawn probably is what white thought yeah knight g5 f3 is wild i'm thinking 1300. i i'm thinking 12 1300 with some with some stupidity toward the end but let's see 1500 wow even higher oh and i realized i never did this for the last game for the last game when i said 1600. so let me let me see what what what what does chess.com think of the last game the thing is chess.com is going to give an estimate close to their ratings right it said they were both 1100. 93 by white 2200 estimate wow'00 now well done wow wow impressive stuff that was a good game yeah i didn't think it was any higher like i didn't think it was 50 see you know like this is a 1600 level game and you guys are like don't install the 1600s why did the 1600 play rook b7 and just allow the pawn to become a queen i don't right like that strange strange stuff rook t6 was definitely nice yes that was definitely nice okay last game very nice little little calm guess the yellow episode this time all right knight f6 have i ever missed the tactic never in my life benoni wow 2 000 minimum wow this is way too professional h3 to play knight f3 to prevent the pin h3 is not a great move but it i mean it makes sense wow what can somebody hang something queen c7 is a very bad move why knight b5 okay yeah hanging queen c7 is is good information it's probably like 1500 and below i mean you just can't yeah that's like a knight b5 is a very natural thing to spot people love these these night jumps b3 this should be two wait a minute my brain my brain was like oh black castle my my brain didn't realize they count so long what why holy just got so short what the heck for what yeah king b8 but now knight b5 now you're just inviting problems now white is gonna take an oh god rook c1 oh this is you got no attack of your own where are you attacked who are you trying to attack oh you're gonna lose your queen you're gonna lose your queen you're gonna leave a3 bishop b5 bishop b1 you're gonna lose your queen oh you're gonna lose your queen you're gonna lose your queen okay you're not gonna lose your queen anymore a move ago you might have lost your queen yeah now now it's manageable but i think you're gonna lose something oh this is just so oh now you're pinned ah the bishop gun is actually a very welcome sight but it's still better for white because the knight is so much better than the bishop unless you hang a rook yeah unless you hang a rook and you're i mean knight b5 was not just like okay good defense good defense better offense but not actually in this case rook c8 oh they're untangling oh [music] oh check check queen c4 and apparently queen f1 was winning i like this wow look at this unstoppable force meets an immovable object queen beef oh that's nice apparently oh you had queen b5 and knight d6 that's very difficult oh my god wow queen e4 looking for the oh that's it now black's winning white just resigned white resigned here okay very decent opening very decent opening like but knight b5 and i mean just some really bone-headed decisions here like knight b5 is crazy you cannot allow that but black was good i mean black got into a very stupid situation and then just defended you know unpinning bringing the second rook like you know you have to understand the best move for black in this position is to bring the second rook this is wrong because technically you're like losing pawns here but and then and then just you know being cerebral just defending the right way and everything that that was a that was a decent game of chess that was a really decent i mean but still like how how low rated do you have to be to allow knight b5 because black could have easily lost this game a hundred times queen a6 back right bringing the queen backwards bringing the knight backwards playing this bringing the rook man like a lot of decent like bishop there but i have to think was any of this that complicated right was any of this really that complicated queen before you know trying to trade the queen it was all very kind of close combat then when in doubt you just started shoving all your pawns forward i mean was this brilliant or an accident brilliant or an accident i must say like i'm gonna go i'm gonna say 17'00. i was a 17'00 but allowing knight b5 which is it would a 17'00 allow knight b5 would a 17'00 survive that long 13.50 final answer 13.50 am i right 2200 versus 2191 . blitz not even bullet no [music] no no oh no no no no no oh god i oh oh god i thought i mean i really thought 17'00 but i just didn't think i just didn't think that that the 21 oh god oh i okay okay no problem no problem it happens you know it happens to the best of us i mean just look at me what the chess.com think chess.com i think has been programmed to not insult the players i think charles.com is going to say like an'00 game i don't think chess.com is going to say any lower than that [music] okay in my defense that was my guess i said 17'00. yeah chess comp thought you know i mean chess.com still taught black play better than white but oh man yeah like the level it was very difficult you know and and the reason look the reason hikaru and magnus are so much better than everybody particularly at speed chess is their ability to defend and not lose and i and i really felt like black's ability in this game to defend and not lose was very high which is why i was saying 17. so i gotta trust myself because i started saying 17'00 and then you guys in the chat and i already made a really bad guess you guys in the chats are going no it's not you idiot and then you know i'm like well maybe they're right you know maybe it's a 1350 game
