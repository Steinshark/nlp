in july 2021 evergreen marine took possession of the world's biggest container ship the ever ace built for taiwan-based evergreen marine the ship is as long as the empire state building is tall from bottom floor to roof with the carrying capacity of 23 992 20 foot equivalent units or teu these evergreen a-class mega ships take the record set just the previous year from hmm's al jazeera's class ships it can hold 10 percent more cargo than the infamous ever given that one ship that got stuck in the suez canal these ships herald a new era of ultra-large container ships and it is a bit of a surprising trend what is pushing these container ships to get bigger and is there anything keeping them from getting even bigger down the line but first i want to talk a little bit about the asian armatry newsletter if you subscribe to the channel you should also sign up to the newsletter lately i've been trying to add more content to the newsletters and those have been quite well received so i think it's worth your while you can find a link to the newsletter in the video description below or just go to asianarmatry.com i try to put one out every week maybe two all right back to the show in 1999 an economist surveyed various container shipping lines and found that 78 of them believed that ships would not pass the 12 000 teu threshold ten years later in 2019 a survey found 89 vessels with carrying capacities over' 000 teu from 2011 to 2021 the number of new container ships around the world has grown by about nine percent from 4933 to 5450. the average number of new ships deployed each year has likewise stagnated despite this the fleet's global carrying capacity has exploded by over 65 percent from 14.4 million to 23.8 million teu fewer ships but vastly bigger ones the technology always existed to build a bigger container ship but a bigger container ship also needs to be financially viable bigger ships exist today because the industry adapted to allow them to exist the container shipping industry as we know it today begins with the 1960s up until then things were shipped as general cargo in parcels crates and the like within a ship's cargo departments this took a long time and ships sat in ports for a long time doing nothing an american trucker named malcolm mclean envisioned separating the tractor from his trucks and transporting them over the water containers can then be packed and unpacked away from the port this minimizes ship time at port and perhaps just as crucially bypassed unreasonably strong union port labor but since many ports at the time were not equipped to handle containers pioneering container ships like the ideal x were equipped with cranes so load and unload containers this limited ship's carrying capacity mclean realized that container ships would never realize their full potential so long as the ports were not ready he invested millions doing so throughout the decade by the 1970s container ships no longer needed cranes allowing the biggest to expand to over 1000 teu after this the next big limit had been the panama canal the big u.s base shipping lines owned many ships that traveled between the american west and east coasts the panama canal at the time could not physically handle ships beyond the lock's 110 foot width if a ship cannot get any wider then its length is also capped because a loaded ship will break in half like a kitkat if it gets caught between the tops of two wave crests these physical limitations capped a ship's carrying capacity to about 4700 teu at least if that ship wanted to go through the panama canal ships that could were referred to as panamax class the canal would finally be expanded in 2016 and that created a new class called neopanamax anyway for 10 years from 1978 to 1988 panamax class ships were seen as the physical limit of what the industry could sustain the thing about huge ships however is that they benefit from economies of scale you spend less steel crew and fuel to run one ship carrying 10 000 teu then two ships carrying 5000 teu each in 1968 the biggest ship was the lancer class 700 feet and 85 feet wide with 1200 teu of capacity it was america's first purpose-built container ship ever ace is 1312 feet long and 202 feet wide it is just about twice as long and twice as wide as the american lancer class ship but it has 20 times the capacity it got to the point where the benefits from these economies of scale finally overcame the panama canals limitations in 1988 american president lines or apl introduced the first post-panamax clash ship these ships could not sail through the canal so apl shipped the cargo from long beach to new york via rail or road they called it the united states land bridge calling a 3 000 mile wide country a bridge to me sounds kind of amusing container ship gigantism hit another stride in 2000 a variety of asian countries developed powerful export economies fueling the container shipping industries growth in 2000 maersk debuted its c class of container ships which broke records at 9640 teu unable to greatly increase the ship's width or its draft which is the measure of a ship's bottom to its water line designers opted to extend its length the c-class would be the largest container ships until maersk again broke the record in 2006 with the e-class the e-class was significantly bigger in all dimensions length width and draft the reason for this explosion and size is tied not to ship unit economics but rather to the ports those ships visited shipping is a two-way trade a big ship that takes too long to get unloaded and reloaded loses all of the economies of scale it picked up at sea bigger ships can cause port diseconomies to scale a bigger ship has more containers to load and unload but it can only stay at the port for so long or else it risks missing the schedule yet at the same time a good crane can only make a maximum of about 30 moves an hour and simply adding more cranes mean they interfere with one another furthermore ports have to do significant infrastructure upgrades to handle bigger ships ports around the world had to dredge the seafloor to make it safe for ships with deeper drafts they had to set up local i.t and inland transport to handle the additional containers these upgrades cost money and are of questionable economic benefit for the ports themselves bigger ships don't load or unload appreciably more cargo at any individual port than their smaller brethren large ships often have to make calls at multiple asian ports picking up containers at random to meet capacity at some point however the shipping industry dragged the ports kicking and screaming into making sufficient upgrades this freed the ships to get yet larger the shipping lines essentially offloaded the cost downsides of their bigger scale to the ports so if the ports aren't so keen on these upgrades why do them it's because of the line's increasing market power the global financial crisis shook the shipping industry it accelerated an industry already on the road towards bigger shipping mega companies in 2008 the top 10 liner companies accounted for 26.2 percent of global container fleet capacity by 2020 this figure has sharply risen to some 80 percent liner companies have merged with their peers or taken over their business for instance when han jing shipping filed for insolvency its competitor hyundai or hmm picked up the remaining container traffic and consolidated its position as korea's biggest carrier they have also diversified into other parts of the transportation value chain in a bid to squeeze out more profits out of the service evergreen marine shipping for instance is part of a bigger conglomerate evergreen group which also includes eva air and evergreen international hotels bigger companies by themselves are financially capable of ordering and filling bigger ships in addition to this the industry has established shipping alliances between these giant companies to further capitalize on economies of scale alliances are technical cooperation agreements the participants do their own marketing and sales but pool their capacity in order to make sure their ships are full when they set off from port global shipping alliances do not engage in price fixing this differentiates them from the old shipping conferences which had ruled to be illegal many years ago there are three alliances right now formed in 2017. together they control 81 of the industry's capacity it is effectively impossible to compete without being a part of a global shipping alliance and this consolidated market power has in turn helped push through the latest round of port upgrades i want to add one final thing about green energy and environmental regulations the maritime industry has come under increased scrutiny for its massive carbon emissions ships run on heavy fuel oil they contributed 2.5 of all human generated carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2018. all things being equal this will grow into 2050. the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships or marpool convention was first adopted in 1972. starting in 1997 they have passed a variety of regulations with the goal of bending this carbon emissions trend in 2005 they adopted a major appendix to include more limits on sulfur dioxide and other emissions one noticeable policy is the sulfur cap which required ships to use fuel oil with lower sulfur content starting in 2020 compliant fuel is harder to come by and costs more an alternative would be to install scrubbers that take out the sulfur and either store it on board or toss it into the sea you can also build or retrofit a boat to run on liquefied natural gas for instance cma cgm's jacques saad the first 20 000 plus teu ship to run entirely on lng 23 000 teu with 25 less co2 99 less sulfur and 99 less fine particles side note there has been some exploration of battery-powered container ships so far this is not possible for mega ships on a pacific or atlantic ocean route mega ship batteries need to cost just twenty dollars per kilowatt hour and have a six thousand two hundred and forty mile range but perhaps for a host of smaller feeder ships it can work anyway these are expensive options but they favor bigger ships for instance it is estimated to cost 35 million dollars to retrofit a 23 000 teu ship to run on lng over 20 percent of its total value you can still spread those costs across all that teu while benefiting from fuel economies of scale bigger shifts are one of the major contributing reasons why maritime carbon emissions declined in the 10 years since 2007. when it comes to maximum ship size the industry has pushed through every previous forecast and the economics of scale still apply so few people have gone all out when it comes to their latest predictions limited only by the literal physical size of the shipping routes for instance you have the proposed class of malacca max container ships these have a draft of up to 68.8 feet the maximum acceptable depth for passing through the strait of malacca between the malaysian peninsula and indonesia a container ship that big would have a total capacity of 30 000 to eu industrial projections predict that such ships are expected to arrive sometime in 2025 to 2026. one regression study predicts this ship would be 1486 feet long 236 feet wide and have a draft of 56.7 feet others have even larger estimates however it feels like the industry as it is today is not ready for such a monster-sized ship economic models hint at declining returns to scale at the 20 000 teu neighborhood for instance the difference in terms of daily operating costs between a 23 000 and a 20 000 teu ship is just about one percent at the same time this mega ship would be unable to traverse the panama and suez canals and few ports would have the depth and crane capacity to handle it if you ask me i think the industry is not quite there yet 30 000 teu ships are probably still coming but due to environmental technical and regulatory reasons you probably will need to wait a few years beyond 2025 before they start coming about alright that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
