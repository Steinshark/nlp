welcome to the series where i show you some of the most surprising ways you can customize your android smartphone and first things first i want to use this video to announce 12:00 mr. who's the boss wallpapers that i've been working on there should be one for every kind of user some are more minimal some are made for oled screens and some are just a little bit crazy but all with that deep blue colour that's central to this channel i'd be interested to see what setups you guys can create with these so feel free to tag me in a tweet if you give it a go now for the transparent phone effect and you can get everything you need for this from the ifixit website it works best when you have no or few icons on the screen and there's a way to make it way cooler we do as you set an x-ray version of this wallpaper as your lockscreen and this gives the effect of being able to peer inside your phone every time you unlock as an added bonus it also hides the whole pant remarkably well on the s10 plus i'm using here alright let's talk about colors for a second colors are powerful colors can stimulate and excite us we are wired to respond to color and so subconsciously picking color themes for your device can impact your mood reds are known to increase your blood pressure and excite you've got yellows that are comforting and warming and you've got green that symbolizes tranquility and it's worth bearing this in mind when you're building a home screen setup and yeah i know we're talking about customizing an android home screen here so let's not get carried away but at the same time that is exactly what this series is about is about people who are passionate about building the ultimate set up on their phone anyways i think this is a big reason why pastel colors have taken off recently they're less saturated than primary colors which makes setups that use them feel lighter more sophisticated and more calming so let's start without for a second just to show this idea off i've quickly put together a pastel set up here on my s10 plus using the oppressor tea icon pack the foxy widget and then a wallpaper that also came with these icons it may sound crazy but these lighter colors could very well lead to a light to mood customisation goes far beyond just changing wallpapers though and one of the coolest ways i've customized my phone recently is by installing the reach ability cursor it's activated by swiping from the edges of your screen and it allows you to reach content in the top half of your phone without you needing to adjust your grip it pretty much solves the biggest problem i have with larger screen phones it means that you can now build a home screen that looks the way you wanted to without feeling constrained to adding icons only in the bottom half see notice customizes your notification experience and is brilliant anytime you get a notification you'll get this little pop-up bubble and by tapping it you can fully see the notification and interact with it without leaving whatever application you're in and the notification won't disappear until you tell it to so if you're anything like me and you want to read notifications but still keep them there so that you can refer to them later this is one way of doing it speaking of unexpected ways you can customize your android phone the border light live wallpaper creates a circuit of light around the edge of your display the benefits kind of end out it looks cool but it definitely gives a unique touch to your screenshots and has an oled black version to offset the slight extra battery that it might drain there's a lot of customizability here everything from the thickness of the lighting to the corner radius and the ability to shape itself around any kind of not your phone might have the default colors are a little tacky but with some tweaking and alignment with your wallpaper color scheme it can be quite a stunning effect so you probably remember that crazy foldable phone samsung just announced well it's not gonna get you a $2,000 device for free but this will bring you one step closer to that experience on the websites a mobile you can download the official live wallpaper that samsung uses it's a video file but actually using the application video live wallpaper you can turn that or actually any video file into a looping live wallpaper and it's beautiful but the only thing i'd say is that the effect looping again and again on your home screen can get a little march so what i've done is just set it as my lockscreen wallpaper and then just use one of these standard static non-moving ones for my homescreen they're all on the same website changing your font is something most android users just don't consider but a new font is probably the quickest way to give your phone instant facelift without changing any of the ui elements there are a ton of apps you can download that'll help you pick one and i'll be the first to admit 80% look pretty grim but there are some that do offer a nice change from your default without making a look like an eight-year-olds handwriting if you enjoyed this video i've got a load of android customization content so i'll link it from
