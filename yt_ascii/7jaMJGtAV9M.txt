[music] [applause] so i am a little confused because i've never done a magic trick where i have the deck of cards and i have no idea how you can possibly trick me here do you have a deck of cards yeah yeah and do you are you are you skilled with cards at all i'm definitely going to do this to peter mccann and i'm very curious how he's going i'm okay at identifying what's happening i'm not like dexterous with my fingers though i have to have a deck of cards yeah i have to be prepared for this yeah you know just one prop one problem i definitely have a deck of cards yeah that's the only a deck of pokemon cards does that work ah can you give me three minutes to look for a deck of cards here i'll try i'll try something else with with this deck it's fun when you have a deck but i'm gonna have you pick a card and see if i can okay something see how this is all a totally normal shuffle deck of cards okay so i'm gonna have you take a look through these cards i'm gonna like riffle them to you and just real fast and see if you can pick out a card and don't say it out loud let's see if you can pick one out right okay all right to the camera gotta get the frame rate got it you got it okay so you can pick we could have picked whatever card but you got one so i'm gonna see you can see this right yes i'm just going to take the deck like this and just like totally mix it up face up face down all over the place so it's completely trash like there's no way you could see like your car could be anywhere in here any one of these cars right it could be face up it could be face down look some of them are back to front some of them are front to back oh look some of them are back to back like it could be anything but sure i'm going to put them in this nice little neat pile [music] make sure you can keep seeing them and would it impress you if if i turned all of these cards to face one direction yes it would definitely impress me it would yes okay cool they're all facing one direction okay that was pretty smooth did you catch that there's there's one card there's one card that's not facing that oh my god that's my card is it is it really oh that's not good that's good all right that's pretty impressive that's pretty impressive thank you thank you i guess last time we spoke we were in the middle of the desert in arizona you had just come down from this balloon trip from was it twenty thousand feet how how did you go i actually went to 25 000. 25 000 which was on my watch but he yelled no no don't pull you after he said go go go and it was really so registered is 24 9 on there okay but i was at 25 on my watch i was on the ground i could see everybody like talking to you in like the whole broadcast set up and that was a fun time you know what threw me for a loop i'm happy it was safe and it was for my daughter and she was there and i wanted to keep it happy and fun and all that stuff i wanted to go higher than anything on earth so mount everest was 29 000 feet a little more than 29 072 feet or something like that yeah i guess because the fa and everybody suddenly thought that i was going to go hypoxic because i wasn't doing the proper o2 breathing so suddenly i'm being remote popped down and i can't keep i'm like where come on what's going on i want to keep going so anyway but but it was a lot of fun when because they were able to remote pop everything yeah they did as soon as i deployed jumped down they recovered the entire rig that was a high-tech experiment like i got to see the like the aftermath of like so you jump out they've got the remote control and like tracking of this huge rig essentially an aircraft it continues to fly they lower it to the ground they recover it like i got to see all that happen yeah i was very impressed with the amount of tech happening even though at its core it's you with some balloons which was amazing but if it was just me and the balloons then it would have actually been something that i wasn't into because i didn't want to just leave balloons to go float away and like destroy the invite you know whatever don't pop in the desert yeah so that's that so the big big team and all the work really was on how do we recover the rig how do we bring everything back down which is they remote pop every single balloon and then lower it yeah so so you put that on youtube yeah and one of my favorite things about like i'm pretty sure i found and i'm sure a lot of people watching this have found your magic on youtube somewhere and if i look back far enough you're easily one of i don't speak to a lot of people who have been uploading to youtube longer than me but you're one of the first people to like blow up on youtube people know david blaine magic from yeah it came yeah it started with youtube so how did you why did you decide to put stuff on youtube because i know my answer but like sharing magic i felt like the medium was was changing so i felt like the natural progression and and now it really is now the only way people look at things is on their phones which is unfortunate but therefore there's also the fortunate part which is they have lots of access to anything that they can think of so you can learn anything from anyone anyone anywhere in the world anytime which is really speeding up the process of the learning curve which is amazing but now there's youtube instagram tick tock which i haven't figured out yet i'm so it's so it's so cool on the same page with the exact i think yeah yeah but no no but i'm not against any of it because i actually like all of it but it's just i have my brain hasn't understood how to do that yet because it's like with youtube it was kind of like magic was perfect because it was like here's a trick here's a reaction boom that's really that that's and that content is quick and it's gratifying but then you know it it started to move too like there's no time for anything it has to be like the fastest trick and the fastest reaction couple seconds yeah yeah yeah quick hits yep i mean i remember i've seen a lot of your videos and magic and that was that was actually part of the entertaining part was that takes you into a sort of a rabbit hole and you just watch as many as you can you can't get enough and the reactions from people when you do a trick to them and blow their mind is i think you described it this way it's like this universal language like everyone has the same like primal mind-blown reaction to a good trick yeah youtube lets you share that with way more people than if it was just one at a time yeah yeah that's right it allows you to to reach anybody anywhere in the world which is incredible no idea how you can possibly trick me here yeah that's this is what makes it good so you've got the whole deck with you no way i could manipulate it or anything so i'm gonna have you do some stuff and i'm gonna find your card right it's a new it's a new camera thing going okay so you've got your deck right here so don't let me see but from the top of the deck just start dealing cards down onto the table in front of you however many you want and somewhere before halfway you can stop so you can keep it below the camera make sure i can't see it so whenever you want to stop i'll keep talking so i can't hear i can't count but as whenever you want to stop you can stop dealing cards at a time you can do three at a time whatever you want to do a random number before halfway and just stop just let me know when you're good good we're good okay so don't show me your don't show me your hand okay don't show me how many but what you're gonna do is take the top card and flip it over and check and see what it is okay and then flip it back over so that's your card don't let me see it but just remember what that card is okay there's no way i can know what this card is at this point but what we're gonna do is like if for example it was a three you'll take three cards from the big pile and put them face down on top of your card so if it was a five you put five on top if it was a jack it's eleven i quite like it if you turn around oh my god yeah he's turning around i can't possibly see how many you're dealing you're putting them on top right so this is just so you you definitely remember your card you know the number and everything then take that small pile pick it up put it on top of the big pile it goes back into one deck got it amazing below the camera that was perfect so you agree there's no way i could know what card you've got where it is in the deck it could be anywhere right you could have picked whatever you wanted i'm gonna have you start dealing from the top one card at a time and you're going to read the cards to me one at a time so i'm going to turn them over and tell you what they are you're going to turn them over and tell me what they are one at a time right four although wait sorry pause one i want to have you cut the deck from the middle okay okay put that you put that back on top right so take that from the middle cut the entire deck in half so you've completed the cut yep there you go yes and then cut it and put it back on top so now you've swapped the top and the bottom perfect okay so now we're gonna deal from the top one at a time face down until we've got your card we'll go all the way through two of hearts three of hearts ace of clubs six of hearts seven of hearts eight of hearts this was a fresh pack nine hearts queen of clubs king of clubs king of diamonds you're holding a card in your hand queen of diamonds oh yeah keep going keep going jack of diamonds and then we've just got ace of hearts wow that you did not shuffle that very much i did not shuffle that very much you saw me unbox the pack do you agree that there is no chance i could there's no technology i could possibly use to like you know turn off center stage and like check your hand or like see anything there's no like incredible audio feature that could let me hear how many you counted or anything like that there's just there's no way you don't know where i cut the deck and i put the bottom half on top so no i don't think you have any idea yeah okay okay well you're right i do i do have a card here i'm curious if your card is also this card how did you do that ah did i did i get it i got it right two of clubs okay that's a pretty good start it's like you reached through the phone and like messed up my deck for me what so now there's a sort of a new chapter because i've seen all these i've seen all these tricks and all these incredible things you've done but you've now decided to make a class and actually teach magic so i've been reluctant forever to do magic kits or do any of those types of things which is ironic because my mother's a teacher and my brother's a teacher so they're both teachers so i always do understand the amazing and important effect that you have by teaching people stuff that you're that you worked really hard on but i was still reluctant because magic is such a a confusing area because these secrets are so powerful but you don't want to just give them away because that's part of the art itself so every time somebody said to me though could you teach me a trick i always feel bad that i can't you know it's like i want to of course i want to and often i do teach them something quickly like i'll be like here i could teach you something but that's not really good enough so the idea of being able to create any kind of class that i wanted with studio which is max called me up and he was he understood all about magic he did all of his research he could perform magic he also learned how to play chess so he could play magnus and he lasted quite a few moves against him and he learned how to memorize a deck so when he showed me all these things he said i'll do whatever you want to make this class something that's incredible and amazing yeah it was it was it was very difficult to say no to that because and i know if anybody wants to take the class they're not just going to get the secrets they're going to be they have to actually enroll they have to like commit to it it's a month-long class so the idea of a student trying to learn some of the things that were what got me started some of the basic things in magic that i love i think that was kind of the inspiration and that's what led me to agree to do this yeah so being able to put out something actually good and like that you have control over and that you can really make amazing and share this with as many people as possible is that's like 2022 david blaine that's pretty sick it's dope i also want to ask you like how do you decide what stuff to to share in the class versus what stuff you continue to work on and evolve so most of the stuff that i share is actually for beginners for people that are you know beginner intermediate people that want to be able to like walk into a situation and do some magic and not you know it's i think it's such an amazing art form and it's so it's so such a deep dive into psychology it's technical it's math it's science it's logic it's all these things combined and there's a philosophy behind it so i feel like the people that you know come come into it i feel like they'll have a a a new appreciation for the actual art of magic itself actually i think like you're gonna suddenly realize oh wow when this magician's doing a trick he does it's a lot of work it's not just like he's doing this quick trick that has no meaning and it's like oh he learned it for three seconds and now he can do it's like oh wow these guys all these magicians out there work really hard at their craft and it's special can confirm i mean you're seeing it now but you've taught me a little bit i've been working on the tricks i can't even do this yeah but you learned it fast wait let me see if i can do one right now what is it called again charlie cut yeah you learned it fast is there a person yeah there you go yep perfect it's not yeah it's deep no you just did it but you learned it fast but that's the that's the type of the next phase would be like this oh see that's just the next would be like this these are the ones that but these are the ones that i don't go into teaching because these are you know this is this is different i do like the those things the evolution of a trick like here's level one here's level two here's level three that's that's sick take this whole deck and and divide it into three like roughly equal sized piles in front of you and don't shuffle before you it's shuffled already i think right you got a couple shuffles in so give me three equal sized piles in front of you don't let me see them and you can you know adjust it make sure they're about three equal sized piles okay they're pretty good you want to see them no you're good just leave him i don't want to see i don't i don't want to cheat and like see the see the the cards oh yeah you know this technology is crazy i might be able to see through the cars so take any one of those piles and flip it face up whichever one you want okay the whole thing's face up yep and you've got a card now on the top of that pile yeah that's your card so remember that card commit that to memory there's no way i could know it that's your selection yeah and then what i want you to do is take that face up pile the whole thing and put it on top of one of the face down piles okay right uh still up though still face up yep and then take the other face down pile and put it on top of the face up pile so you just made a sandwich yep so you got all your cards in here now some of them are face up some are face down and do your best to like roughly in the middle cut the deck and don't complete the cut so you just have two piles now am i showing this to you nope nope don't let me see it okay cut it in half you've got a face up half and a face down half and just put them into each other this is the part where you give me your little riffle shuffle one of these so we're really mixing up nah nah off camera the whole thing just mixing the crap out of this deck right now you are making me ruin these cards you still remember your card right you still got it on my card okay perfect well like there are like half of them are up and half of them are down yeah it's it's crazy it's pretty messed up right now just for fun just give me a give me another cut just just cut it in half and complete the cut like that so like there's really truly no way you can cut it again if you want like just making sure there's absolutely no chance in these 52 cards that i could know what it is where it is it's face up face time whatever right yeah so i want you to take this deck you've you've shuffled and one at a time from the top deal the cards into a pile and each one that is face up read the card out loud but don't like let me see it don't change your voice if you hit if you hit your card or not just say all them the exact same so i could never know just read through the deck one at a time deal them face up let me know which ones are face up deal them all one on top of another all right king of spades ace of diamonds queen of spades three of clubs that's it that's it okay you know the crazy stat about like like a card deck can be in any order like there's like some crazy number of like orders it can be in like 52 factorial it's like more more stars in the universe or something like that yeah it would be pretty miraculous if from that shuffle from all that we just did i could find your card i might be shocked i'd be pretty shocked there's no text i would be shocked i would be shocked i would be shocked actually you know what's funny actually i have another i have a pocket on the other side you remember no way dude okay you've seen these okay and so again i'd be shocked if this worked but let me know if this is also your card holy no way no way did i got it sounds like i got it you've done like these tricks to almost any person i can name has experienced some sort of incredible magic who's your who's your favorite reaction you've gotten i mean you know there's so many amazing reactions but you mean on somebody like well known or whatever maybe you did a trick and you just were like i can't believe this person loved the trick so much i mean i was once at a dinner with a dear friend of mine and mickey rourke and tupac and you know tupac we were at cafe to back and he was smoking at the table so he's a little buzzed and i start doing magic to him and the next thing i know i look over and he's like on the floor laughing like kicking his legs like a little kid and that was yeah that was a pretty and he's also tupac you know so that was a pretty exciting reaction but there's all kinds of reactions that i get that are amazing and sometimes it's the opposite it might just be somebody's completely still like a kid that i did magic to in a barstow and i made a coin disappear over saying it was in my first show i've seen that yeah yeah and he just stood there and he's like cool and that was all and i obsessed over him but you know and then i wanted to put that trick on abc and they were like no it's not his reaction i was like this is the best thing and then after that i think he got a taco bell commercial or something that's an iconic and that's all over youtube that's exactly that's what i'm talking about see and then what was funny was those spoof videos that came like not that long ago like 10 years ago or something had those like david blaine street magic videos did you enjoy those yeah that was some of my favorite videos now that guy mikey day has he got a a lead in snl after that that's incredible that's incredible you know magic these types of things they're all creative i view you as a creator basically this is what i'm saying like you you put stuff online you adjust the way you present you you're creative in the way you combine things and you're able to to make something new and that it's like amazing and you get to share with people and that's like inspiring for me so i appreciate that thank you but hold on i want to say one other thing marquez so so like i said i always try to teach people magic yeah right like i'm always like the way you are with your hands and your ability to learn it's it's it's mind-blowing it was a very fast learning curve as you know it just that was i was very impressed you know and and once again that was part of my excitement in the beginning was just i know you're so athletic you're so smart you're so telling so seeing the immediate learning curve was inspiring and then you pulled the stuff off quickly yeah yeah no i had the best teachers so i definitely had a pretty pretty good head start there yeah but you you you the way you learned it and the way you pulled it off right away we did it to your crew did it over zoom yeah and you improvised you came up with stuff so that you know that that was for me that wasn't that's worth the whole thing right there like watching you learn and adjust and and come up with things and it was fun if your card is the eight of clubs it isn't it's fine i was just kidding is it this one [laughter] [music] did i get it i think i got it what the hell that looks like i got it you're reaching through my screen it's not even fair he learned he learned he learned very fast what it took a second it took a second i was by the way i didn't help him i mean i taught him but i didn't help him there's a difference i don't have like someone who works at crete airport all right all right i guess you learned from the master but that's legitimately really impossible appreciate it thank you but how could he have known what you were thinking regardless oh what's up man how you doing by the way just so you know just you know i was watching so even though he put the cards at a frame nothing funny was done he did all of what you saw exactly wow yeah i didn't help at all he did it all himself that whole thing that is super impressive well call us back one day when you have your own deck of non non-pokemon he pulled off the impossible wow david i've watched a lot of your stuff online over the years you're you're magnificent i think you just got a a dose of the the new version of being able to do this through the screen like that is unbelievable but there's something really eerie about controlling your own deck and controlling your own cuts and your own shuffles away from you and just happening like that is bizarre face up oh hold on this is weird hold on tilt the camera down move the pile in your hand away move it away move it away you drop him get rid of him look what he's been holding since before this began turn it shown and by the way you didn't even you turned them upside down right side up you did what you wanted [music] i wish i had more time to take this in this has blown my mind all right shout out to david blaine himself for
