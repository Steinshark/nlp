- have you heard the word? the wishtery tech word. ooh! ooh! does anyone want a dual charging, game holding and cooling fan for the sony playstation 5? 26 bucks. sold. pokemon cards. that worked out well before. i gotta investigate. the pokemon card selection at
our fine friends over at wish. oh look, it's a game stick. a tv game stick 4k. this literally looks like a chromecast with two fake playstation controllers. question: how do we feel about
an imac for $338 dollars? - [ken] what year? - yes. i clicked on this cool like
game sphere looking speaker. the first item i see, "for pregnant women, children's early education,
and prenatal education." it's a (bleep) bluetooth
speaker with leds. what are you talking about? what the? oh. - [ken] what butt plug is it? - future austin, (bleep) you. oh? it's a $20 pair of airpods max. i'll tell you looking at the photo, not particularly authentic looking. so my friends, with 17
items and $831 spent, i will be back in 30 to 60 days when our full wishtery tech haul arrives, and i am sad at the poor quality of items that i've wasted my money on yet again. this video is sponsored by our

for sponsoring this video. it has been roughly two months since we purchased our items from wish. however, ken, before you go and pick up that large suspicious box, i actually have something for the room. i have something to share
with all of you fine friends. - [ken] is it a new host? (box thuds) - the brand-new fusion
strike pokemon card set. look, we can pull the
alt art gengar vmax. is this just an excuse
to open pokemon cards and call it work? well yes. yes, it is. see? look how joyous the room is. - [ken] what is it, three? - four cards. all right, let's go, boys. let's go. fun fact, the largest pokemon set ever over 264 different cards in this set. i got a holo. you got a blissey, but it's not a holo? matt, what'd you get? - [matt] nothing. - wow. - with our powers combined,
we make one disappointment. - can you hold that- do not do that! do you know what's inside this box? - [matt] whatever it is, it's refurbished. - i actually know what this is. cause i had to lift this box
and bring it across the hall. this my friends is an imac that we bought on wish.com - [ken] oh oops! - yeah, you- - [ken] oh, i forgot about that. - [jared] won't be an imac anymore. - this was an imac from wish.com. can you look at this please? - [ken] ew. - [jared] it says apple. - [ken] oh! - [jared] oh my god. - can someone get some disinfecting wipes. thank you. so this is a relatively modern imac. it's still the current 8th generation, 'cause they're still
making the larger ones. - [ken] so it's like
a core i still, right? - yeah., and this is the
newer model, so it has, oh, but you know what? it must be an older one
because it's got thunderbolt 2 instead of thunderbolt 3. - [ken] it's a 2013, 21 inch
i5 with eight gigs of ram, one terabyte hard drive,
and you paid $340 for it. - oh wow, i'm an idiot. why would i spend that much money on this? i will say this is actually
in very nice condition. the screen is pretty much flawless. we'll see when we actually fire it up, but i'm not seeing any like
dead pixels or anything. it looks too obvious here. while the imac is ready,
please enlighten me. what else do we have? okay, i caught it. oh, i know what this is too! look at this. mr. austin evans, finally,
after years of making wishtery tech, reminded
myself by looking through all the listings before
we started shooting. i'm going to need an
assistant for this one. - [ken] what? we'll be right back. - i assist. - [austin] at least you're
not wearing a linus shirt today. - [jared] that's true, i'm not. - ken, how are you doing these days? - [ken] i mean fine. - that ls of yours. - [ken] oh. - [austin] it's getting
a little expensive. - [ken] yeah? - may i offer you an alternative way to not only live your life, but to improve it? enrich it to some extent. would you be interested
in such a proposal? - [ken] no, but i mean, i'm curious to see what the hell your- - jared, please come in. i propose to you- - [ken] oh! right, that, yeah right. i still haven't watched that. - you haven't seen it? - what? the joke is ruined! ken, how have you not watched squid game? (group laughs) - [ken] are those your
airpods in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? - i can explain! it's not what you think! - so update, the imac didn't boot after like over 10 minutes,
i hit the power button, and then a minute later, it's
now trying to boot again. so either it's fixed itself
or we spent $340 on an imac that doesn't work. i think i need another item. ken, you have no respect. okay. what is this? ah! damn it, past austin. why would you do this to me? [music] it's electric [music] oh my god. do you want to know what
the power consumption of this thing is? - [jared] 20 watts. - 50 watts! - [ken] whoa! you could charge your macbook off that! that's cool. - 50 watts to my nipples, man. - [matt] i don't know, who's
saying put them on your nipples? you're just adding that. - well, where else do you put them? - [matt] i literally said your abs. - look, i bought it for a reason. - [jared] is this a self report? - [austin] pikachu used thunderbolt. - take it off, boy. - you happy, matt? - no. not since about 1998. this is a dead-ass meme, but
i'm so happy i get to do it. i like ya cut, g! (group laughs) - so wait, we're doing the abs? wait- - yeah, it specifically says abs. - but i see- - but since you wanted to. - no! no, no!
(group laughs) wait, could we test
this before i put it on? - [group] no. - oh okay, okay, okay. okay, okay.
(yells) - it's on? - yup, yup. - that is the lowest possible setting. - wait, leave it there for a second. let me talk. okay, so.  (group laughs) - [ken] okay maybe let's stop. oh god. - wait, wait, wait. maybe we should stop it now. - [matt] i haven't heard a safe word yet. - [ken] i was gonna say (indistinct) - what level am i on right now, matt? - you're at 50%. (austin yells) - all right, i'm good. i'm good. (yells) - [jared] tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out, tap out. - i'm good. i'm good. - off. today was a good day. - i don't know who wants to
crank that up a hundred percent. like i honestly don't know
who wants that much power. - [ken] well, most importantly, i mean, i'm glad you're okay, but you know, what's not? - the imac still hasn't booted. - [ken] yeah. - [austin] huh. okay, that i did technically catch, but made slightly too much
contact with the table. - [ken] that would not have
been ruled a catch in the nfl. don't worry, this is the
one that runs cooler. we're good. - ah. well then we're just going to continue on  with the p5 cooling stand
with controller and chargers. wait didn't we already use one of these when we built the ultimate ps5? - [ken] yes, i don't know
why you bought one on wish, but i mean- - [austin] so it is one solid piece. so basically what you get here, oh wow. it even comes with a separate screw, and a little plastic protector so you can screw it all the way into the bottom of your ps5. that actually is fairly nice. i'm not sure where the
fans come in though, because i don't see anywhere
for fans to do anything. - [matt] i mean there's slots
on the bottom of it, but- - also this technically
works 'cause it's digital, but also there's this giant
hole that your hand fits in. i can tell you right now,
this is where the fan, the air is supposed to come out. i feel next to nothing. - [ken] wait, what the hell? yeah, that is nothing. what the hell? it's an intake. it's absolutely an intake. so it's the other way around. so it's sucking hot air
from the bottom of the ps5? - it's channeling it out through the side, 'cause you can feel- - [austin] i do feel the wind. - [ken] the wind on the side. they do know heat rises, right? that's how that works? also all the exhaust is
at the top of the console. - [austin] ah, this is fine. i will say though my favorite part of it is a hundred percent
the fact that you have not only a good spot to
put your controllers, even though it's a little bit not stable, but actually seeing the state of charge and a nice big screen with the little led, pretty cool. but as far as the fan? (fan whirs loudly) that ain't it, chief. i'm so happy 'cause wish sucks! i mean, i love wishtery tech, well that one's a bounceable product. more earbuds! why the hell did i buy so many ear buds? - [ken] austin! - why did i buy the leading ear buds? are you sure i bought these? i don't think i bought these. what the hell is this? the 2.4 gigahertz wireless
controller game pad. supports 40 emulators. look, ps2 controllers. - in all fairness, this
feels like the six axis without the rumble motor. - it's definitely the same shell. - it's just as light, and this is definitely
the same shell as ps2, but it has a battery door in the back. - well, i found our dongle. it looks like a chromecast
(bleep) a nintendo switch. hello, it is functioning,
our game stick lite 4k, which is not 4k. uncle poo! long time no see, dude! driver! there was driver! wow! oh! the driving mechanics. oh, ow, oh. oh, they're the cops. - [austin] not the cops. - [ken] uh, uh, uh, uh. - [austin] i'm stuck! there you go. - [ken] wow, what (bleeps) cops
couldn't stop that? initial d! - [ken] let's go! wow, we lucked out on that one. - [ken] let's go! lets go! - i've never played this for ps1. - [ken] yo, is that an ae-86? the hachi roku itself? - uh? uh? uh? this doesn't seem promising. you know, we had a moment of joy there. we all experienced it together. there's a moment of
unbridled, pure joy, and now- - [ken] that was genuinely the happiest i think i've ever been on set. - [jared] maybe the real initial d is the friends we've made along the way. - [ken] no, jared. i have no friends. - we don't do that here. (jared gasps) - it took that long to load? we're going through an
existential crisis here. initial d dot dot dot. woo! - [ken] this is really nice. - for a ps1 game, it was
a late model ps1 game it's '99. - [ken] austin, you gotta
do the gutter trick. - i don't know any of
my controls, but yeah. - [ken] there, yeah! - this is actually pretty fun, and i would recommend it. when it comes to mystery tech, or wishtery tech as it were, there's a certain level
of mystery required. and who better than the
mysterious man himself. (whispers) this is where you come in. the mysterious man himself, super saf! - that was a late entrance. i thought i'd add to the mystery. - [austin] welcome. this is the first time
you've been on mystery tech in like three years. - [saf] it has been three years. i'm excited. looking forward to this. - [austin] you should lower
your expectations immediately. - [saf] okay. - that was pretty good. that was a solid, like
eight out of 10 catch. - [saf] i'm going to blame the throw. - [ken] to be fair, yes. i could have done that better. - so these look familiar. how much was this pair of airpods max? they're completely legitimate from wish. - [matt] so fun fact about these ones. - oh no. are they gone? - [matt] so you paid $30 for them. they never actually showed up. someone had sent us these
in the po box just randomly. we had these before you
ever ordered them on wish. - i mean, how bad could they be? saf! saf! saf! - i'm a professional unboxer.
- saf! saf! (austin cheering) - there we go. - this looks pretty legit. the real box takes a long time to open. - [saf] yeah. - [austin] oh wow. wait, what? we know that not everyone
can afford $549 headphones, so we decided to create the best possible
one-to-one replica version of the original airpods max
for one quarter of the price. - [ken] i don't know if that's allowed? - this is sus now. is this wishtery tech? is this mystery tech? is this promoting atpromax.com? it says designed by apple in california. - can they do that? - no, no, no. you can't do that. airpods max on the sticker? ooh. oh geez. oh, that does not. oh. i will say the headphones
feel way lighter. like definitely plastic. like it's like- - [saf] oh yeah, yeah. - much, much lighter. the case is actually fairly close. it's not quite the same, but like it's close enough. - the front again seems slightly off and even with the mesh. - [austin] yeah. - [saf] you can tell it's not- - [austin] look, airpods- - [ken] lowercase m? are you serious? - [saf] change it just
enough so they don't sue you. (group gasps) - okay, things are happening. - [ken] that's illegal! that's illegal! - put them on. see what happens. - all right, they feel a lot lighter. - that's probably for the better honestly. they're pretty heavy normally. man, saf is super stylish
right now though with this. - nah. absolutely not. i'm like white girl dancing now. - [ken] no, no, no. and this is how guests don't come back. it was a nice knowing you, saf. thanks for stopping by. - thank you. - [saf] okay. i'm going to let you do this one. - this is best- i know what this is! i know what this is! best by march 31st, 2022. would you like to eat some
hostess twinkies from wish.com? (austin laughs) saf showed up to the office this morning with a beautiful bag
full of wonderful coff- coffee? candy. and this seems like not a very good trade. - yeah, i kind of don't
want food poisoning. - [ken] here's the thing. we didn't know wish even
sold food until this episode. you buy food on amazon,
it's already expired. so i wonder how much better it is on wish or are you're just going to- - oh, he's doing it. - [matt] we're not
gonna make you eat this. - [ken] but we're going
to make him eat it. - i can't eat it because
of religious reasons. - that is actually, that's a very valid, that's a very valid point. - yes! - [ken] it's just a thought
of where that came from. wish.com. - i'll let you to do the honors. i'll catch- - [ken] and saf will open. - [saf] okay. - [austin] what is this? a speaker? why did i buy a speaker? i gotta stop doing this. i think it looks good
on wish and i get it. - [speaker voice] the device already, ready to connect. - that's a lot of words to just say on. (relaxing music plays) - [austin] you know? well- - it has a microsd card slot. - okay, cool. i'm sold. - done. - i'm so disappointed. two things? okay. which one do you want? - this one. - oh boy. i got my fold bluetooth dual call headset with what has got to be the
longest stem i've ever seen. (austin gasps) it came after all! wait a minute! - 30 bucks. - wait a minute! this was here all along! - [saf] oh, oh. - [austin] ooh. oh, that looks not good. oh no. - [saf] oh! - [ken] it looks great
in our lighting though. i'm not going to lie. - [austin] the lighting
makes it look better. this weighs nothing. like i thought the other ones were light. like this weighs actually nothing. - [ken] it's also smaller than real pairs. - well, while you're having fun with that, take a look at this. - oh cool. can you hear that? (headphones crunching) (group groans) - [ken] that sounds like my
bones on a friday morning. - oh, they do come off. - [ken] oh that don't look the same. - [austin] that's not good. - [ken] wait, is that one ear? oh. we got frankenstein over here. look at this. - but like how deep are
they in your ears, like- - too deep.
- is that safe? - too deep. you know when you go to the doctor and they stick the thing in your ear? that's the vibe. that's the vibe. - ooh. all right, so they give me a headache, but for 30 bucks, the sound is not bad. - really? - like for 30 bucks. they are not comfortable. those were a lot more comfortable because they're just hard plastic. so when you put them on
your head, it's like- - [matt] it looks like it's gonna break- - yeah, and it's really
pushing against my head. - all right. let's see who has the worst
cheap wish headphones. they're not terrible. very sparkly, very treble-y, they're like, it's like 90% high end. it's like, there's like whispers of bass. - i can't explain sound like that. - don't buy these on wish. look, when you have the biggest
tech youtuber who's cool in the office, you gotta yeet it together. - three, two. - my headphones are still
playing in the case. (both laugh) so i hope this was as
disappointing as you expected. - i mean, i started here and
then i went here very quickly. - that checks out. - [ken] that's a very generous review. you're like, i like that
you're just cushioning the blow for us.
- yeah. - [ken] yeah.
