the psychology of the criminal mind has fascinated people forever books about true crime shows about fake crimes all the crimes we love it we love watching it all unfold right but at a time when i thought i'd seen it all one case drew me back in and reminded me why these investigations are so addictive it's a case with a twist where the scammers actually turn on one another and the psychology of why they did it just hugged me it was so ridiculous when i first heard it that i decided to dig deeper and just break it down for your viewing pleasure our story starts a few days ago not just minding my own business watching the clinton news network when suddenly i heard an update on instagram star hush poppy an instagram influencer who posted pictures of his lavish lifestyle could spend the next 20 years in a prison cell ramon abbas aka hush puppy has pleaded guilty to money laundering in a u.s federal court now okay if you're a long time zilla holder pump to stock you know that we've covered hush puppy before when he went to jail but the details on this case we haven't covered let me set the stage for you hush puppy real name raymond abbas was able to flex on instagram and gain millions of followers based on the appearance of being a successful real estate mogul in reality it was because he ran something called a bec scheme it's a type of confidence scam where you convince someone to send you money because you impersonate some kind of business email in this case hush puppy was pretending to be a wells fargo banker and hush puppy convinced his victim that he could get him a 15 million dollar loan to build a school in qatar this is the case he was charged on now maybe this victim wanted to save the kids i don't know but how this thing worked is they tricked the victim into sending money first because they said there were taxes on this multi-million dollar loan and you might be asking yourself how in the world did they get anyone to fall for this well complex scams like this aren't easy to pull off you need tons of fake proof of your identity and hush puppy had a few people he recruited to his team to help pull off this deception the first was a guy named juma who pretended to be from kenya and provided the loan he was the source hush puppy was malik a banker at wells fargo and they also had a third guy vincent the tech guy he set up phony wells fargo websites and even a fake wells fargo automated phone number all to convince the victim that he really did receive a loan and on the surface this fateful job was going off like any other they'd already convinced the victim to send hundreds of thousands of dollars to them but behind the scenes things were getting a little rocky with the team vincent the third man he was upset he wasn't happy with how much he was being paid or how fast he was getting paid and he decides you know what this scheme isn't that hard for those other guys you know he was the one doing all the work setting up the tech why not cut hush puppy and juma out of the deal so he contacts their victim and tells them hey you're being scammed that's right he basically says i'm here to help you if you just start redirecting those scam payments to me i'll save you from the scammers now at the time juma and hush puppy didn't know this but they were also planning to cut vinson out so imagine their surprise when the word got out to them that they had been beaten to the punch now they were the ones being cut out and guess what they're outraged on january 16th 2020 hush puppy then decides it's time to take things to the next level and he threatens vincent i swear with my life you will regret messing with me you will even wish you died before my hands will touch you and that same day hush puppy also contacts a fixer this is someone who solves inconvenient problems in this case it's nigeria's deputy commissioner abba kyari and if you're in disbelief right now yes a scammer just called the police on another scammer but this isn't just any cop kyary was known as a super cop and this guy was bad news he used to be part of sars the special anti-robbery squad which got disbanded after its many many abuses of power in nigeria and so this is the guy hush puppy calls and he simply tells him the truth haj's puppy said vincent contacted the job to divert the job for himself and he didn't pretend it wasn't a scam they both knew they're talking about a scam job but according to the court record hush puppy asked kyari to have the police pick this guy up and give him the serious beating of his life that's a quote he also told the corrupt cop i will take care of the team also after they pick him up meaning pay off the whole team of cops kyary confirmed yes four days later hush puppy gets sent a picture of this guy vincent he's been arrested the cop had done his job hush puppy tells kyari let me know how i can send money to the team sir let them deal with him like an armed robber kyary responded okay i will send their account details to you hush puppy also wrote and this is the part that i just cannot wrap my mind around he betray me and try to take food out of my mouth this is great punishable sin i want him to suffer for many years kyary responded now okay this is the part my brain can't understand a scammer just told a cop to throw the book at someone who stole money from him while also himself stealing money from people overseas and we know that he planned to steal money even from vincent his partner so he's mad and thinks it's evil to steal from your partner while also stealing from his partner it doesn't make any sense and this is the thing like when he eventually got caught i wonder i'd love to know what he had told the judge like did he beg for mercy after wanting to let his partner rot in a jail cell on trumped-up charges like i don't know this is just such a dark story of really ugly people who ultimately got caught but the reason they were eventually captured is likely in part due to this falling out they had i can't say i feel bad for them i just wish i knew why they couldn't see themselves for how they truly are bad people i don't know i think i need to talk this out with somebody hey welcome back can i interest you in a limited special barbs do it's aged like fine wine no nothing today i actually just need to ask you a question okay yes i'd leak those texts but i was doing society a service that's illegal in the state of virginia you know what are you talking about i was just gonna ask you why no one sees themselves as evil oh i thought you were gonna ask me about my threat on kiwi farms no i don't even know what that is i'm asking because i'm stumped in this case with hush puppy i mean look he blatantly stole money from people but then when he gets money stolen from him he gets angry about it like can't he see he's the bad guy well speaking strictly psychologically this phenomena has been around for a while ever hear the story of two gun crowley no but it sounds like a badass bad guy name yeah but that's just it this guy didn't see himself as a bad guy even though he killed people he later wrote a letter that said under my coat is a weary heart but a kind one one that would do nobody any harm do you think he actually believed that i have no idea but the way i see it this hush puppy probably thinks the same way they see all their own faults as forgivable and other people's actions as unforgivable that's just the way it is colloquially i believe you humans refer to them as giant huh that's actually pretty insightful thanks but with that out of the way can we finally talk about chris shan i've been dying to talk about christian i have no idea what you're talking about [music] apologize but really somehow you ain't saying much but a waster someone with their fame up you took from everyone including all your day ones i can't believe it still the truth you need a spill you prove the greed is real you can't delete it chill from the start it was doomed to fail i heard you can't go to the moon from jail
