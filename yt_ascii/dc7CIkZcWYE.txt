old computer hardware doesn't slow down we've proven it multiple times so then why does your old pc feel so much slower than when you first got it the answer lies in the software and it's the same reason that your phone feels slower as it ages each subsequent windows update adds features and bloat that can drag down performance so then well what do you have to run an old operating system full of compatibility and security issues no there's a new kid on the block its name is atlas os and thanks to acer sponsoring this video to promote their recent earthion green initiatives we're going to be taking it for a spin with some hardware that is so obsolete that we paid less for this entire box than the cost of the included windows license let's see if we can get this puppy running like new spoiler we can and it is super awesome our adventure begins with a bog standard obsolete big box store pc we wanted something from acer of course since keeping old electronics out of the landfill was a huge motivation for them to sponsor this video and we settled on the aspire tc780. it's in that weird anti-goldylocks zone it's too new to be retro and too old to be current and most businesses would basically just pay a recycler to haul these things away by the pallet full which is good because it means they go for cheap we paid 150 canadian dollars or about 110 us and that included the keyboard and mouse which weren't amazing but let's say we could flip them for 10 bucks giving us a total of a hundred us dollars for our tower internally i don't know it's probably oh seen better days anthony you're fixed for the dead fan is still on here spoiler spoiler we have to fix a dead fan i'll get to that later one moment please overall nothing a can of dust off can't fix and she powers on 4 pin cpu power 24-pin motherboard connector oh front usb 3. that's nice to see and four pin for our cpu fan also standard matx motherboard and atx power supply this is going to make the process of refurbishing this thing a lot easier well isn't that just fantastic wow does this even have m.2 support anthony it does what that's awesome 7th gen had m.2 support yeah oh i guess this is as good a time as any to talk about the cpu in here it's a core i5 7400 so it's four cores four threads 3.5 gigahertz max boost it was kind of the seventh gen's bang for the buck cpu with higher core clocks than its predecessors but at the same cost not only was it less expensive but compared to higher end chips it had a 65 watt tdp and could easily be cooled with low cost heatsinks making it a great choice for a budget system for that reason we're not actually going to replace this almost intel stock cooler in here we're just gonna destroy our lungs by wiping it down and we're going to put a new fan on it i wonder how many people worth of dead skin cells i've inhaled over the years of doing this it's a really uncomfortable thoughts what's not uncomfortable is that 400 class core i5s have long been considered excellent value for gaming with the more recent 12 400 and 13 400 being solid contenders for entry and mid-range gamers for us though there is absolutely no need whatsoever to change anything in here we're just going to get some zip ties put this just random fan we found it happens to be in knoxville but yours doesn't have to be put this random fan in here and we should be off to the races look at this i found an 80 millimeter fan kicking around and i don't even need to zip tie it anymore totally lines up twice now we just plug this into the cpu fan header and no need to change anything here in time you might find that multiplayer games are going to demand more cores but it's certainly enough for a responsive desktop experience today and could even be upcycled later into a home server solid investment moving on our current ram configuration is a little suspect we've got a four gig stick and an eight gig stick for a total of 12 gigs which is a lot of ram but not ideal because we're not getting dual channel and the speeds of these sticks are mismatched at 2133 and 2400 mega transfers per second unfortunately the bios of this machine does not support xmp or setting the ram speeds manually so it will simply match the speed of the slowest stick to ensure compatibility our best course of action then is to pull out our four gig stick here see you later and replace it with another 8 gig similar speed dim time tech these can be found online for about 20 bucks since their slower speed makes them not super desirable now you could potentially flip that four gig stick to recoup a little bit of your cost but i think it's probably worth more as a spare for troubleshooting so i would probably hold on to it now let's power this up and for a total of 30 bucks for a stick of ram and a generic 80 millimeter fan we should have 16 gigs four cores and a working cooler there are still some things we need to do yes we're going to do hard drives but first we're gonna do power supply now the power supply that's in here is an fsp unit good brand rated for 300 watts continuous which is probably fine too like this was a perfect fit for the original hardware and probably perfectly reliable with the cpu's 65 watt tdp and no gpu it probably never ran at more than 50 percent of its capacity but the lack of pcie power and the possibility that it's deteriorated over time to become less efficient means we should probably replace it proactively if we have space in our budget with that said don't throw it out you can still totally use this thing as a hobbyist benchtop power supply if you're so inclined and personally i use what i call doorstop power supplies for all kinds of things like just running fans for example to cool something outside of a computer like they're just very very useful one nice thing about the old school ketchup and mustard style cables is that they're color coded for voltage red is 5 volt yellow is 12 volt and black is ground so you can put whatever connectors you want on these things as long as you don't overload the rails which are conveniently labeled on the side and power whatever you want for a replacement we don't need something super powerful we just want to make sure that we do our homework and get something decent so we settled on this evga 400 watt unit that is a power supply i mean i mean it doesn't really we're not recommending the cheapest possible thing evga does stand behind their products rip evga graphics cards which they still existed it doesn't have modular cables and you know ketchup and mustard make a triumphant return but it's more than enough for what we're going to be doing this is actually an older unit but as the lab ramps up their testing we're going to be building a database of the performance characteristics of every budget power supply so that whether you're refurbing an old machine or building a new budget machine from scratch you can get something decent without overspending oh on that subject are water bottles on lttstore.com are all the same price regardless of capacity you can get any size you want without overspending now while i pointed out earlier that our board supports m.2 drives we don't necessarily need the fastest drive you can get an inexpensive 500 gig ssd for about 40 bucks on sale or even a one terabyte for around sixty dollars ssds have gotten shockingly inexpensive lately for us we're going with an old wd blue 250 gig and the main reason is that you can pick these up for even cheaper on craigslist or facebook marketplace thankfully acer included mounts for two and a half inch drives are they toolless nope all together now the correct number of screws for a two and a half inch ssd is one that's good enough right yeah she's not going anywhere this is an extra screw now the place for an extra screw is not inside the chassis that's true that's true that's bad what i showed you just now in fact i'm gonna punish myself by making myself put in another drive for the ssd so add a data or say to data there's gonna be a war in the comments tonight everyone typing it it's it's a data i can't tell which one it's a little late in the day we all just want to go home now there are many gpus available on the second hand market that would suit our needs just fine we could go super low end here 1050 tis can be had for under a hundred dollars but the bang for the buck of the 1660 ti is hard to argue with it should be able to gain at 1080p medium at least in this system and it fits within our thermal power and space constraints these go for around 200 new that's a lot but this is the e-waste pc so realistically we would suggest picking up a secondhand one on ebay for anywhere from 100 to 150 us dollars the 1660 ti doesn't have av1 codec support but it'll accelerate h.264 and h.265 and has the higher quality nvank encoder whatever value gpu you end up going with though be aware that some require resizable bar to reach their full potential and older systems like these don't always support it fortunately acer still has the full support side up for this desktop which is great and super important for helping looks like us extend their life spans step power oh and also this i guess why is this not clipping anymore did i break it did did you break it okay bro it was all working oh i bent it i bent it real good nice plug the hdmi into that now obviously this isn't gonna boot until we configure our ssd with an operating system let's talk about that thankfully our system has usb 3 otherwise this process would be a little on the slow side we're just going to fire up the media creation tool plug in a usb drive and while this is imaging acer sent over their vero laptop full disclosure i have a stake in framework a competitor but acer has clearly been making great strides of their own when it comes to sustainable computers starting with an easy to open chassis and non-soldered components this is what they're calling a green pc and it's part of their earthion initiative it's acer's mission platform for a greener future and it's literally green which is because this is super cool you can actually see the flex of post-consumer plastics just kind of mashed together in order to make this chassis i actually kind of like it earthion encompasses everything from product design and packaging all the way through to production logistics and recycling this particular one is powered by intel's 13th gen core processors that is intel evo verified there's enough horsepower on tap to handle most tasks while maximizing battery life meaning you need to charge less often which prolongs battery health when you do need to charge its fast charge capability means you can add four hours of endurance with just 30 minutes on the wall and their ultimate goal is to bring in their business partners and use their shared technology to change the world for the greener you can join the movement by advocating for sustainability wherever you can or simply by living a greener life we're doing our part today by pulling potential e-waste from the landfill but if you're not up for all this work choosing to support initiatives like earthion and machines like the vero can help of course you still want to see what this little thing can do though right and you're saying the trackpad is made of ocean plastic yeah it's made from ocean bound plastic the entire chassis is 30 post-consumer recycled materials so that is super cool yeah you might be wondering why not 100 post consumer materials we've actually been learning a lot about this for our acoustic panel project you just can't because of the unpredictable way that little shrink after molding but 30 percent pretty darn good especially post consumer because i think we were able to get as high as like 45 but that was just re-ground new plastic that wasn't post-consumer well you want to know what's even better yeah the keycaps are 50 percent sure shut up they don't even look or feel like bad yeah even the keycaps 50 pcr i don't know how they managed that yeah that's super cool here while this is doing its thing i'm just gonna open it because it looks like it's that easy right it's all phillips screws see the thing is i don't care if my investment wins or if everyone else just does better i just want more stuff like this in the long term i want to see this kind of concept make its way into their higher tier products but i understand you've got to start somewhere and obviously you've got to mitigate the risk of the development somehow so starting with something that's relatively small is a way you can do that i just need one clip to release so that i can get under it did you get it open anthony yeah oh okay i wonder if part of this is just because of the plastics that might be that might actually be why there's so many clips and screws yeah because there's the tolerances are going to be not as tight with this post-consumer plastic there it is socketed ram socketed ssd everything very easy to access in here actually socketed wi-fi which you can't even take for granted anymore these days that didn't used to be impressive but now i'm seeing a lot of soldered wi-fi two screws on the battery total that's it very cool i gotta say this started out as just sort of sponsor talking points and has turned into i'm pretty impressed this seems to be more than just paying lip service to green this is like super serviceable okay editor good luck before we gain though i feel like we should do a peel here oh ew this is very old electrical tape it's icky oh what why did they why did they put on tape to keep the peasters and you know who you are because nobody else put on tape quite like you did let's play some games oh wait well first i guess we should just sort of navigate the operating system right you know chrome launch yeah all right and we're not screen recording locally it's an hdmi pass-through to a separate pc so it won't affect performance in any way things are definitely a little bit hitchy this is a standard windows 10 install fully up to date with some mild manual decluttering so we uninstalled onedrive skype etc it's chugging a little whether we're talking alt tabbing out of games launching programs i mean even start menu animations it's chugging a little there's no denying that while we wait for this to load is a perfect time to talk about atlas os you might remember the video we did on windows 10 ameliorated a project that got pulled because they were technically distributing windows isos without microsoft's approval well atlas os used to do the same thing but thanks to the efforts of ameliorated dev actrons is now using a new framework called ame wizard that lets you do all of the ripping and tearing out of excess bloat post install meaning that they can do what they used to do but they no longer need to distribute pre-modded isos so the whole thing is fully above board we've actually got an early access version of it here and by the time this video goes live you should be able to download it for yourself it'll work not only on older hardware but also on modern hardware which is super cool okay we're gonna try our little halo game then we're gonna fire things up with atlas os double kill okay well there's no denying it it's a gaming machine for gamers rage quit let's fire up atlas os we did some movie magic anthony's the one who set up atlas os ahead of time i haven't touched it yet i am super stoked check this out the e-waste pc love it all right google chrome interesting why don't you take a look at the process list is that it whoa whoa this is markedly more responsive i don't even need the side by side this feels like a brand spanking new machine look at that look at her go you know this basically kills linux as like well right because that's what people use linux for is getting more life out of old hardware that can't run windows anymore if you can run windows with this kind of performance jeepers creepers i mean even nvidia control panel launches without being dog slow with that said i am not expecting markedly better performance in games that's really just constrained by your gpu however you know we might get a little less stutter if our cpu is less busy working away at background crap i just got rid of my last windows 8.1 embedded industry pro i'm just going to use this why not right this is awesome oh man what this is on a quad core from seven years ago quad core four threads she's responsive you're losing telemetry automatic updates that's probably something they turned off i don't know i actually haven't looked that closely at it let's talk memory usage right now look at how quickly i can check that we're at five gigs with halo infinite running and that's 2.4 gigs so we are sitting at just over two gigs of total system use other than no because another over 200 megs is also steam this is incredible our ram usage outside of halo and steam is like negligible i know this is a lot of hoops to jump through to extend old hardware shelf life and you can obviously only go so far before you are adding to the e-waste problem just like buying more stuff to what be greener that's why it's important to think carefully about the computers you buy a machine with enough power to handle what you need today and a bit of room to grow into tomorrow always a good bet and recycled material construction and packaging are huge bonuses if you want to be environmentally conscious equally important is that old hardware like this doesn't have to die just because software keeps getting more bloated for less than 350 bucks here we've got a machine that may be a little old but is still totally capable of handling modern titles at decent settings this is 1080p medium life doesn't always have to be about the latest and greatest especially when the environmental cost can be so high remember the three r's reduce use and recycle are in that order for a reason now with a 13th gen core processor back to our sponsor acer's aspire bureau has plenty of power for today and tomorrow but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give alice os a try on it if nothing else it should contribute to battery life savings on top of the vero's already impressive endurance which as acer already had us point out to you is good for the longevity of your battery as well and hey later on down the road when it's time to upgrade who's to say you can't use it for something else like streaming serving media or even a thin client its more modular design makes repairs easier and is already made out of recycled materials they've taken care of the reduce and recycle so it's on you to reuse and we're going to have this length down below now it's time to play some more halo infinite here oh it's capture the flag well thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like and subscribe maybe go check out the video on reusing your old computer as a server that's a good one a really good video i really liked it i hosted it but not biased at all right not biased at all i didn't write the video it was somebody else who wrote it [music]
