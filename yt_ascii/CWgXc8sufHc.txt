it's 2022 and you're ready to learn a new skill 
maybe this is for a new job or job promotion   what better way to learn your first or maybe just 
another programming language i can guarantee when   you are about to learn a new programming language 
whether you have learned tons in the past or this   is your first one one of the first challenges that 
you are going to come across right off the bat is   well what programming language do i learn there 
are so many out there so many to choose from which   one is right for me hey friends welcome back to my 
channel today we are going to be talking about the   top programming languages to learn in 2022 these 
are based on the top job postings on linkedin from   both europe and usa so whatever job postings we're 
requiring the number one programming language the   number two programming language that is what 
we are going to cover today before we get into   it though make sure to hit that subscribe button 
for more tech and coding related content give this   video a thumbs up and don't forget to leave in 
the comments other videos you want to see that's   how i make these videos so leave in comments 
what you want to see okay let's get right to it okay we're here again with my trusty whiteboard 
you can see i live in canada so it's not even   5pm and it's already getting a little 
dark outside but we got this we got this   okay coming at number five for the top most 
popular programming languages is c sharp and for a little fun fact about c sharp 
the first time microsoft used the name c   sharp was back in 1988. 
let's go talk more about it c sharp is an object-oriented programming 
language that is commonly used with   microsoft's.net framework many of the advantages 
and features of c-sharp are tied closely to   net which is why they team really well together so 
why should you learn sharp well to start off with   it's a very useful and flexible language with 
a very expressive syntax that usually makes it   pretty easy to pick up not to mention if you are 
familiar with c c plus plus or java you should be   able to pick up this language relatively quickly 
that being said if it's your first programming   language don't worry don't fret it still will be 
pretty simple to pick up as long as you stick with   it read the documentation do some tutorials and 
keep on going what can you build with c-sharp   i'm sure is the next question well pretty much 
anything whether it's business applications games   web apps mobile tablet apps and so much more for 
example video games is something that c-sharp is   commonly used to create this is because c-sharp 
can quickly develop games for both windows   android ios and mac os one of the most popular 
game developing platforms is unity and c-sharp is   one of the more common programming languages used 
on that platform so i'm sure you want to visualize   some games that are made with c sharp some of them 
include shadowrun returns rust wasteland 2 and   hearthstone hearthstone i don't know if 
i'm saying that right i'm not a huge gamer   okay another area where c sharp is commonly used 
is in anti-hacking software now in a world that   there is so much put around cyber security and 
anti-hacking software c-sharp is more and more in   demand because it is being used in that sector and 
not to mention it helps build a ton of different   mobile apps some that you may be familiar with 
include slack pinterest tableau the world bank   fox sports just to name a few so if your next 
question is where do i learn c sharp i'm not going   to give one specific resource because there are 
so many online that it varies based on your past   experience with programming languages for me 
overall i really like to use udemy though youtube   has some great tutorials and where else do i like 
to do free code camp i'll link some links down for   each programming language that we covered today 
for some examples of courses on each language okay coming in at number four is c plus plus a 
little fun fact about c plus plus is that it was   actually called the first name of it was called 
the new c the new c i think i kind of like that c   plus plus was developed by bajarn straus 
struck i'm sorry if i'm butchering that name   as an extension to the c language and c plus 
plus gives programmers a high level of control   over the control system resources and memory so 
once again you're probably asking the question   well why should i learn or consider learning 
c plus well to start off with it's one of   the world's most popular programming languages or 
else i guess it wouldn't be on this list it can be   found and used in both operating systems graphical 
user interfaces and embedded systems so it's   really its use can be it can be used for a lot of 
different areas in the tech sector not to mention   as we just spoke about c sharp if you know c sharp 
or java c plus plus is another language that is   pretty easy to pick up or switch between that 
being said as i mentioned before if you have no   experience it doesn't mean you can't learn c plus 
plus it just might take a little bit more time   okay some of my favorite applications are actually 
written with c plus so i want to talk about them   starting with adobe photoshop and illustrator so 
photoshop is obviously one of the most popular and   advanced graphic editors out there and this is an 
application that was pretty much changed the game   in photo editing and is still one in my opinion 
one of the best applications to work with for   photo editing c plus plus was part of building 
adobe photoshop and illustrator and it's a really   great example of what c plus plus can do meaning 
it works very well with that type of advanced apps   it's extremely fast and able to perform very 
well even when it's managing a lot of data   another application that is used or sorry 
built with c plus plus is spotify this auto   streaming app the back end is written with c 
plus and once again another great example of c   plus and its power managing all the data enormous 
amount of data i should add and c plus plus makes   it all possible okay and the app that we are on 
youtube youtube was written by with many different   programming languages when i was reading about it 
but the area that was built with c plus was the   video processing part and that obviously is one 
of the most important parts and it was written all   with c plus plus so i think after going through 
some of these more powerful apps you really get   the point that c plus is one of the most powerful 
programming languages out there it is versatile   and it's not going anywhere anytime soon so if 
you are interested in picking up a new programming   language this is definitely one to consider okay 
coming in at number three no surprise here is   javascript which is my favorite language so 
we gotta really really emphasize that one okay here's a really fun fact about javascript 
that i even didn't know until i started googling   fun facts about javascript which is you 
can actually use the semicolon you know   many programming languages use a semicolon 
at the end of a statement in javascript you   can use it also at the beginning i haven't 
tried this out yet so i'm going to try this   out after the video so i'm really curious to 
see if it actually works but according to the   internet and many different sites you can 
use the semicolon at the beginning which is   kind of mind-blowing so we gotta go test that 
out test down and comment if it works for you javascript i'm not going to lie is probably my 
favorite programming language i know a lot of   you will either love that or hate that but i 
think the reality is it's my favorite because   it was the first programming language i ever 
learned so when you learn something your   initial learning i feel like you get a little 
attached to it or it's like your first love   and for me that was javascript i also really like 
it because you can write both the front end and   back end with it so it's very versatile language 
i can build different applications with it i can   build different websites with it it's just it's 
it's flexible unlike me so javascript allows you   to set up dynamic and interactive content animated 
graphics and other complex features all on the web   maybe in past years i would say javascript is 
more of a client-side language in that it executes   within the web browser however more and more 
it's increasingly being used on the server side   with runtime platforms such as node.js and 
other frameworks i love you node node's one   of my favorites as well by the way 97 of the 
world's websites use javascript to some degree   i'm going to give a few examples but i'm 
sure your mind can just go to pretty much   any website you use and you could 
think that javascript is part of it   some famous apps that are built using javascript 
include netflix candy crush facebook uber linkedin   and so much more you get the point it's 
extremely widely used and honestly it's a pretty   friendly language to pick up it has its quirk 
so i'll say that but from someone who learned   it there is our first programming language i think 
it's a really good language to pick up first okay   coming in at number two is java fun fact about 
java actually is it was actually originally called   oak i'm curious to know if you knew that or not if 
you did leave down in the comments this name was   originally done by let me see what was done james 
gosling who was a developer and he literally took   inspiration from the oak tree outside his office 
later it was changed to java by other developers this is a fun fact about java that i didn't 
really know actually and it's also one of the   most popular or is the most popular language 
for iot devices so internet of things devices   and that's pretty cool because as we just 
recently spoke about in one of our other videos   will smart devices become a thing of the past 
iot touches everything and it's continuing and   continuing to grow so the demand for java as a 
programming language i truly believe will continue   to grow although it's still huge and massive right 
now according to some people online specifically   coding nomads java is considered harder to learn 
than python but easier than c or c plus plus   so it's kind of in the middle there on the plus 
side though once you master something like java   learning something such as python or even 
javascript will seem much easier so it's kind   of like you start out hard and then the other ones 
are are easier some applications that are built   with java or at least part of them are built with 
java include spotify twitter cache apps signal   and so much more so you'll kind of start seeing 
that the apps i'm referring to because i'm   speaking about some of the more popular apps 
that we are all familiar with you'll see kind of   an overlap for example another app that is built 
with java includes netflix and we just spoke about   how javascript was built built part of netflix 
as well so it's really important to recognize   and keep in mind that a lot of these bigger 
applications or massive applications they're   definitely not just built with one programming 
language a lot of times there's one programming   language used for the front one for the back or 
maybe even multiple okay coming at number one   we have python no surprise here and we're going 
to speak about it just in a second here but   first a fun fact did you know python wasn't 
actually named after the snake but actually   the creator of python was a huge fan of the tv 
or the comedy tv show monty python hence python okay i'm sure there's no surprise here that i 
listed python as number one programming language   in demand based on linkedin's most top or the top 
programming languages for job postings python has   been getting so much attention i would say the 
past two two and three years maybe past two years   for sure it's been around longer than that but 
it's been getting a lot of attention recently   and there's a lot of reasons why one of the 
main ones being python is easy to pick up   and now i'm when i say easy to pick up if it's 
your first programming language don't get mad   at me and be like if you said this was easy i'm 
still not figuring it out it still takes time   to kind of master it but it definitely is one of 
the easier or easy what's it easier programming   languages to pick up and i think another 
reason that python is so popular is because   it can be used for so many different things 
so it's a general purpose server-side language   python is used from tasks such as simple 
scripting to advanced web applications and   artificial intelligence so it really can be used 
for so many different things from data science to   building applications to you know artificial 
intelligence that once you learn python it's like   your world is your oyster actually fun fact about 
python when i'm searching different applications   that it has helped built is python is recognized 
as the official language at google so it's one of   the key languages at google today which is pretty 
interesting alongside c plus and java so that's   pretty cool and of course it builds a ton of other 
apps for a part of apps such as spotify netflix   uber dropbox pinterest we've listed a lot of these 
before because it's just these massive companies   are not just going to use one programming language 
but it's really cool to see that they are using   pretty much all on the list to some degree or 
different ones are to different degrees meaning   you're pretty safe to learn any of these 
programming languages that it is in demand okay let's talk candidly here though do you really 
need to worry about what programming language you   learn first or the next programming language you 
learn i think at the end of the day it's one of   our biggest challenges that we have to overcome is 
not getting so caught up in the mundane things yes   learning a popular programming language that 
is in demand is super important especially if   you want to level up your job or get a new 
job however don't let the fear of choosing   the right programming language actually stop you 
from going after what you want from learning how   to code from growing your skills i remember when 
i first learned how to code i would switch between   so many different programming languages because i 
was scared i wasn't learning the right one and i   really wanted to highlight that because don't let 
that fear or that uncertainty of not picking the   right language stop you even if you learn java but 
then the job posting is requiring for javascript   they're not going to not choose you just because 
you don't know the right programming language   if it's a good company they will have an 
understanding that you know a different   programming language and because of that you 
have those skill sets that you can learn a   programming language they know you can easily 
probably pick up another one so don't get too   caught up on that at the end of the day throughout 
our career as programmers as software developers   we will have to learn many different languages 
typically and one of the biggest challenges is   once again just being comfortable with that 
although it can feel very uncomfortable okay   i'm gonna end this video here i hope this was very
