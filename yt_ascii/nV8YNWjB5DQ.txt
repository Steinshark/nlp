hey you all know me you know i love polyhedrons 
where the other day i learned something new that   i didn't previously realize about a wonderful 
alignment in how you can arrange i mean check it   out here it is right look at how you can arrange 
polyhedrons polyhedra your choice and it's not   just theoretical someone actually did it isn't 
that absolutely incredible so i want to share   with you this amazing new polyhedrin plane [music] 
quick any other business i'm doing unnecessary   detail in bristol uk on the 12th of march come and 
say hi and applications for jane street's academy   of math and programming are now open more details 
about that at the end of the video my journey of   discovery started when my mate glenn whitney 
uh and some of his colleagues came up with an   idea where people could send in polyhedrons that 
they would then display in an art installation of   course i wanted to get involved but i thought i 
would include all of you so i did a live stream   this is a couple months ago where viewers watching 
it helped me work out what polyhedron i was going   to build hey hello so welcome to me on my second 
channel i'm here to build a shape okay well let's   let's let's just start chucking these together 
otherwise i'm never going to eat why did we   just make the tetrahedron come on focus okay i'm 
calling i'm calling it this is the shape we're   done that's it there i'm sorry the auto focus 
doesn't seem to be coop there it is in fol look at   that three blue one gold it's the tetrahedron we 
all didn't know we needed it'll be in new jersey   mid april check out the poly plane website 
linked in the description and go marvel at this   mighty polyhedron glenn and friends took all the 
shakes people posted in and decided to hang them   in a massive cuboid which means they had three 
decisions for every shape because there's three   dimensions three axes there's three different ways 
they can adjust the location of any one polyhedron   they're going to hang and i've got a simulation 
here of some of the choices they could have made   this is a geer file that my friend ben very kindly 
made for me there's the empty cuboid waiting to   have some shapes hung in it in fact i'll turn 
on tetesan there we are there's mine look at   that i mean do not necessarily going to put 
it there i just thought i' show you there's   one there in fact we'll turn on the rest we got 
a cube we got an octahedron and we got the rest   of these to start with these are not you know any 
particular arrangement they're just kind of lined   up ready to go we got a few prisms we got these 
are like jewel pyramids back to back and we got   our friend ponic solids and a square base pyramid 
why not they're all set to go so let's make one   choice let's put them with this is the number 
of faces on one axis over here this is the total   volume for a unit side length over there and then 
this axis is vertices on big face so that's why   this octagon prism is all the way out here by 
itself it's got the face with the most vertices   on it there anything made from triangles where 
triangle the the biggest or the most complex shape   that appears over here like that and so that's 
one way to arrange them and i don't know i guess   you can kind of see some things coming out there's 
not obvious patterns let's switch to another one   this is edges on one edge this is number of edges 
on this edge haha total surface area on this   axis and then the radius of the circum sphere on 
the third axis and what can we see now i mean   there's some in like obviously oh okay so surface 
area this has got a lot of surface area for the   volume it contains well this is where the 
radius of the circum sphere is not quite volume   maybe we should have done volume anyway so 
ben sparks who made this we had a chat about   different ways we could put things on the various 
axes to see what kind of patterns we would see but   once again they're kind of all over the place so 
let's switch to something nice and simple this is   number of vertices on one axis number of edges on 
another number of faces on the third and so now if   we have a have a little look at these we got oh 
wait a minute they all they all line up look at   that so now they perfectly align in a single 
flat plane i can actually turn on that plane   there you are so they're all look at that they're 
all in that one flat plane isn't that absolutely   incredible and this is just for the ones that 
ben and i put in as an example so the question   now is if you take all the random polyhedra sent 
in by people to glenn and you hang all of them   according to number of faces number of vertices 
number of edges in 3d space will you get this   fantastic plane the only way to find out is to see 
the installation and amazingly i was able to see   glenn's math insulation yes math because it and i 
happen to be at the same conference it's just up   here the joint math meeting is happening in san 
francisco usa they have installed it in the main   exhibition space the installation now involves 
hanging all of these shapes in a very specific way   i'm so excited to show you this i'm going to head 
up see if i can find it i was so excited walking   across the main exhibition floor in the distance 
i could see a lot of very colorful very chaotic   shapes all suspended inside a cuboid yes this is 
the installation noun not verb of all the shapes   that had been sent in and sure enough if you look 
at it from just the right angle they all line up   on the one plane some of you may already realize 
where they all lie in that one plane in fact that   was the whole point of the installation it's 
called poly plane because all the polyhedra are   in the same plane now if you know know why that's 
fine but i was still struck by the mathematical   beauty of how a few different math concepts all 
knit together to make this incredible installation   possible starting with oil's polyhedrin formula 
which says the number of vertices subtract the   number of edges plus the number of faces for 
any polyhedron with no cheeky holes in it will   always equal two and this seems like as good 
a time as any to actually prove that the first   factor we need is that any nice polyhedron can be 
projected down into a planer graph so here i have   the case for a cube there's a cube floating 
above a plane and we're projecting it down   onto that plane at the moment this is not planer 
which just means that there are lines crossing   each other so this edge goes through this edge in 
terms of its projection down to that flat surface   however there's always somewhere you can put your 
projection point such that there we are such that   now we have a planer graph absolutely nothing is 
cross in anywhere and as far as we're concerned   mathematically this cube is equivalent to this 
projection and it works for more complicated   shapes check out this octahedron so you got way 
way way more faces and again we can move this   around a bit until we get it somewhere like that 
is that done yeah there we are so that works too   so any shape can become a planer graph to make our 
life simple going forwards we're going to use the   graph from my tetrahedron the three blue one brown 
as simple as it gets tetrahedron and it's graph   there you got well there's still the four faces 
there's the one two three faces and the fourth   face that would be underneath if you imagine this 
is kind of looking down on it is actually wrapped   out the outside becomes a face as well so those 
are our four faces you still see the four vertices   they're now the vertices of the graph and all six 
edges are there as edges of the graph and what   we're trying to prove is if you take the number 
of vertices subtract the number of edges add the   number of faces you get two if you ever forget the 
order of those they go up in increasing numbers of   dimensions that the things exist in so vertices 
are zero dimensional points then you go up to   edges that are onedimensional lines and then faces 
that are two-dimensional polygons and oh and it   works in higher dimensions as well you continue 
that where you put them in the increasing number   of dimensions for each component and you alternate 
the the subtract and add but it equals either two   or zero based on i think it's two or z based on 
if you're on in an order and even dimension anyway   we're looking at 3d shapes projected down into 2d 
and we're going to do our proof by initially   ignoring the edges going take them all out forget 
the whole graph we're going to replace it with a   much much easier graph this is what's called a 
spanning tree graph so we're using graph instead   of network because mathematicians a tree graph 
is one with no cycles so i'm going to fill in just   three of the the edges and this is a tree graph 
because everything branches but never recombines   which means we have now only got one face so 
because we have lost these other edges here   there's just this one single face because if there 
are no cycles it can't section off one face as a   region distinct from the rest of the plane so now 
we just have this one massive massive face and if   you think about a spanning tree graph so spanding 
means it goes through every single vertex we now   definitely have one more vertex than edges which 
i kind of think about it in terms of like a fence   post thing but you can imagine the way you would 
grow this you start with one initial vertex and   each time you add an edge to another one you go up 
by one edge you go up by one vertex another edge   another vertex another edge another vertex however 
you want to think about it convince yourself for a   tree graph there's always one more vertex than 
edge which means up here if you got vertexes   subtract or vertices subtract edges you end up 
with one because there's always one more vertex   than edges then if you want to add on the number 
of faces with there's one face one single face so   add the face equals 2 so this is definitely true 
for our reduced case with a spanish tree graph now   we need to get back to our whole shape because 
that's what we want to prove this for so we're   going to add the edges back in one at a time and 
each time we add an edge obviously the number of   edges is going to go up but if you add an edge 
you also add a face because every edge we add   sections off another region we're always closing a 
well at least a cycle so if you add in that first   edge there you've now got one extra face so that 
means the number of edges has gone up but at the   same time time the number of faces has gone up and 
we're subtracting edges and we're adding faces so   we have to subtract off one more edge and add on 
one more face which cancels out and that's the   case for all of them we put on another edge over 
here one more edge one more face cancels out even   like if we're adding an internal edge internal for 
this arrangement we pop that in one more face one   more edge cancels out we can rebuild the entire 
shape by adding in edges and each time we add in   one more edge doesn't matter matter cuz it also 
adds in one more face and those cancel out so i   guess the nice fact you have to trust me on is 
that any graph from a polyhedron can be covered   with a spanning tree but if you're happy with all 
of that we've now got a hand wavy proof that   oilers polyhedrin formula is indeed true you'll 
always get to if you would like a nicer proof of   that a very very old three blue one brown video 
one of the original ones is a proof of this very   thing except grant uses the concept of a duel 
graph some of you may be familiar with duel   shapes where you swap faces for vertices and 
vertices for faces you can do the same thing   with a graph it's a really nice proof i'll link 
to it below fine we know oiless thing works and   the numbers of vertices edges and faces on the 
three different axes are somehow linked but why   does that relationship between them give you a 
plane for that we have to look at the equation   of a plane and for that we're going to start with 
the equation of a line i have here the classic   y = mx + c you can replace m and c with whatever 
letters the country you did your formative   education in happens to use it doesn't matter 
please you may argue about it in the comments   knock yourself out i'm actually i'm quite curious 
which countries have which letters but we've got m   here for the gradient so if i alter the m in the 
equation it just tips the line around and we've   got c so if i alter c it's just the you know 
the vertical the y intercept and that's enough   to get any possible line by moving up and down 
the vertical intercept and changing the gradient   you can hit any line you want but that's not the 
only way to write the equation of a line instead   of having y on one side and x on the other side 
hanging out with a constant why not put x and y   on one side and put the constant on the other 
so here i can flip the representation and once   again huge thanks to ben for making this for me 
now we've got a multiple of x plus a multiple of   y equals some constant which in this case we've 
set to one and still the the multiple of y if i   move b around that still changes the vertical 
intercept but now it's it's actually if i move the   multiple around in this case it's the inverse 
of it gives you the intercept but it's exactly   the same i can choose where i want that to cross 
the vertical axis and a is the other one i can   choose where it crosses the horizontal axis so now 
instead of choosing one intercept and the gradient   i just choose both intercepts and that still gives 
us every possible line and this is what we do one   dimension higher here we are in three dimensions 
we've got a * x plus b * y + c * z and they equal   a constant we happened to call d and we can move 
them around so there's the a1 i can move around   that's the xaxis intercept i can move around 
the y axis intercept and i can move around the   z ais intercept actually if i turn on the graph 
it's a plane we've defined a plane by you know if   you have any three intercept points on the three 
orthogonal axes that gives you the definition of a   plane and you can get any plane you want by moving 
a b and c we've also given a slideer a d it just   scales everything up and down and so often you'll 
see different values for the constant instead   of one but for any of those you could i mean you 
could divide through by that value through x well   through a b and c to adjust the intercept points 
so i mean it's equivalent you only need three   variables to define a plane and that's exactly 
what's happened here i love this installation so   much because it gets to the heart of for me what 
mathematical beauty is where seemingly unrelated   things have the same logic and pattern behind them 
in this case you have oilers characteristic where   the oiler polinomial formula tells you that the 
three things are linked by equaling a constant and   you've got the notion of the equation of a plane 
in 3d space which is the same form so if you set   vertices edges and faces as the three dimensions 
of 3d space you end up with the same form of an   equation for a plane so the shapes match the 
plane oh it's so good i love it so much the   big question of course is where is my shape and 
because it is the tetraedron with its mere four   faces six edges and oh it is four vertices 
is right here a little unceremoniously in the   corner and now for this long of grant sanderson 
complaining about what constitutes an edge which   one upsets you the most oh oh easily this one 
right right because oh i mean it's just the am   st no cuz you're supposed to under i'm actually 
not sure how you're supposed to understand i think   you're supposed to understand that these are ed 
is so as opposed to what anyal each little dedon   is an edge each dedon is a point right and then 
you think of those points being connected into   ed so it's just and so one i suppose is invited to 
ignore the giant number of holes in a topic which   is usually all about counting the number of holes 
and i suppose one is supposed to ignore the fact   that you've got like an enormous number of faces 
and vertices and edges that should get it like   way is the argument that some of these are like 
frames yeah yeah po yeah yeah yeah i think that's   that's what they're going because you have a very 
eclectic style on like how they're even made or   what they're made of or how you're supposed to 
interpret the faces and the eclectic nature is   maybe artistically nice but arguably pedagogically 
confusing if you were trying to you know   educate a small child about the nature yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah cuz there's a lot of like no no   no don't count this as a face that's not but then 
you go to this one you're like no but do count   this as a face cuz this cu this one was made by 
alex who you know who's part of the installation   well yeah but because he's like a mathematician 
and he like you know he's like what's what's   the whole point of this what's the whole point 
of like oiler characteristic he's like what's   more fun is to get something that's off the plane 
that you can count the hes can see that and so he   deliberately does that i'm assuming you may have 
noticed some 3d printed shapes are way off to the   side i mean still still on the plane but nowhere 
near the other shapes and that's because friend   of the channel henry seaman thought it would be 
very funny to bend the rules as much as possible   while still strictly speaking staying inside 
the rules i mean matt may think it's bending   the rules but to a topologist this beach ball 
shape is a perfectly sensible polyhedrin there's   a verx at the top a verx at the bottom and nine 
different edges connect in them together which   isn't a problem unless you insist on straight 
lines there are also nine faces each with only   two sides which again isn't a problem if you're 
a topologist so there are nine faces nine edges   and two vertices and 2 - 9 + 9 is 2 as expected 
this one is a tetrahedron which would have oiler   characteristic to as usual except that i added a 
bunch of vertices along the edges those are the   blob things every time you add a vertex you also 
split an edge in two so both the vertices and the   edges go up by one which which never changes the 
oiler characteristic so it's still two as an aside   when ben and i were putting together this yra file 
where everything is plotted according to vertices   faces edges we notice not only does everything lie 
on this plane which now i can label there it is   the oiless characteristic and the equation look at 
that so good everything lines up so neatly we then   realized that the shapes are forming two straight 
lines and that's because we could choose the ones   we plotted and we picked a bunch which were jewels 
of each other and i can put on there's a central   line here so that middle line on it i'm going 
to zoom in everything's going to break a little   bit so here's my tetrahedron is on that line 
and the oh and where we put the line through   is a bit all over the place the square base 
pyramid is on that line and then the other ones   form two separate lines that go off and they're 
two different lines according to shapes that are   jewels of each other so the decahedron and the 
icosahedron are jewels and they're opposite each   other as you go out along so we don't you know 
i suspect it wouldn't take much working out or   thinking about it to show exactly what's going 
on there but it seems really nice that not only   are the shapes all on the poly plane but they're 
forming these two neat like they've taken marching   orders and they're partnering up with their dual 
shapes and the s jewels are on the line maths if   you would like to see the poly plane installation 
in real life it is no longer in san francisco   glenn packed it up the next day put it into a van 
drove away with it it's now at ucla in los angeles   at the institute of pure and applied mathematics 
it will be there for all of february from the 1st   to the 28th that's not quite all of it is it not 
this year anyway you can go and see it there if   you're anywhere near los angeles they're still 
accepting shape apes so if you want to build   polyhedrin you can post it in details on poplane 
dog yep that's the website i'll link to it below   and you can even apply to host it if you're at a 
place or institution or whatever who would like to   have poly plane installed you can get the details 
on the website for how to go about doing that but   up next a word from the sponsor of this video jane 
street who are not trying to sell you something   they're trying to give you something jane street 
are now accepting applications for their academy   of math and programming which is is a summer 
program runs from the end of june through to   the beginning of august in new york city and it's 
a no cost education program for recent high school   graduates who are interested in math and computer 
science and have experienced some kind of barrier   in their education thus far if you get accepted 
onto the program not only will jane street pay   for your travel food boarding program fees the 
works they will also give you $5,000 scholarship   towards your future education it's such a great 
opportunity unity applications will close on the   13th of march so if you or anyone you know could 
benefit from this program please do send them the   link i'll put it below and jane street have put 
together a puzzle that you can try this is not   compulsory in fact anyone can do it you've got 
to arrange numbers that represent skyscrapers on   a grid just to give you a taste of some of the 
type of content that will be involved but it's   way more than that it will cover everything from 
mathematics to computer science data analysis game   theory and more and you get to meet me probably i 
was there last time i think i've been to all well   the last two definitely i'm hoping to be at the 
one at 2024 such an incredible opportunity huge   thanks to jane street for making this possible 
please do either apply or pass it on to someone   who can apply and thanks to jan street in general 
for sponsoring this channel they were also at the   joint math meeting they ran an estimat thon 
where people could get into teams and compete   to estimate things in firmy style problems and 
they put on an event for undergrads they can can   go along get a free lunch listen to some staff 
from jane street talk and from this guy i pop   by to say hi always very happy to meet people 
who may be considering applying to work at jan   street i think they're a great organization they 
do financial things so please do check out   amp and jan street in general links below that's 
it end of the video thank you watch to the very   end of the video gang for you find people which 
is very much not everyone yeah a bunch of post-it   notes in the background finally finished writing 
my next book you might find a link at the very   bottom of the description where you can you you 
can sign up to hear about pre-orders it's the pre [music] pre-orders
