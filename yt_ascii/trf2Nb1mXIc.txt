war games is mentioned certainly in the ready player one book but i don't know if it's in the film i haven't seen the film yet what what was inside 8080 why does it look remarkably like the front of an altar because it was based on an altar maybe the mci 8080 was a machine that come out not long after the altar it's an s 100 bus based machine so s 100 means that it had a connector had a back plane but there was a hundred connections which carried the data bus address bus and all the control lines for the processor the back plane didn't do anything it was just a bunch of connectors you'd have a a cpu board maybe a ram board maybe a serial board you could expand it so effectively it was it was pretty much the same as the altair but it kind of looked nice with its nice big switches a little bit sort of pdp-8 style switches nice big ones there the leds that would light up on the front so kind of a sexy looking outer they remind me of almost the front of a of an old vcr yeah now i can see some of them say address some of them say data some of some say input i mean how does it how would it work you literally toggle in binary data and the leds would light up on the panel there with your binary output from it so if you want to write data to address xero ff then you would convert that into binary you would toggle that binary in and then you in the same way you would toggle in the the data that goes there and that's it so it's very very time consuming but actually i mean everybody talks about that and the way the altair is done and it is a very very slow and serious process but quite often what you would be doing is just toggling in a few lines of code or maybe just a jump even that would jump to a bit of code in memory that would then initialize the disk drive or the tape or whatever so what they call bootloader code just to jump the machine into life and get it into its peripherals so you've got the address bus there you can set the address and then you've got your data and you can toggle that in as well and that way you can basically it's like a poke command in basic you can poke data into a certain memory location yes you can use them like that but ultimately these things you could have a serial port if you had a serial port you could hook up a terminal you might have a rom in there which might be basic or you'd load basic info or anything else maybe cpm from a disk tape whatever interfaces you had connected to it you could get your data in and out so it's not like we all just sat there toggling in code day after day in binary a few people did but you know these things were a bit more usable than that i remember when we looked in the altair there were all sorts of upgrades and changes and would that be quite common on one of these as well that people would just add their own different boards yeah i mean these machines were for enthusiasts you know the people that were buying these quite often were electronics e kind of people so yeah you would buy one and you would just keep making it better and the same as everybody does with their pcs you know more ram more speed more power it was exactly the same so yeah the altair the original outside that we have isn't really much of an out air lift you know it was upgraded so much this one was a bit different it's had a bigger back plane in it so it's got a a toy's back plane there so you can plug in more boards and you know same thing would have been going on let's upgrade it we need more ram for our applications you're really into computers huh yeah it looks to me like kind of quite a professional machine so it's probably bending reality to have had the hacker keyed with it sitting on his bookcase yeah i mean these things weren't cheap so you know they were you know reasonably good money so whether matthew lightman was his name i think nice broderick something lightman like i remember yes was yeah would have afforded to have one of those machines in his bedroom i don't know because it's the machine it's just about to see a picture of their machine you've got the terminal that went next to it you had his little speaker box so he could speak and his vhs player on the shelf there that's a fair old amount of money's worth of gear but maybe his parents were loaded i don't know but but there you go he had one and they i mean were they bending it a bit with things like the speaker do you want to hear it talk i mean what sort of hardware would you have needed to have made a computer of that era talk i mean there was basic speech synthesis out there so it's it's feasible make mistakes yes they do how can i talk maybe it spoke a bit better than the actual real speech synthesizers did at the time i mean i can't remember when the spo 256 came out which is a chip which is a speech synth chip you were linking those up to early and things but i mean speech synthesis has been around some time so it was kind of feasible maybe normally on computer file we get the lid off we have a look around but this particular one's being refurbished yeah so this one is a bit of an empty shell at the minute so we have one of our volunteers has kindly taken the boards out and it's getting them working so we've got there's a processor card in a ram card the s100 is pretty standard so you can test it in other machines the altair he's already done so we now will very shortly have an altair where you can well you could toggle in the data if you want but we probably won't but we will be able to load in the little program to just fill up with timing loops and as those timing loops play interferes with the radio the radio then creates tones and you've got music and apparently there was this sort of reward given for the first thing that they they really made an outer do of any use if you call that of any use but that is music of course it is so yeah so that will be working but also the next thing is get the insight working as well so we're just getting the boards done then we'll refurbish the machine itself hopefully you better come here and have a play and we can take it to that gate because yellow key yellow castle and we can get in there now we have what could possibly be a sword or maybe just an arrow so so we can now take that one and we can come out is it one thing at a time though yeah yeah so you've got to have the right things at the right time so we can go this way oh but we can't
