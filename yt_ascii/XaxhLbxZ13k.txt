- all right, logangsters. last one of you to take your hand off this house gets to keep it. - i live with my parents. - my mom's kicking me out. - i already parked my car in the driveway. - i just want a house. - i don't need this, but i'm gonna win it, so they can't have it. - dude, you should let one of them win it. - no. - rules are simple, boys. last one of you to take
your hand off the house, or sit down, loses.
before we can go too far, we need to show you guys
the inside of the house. so, make your way inside while keeping your hands on the wall. we're gonna show the viewers the inside. - so guys, what do you
think of the living room? - looks like a good place to live. - spacious. - and room in. - this is the first room right here. [music] do bi do bi do bop [music] guys, come over here.
this is room number two. oh, yeah. by the way guys, bailey's one of our editors. - hello? - you guys haven't really met him before but now you have him. - my guest appearance. - this is room number three. wait, and then you guys
have this spot over here. - you're upstairs living room to oversee your downstairs. - spacious. - and then there's a bathroom over here. all right, let's go back outside. that's your tour. - all right, they are now complying to these two strips to tape. - somebody bring a fly, so jake can lose. - calm down, boys. - somebody put the hood
up, so taylor can lose. - somebody start a challenge.
so taylor can quit. - okay. - so, let's go over the rules so we're all on the same page. no sitting, hand must stay
on, you can't switch hands. one hand. this camera
is recording everything. last one of you to take it off, gets to live here for one year. - wait, take it off?
- rent free. - take it off now. - last one to take your hand off.
- oh. - gets to live in this house for one year with no rent. now, this challenge is
gonna be a little different than other ones. we're gonna screw around
with you guys a lot. just so you know. one thing we're doing a little different about this challenge is we're
punishing people if they lose. there's five of them. whoever's the last man
standing wins the house. the other four, when they quit, they're gonna get hit with
whipped cream in the face, or gonna egg them. not only is the house on the
line, but so is embarrassment. it should be fun. - so, garrett. why do you need this house? - well, because i like
to walk around naked and i have too many roommates at the time. - why do you need this house? - so, i can get away from my parents. it's time to move outta my own. i'm a butterfly now. - so, jake. why do you need this house? - send it out. - because it's getting really
awkward bringing home girls to mom and dad, and
i'm 26, living at home. - all right. then jake, you better not take your
hand out that house. bailey, how about you? - i just moved here and i
don't have a place to stay. - that's true. he literally moved down
here to edit for me and does the apartment. - i've been living in
his apartment, so i need- - so, bailey wants to
move outta my apartment into this house. - into this place. - it's another- - another your apartment. - oh. - put in an a-hole and let them win. also, reveal your hand. that's the second time
i've had to warn you. last thing i need your phone. - can i keep my phone
- thank you. for insurance purposes? - give me your phone. haven't saved in your contacts? - no. - all right, chandler.
thank you for your phone. can i have your phone? - i have a flip phone. - i thought all day was- - well, can i have your flip phone? - hold up. today's thursday? - and there we go. we have all the phones. all right, guys. now we have a nerf gun. let's shoot him. - that actually kinda hurts. - let's see if i can hit
him from across the street. - that is so close. - he's on the line. - we need an instant replay. - you see where i clip
the line right here? or something like that. - garret, come here. here you go. - didn't see anything. - are you sure? - you guys. - that's not real.
- reload me. - you guys duck before? - i got you, dude. - they're saying my lap is open for anyone who wants to come sit
down. it's very comfy. - give me the house, now. - you don't have to do this. - give me the house
- put the gun down. - taylor, put the gun down. - i think it made in my hoodie. - what? oh. - i didn't do it. go have it. go have it. - chandler deserves a
punishment. punish him. - since chandler shot me,
he gets hit with a potato. i'm gonna grab an egg, so he's gonna think i'm gonna throw an egg, and then when he like turns to hide, i'm gonna pelt him with a potato. he's gonna be freaking
out when i throw it. and then they'll leave. all right, you guys might want
to get away from chandler. chandler in the middle. - this is my good clothes. - chandler. - is there egg in your pocket, or are you just happy to throw stuff? - that's a whole cut of potato. - ouch. - that was your punishment. - that potato looks like a rock. - well, you just got spudded. - peace, dude. - is that potato or a balls there? - is that frozen or something? - maybe you can hit the potato a minute. oh, that was close. - that was real close. can i get another try? - i'll hit it with my poison dart. - can i get another try? if you go again, and you hit it, you can pelt someone, and if you miss, then i
will throw these egg at you. - all right.
- yeah. something fishy's up - the second that you missed it, i'm throwing these egg at you. - okay. - one second. - betrayal, betrayal. - i got it. - he's got an egg, everybody get down. - back off. - and while he has an egg,
i'm staying over here. - here's the potato man. - garrett's butt is egg proof confirmed. - should i just hold onto it? oh, look. i really just wanna throw
it way up in the air and see it splatter. - imma try those. - do it, watch yourself. - i spared all your lives. [music] like we said [music] [music] just like a christmas tree [music] [music] aah [music] - imagine these guys robbing your house. [music] carol [music] - hey, you're not supposed
to be having fun, guys. - potato. - here's a potato to throw it to someone. - jake did that on purpose. - i did not. - you guys still wanna

- my doctor's appointment at 1:30, it's 11:00. - i'm just relieved that he's gone. 'cause now this makes easy for me. - chandler, you're not the first one gone. - i know. - all right, guys. it is time for lunch. no one's gonna know who gets who's food. so, this is gonna be 100% anonymous. you're gonna pick jake's food. what do you wanna give him? - i wanna get him a tofu sandwich. that way he gets no food. - i guess we'll do chandler next. chandler, you get to pick

we don't wanna be out here. - all right. well shake on it with your non-hand-hands. - wait, hold on. before they shake, can we point out some obvious? this is bailey's first
