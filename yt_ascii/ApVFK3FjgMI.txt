drawing inspiration from real life so for devs for ex machina look at characters like elon musk what do you think about the various big technological efforts of elon musk and others like him and that he's involved with such as tesla spacex in your link do you see any of that technology potentially defining the future worlds you create in your work so tesla's automation spacex is space exploration your link is brain machine interface somehow merger of biological and electric systems i'm in a way i'm influenced by that almost by definition because that's the world i live in and this is the thing that's happening in that world and i also feel supportive of it so i think i think amongst various things elon musk has done i'm almost sure he's done a very very good thing with tesla for all of us it's really kicked all the other car manufacturers in the faces kicked the fossil fuel industry in the face and and they needed kicking in the face and he's done it so and and so that's the world he's part of creating and i live in that world just bought a tesla in fact and so does that play into whatever i then make in some ways it does partly because i try to be a writer who quite often filmmakers are in some ways fixated on the films they grew up with and they sort of remake those films in some ways i've always tried to avoid that and so i looked at the real world to get inspiration and as much as possible sort of by living i think and so so yeah i'm sure which of the directions do you find most exciting space trouble space travel so you haven't really explored space travel in your work you've said you said something like if you had unlimited amount of money i think i read at ama that you would make like a multi-year series space wars or something like that so what what is it that excites you about space exploration well because if we have any sort of long-term future it's that it just simply is that if energy and matter are linked up in the way we think they're linked up we'll run out if we don't move so we got to move and but but also how can we not it's it's built into us to to do it or die trying i was on easter island a few months ago which is as i'm sure you know in the middle of the pacific and and difficult for people to have got to but they got there and i did think a lot about the way those boats it must have set out into something like space it was the ocean and and how sort of fundamental that was to the way we are and it it's the one that most excites me because it's the one i want most to happen it's the thing it's the place where we could get to as humans like in a way i could live with us never really unlocking fully unlocking the nature of consciousness i like to know i'm really curious but if we never leave the solar system and if we never get further out into this galaxy or maybe even galaxies beyond our galaxy that that would that feel sad to me because because it's so limiting yeah there's something hopeful and beautiful bar reaching out any kind of exploration reaching out across earth centuries ago and reaching out into space so what do you think about colonization of mars so go to mars does that excite you the idea of a human being stepping foot on mars it does it absolutely does but in terms of what would really excite me it would be leaving this solar system in as much as that i just think i think we already know quite a lot about mars and but yes listen if it happened that would be i hope i say in my lifetime i really hope i say in my life i do it would be a wonderful thing you
