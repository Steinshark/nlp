do you ever feel like if only i knew that skill was in demand five years ago then i'd be the top highest paying whatever the role may be data scientists developer product manager or why did i miss that train why did i not get into this skill sooner if you have felt this way that is what this video is going to help you solve how to get ahead of tech trends or tech skills quickly we spend so much time as individuals who are always keeping up to date with tech or learning about tech that we want to ensure we are spending our time and our energy in areas that will help us grow quicker and better there is nothing worse than spending so much time on something whether it be a technical skill or otherwise only to realize that it's not going to be in demand i mean there's always specialized roles so i don't ever want to say anything is a waste of time but it's finding that happy balance in this video i'm going to share with you some of my biggest tips for identifying top skills that are going to be in demand and this is done through a variety of different ways that we are going to dive into today alright let's get into it if you haven't already hit that subscribe button give this video a like now let's get into it foreign who actually has an 86 accuracy on his tech predictions he has predicted some really interesting things let's take a second actually and look back on some of his accurate predictions some of them include in 1990 he predicted that a computer would defeat a world-class chess champion by 1998 and in fact ibm's deep blue defeated gary kasparov in 1997. now his predictions get really accurate and honestly they really blow my mind let's go through one more he predicted that computer displays built into eyeglasses that project images directly onto the retina would be developed about 2020 and now as we know we have google glass and other ar displays maybe they're not implemented in everyone's day-to-day lives but the technology is there now the futurist also predicts some pretty scary or interesting things depending on how you look at it one of his recent predictions are that ai will surpass human intelligence and pass the turn test by 2029 and that by 2045 humans will merge with ai we've created which he calls as we've all heard before this singularity this brings up a lot of questions though and no we're not going to go down this rabbit path for this video we want to stay focused on being able to predict our own future trends especially when it comes to skills that you can develop when you are going out to advance your career or stay on top of these trends or even if these predictions come true that he's saying how can we be you know getting ahead of the curve versus staying behind now let's go back to a question that i get asked all the time one of the biggest questions i get asked recently and i think it's because of everything going on in the world right now with how quickly it feels like tech is moving and changing which is should i study or should i get in career in data science or whatever this subject may be something subject a or subject b an example of this would be should i study or get a career in data science or should i go into what's a popular one it's a software development two different kind of areas and the premise of this question is what is going to make my job secure pay higher make sure i have security long term because at the end of the day we are putting so much time and energy into studying for these subjects and learning about them or upskilling depending on where we are at in our careers that all of a sudden now we're like is my job going to get taken over or is it going to be less in demand with all of this technology especially ai and i really wanted to address this question here because this is how i respond to it i always start by saying explore both and i'm not talking specifically about data science and software development i'm just saying in general if there are a few areas that you are interested in explore both whether it be through a free online course or tinkering around for me one of the best things to do is actually go reach out to people sit down with them grab a coffee understand what that role really looks like because it is one thing if you decide to go with the most in-demand role because you did an analysis and this is what is going to be in demand for the next 20 years or whatever the case may be but if you genuinely do not love that role or even like that role it's going to be very hard for you to actually excel in that and that's what i always say go with what you actually enjoy versus what you think or what society is telling you is a bit more in demand and if you like them the same amount then yes go with the more in demand one but your passion and your drive for that area that you are most into will actually help you excel way past what you would even if you go for the in demand area and i'm bringing this up because we talk a lot on this channel channel about in demand tech skills or tech skills that maybe aren't in demand anymore and i just really want to highlight that although those are important to be aware of and to focus on at the end of the day you have to do what is best for you okay but still you're like tiff i still want to be able to predict future in-demand skills here are some places to do so there are some reports that come out yearly or monthly that are really good and very insightful they have experts spending all of their time on these skills to see which is going to be in demand and not some of them include mckinsey forrester and gardner those are probably the three main ones i would say and what they do is they share where we currently are at but also to upcoming trends and this is a really good way i like to go through these reports and kind of skin them high level but it gives me a good sense as to what is coming up is ai still really popular is it more of a fad or are robotics becoming more popular you get a sense of what is going up going to be in demand and on that note some skills that these reports have in common that will be continuing to be in demand include of course things like human computer interaction so things like robotic process automation augmented reality and all things ai unlike i would say blockchain or crypto and that really big russian buzz that we all saw ai is different because ai is an area that we are starting to implement today businesses are using it we are using it and although that is true to a degree with blockchain and the whole crypto thing i know two separate topics but they often get intertwined ai is an area that we can see is closely ingrained into our daily lives now something that isn't going to go anywhere can you imagine now not being able to use chat gpt or claude or even when you are coding if you're a coder not being able to use something like github co-pilot it would kind of suck and that i think is something we really need to recognize i get asked a lot as well about is ai going to be a height bubble or is it going to burst and the reality is it's not going to be the same fat that we saw with web3 although web3 is real please don't come at me but i'm when i say bubble i mean everyone was talking about it and now we don't hear anything another thing for me that really helps identify skills that are going to be more demand in the future is actually studying job posting so sometimes even if i'm not job hunting i will go on different job sites such as indeed or linkedin and see if there is a trend throughout even different roles but what they are asking for so right now going back to ai if you go on linkedin or indeed or any of these job posting sites you will see very quickly that throughout many of these different roles they would like someone with knowledge around artificial intelligence or machine learning depending on how descriptive they get we saw this as well with blockchain and web3 and you know there's kind of some underlying things as well i'm also seeing two though well looking at a lot of these job postings underlying threat as well around data there is a lot of roles around data whether it be working with data understanding it working with clients for it that still is a very big trend too that i don't think we talk about too much or as much as we should another thing i like to do and i've said this before but it's because it's probably the easiest way to not only stay up to date with current tech trends but also to get insight into what is coming up is through subscribing to newsletters i think it is the best thing you can do i'm saying this and then you're going to be like getting spammed by newsletters so here are some that i really like i really like mit tech review wired i also really like just going on their website and seeing what they're doing futurism is incredible especially for focusing on future tech and that also too will give you an idea of what is coming up even if it's not a direct tech skill understanding as to what is in the news in tech and trending will also help you understand well what skills were needed to build that technology so kind of flipping it and this is something that as someone who is honestly obsessed or very passionate anyways with uncovering what skills are not willing to demand now but in the future i love to do the key at the end of the day is really emerging yourself in the tech industry and in the tech space being a thought leader and that doesn't mean having to you know put your thoughts online or anything like that but recognizing that you are in control of finding out what skills are really in demand and then building on those skills as well other things that are really helpful i mean reddit has so many great subreddits i'm not a reddit user but that you can go on and find different trending topics and then also too i like going on slack and finding different communities within there finding online communities that you feel are healthy because sometimes online communities cannot be so healthy and that support you and are there for the same common mission which is to learn about technology understand future tech and better themselves alright on that note let's go through what are some skills that are intimate in the future this video is really about how to identify these skills but as always let's go through some of the top ones here one that i found very interesting was a mckinsey report that reported 65 percent of annual growth in related roles for automation architects so things such as automation testers and this is really interesting as things continue to become more and more automated it's something we haven't really spoken about another one which is super common and i feel like we've spoken about a bunch is data science data science was actually named the number one job in america for four years by glassdoor which i'm not surprised at all about lincoln saw a data science job postings increase over 650 percent from 2012 to 2019 and data science really can touch all areas from finance health care tech you've got to keep in mind too that these technical skills or technical knowledge depending on if you're technical or more of a soft skill person that has this knowledge it doesn't have to just be in tech big tech or tech industry all industries now need these skills whether you are going into finance fashion or even health care all right those are some of the top ways you can easily keep up to date with what is coming up for the top in demand tech skills at the end of the day it's about networking using your network to understand what they are focused on and in turn you'll hear different kind of whispers if you will of what is kind of being trending also to relying on resources and reports the ones that i mentioned and then lastly as well staying up to date within the tech community through different channels whether it be newsletters slack communities whatever the case is and hopefully using tools like tiff and tech youtube to stay up to date because i'm always looking out for you and trying to find the best in demand skills for the future that we can focus on today because it's really this interesting time we're at where we have the internet at our fingertips to literally learn whatever we want and grow our careers in so many ways one of the best things i think is the role you're in today honestly should not be the role you are in five years from now or 10 years from now if you are a developer you can grow and grow whether it be into management in that aspect or maybe you want to grow into a specialized field or if you're fine to staying where you are at that is great too but the opportunities to continue to grow and build on new skills is something we've never had this accessible before till now which is pretty cool if you think about it i'm curious what area of tech are you most interested in leave down in the comments so i know what to make more videos on alright i will see you all soon thanks everyone oh hit that subscribe subscribe button and the like button and okay i'll see you soon [music]
