my friends this is this is craziness tldr the 302 version of this story about a week ago here in late november 2023 grandmaster vladimir karnick put on his chess.com page that hikaru has recently pulled off monster winning streaks in blitz chess to the total of 45 a half out of 46 and everybody would find this interesting and that's all vladimir was saying now vladimir has been on an anti- cheater crusade and for a lot of the things he said i i was willing to listen i was i actually agreed with some of the things that he was saying i think in prize money tournaments online the risk of cheating is massive and cheating poses an existential threat to chess for years to come now with all these little devices that you can you know put anywhere and they could help you win a chess now he went after hikaru but vladimir said that it wasn't an accusation and that it was just he doesn't think anybody is above the law and he thinks that everybody should be fairly investigated so ch.com put this out all right they said look at this magnus it's because it's magna's birthday we take all cheating accusations seriously in the case of recent accusations against hikaru we've generated over 2,000 reports and we have found no incidents of cheating this is the report charles.com has permit yeah yeah best platform for both casual professional players we invest heavily in protecting the game with state-of-the-art algorithms and proctoring they do they do they they they they really do ch.com takes chess very seriously with clear evidence when clear evidence exists we act even last month they closed 55,000 accounts including six title players which is pretty wild six title players were banned in october we've closed hundreds of title players dozens of grand masters and four players in the world top 100 so chess.com is pretty damn confident when they think they have the right statistics aligned to ban a player off of their platform now by the way we can have a whole separate conversation as to like should this stuff be made public right in any professional sport when a player pops for drug use substance use illegal substance use they are suspended publicly it's not hush hush right because then they just won't play anymore right now the way it stands here on on you know in the online chess world if you get banned by chess.com you you frequently nobody says anything publicly but we can we can discuss that later we recognize due to the extreme competitive nature test that always be correct and incorrect accusations of cheating we all take we take them all seriously actually in the coming weeks they're going to be announcing further measures anyway in the case of recent accusations against yaro by vladimir kramnick we can say that we have generated 2,000 individual reports on karo's games which probably means they've analyzed tens of thousands of games hi car's incredible performance including 45 a half out of 46 we've looked at the statistics our team has done the math in various simulations of streaks for a player like hikaru's played more than 50,000 games we have found that not only is a 45 game winning streak possible it's like it's likely given the number of games played right monte carlo simulation how many times can a player achieve such a streak within data sets of let's say a thousand games we have confirmed these results with external statisticians including a professor of statistics at a top 10 university with the deepest respect for world champion vladimir karnick in our opinion his accusations lack statistical merit and it is signed you guys couldn't see that last part it it sorry it it is signed by dan and eric of ch.com now the one of the earlier statements that was put out actually like had a small paragraph about chat gpt which got oh i have some twitter notifications which got a little bit of like you know people were like oh chat gpt i actually don't think they it was since removed but i i i i don't think it was like the chat gpt basic model i mean i'm pretty sure chat gpt 4 is a bit more than a language learning model i mean it it probably the statement in and of itself that they verified with a professor of statistics at a top 10 university is good enough but i think you know all of these ai language learning models like the boosted version of them could probably run some numbers but regardless this is the statement all right we're going to go back full screen on me for a second look i don't think anybody expected anything different and that's not like i'm not a conspiracy theorist okay like i just like full disclosure i mean i'm not i'm not you know i'm not on on the side that's like well even well even if he was they did find something wrong they just wouldn't say like no no no let stop in 2023 for some reason it's become so difficult to just like accept truth by like anybody every like no that's suspicious no i think we just kind of expected this okay like hikaru's upside of cheating in random 40 45 game streaks of blitz it's like i don't know i somehow it was not the most compelling argument we listen to the stats team that clearly bans grand masters and top 100 players when they think necessary this is not it's not the reality now here's the thing vladimir obviously was not satisfied i'm going to show you his response in a second but the truth is can we just take a step back like what did vladimir think was going to happen when he brought this up what did did like was vladimir did did he want hikara to be found guilty like what what was the verdict in his mind right because it's either guilty or not guilty it's binary i mean it's not so did he want a more compelling case for the not-guilty like who is the professor and what methods were used well let's see and and actually kramnick has has talked about potentially pursuing legal action but not for the reasons you would think i have lately received so vladimir has changed his profile photo on chess.com it is now no longer him it is the petition that he has asked to be signed for players to be investigated and there's an amount of signatures now the petition is kind of oh my god yeah it's very like people are meing on it a bit they're like signing it as different names and everything but i mean okay it is a petition at the end of the day it's fine on top of various personal insults vladimir has received physical threats from members of the platform he's reported them numerous times he has not received a single answer from chess.com those two already overstep anything is serious decent company can allow on their platform so he was saying that those people aren't banned so basically vladimir is saying that we might disagree somewhat about certain matters but the behavior of certain people on chess.com is above imaginable humanly and legally at least my lawyers checking the case might start an official case against the platform after my consultations with them then he responded to the actual statement but he has been posting some of the things he has been receiving i hate to give this stuff attention and you know what i i i i might even make the decision now that i won't i mean this person has now been banned on ch.com and this person just wrote something really really nasty to vladimir and you know all all i will say here just in the like it look two things can be true at the same time number one you should not hide behind anonymity to message people horrible things okay i mean i have received thousands over the last few just all some of the most vile heinous things that people have said to me right now in my case i'm just like this is the internet all right 99.99% of you have nothing but positive things to say actually a huge amount of you just watch the video and don't even comment like these videos have 400,000 views and a thousand comments right like a lot of people just watch like they don't need to comment shout out to you if you're lurking you know just enjoying the show but it's the internet it's the internet on twitter on instagram on ch.com like the veil of anonymity empowers people to be horrible especially in these heated cases right where a guy is calling for a guy's games to be investigated hikaru's fans or people again you you might just have a teenager at home who deliberately writes writes horrible things because he like knows it's going to offend the other party if you behave this way or have a friend that behaves this way you should stop behaving this way and tell your friend to stop behaving this way because all the advice that i give to the young generation is your time is running out like at some point in the future if you don't cut these bad habits out of your life you're going to get punched in the face now some people improve as individuals after getting punched in the face i don't know on the flip side of that it's the internet like i really hate this to say it but vladimir's dms are open i i have my chat off on chess.com i have my messages off on chess.com okay vladimir doesn't and so like when you get into this case that's going to have millions of eyeballs on it statistically speaking you speaking of statistics right and we can call the mathematicians and confirm this you can have some scumbags you can't sue a platform because a troll message you something horrible now in the case of physical violence that you know and that that's which vladimir has reported as well yes that is like horrible and probably actionable i don't know i'm not a lawyer but it's you know it's like the internet and i just i feel for vladimir because i don't know what's going on anymore you know let let's take a look at like what i mean by i don't know what's going on anymore it's like what is vladimir's end goal i mean i i almost feel like he he just started using social media more like a year ago vlad this is just how it is man you know it's like if if you start arguing about your favorite football player your favorite cricket player like your favorite basketball player people are just going to say horrible things to you it's like i you know but it's not excusable and it's it actionable but what does vladimir want does he want people to be banned in like 30 minutes they they're banned they're banned it took i don't know it took 24 to 48 hours i the whole thing is just odd now vladimir said i have briefly checked this statement of ch.com have several things to say with the deepest respect to danny and eric he didn't spell eric's name right but the respect is still there calling my recent efforts on helping improving anti-cheating efficiency of chess's platform accusations of karo by vladimir kramnick is clear public disinformation which obviously can cause huge image damages for me therefore i offer the chess.com platform 24 hours time frame to exclude and refuted the sentence from this report together with public apologies again again again vladimir literally like like a week you know like like 72 hours ago was saying in a different post that i you know i don't want to go and pull up now probably should have before i made this video he was saying that he has evidence that's going to knock hikaru out like that is a comment that he wrote it's in a video that i posted i don't know how vladimir could possibly i this is the source of confusion for me like what was he thinking what what was i agree with vladimir nobody is above the law everybody is fair to be investigated in their games but what was the end goal of all of this why did he start this with like no statistics and then say i'm going to publish more statistics and then those statistics were just more streaks that's all published he just published how many times hearo beat a certain average rating and now it's it's this it's you know again what like what was the end goal of all of this i mean it was content we're getting content out of this i guess anyway he said i will start a legal case against chess.com next week if this is not done within 24 hours this was posted 12:59 p.m. november 29th it's currently 10:33 chess.com has got two hours and 26 minutes they got two hours and 26 minutes i'm going to refresh it and it says recent accusations against i mean bro i don't know what's happening here boys and girls like i we are headed down a certain path and and he said i expect apologies regarding non-acting of my report of abuse again what does this mean like they did act on it like was there did he expect it to be immediate this is what i don't know of course the the threats the threats are terrible they're awful i'm not saying you i'm i'm literally telling you guys if you behave this way online you are a piece of garbage stop messaging people awful things about themselves or their you won't it's just statistics it's just the odds of you know it could be one in 10,000 it's still one in 10,000 people are going to write people horrible things but oh my goodness i haven't received any answers about users making criminal statements and he was only banned only after my post a couple of days later i can understand people working on the platform can make mistakes strongly believe admitting and apologizing is the only path the petition asking ch.com and publish the results after this presumably long examination collected 2 signatures in a few days and then he posted a couple of other things of people saying terrible things to him it's not good you know i i i i don't want to show it i don't want to show it because i don't want to give those people a stage but as you can see here he's posting more stuff and now vladimir said now let's talk about the research done by the world's best anti-cheating team provided by approved by their my serious top professor this is really strange highlighting but i will try to read it our team has done the math and various simulations of streaks for a player like hikaro being just some ignorant person without a clue about statistics this detailed report raised questions after consulting with ma mathematicians i would like to ask you where from is this number 50,000 games is it counting all time controls and opposition level if yes obviously it's wrong using it measuring probabilities of 3-minute games versus a certain level of average rating players if not there's much less games to consider okay he basically saying did ch.com analyze every single one of hikaru's games like when he plays against viewers or what right like what or or or did they analy you know or did they analyze just games against strong players did you include calculations how many streaks like that occur during the period of your 50,000 games i suppose this would change completely probabilities from your sophisticated report we conclude you were talking about the probability of one such streak please let us know since according to your statement there's a major obvious mistake okay i appreciate the efforts of your mathematicians but to start with that streak wasn't 40 plus victories there was some others 55 out of 55 buy proper calculators yours is old and broken i suspect on top it is not about necessarily winning streaks but for example huge over performance in dozens of consecutive games what matters here but since you skip mentioning such a parameter i assume you didn't check this i'm sure your people have checked the probabilities of such players in a short period of time from the amount of games played during that time frame because it's the correct method of measuring but just forgot to mention in your report please correct this since definitely most important from tons of your numbers gener generously provided deepest respect vladimir and that is where we currently stand and vladimir is saying that this needs to be removed and the time frame is expiring in about two hours look i'm going to summarize this the exact same way i've been summarizing this for the last couple of videos okay i have a tremendous amount of respect for vladimir kik's contributions to chess over his entire career in fact i have respect for his being so outspoken and trying to attempt to you know talk about top level cheating like not top four four players out of a top 100 i mean like top 30 grand masters in the world i also subscribe to the theory that it's extremely difficult to catch cheaters if they do it in an intelligent way like it it is it is a very very serious existential problem but i don't understand any of his decision making regarding this case none of it at all none of it at all makes any sense to me number one if he really truly believes that hikaro has cheated and is cheating and he in karnick own words has had many private conversations brought to his attention about hiar that's what he said and hikaro himself has stated dubov has been suspicious of him right i think that was what hikaro said i don't know if he mentioned other grand masters why did karnick do it this way why why why did he do it one step at a time like why would you not have a more structured approach to like filing some sort of formal complaint instead of doing it the way he has number two it's like what is the end goal of all of this because at the end of the day chess.com is going to come out and say we have all the metrics we don't think the guy is cheating so now it's like what what is kck what is what is the next step is it okay all right i you know i thought he should be investigated and it seems like he's clear of all wrongdoing great or are we going to continue to argue over the methods used like is there ever a world in which that karnick is going to sit back and say you know what you guys did everything i asked and hikaru's innocent and that's okay right now karnick is saying he wasn't accusing the guy he just doesn't believe anybody anybody's is above the law and if they don't remove the thing that he accused him then he's going to take legal action right and now karnick is also posting things which are saying it is violation of like california state law to write threats to people of physical violence and harm to their family which i have already addressed is like scumbag behavior you are all horrible people if you participate in that but what is even going on anymore i i am so the whole thing is just so weird and i love how no other top player is like saying anything it's just chess world is so weird the whole thing is so weird but there's still so many questions how are we going to handle cheating in the future if a top 50 grandmaster is banned on chess.com should that restrict them from playing over theboard tournaments should the world chess federation feed a partner with chess.com to have some sort of committee that i don't i don't know no i the whole thing is so weird that's all i have for you today all right we're going to have another h100 million lawsuit in the chess world anyway just get out of here
