netscape and sun micro system announces javascript the open cross-platform object scripting language what the heck is an object scripting language for enterprise networks and the internet every single person right now thinking about life look what they did to the internet look at what they did we got javascript 28 industry leading companies to endorse javascript as a compliment to java for easy online application development e-o-a-d oh this is beautiful mountain view california when did we start abbreviating california as caliph december 4th 1995 a day that will live in infamy and i forgot to turn off alerts netscape communications corporation nasdaq oh wow they really went down and sun microsystems incorporated sun w what a w today announced javascript an open cross pour of platform object scripting language for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks and the internet capital i internet the javascript language complements java sun's industry leading object-oriented cross-platform programming language write one's debug everywhere the initial version of javascript is available now as part of the beta version of netscape navigator 2.0 which is currently available for downloading from netscape's web site in addition 28 i cannot believe this is how it all started like think about this we now get 27 individual tools to compile our javascript running on everything from medical devices to nasa to our browser to iot to just device script you get everything now look at what happened this is what made my life less awesome in addition 28 industry leading companies including american online industry-leading apple computer architect software what attachment corporation what at d borland international brio technology incorporated computer associates incorporated digital equipment corporation hewlett packard in icon of x illustra illustra information technology informix software into it okay i know into it like there's very few i even recognize here macro media pour one out for macromedia novell oracle corporation boo boo boo boo precept software rad technologies the santa cruz operation silicon graphics spider technologies sisbase toshiba variety verity vermeer technologies have indoors oh where's microsoft because didn't microsoft just completely everybody when it comes to javascript shocking have endorsed javascript as an open standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in the future products the draft specification of javascript as well as the final draft specification of java is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standard bodies for industry review and comment this month oh god i remembered microsoft's solution yeah javascript is an easy to use object scripting language designed for creating live online applications that link together object and resources on both clients and servers wow do they have no idea what it was going to become look everybody we built this in 10 days while java is used by programmers to create new objects and applets javascript is designed to be used by html page authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the behavior of objects running on either the client or the server what does this even mean like i know enough about programming that this statement by itself is emotionally painful and confusing javascript is analogous to visual basic in that it can be used by people with little or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications still true still true still true and hearts still true and hurts hey man react is really awesome all right javascript's design represents the next generation of software designs specifically for the internet capital i and is designed for creating network-centric applications complementary to and integrated with java complementary to and integrated with hitmal open and cross-platform crazy java developed by sun is an object-oriented programming language that operates independent of any is this is this for like programmers who who are they writing to okay the the amount of times you said is object oriented or is object scripting language it's like how many times java developed by sun is an object-oriented programming language that operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor java programs called app list by the way i my fir the the thing that got me into programming like as a heavy programming thing was javascript applets i used it to make little video games before i knew physics i had my own physics and then i learned physics and rewrote the engine using fit oh man can be transmitted over the network and run on any client providing the multimedia richness of a of a cd-raw so many w's need to happen in chat right now okay so many w's right now java applets provide the richness of of a cd-rom this statement is this statement is is there is no competing who has made more of a great statement that has been so like we just got done reading an article about go and how it was designed and how wisdom was able to prevail 11 years later it was still a good article talking about good things on how we should think about programming we look at this and everything about this statement has been deprecated this is the opposite the opposite of wisdom we're reading right now this is so good over corporate networks and the internet capital i java has been widely hailed by programmers because it eliminates the need to port applications and by managers of information systems for its potential to lower the cost of distributing and maintaining applications across the network with javascript and html and html page might contain an intelligent form that performs loan payments or currency exchange which is programmed by people with little to no programming experience let's go oh now a multimedia weather forecast applet written in java can be scripted by javascript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region a server-side javascript [music] what did they call node.js in 19 they knew they they knew this whole time i thought it was an accident oh my goodness is this a cia psy op to make my life horrible i think it literally is i think this is a psyop i think we've officially i think we gotta get alex jones on here right now we gotta get jones on here right now they're turning all the freaking programming languages into javascript that's what's happening right now it's been it's been it was it was there might be pulled a data ssr called 20 years ago javascript might pull data out of a relational database and format it in html on the fly oh my goodness it is they literally called react server components ah oh no not and react still screwed it up for a decade how did that happen how did that how did you do that how did this what a page might contain javascript's javascripts that run on both the client and the server and the server the scripts might dynamically compose and format html content based on the user preferences stored in a relational database and all the client the scripts would glue together the assortment of java applets and html how were you so close yet so far away form elements into live interactive user interfaces for specifying a netwide search of information java programs and javascript scripts are designed to run both cl on both clients and servers with javascript scripts used to modify the properties or behavior of java objects so the range of live online applications that dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise networks or the internet capital i is virtually unlimited i mean they really did have good foresight here other than the whole javascript scripts and java program like all that netscape will support java and javascripts in the client and server products as well as programming tools and applications to make this vision a reality programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about java because it designed from the ground up for the internet capital i javascript is a natural fit but since it also is designed for the internet capital i and unicode based worldwide use said bill joy fn built did you know bill joy invented vi and then right afterwards left vi and started using emacs that is not fake that is not a made-up story he literally did that okay bill bill how could you be both you are anakin bill you are an attic kid co-founder and vice president of research at sun javascript will be the most effective method to connect hitmal based content to java applets bill i wish i could talk to bill honestly i really wish i could talk to bill i don't even know if bill joy is still alive if he is alive and i can somehow talk to him i would love to talk to bill java is available okay so we're almost done then it comes to some sighting java is available to developers free of charge the java compiler tm and java java developers kit tm as well as the hot java browser and related documentation are available from sun's website at http colon slash slash java.sun.com in addition the java source code can be licensed for for a fee details on the licensing are also available via the java.sun.com webpage to date sun has licensed java to a number of leading technology companies including borland macromedia mitsubishi netscape oracle silicon graphics spyglass and toshiba sun's workshop for java toolkit is scheduled for release in spring 1996 sun's neo product family the first complete development operating and management environment for object-oriented network applications we'll also use java enabled browser also as front ends to the neo environment man did they get that wrong i man just like bill joy chose emacs did bill joy get it wrong no hey by the way i'm not making fun of bill joy bill joy obviously you know hero other than that i'm still trying to get the knife out of my back though it's really hurting right now netscape and son plan to propose javascript to the w3 consortium w3c and the internet capital i engineering task force as an open internet capitalized scripting language standard javascript will be an open freely licensed proposed standard available to the entire internet capital i community existing sun java licenses will receive a license to javascript in addition sun and netscape intend to make a source code reference implementation of javascript available for royalty-free licensing further encouraging its adoption as a standard in a wide variety of products honestly this is actually a really great statement here notice they they really close down source code that as the whole argument with google and the whole everything with java and the fee and the licensing whereas javascript came royalty free just like anyone can have it other than oracle owning the javascript twitter handle and they will sue you if you try to use the term java it's job javascript at any website yes this is true no my fears about rust saying you can't use in a website aren't unfounded they literally did it to somebody just within the last few weeks or in the last couple months okay when people say that they don't like trademark policy especially when it comes to rust you now understand why netscape communications corporation is a premier provider of open source for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the internet capitalized the com company offers a full line of netscape navigator clients navigator servers what am i reading with annual revenues of 6 billion sun microsystems provide solutions that enable customers to build and maintain open network computing environments widely recognized as a proponent of open standards okay is this just like all padding each other on the back yeah yeah okay let's read some quotes okay we're about to get quoted are you ready script brings the power of rapid multimedia application development with cross-platform mobility at both the operating system and architecture level we are pleased to integrate this powerful language into our developers program mike connors president america online technologies javascript will allow us to easily create personalized applets for the excite service these applets combined with the rich functionality of excite service will integrate more fully into the user's experience as they explore and navigate the internet you have mail graham spencer chief technology officer architects software at t colt semicolon support for javascript is more than support for cool technology it is the support for an open standard process the open standards are and will be as important to the success of the internet capitalized as open connectivity tom okay this actually this guy did a really great job he's absolutely correct the more open the more free it is the better and quicker it can be adopted this is good all right let's let's see some good ones here javascript and java represent important steps in the evolution of the internet and the intranets people have no idea what she's even saying for business computing javascript allows internet applications to easily connect to production databases such as ca ca open ingress let me guess ca is computer associates well really while java allows easy to use multi-platform web clients for ca unicenter and business applications such as ca masterpiece and ca man man pen and ca ac pack what the hell's the ca nancy nancy what is ca tools like javascript will unleash a new wave of creativity and transform the internet in a way no one can predict lord have mercy my goodness this guy predicted correctly no one saw this one coming javascript and other developments will demand increased system performance shoot that's funny ideally met by digital alpha system architecture okay rose why does everything do you notice that everything with javascript also is a self promo are you catching this right now it is like literally all self-promo every time hey by the way javascript pairs best with ca technology javascript is an exciting technology because it represents the next generation of software designs specifically for the internet capitalized hulert packard is committed to open standards and some and is a supporter of javascript because it complements hewlett packard's open system architecture thank you jan orion i don't know if you're german or not we plan to integrate our atomic or our automatic document indexing and abstraction technology to leverage the power and functionality of javascript the power and use of our technologies greatly enhance the server and its delivery of timely and valuable documents for web clients robert griggs vice president of sales and marketing iconifex corporation you're probably asking yourself oh icon of x the corporation we all know about rip icon of x it is still making somewhere between zero to one million dollars in revenue it has less than 25 employees they probably asked some how much do you want to bet it probably has some oh my goodness stephen waldron is still oh my goodness we can email we could call stephen waldron let's make a phone call stephen this is the primogen microsoft empowers developers to create powerful new class of multimedia rich applications in a platform independent development environment how much money did you have to pay somebody to say this quote illustra's unique extensible object relational architecture look at this they're literally doctor dr michael stone breaker more like ball breaker here why are you doing why why you gotta be like this why do all of you have intuits into it into a paper software implies a multi-dimensional verbal user interface that is what is this does anybody here just say something about javascript other than the person that's like and no one can predict no one can predict this was probably the best statement of all time in fact this statement deserves a tweet can predict let's let's correctly attribute it to to rose rose and gordano gordano night december 4th 1994. a stone breaker is a legend well stone break me in surprise okay i didn't realize dr ball breaker's a legend okay hey guess what the name is javascript is a object scripting language again
