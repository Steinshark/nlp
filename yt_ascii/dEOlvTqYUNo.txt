whoops i accidentally dropped my nail however am i gonna pick up all these nails unpleasant when you scout the metal details on the floor push large magnet to the bottom of any box and using extraordinary magic force iron pieces to return back to its place what's up guys person who counted to a high number and makes fun of intros here basically i'm gonna go on youtube and reenact a bunch of life hacks and see if they're actually practical because i feel like life hacks have gotten out of hand there are life hacks that require like you have 20 different tools and all these other things and it's like that's not a life hack like that it doesn't even no one has all that stuff subscribe let's go [music] how did he make it look so easy oh boy yeah [music] what the [ __ ] [music] yeah i'm not quite sure what she did in her video but whatever the [ __ ] i just made is not working and i'm kind of pissed off i wasted oh oh did i get something [music] i don't understand how they do this stuff my ping-pong ball did not want to cut straight so [music] so i taped slash glued the two sides of the thing together now i'm pretty sure you just set it down and then you put an egg inside of it now not to be rude or anything but what is the point of this and why did i spend 15 minutes making it [music] oh yeah such good chips oh no whatever shall i do how should i close my bag of chips let me just grab some mag let me just keep this bag of chips closed with magnets because you know it's not like they they sell things like this at the store how convenient that they sell things like this at the store you know it closes and it has a magnet on it too yeah well that life hack was definitely necessary you will need a spring from a pen which should be wounds at the base of a cable all right so take a part pin and you'll get a pretty convenient way to hold the wires in your workspace and then you put a little magnet on the side of your table and it should stick oh ones my cord's not really sticking see this is this is what i hate about life hacks like literally half the time they don't even work like the thing's not even sticking to it that's a magnet and my cord just keeps falling so i mean maybe i need a better magnet but like ah it's just annoying measure out a piece of sponge and cut it so it fits in the bottleneck embed a magnet inside a sponge with a thin bladed knife and fill the hole with glue throw sponge inside and you can use another strong magnet to pick up the grime of the walls it's not sticking to the magnets [music] so i stuck magnets on both sides of the hammer and for some reason my hammer's not doing it like his was his he just put a nail there my i put a nail there and it just drops it'll stick to the side but when i try to stick it to the end like he did i don't know [music] [music] they're not sticking to my magnet all right take number two so in some of the life hack videos i watched the thumbnails was a can of soda and they put a magnet next to it and it distorted the can i don't know i saw it on a couple different videos so let's give it a try i don't know how they did it but there's gotta be a way i mean it was on like three different thumbnails
