i have to say depressingly and right let me say this right here and now i do not own adobe shares i'm not a marketing executive for adobe but the other day i did actually save a powerpoint presentation it was something like 370 megabytes in total i'd use the save as pdf available as standard in powerpoint and it reduced it from 370 to all of 210 megabytes wow and it was a pdf definit viewed fine i then put it through pdf writer pdf writer of course was a paid for option a pseudo printer driver and it went from 370 megabytes to 10 megabytes which i think says something about the willingness to call upon compression technologies and the expertise in preparing good pdfs let's just backtrack a little bit and remind ourselves of yeah fous famous launch of postcript in early 1985 john waro steve jobs all that and the example they used we've got it here here was john waru's original postcript which when imaged and rendered produced this supplementary income tax form but it was too slow for steve jobs to show at the launch we've done some stuff on this if you unroll the loops flatten the code then you can get something that works in about 25 seconds that's what they did now i know many of you will say well that's a good start but it's not enough what about this stuff you've gone out on in the past about lossy and lossless compression yes obviously in pdf many of you will know you can do lossless lz or el w type compression on text fine it's there it's available and yes in images you are certainly going to need to be able to do compression of the jpeg sort and to have it coped with by the postcript and indeed the pdf image oper ator so compression is of the order of the day over and beyond abbreviating things if this is the glimmerings of pdf why did it take so long for pdf to actually emerge well what how long what we talking here how long we're talking from 1985 when this was done and the actual announcement of pdf and acrobatics viewer software was late 92 early 93 so we are looking at seven years aren't we there more like eight probably by the time you finished why did it take so long and the answer is simple you had to wait for people's desktop workstations to become powerful enough to handle all this the common factor between the two is what's called the postcript graphic model which is magic but remember back in 85 the only computer in the room powerful enough to render postcript was the laser writer the macs were utterly incapable of doing it a standard 9in mac came with 128k just hopeless and they were so slow as well even slow than li printer so there we are then you realize that if postcript was going to develop away from being just something that ended up being printed out on paper into being something renderable on a big screen well for a start your screen's got to be capable of holding u of rendering us letter size or a4 size pages okay relate that back to a tiny 9in mac screen and the answer is well you'll have to wait for that technology to develop and you'll have to be prepared to pay a fortune for your apollo or son workstations for the 70 people in your print room or whatever it is to use but gradually slowly but surely it did come along and of course by 1990 there was no question postcript would won the high-end war completely and totally so what was their recommended means if you were a postcript devotee to get across the pdf as a first approximation and for the sake of argument we'll say maybe it was microsoft word or something like that here and up until now if you want high quality output let's use ellipses for stuff that's in printable formats so we say ps here yes you could get word to produce postcript you could send that postcript off apple laser writer or some other laser writer that actually had got postcript inside it adobe were making a fair bit of nice money thank you very much supplying proper postcript to go into laser writers right through to laser setters at the very high end the new feature now coming along was to say well if you port this postcript into another piece of adobe software called distiller this will turn it into this new and wonderful pdf now you've got to give people a means of viewing it for free the famous acrobat but you have to pay if you want distiller so the next question then was yes i'm a loyal postcript person but that distill is costing a fortune adobe i'm going to find somebody else who can do it for me and of course there were lots and lots of people who would do your distiller substitute it is not easy you have got to be able to take the most outrageously abominable postcript and not crash and i i remember saying to adobe b at the time i said well what's wrong with a lot of these clones he said they get everything right but the thing they can't handle is fonts and what he said well first of all you know you got to license them we've got got permission from lype to use their stuff but you've got to use clone fonts and then you're in trouble do they quite match what was there on the original and what the intention was and indeed fonts has always been a problem in this i once asked bob wolf the leader of the team that developed bdf distill of an acrobat reader and said bob what were your six greatest challenges in developing pdf and he said dave that's easy fonts fonts fonts fonts fonts and fonts in that order those were my six biggest challenges so anyway the obvious question to ask since this is going to cost you a lot of money is to say well look word needs to get into this pdf form now doesn't it to go you know be compliant why not take a flying leap around here cut out the middleman as it were you don't need to go through postcript anymore word or any other app could use a printer driver standard printer driver type thing except it's not really directly driving a prin is producing a pdf file well they did in very short order they came out with pdf writer and again opportunity for third parties pdf riser of course was a paid for option to get this pdf it was not free like reader so a lot of people said we can do a pdf writer that's good enough and some were better than others inevitably so to sum up then this is the nature of the pdf story it took a long time to get itself established but now it really is a de facto standard and a very very successful one too the only big conundrum still left and you know for those of us those of you who've seen my html video i can only come back to this that tim berners le's comment to me about we've got to find some way to marry exact representation and high quality typography with the flexibility to reflow stuff and we're still in a way puls apart i mean html despite css cannot really aspire to the same standards of typographic excellence as pdf can and yet pdf is exact but rigid sometimes people try and attempt to reflow pdf and it's rarely successful and it's certainly not easy so i think john war kno's comment i just wish you would do something about marrying these two views of the world is yeah one of the advantages of pdf and postcript is you can say draw me on my screen a line that is exactly one in long and it doesn't doesn't matter whether it's a 72 dpi screen or whether it's a piece of bromide imaged at 2,000 dots per inch that same command in either postcript or pdf draw me a line one inch long regardless of the resolution get your ruler out it will be one in long html can't do that every time you go on that loop it has to say what's my loop counter at the moment oh i'm on three now let me take a look at how far i'm supposed to oh six say oh it's three less than six yes it is oh i think we better go around again i exaggerate
