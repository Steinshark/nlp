the following is a conversation with melanie mitchell she's the professor of computer science at portland state university and an external professor at santa fe institute she has worked on and written about artificial intelligence from fascinating perspectives including adaptive complex systems genetic algorithms and the copycat cognitive architecture which places the process of analogy making at the core of human cognition from her doctoral work with her advisers douglas hofstadter and john holland - today she has contributed a lot of important ideas to the field of ai including her recent

melanie mitchell the name of your new book is artificial intelligence subtitle a guide for thinking humans the name of this podcast is artificial intelligence so let me take a step back and ask the old shakespeare question about roses and what do you think of the term artificial intelligence for our big and complicated and interesting field i'm not crazy about the term i think it has a few problems because it it's means so many different things to different people and intelligence is one of those words that isn't very clearly defined either there's so many different kinds of intelligence degrees of intelligence approaches to intelligence john mccarthy was the one who came up with the term artificial intelligence and what from what i read he called it that to differentiate it from cybernetics which was another related movement at the time and he later regretted calling it artificial intelligence herbert simon was pushing for calling it complex information processing which got nixed but you know probably is equally vague i guess is it the intelligence or the artificial in terms of words that it's the most problematic you would you say yeah i think it's a little of both but you know it has some good size because i personally was attracted to the field because i was interested in phenom phenomenons of intelligence and if it was called complex information processing maybe i'd be doing something wholly different now what do you think of i've heard the term used cognitive systems for example so using cognitive yeah i mean cognitive has certain associations with it and people like to separate things like cognition and perception which i don't actually think are separate but often people talk about cognition is being different from sort of other aspects of intelligence it's sort of higher level so to you cognition is this broad beautiful mess of things that's in calm the whole thing memory yeah i i think it's hard to draw lines like that when i was coming out of grad school in the night in 1990 which is when i graduated that was during one of the ai winters and i was advised to not put ai artificial intelligence on my cv but instead call it intelligent systems so that was kind of a euphemism i guess what about the stick briefly on on terms and words the idea of artificial general intelligence or or like beyond laocoon prefers human level intelligence sort of starting to talk about ideas that that achieve higher and higher levels of intelligence and somehow artificial intelligence seems to be a term used more for the narrow very specific applications of ai and sort of the there's the what set of terms appeal to you to describe the thing that perhaps would strive to create people have been struggling with this for the whole history of the field and defining exactly what it is that we're talking about you know john searle had this distinction between strong ai and weak ai and weak ai could be generally ai but his idea was strong ai was the view that a machine is actually thinking that as opposed to simulating thinking or carrying out intelligent processes that we would call intelligent high level if you look at the founding of the field of mccarthy in sterlin and so on are we closer to having a better sense of that line between narrow weak ai and strong ai yes i think we're closer to having a better idea of what that line is early on for example a lot of people thought that playing chess would be you couldn't play chess if you didn't have sort of general human level intelligence and of course once computers were able to play chess better than humans that revised that view and people said ok well maybe now we have to revise what we think of intelligence as or and and so that's kind of been a theme throughout the history of the field is that once a machine can do some task we then have to look back and say oh well that changes my understanding of what intelligence is because i don't think that machine is intelligent at least that's not what i want to call intelligence do you think that line moves forever or will we eventually really feel as a civilization like we cross the line if it's possible it's hard to predict but i don't see any reason why we couldn't in principle create something that we would consider intelligent i don't know how we will know for sure maybe our own view of what intelligence is will be refined more and more until we finally figure out what we mean when we talk about it but i i think eventually we will create machines in a sense that have intelligence they may not be the kinds of machines we have now and one of the things that that's going to produce is is making us sort of understand our own machine like qualities that we in a sense are mechanical in the sense that like an eles cells are kind of mechanical they part they have algorithms they process information by and somehow out of this mass of cells we get this emergent property that we call intelligence but underlying it is really just cellular processing and and lots and lots and lots of it do you think we'll be able to do you think it's possible to create intelligence without understanding our own mind you said sort of in that process we'll understand more and more but do you think it's possible to sort of create without really fully understanding from a mechanistic perspective sort of from a functional perspective how our mysterious mind works if i had to bet on it i would say no we we we do have to understand our own minds at least to some significant extent but it i think that's a really big open question i've been very surprised at how far kind of brute force approaches based on say big data and huge networks can can take us i wouldn't have expected that and they have nothing to do with the way our minds work so that's been surprising to me so it could be wrong to explore the psychological and the philosophical do you think we're okay as a species with something that's more intelligent than us do you think perhaps the reason we're pushing that line farther and farther is we're afraid of acknowledging that there's something stronger better smarter than us humans well i'm not sure we can define intelligence that way because you know smarter then is with with respect to what what you know computers are already smarter than us in some areas they could multiply much better than we can they they can figure out driving routes to take much faster and better than we can they have a lot more information to draw on they know about you know traffic conditions and all that stuff so for any given particular task sometimes computers are much better than we are and we're totally happy with that right i'm totally happy with that i don't doesn't bother me at all i guess the question is you know what which things about our intelligence would we feel very sad or or upset that machine's had been able to recreate so in the book i talk about my former phd advisor douglas hofstadter who encountered a music generation program and that was really the line for him that if a machine could create beautiful music that would be terrifying for him because that is something he feels is really at the core of what it is to be human creating beautiful music art literature i you know i don't think he doesn't like the fact that machines can recognize spoken language really well like he doesn't he personally doesn't like using speech recognition i don't think it bothers him to his core because it's like okay that's not at the core of humanity but it may be different for every person what what really they feel would usurp their humanity and i think maybe it's a generational thing also maybe our children or our children's children will be adapted they'll adapt to these new devices that can do all these tasks and and say yes this thing is smarter than me in all these areas but that's great because it helps me looking at the broad history of our species why do you think so many humans have dreamed of creating artificial life and artificial intelligence throughout the history of our civilization so not just this century or the 20th century but really many throughout many centuries that preceded it that's a really good question and i have wondered about that because i'm i myself you know was driven by curiosity about my own thought processes and thought it would be fantastic to be able to get a computer to mimic some of my thought process season i'm not sure why we're so driven i think we want to understand ourselves better and we also want machines to do things for us but i don't know there's something more to it because it's so deep in in the kind of mythology or the dose of our species and i don't think other species have this drive so i don't know if you were to sort of psychoanalyze yourself and you're in your own interest in ai are you what excites you about creating intelligence you said understanding our own selves yeah i think that's what drives me particularly i'm really interested in human intelligence but i'm all i'm also interested in the sort of the phenomenon of intelligence more generally and i don't think humans are the only thing with intelligence you know i or even animals that i think intelligence is a concept that encompasses a lot of complex systems and if you think of things like insect colonies or cellular processes or the immune system or all kinds of different biological or even societal processes have as an emergent property some aspects of what we would call intelligence you know they have memory they do in process information they have goals they accomplish their goals etc and to me that the question of what is this thing we're talking about here was really fascinating to me and and exploring it using computers seem to be a good way to approach the question so do you think kind of intelligence do you think of our universes a kind of hierarchy of complex systems and then intelligence is just the property of any you can look at any level and every level has some aspect of intelligence so we're just like one little speck in that giant hierarchy of complex systems i don't know if i would say any system like that has intelligence but i guess what i want to i don't have a good enough definition of intelligence to say that so let me let me do sort of multiple choice i guess though so you said ant colonies so our ant colonies intelligent are the bacteria in our body in intelligent and then look going to the physics world molecules and the behavior at the quantum level of of electrons and so on is are those kinds of systems do they possess intelligence like words where's the line that feels compelling to you i don't know i mean i think intelligence is a continuum and i think that the ability to in some sense have intention have a goal have a some kind of self-awareness is part of it so i'm not sure if you know it's hard to know where to draw that line i think that's kind of a mystery but i wouldn't say that say that you know this the planets orbiting the sun her is an intelligent system i mean i would find that maybe not the right term to describe that and this is you know there's all this debate in the field of like what's what's the right way to define intelligence what's the right way to model intelligence should we think about computation should we think about dynamics and should we think about you know free energy and all of that stuff and i think that it's it's a fantastic time to be in the field because there's so many questions and so much we don't understand there's so much work to do so are we are we the most special kind of intelligence this kind of you said there's a bunch of different elements and characteristics of intelligent systems and colonies are his human intelligence the thing in our brain is that the most interesting kind of intelligence in this continuum well it's interesting to us because because it is us i mean interesting to me yes and because i'm part of the you know human but to understanding the fundamentals of intelligence what i'm yeah yeah jerry is studying the human is sort of if everything we've talked about will you talk about in your book what just the ai field this notion yes it's hard to define but it's usually talking about something that's very akin to human intelligence to me it is the most interesting because it's the most complex i think it's the most self-aware it's the only system at least that i know of that reflects on its own intelligence and you talk about the history of ai and us in terms of creating artificial intelligence being terrible at predicting the future or the iowa tech in general so why do you think we're so bad at predicting the future are we hopelessly bad so no matter what well there's this decade or the next few decades every time i make a prediction there's just no way of doing it well or as the field matures we'll be better and better at it i believe as the field matures we will be better and i think the reason that we've had so much trouble is that we have so little understanding of our own intelligence so there's the famous story about marvin minsky assigning computer vision as a summer project to his undergrad students and i believe that's actually a true story ya know there's a there's a write-up on it everyone should read it's like a i think it's like a proposal this describes everything done in that project is hilarious because that i mean you can explain it but for my sort of recollection it described is basically all the fundamental problems of computer vision many of which they still haven't been solved yeah and and i don't know how far they really expected to get but i think that and and they're really you know marvin minsky is super smart guy and very sophisticated thinker but i think that no one really understands or understood still doesn't understand how complicated how complex the things that we do are because they're so invisible to us you know to us vision being able to look out at the world and describe what we see that's just immediate it feels like it's no work at all so it didn't seem like it would be that hard but there's so much going on unconsciously sort of invisible to us that i think we overestimate how easy it will be to get computers to do it and sort of for me to ask an unfair question you've done research you've thought about many different branches of ai and through this book widespread looking at where ai has been where it is today what if you were to make a prediction how many years from now would we as a society create something that you would say achieved human level intelligence or superhuman level intelligence that is an unfair question a prediction that will most likely be wrong so but it's just your notion because okay i'll say i'll say more than a hundred years more than a hundred years and there i quoted somebody in my book who said that human level intelligence is a hundred nobel prizes away which i like because it's a it's a nice way to to sort of it's a nice unit for prediction and it's like that many fantastic discoveries have to be made and of course there's no nobel prize in if we look at that hundred years your senses really the journey to intelligence has to go through something something more complicated as again to our own cognitive systems understanding them being able to create them in in the artificial systems as opposed to sort of taking the machine learning approaches of today and really scaling them and scaling them and scaling them exponentially with both computing hardware and and data that would be my that would be my guess you know i think that in in the the sort of going along in the narrow ai that these current the current approaches will get better you know i think there's some fundamental limits to how far they're gonna get i might be wrong but that's what i think but and there's some fundamental weaknesses that they have that i talked about in the book that that just comes from this approach of supervised learning we require requiring sort of feed-forward networks and so on it it's just i don't think it's a sustainable approach to understanding the world yeah i'm i'm personally torn on it sort of i've everything read about in the book and sort of we're talking about now i agreed i agree with you but i'm more and more depending on the day first of all i'm deeply surprised by the successful machine learning and deep learning in general and from the very beginning that when i was it's really been many focus of work i'm just surprised how far it gets and i'm also think we're really early on in these efforts of these narrow ai so i think there will be a lot of surprise off how far it gets i think will be extremely impressed like my senses everything i've seen so far and we'll talk about autonomous driving and so on i think we can get really far but i also have a sense that we will discover just like you said is that even though we'll get really far in order to create something like our own intelligence is actually much farther than we realized right i think these methods are a lot more powerful than people give them credit for actually so that of course there's the media hype but i think there's a lot of researchers in the community especially like not undergrads right but like people who've been in ai they're skeptical about how far deep learning yet and i'm more and more thinking that it can actually get farther than i realize it's certainly possible one thing that surprised me when i was writing the book is how far apart different people are in the field are artisan their opinion of how how far the field has come and what is accomplished and what's what's gonna happen next what's your sense of the different who are the different people groups mindsets thoughts in the community about where ai is today yeah they're all over the place so so there's there's kind of the the singularity transhumanism group i don't know exactly how to characterize that approach which is there as well yeah the sort of exponential exponential progress we're on the sort of almost at the the hugely accelerating part of the exponential and by in the next 30 years we're going to see super intelligent ai and all that and we'll be able to upload our brains and that so there's that kind of extreme view that most i think most people who work in ai don't have they disagree with that but there are people who who are maybe don't aren't you know singularity people but but they're they do think that the current approach of deep learning is going to scale and is going to kind of go all the way basically and take us to ai or human-level ai or whatever you want to call it and there's quite a few of them and a lot of them like a lot of the people i've met who work at big tech companies in ai groups kind of have this view that we're really not that far you know just to linger on that point sort of if i can take as an example like yannick kun i don't know if you know about his work and so a few points unless i do he believes that there's a bunch of breakthroughs like fundamental like nobel prizes there's yeah he did still write but i think he thinks those breakthroughs will be built on top of deep learning right and then there's some people who think we need to kind of put deep learning to the side a little bit as just one module that's helpful in the bigger cognitive framework right so so i think some what i understand yan laocoon is rightly saying supervised learning is not sustainable we have to figure out how to do unsupervised learning that that's going to be the key and you know i think that's probably true i think unsupervised learning is going to be harder than people think i mean the way that we humans do it then there's the opposing view you know that there's a the the gary marcus kind of hybrid view or where deep learning is one part but we need to bring back kind of these symbolic approaches and combine them of course no one knows how to do that very well which is the more important part right to emphasize and how do they how do they fit together what's what's the foundation what's the thing that's on top yeah the cake was the icing right yeah then there's people pushing different different things there's the people the causality people who say you know deep learning as its formulated a completely lacks any notion of causality and that's dooms it and therefore we have to somehow give it some kind of notion of cause there's a lot of push from the more cognitive science crowd saying we have to look at developmental learning we have to look at how babies learn we have to look at intuitive physics all these things we know about physics and it's somebody kind of quipped we also have to teach machines intuitive metaphysics which means like objects exist causality exists you know these things that maybe were born with i don't know that that they don't have the machines don't have any of that you know they look at a group of pixels and they maybe they get 10 million examples but they they can't necessarily learn that there are objects in the world so there's just a lot of pieces of the puzzle that people are promoting and with different opinions of like how how how important they are and how close we are to the you know we'll put them all together to create general intelligence looking at this broad field what do you take away from it who is the most impressive is that the cognitive folks gary marcus camp the yawn camp son supervising their self supervise there's the supervisor and then there's the engineers who are actually building systems you have sort of the andrey carpathia tesla building actual you know it's not philosophy it's real writing systems that operate in the real world what yeah what do you take away from all all this beautiful yeah i don't know if you know these these different views are not necessarily mutually exclusive and i think people like jung mccune agrees with the developmental psychology causality intuitive physics etc but he still thinks that it's learning like end-to-end learning is the way to go we'll take us perhaps all the way yeah and that we don't need there's no sort of innate stuff that has to get built in this is you know it's because no it's a hard problem i personally you know i'm very sympathetic to the cognitive science side because that's kind of where i came in to the field i've become more and more sort of an embodiment adherent saying that you know without having a body it's gonna be very hard to learn what we need to learn about the world that's definitely something like i'd love to talk about in a little bit to step into the cognitive world then if you don't mind because you've done so many interesting things if you look to copycat taking a couple of decades step back you'd douglas hofstadter and others have created and developed copycat more than thirty years ago ah that's painful here what is it what is what is copycat it's a program that makes analogies in an idealized domain idealized world of letter strings so as you say thirty years ago wow so i started working on it when i started grad school in 1984 wow and it's based on doug hofstadter's ideas that about that analogy is really a core aspect of thinking i remember he has a really nice quote in in in the book by by himself and emmanuel sanders called surfaces and essences i don't know if you've seen that book but it's it's about analogy he says without concepts there can be no thought and without analogies there can be no concepts so the view is that analogy is not just this kind of reasoning technique where we go you know shoe is to foot as glove as to what you know these kinds of things that we have on iq tests or whatever that but that it's much deeper much more pervasive in everything we do in everything our language our thinking our perception so we so he had a view that was a very active perception idea so the idea was that instead of having kind of what a passive network in which you have input that's being processed through these feed-forward layers and then there's an output at the end that perception is really a dynamic process you know we're like our eyes are moving around and they're getting information and that information is feeding back to what we look at next influences what we look at next and how we look at it and so copycat was trying to do that kind of simulate that kind of idea where you have these agents it's kind of an agent based system and you have these agents that are picking things to look at and deciding whether they were interesting or not whether they should be looked at more and and that would influence other agents how do they interact so they interacted through this global kind of what we call the workspace so this actually inspired by the old blackboard systems where you'd have agents that post information on a blackboard a common blackboard this is like old very old fashioned a set is that we're talking about like in physical space is a computer program computer programs agents posting concepts on a blackboard yeah we called it a workspace and it it's the workspace is a data structure the agents are little pieces of code that you can think of them as detect little detectors or little filters then say i'm gonna pick this place to look and i'm gonna look for a certain thing and it's just the thing i i think is important is it there so it's almost like you know a convolution in way except a little bit more general and saying and then highlighting it on the on the work in the workspace wasn't once it's in the workspace how do the things they're highlighted relate to each other like what so there's different kinds of agents that can build connections between different things so just to give you a concrete example what copycat did was it made analogies between strings of letters so here's an example abc changes to a bd what does ijk change to and the program had some prior knowledge about the alphabet new the sequence of the alphabet it you know had a concept of letter successor of letter it had concepts of sameness so it has some innate things programmed in but then it could do things like say discover that abc is a group of letters in succession hmm and then it an agent can mark that so the idea that there could be a sequence of letters is that a new concept that's formed or if that's a concept that's a concept that's innate sort of can you form new concepts or all so in this program all the concepts of the program were innate so cuz because we weren't i mean obviously that limits it quite up quite a bit but what we were trying to do is say suppose you have some innate concepts how do you flexibly apply them to new situations right and how do you make analogies let's step back for a second so i really like that quote that he said without concepts there can be no thought and without analogies that can be no concepts you know in a santa fe presentation you said that it should be one of the mantras of ai yes and that you all see yourself said how to form and fluidly use concept is the most important open problem in ai yes how to form and fluidly use concepts is the most important open problem in ai so let's what is the concept and what is an analogy a concept is in some sense a fundamental unit of thought so say we have a concept of a dog okay and a concept is embedded in a whole space of concepts so that there's certain concepts that are closer to it or farther away from it are these concepts are they really like fundamental like we mention innate look almost like xe o matic like very basic and then there's other stuff built on top of it or just include everything is are they're complicated like you can certainly have form new concepts right i guess that's the question i'm asked yeah can you form new concepts that our company complex combinations of other ago yes absolutely and that's kind of what we we do you know learning and then what's the role of analogies in that so analogy is when you recognize that one situation is essentially the same as another situation and essentially is kind of the key word there and because it's not the same so if i say last week i did a podcast interview in actually like three days ago in washington dc and that situation was very similar to this situation although it wasn't exactly the same you know it was a different person sitting across from me we had different kinds of microphones the questions were different the building was different there's all kinds of different things but really it was analogous or i can say so by doing a podcast interview that's kind of a constant it's a new concept you know i never had that concept before i mean and i can make an analogy with it like being interviewed for a news article in a newspaper and i can say well you kind of play the same role that the the newspaper the reporter played it's not exactly the same because maybe they actually emailed me some written questions rather than and the writing the written questions play the you know are analogous to your spoken questions you know there's just all kinds of this somehow probably connects to conversations you have over thanksgiving dinner just general conversations you could there's like a thread you can probably take that just stretches out in all aspects of life that connect to this podcast i mean sure conversations between humans sure and and if i go and tell a friend of mine about this podcast interview my friend might say oh the same thing happened to me you know let's say you know you ask me some really hard question and i have trouble answering it my friend could say the same thing happened to me but it was like it wasn't a podcast interview it wasn't it was a completely different situation and yet my friend is seen essentially this the same thing you know we say that very fluidly the same thing happened to me essentially the same thing we don't even say that right things they imply it yes yeah and the view that kind of what went into say coffee cat that that whole thing is that that that that act of saying the same thing happened to me is making an analogy and in some sense that's what's underlies all of our concepts why do you think analogy making that you're describing is so fundamental to cognition like it seems like it's the main element action of what we think of us cognition yeah so it can be argued that all of this generalization we do concepts and recognizing concepts in different situations is done by analogy that that's every time i'm recognizing that say you're a person that's by analogy because i have this concept of what person is and i'm applying it to you and every time i recognize a new situation like one of the things i talked about it in the book was the the concept of walking a dog that that's actually making an analogy because all that you know the details are very different so it's so now--so reasoning could be reduced on to sense your analogy making so all the things we think of as like yeah like you said perception so what's perception is taking raw sensory input and it's somehow integrating into our our understanding of the world updating the understanding and all of that has just this giant mess of analogies that are being made i think so yeah if you just linger on it a little bit like what what do you think it takes to engineer a process like that for us in our artificial systems we need to understand better i think how how we do it how humans do it and it comes down to internal models i think you know people talk a lot about mental models that concepts are mental models that i can in my head i can do a simulation of a situation like walking a dog and that there there's some work in psychology that promotes this idea that all of concepts are really mental simulations that whenever you encounter a concept or situation in the world or you read about it or whatever you do some kind of mental simulation that allows you to predict what's going to happen to develop expectations of what's going to happen mm-hm so that's the kind of structure i think we need is that kind of mental model that and the in our brain somehow these mental models are very much inter connected again so a lot of stuff we're talking about it they're essentially open problems right so if i ask a question i don't mean that you would know the answer already just hypothesizing but how big do you think is the the network graph data structure of concepts that's in our head like if we're trying to build that ourselves like it's we take it and that's one of the things we take for granted we think i mean that's why we take common sense for granted within common sense is trivial but how big of a thing of concepts is on that underlies what we think of as common sense for example yeah i don't know and i'm not i don't even know what units to measure it in beautifully put right but but you know we have you know it's really hard to know we have what a hundred billion neurons or something i don't know and they're connected via trillions of synapses and there's all this chemical processing going on there's just a lot of capacity for the stuff and their informations encoded in different ways in the brain it's encoded in chemical interactions it's encoded and electric like firing and firing rates and and nobody really knows how it's encoded but it just seems like there's a huge amount of capacity so i think it's it's huge it's just enormous and it's amazing how much stuff we know yeah and but we know and not just know like facts but it's all integrated into this thing that we can make analogies with yes there's a dream of semantic web and there's there's a lot of dreams from expert systems of building giant knowledge bases or do you see a hope for these kinds of approaches of building of converting wikipedia into something that could be used in analogy making sure and i think people have have made some progress along those lines i mean people have been working on this for a long time but the problem is and this i think was is is the problem of common sense like people have been trying to get these common sense networks here at mit there's this concept net project right but the problem is that as i said most of the knowledge that we have is invisible to us it's not in wikipedia it's very basic things about you know intuitive physics intuitive psychology to ative metaphysics all that stuff if you were to create a website that described intuitive physics intuitive psychology would it be bigger or smaller than wikipedia what do you think i guess describe to whom no that's very really good right yeah that's a hard question because you know how do you represent that knowledge is the question right i can certainly write down f equals ma and newton's laws and a lot of physics can be deduced from that but that's probably not the best representation of that knowledge for for doing the kinds of reasoning we want a machine to do so so i don't know it's it's it's impossible to say and you know the projects like there's a famous the famous psych project right that doug douglass lynott did that was trying still going i think it's still going and if the the idea was to try and encode all of common-sense knowledge including all this invisible knowledge in some kind of logical representation and it just never i think could do any of the things that he was hoping it could do because that's just the wrong approach of course that's what they always say you know and then the history books will say well the psych project finally found a breakthrough in 2058 or something and it did you know we're so much progress has been made in just a few decades that yeah okay knows what the next breakthroughs will be it could be a certainly a compelling notion what the psych project stands for i think lenin was one of the early people do say common sense is what we need and that's what we need all this like expert system stuff that is not going to get you to ai you need common sense and he basically gave up his whole academic career to to go pursue that i told my er that but i think that the approach itself will not what do you think is wrong with approach what kind of approach would might be successful well again he knows the answer right i knew that you know one of my talks one of the people in the audience's a published lecture one of the people in the audience said what ai companies are you investing in advice i'm a college professor extra funds to invest but also like no one knows what's gonna work in ai right that's the problem let me ask another impossible question in case you have a sense in terms of data structures that will store this kind of information do you think they've been invented yet both in hardware and software or is something else needs to be are we totally you know i think something else has to be invented i that's my guess is the breakthroughs that's most promising would that be in hardware and software do you think we can get far with the current computers or do we need to do something you're saying i don't know if turing computation is gonna be sufficient probably i would guess it will i don't i don't see any reason why we need anything else but so so in that sense we have invented the hardware we need but we just need to make it faster and bigger and we need to figure out the right algorithms and and the right sort of architecture touring that's a very mathematical notion when we try to have to build intelligence it's not an engineering notion where you throw all that stuff i guess i guess it is a it is a question that their people have brought up this question you know and when you asked about like is our current hardware will our current hardware work well turing computation says that like our current hardware is in principle a turing machine right so all we have to do is make it faster and bigger but there have been people like roger penrose if you might remember that he said turing machines cannot produce intelligence because intelligence requires continuous valued numbers i mean that was sort of my reading of his argument and quantum mechanics and what else whatever you know but i don't see any evidence for that that we need new computation paradigms but i don't know if we're you know i don't think we're going to be able to scale up our current approaches to programming these computers what is your hope for approaches like copycat or other cognitive architectures i've talked to the creator of sore for example i've used that arm myself i don't know if you're familiar with yeah woody what do you think is what's your hope of approaches like that in helping develop systems of greater and greater intelligence in the coming decades well that's what i'm working on now is trying to take some of those ideas and extending it so i think there are some really promising approaches that are going on now that have to do with more active generative models so this is the idea of this simulation in your head a concept when you if you want to when you're perceiving a new a new situation you have some simulations in your head those are generative models they're generating your expectations they're generating predictions that's part of a perception you haven't met the model that generates a prediction then you come parrot with ya and then the difference and you also that that generative model is telling you where to look and what to look at and what to pay attention to and it i think it affects your perception it's not that just you compare it with your perception it it becomes your perception in a way it is kind of a mixture of that bottom-up information coming from the world and your top-down model being opposed in the world is what becomes your perception so your hope is something like that can improve perception systems and that they can understand things better yes understand things yes what's the what's the step was the analogy making step there well there the the the idea is that you have this pretty complicated conceptual space you know you can talk about a semantic network or something like that with these different kinds of concept models in your brain that are connected so so let's let's take the example of walking a dog we were talking about that okay let's see i say see someone out on the street walking a cat some people walk their cats i guess this seems like a bad idea but yeah so my model of my you know there's connections between my model of a dog and model of a cat and i can immediately see the analogy of that those are analogous situations but i can also see the differences and that tells me what to expect so also you know i have a new situation so another example with the walking the dog thing is sometimes people i see people riding their bikes with elise holding a leash and the dogs running alongside okay so i know that the i recognize that as kind of a dog walking situation even though the person's not walking right and the dogs not walking because i i have the these these models that say okay riding a bike is sort of similar to walking or it's connected it's a means of transportation but i because they have their dog there i assume they're not going to work but they're going out for exercise and you know these analogies help me to figure out kind of what's going on what's likely but sort of these analogies are very human interpreter bowl mm-hmm so that's that kind of space and then you look at something like the current deep learning approaches they kind of help you to take raw sensory information and just to automatically build up hierarchies of role you can even call them concepts they're just not human interpretive or concepts what's your what's the link here do you hope it's sort of the hybrid system question how do you think that two can start to meet each other what's the value of learning in this systems of forming of analogy making the the goal of i you know the original goal of deep learning in at least visual perception was that you would get the system to learn to extract features that at these different levels of complexities may be edge detection and that would lead into learning you know simple combinations of edges and then more complex shapes and then whole objects or faces and this was based on that the ideas of the neuroscientists hubel and wiesel who had seen laid out this kind of structure and brain and i think that is that's right to some extent of course people have come found that the whole story is a little more complex than that and the brain of course always is and there's a lot of feedback and so i see that as absolutely a good brain inspired approach to some aspects of perception but one thing that it's lacking for example is all of that feedback which is extremely important the interactive element do you mentioned the expectation the sexual level go back and forth with the the expectation the perception and yes going back and forth so right so that is extremely important and you know one thing about deep neural networks is that in a given situation like you know they they're trained right they get these weights everything but then now i give them a new a new image let's say yes they treat every part of the image in the same way you know they apply the same filters at each layer to all parts of the image mm-hmm there's no feedback to say like oh this part of the image is irrelevant right i shouldn't care about this part of the image or this part of the image is the most important part and that's kind of what we humans are able to do because we have these conceptual expectations there's a little bit work in that there's certainly a lot more in a tent what's under the called attention in natural language processing knowledge ease it's a that's exceptionally powerful and it's a very just as you say it's really powerful idea but again in sort of machine learning it all kind of operates in an automated way that's not human it's not it's not also okay so that yeah right it's not dynamic i mean in the sense that as a perception of a new example is being processed those attentions weights don't change right so i mean there's a this kind of notion that there's not a memory so you're not aggregating the idea of the this mental model yes yeah he that seems to be a fundamental idea there's not a really powerful i mean there's some stuff with memory but there's not a powerful way to represent the world in some sort of way that's deeper than and it's it's so difficult because you know neural networks do represent the world they do have a mental model right but it just seems to be shallow i like it it's it's hard to it's it's hard to criticize them at the fundamental level to me at least it's easy to it's it's easy to criticize and we'll look like exactly you're saying mental models sort of almost from a sec i'll put a psychology head on say look these networks are clearly not able to achieve what we humans do with forming mental models but analogy making so on but that doesn't mean that they fundamentally cannot do that like you can it's very difficult to say that i mean i used to me do you have a notion that the learning approaches really i mean they're going to not not only are they limited today but they will forever be limited in being able to construct such mental models i think the idea of the dynamic perception is key here the idea that moving your eyes around and getting feedback and that's something that you know there's been some models like that there's certainly recurrent neural networks that operate over several time steps and but the problem is that it that the actual the recurrence is you know basically the the feedback is to the next time step is the entire hidden state yes the network which which is it that it that's that doesn't work very well does he hit the the thing i'm saying is mathematically speaking it has the information in that recurrence to capture everything it just doesn't seem to work yeah so like my you know it's like it's the same touring machine question right yeah maybe theoretically it computers and anything that's throwing a universal turing machine can can be intelligent but practically the architecture might be very specific kind of architecture to be able to create it so just i guess it's sort of ask almost the same question again is how big of a role do you think deep learning needs will play or needs to play in this in perception i think deep learning as it's currently as it currently exists you know will place that kind of thing will play some role and but i think that there's a lot more going on in perception but who knows you know that the definition of deep learning i mean it this it's pretty broad it's kind of an umbrella so what i mean is purely sort of neural networks yeah and a feed-forward neural networks essentially or there could be recurrence but yeah sometimes it feels like for us i'll talk to gary marcus it feels like the criticism of deep learning is kind of like us birds criticizing airplanes for not flying well or that they're not really flying do you think deep learning do you think it could go all the way like you're looking things do you think that yeah the brute force learning approach can go all the way i don't think so no i mean i think it's an open question but i i tend to be on the innate ness side that there has that there's some things that we've been evolved to be able to learn and that learning just can't happen without them so so one example here's an example i had in the book that that i think is useful to me at least in thinking about this so this has to do with the deepmind's atari game playing program okay and learned to play these atari video games just by getting input from the pixels of the screen and it learned to play the game break out thousand percent better than humans okay that was one of the results and it was great and and it learned this thing where it tunneled through the side of the the bricks in the breakout game and the ball could bounce off the ceiling and then just wipe out bricks okay so there was a group who did an experiment where they took the paddle you know that you move with the joystick and moved it up to pixels or something like that and then they they looked at a deep q learning system that had been trained on breakout and said could it now transfer its learning to this new version of the game of course a human could but and it couldn't maybe that's not surprising but i guess the point is it hadn't learned the concept of a paddle it hadn't learned that it hadn't learned the concept of a ball or the concept of tunneling it was learning something you know we caught we looking at it kind of anthropomorphised it and said oh it here's what it's doing and the way we describe it but it actually didn't learn those concepts and so because it didn't learn those concepts it couldn't make this transfer yes so that's a beautiful statement but at the same time by moving the paddle we also anthropomorphize flaws to inject into the system that will then flip out how impressed we are by it what i mean by that is to me the atari games were to me deeply impressive that that was possible at all so that guy first pause on that and people should look at that just like the game of go which is fundamentally different to me then then what deep blue did even though there's still mighty calls distillate research it's just everything in deep mind is done in terms of learning however limited it is still deeply surprising to me yeah i i'm not i'm not trying to say that what they did wasn't impressive i think it was incredibly impressive to me is interesting is moving the path aboard just another love another thing that needs to be learned so like we've been able to maybe maybe been able to through the current neural networks learn very basic concepts that are not enough to do this general reasoning and it may be with more data i mean the data that you know the interesting thing about the examples that you talk about and beautifully is they it's often flaws of the data well that's the question i mean i think that is the key question it whether it's a flaw of the data or not or the mexico the reason i brought up this example was because you were asking do i think that you know learning from data could go all the way yes and that this was why i brought up the example because i think and this was is not at all to to take away from the impressive work that they did but it's to say that when we look at what these systems learn do they learn the human the things that we humans consider to be the relevant concepts and in that example it didn't sure if you train it on a movie you know the pat paddle being in different places maybe it could deal with maybe it would learn that concept i'm not totally sure but the question is you know scaling that up to more complicated worlds to what extent could a machine that only gets this very raw data learn to divide up the world into relevant concepts and i don't know the answer but i would bet that that without some innate notion that it can't do it yeah ten years ago a hundred percent agree with you as the deal most experts in a system but now i have a one but like i have a glimmer of hope okay have you no that's very nice and i think i think that's what deep learning did in the community is no no i still if i had to bet all my money it's a hundred percent deep learning will not takes all the way but there's still other it still i was so personally sort of surprised mm-hmm why the thar games by go by by the power of self play of just yeah i'm playing against you that i was like many other times just humbled of how little i know about what's possible you know yeah i think fair enough self play is amazingly powerful and you know that's that goes way back to arthur samuel wright with his checker playing program and that which was brilliant and surprising that it did so well so just for fun let me ask you a topic of autonomous vehicles it's the area that that i work at least these days most closely on and it's also area that i think is a good example that you use a sort of an example of things we as humans don't always realize how hard it is to do it's like the the constant trend ai but the different problems that we think are easy when we first try them and then realize how hard it is okay so why you've talked about this autonomous driving being a difficult problem more difficult than we realize you must give it credit for why is it so difficult one of the most difficult parts in your view i think it's difficult because of the world is so open-ended as to what what kinds of things can happen so you have sort of what normally happens which is just you drive along and nothing nothing surprising happens and autonomous vehicles can do the ones we have now evidently can do really well on most normal situations as long as long as you know the weather is reasonably good and everything but if some we have this notion of edge cases or or you know things in the tail of the distribution you call it the long tail problem which says that there's so many possible things that can happen that was not in the training data of the machine that it won't be able to handle it because it doesn't have common sense right it's the old the paddle moved yeah it's the paddle moved problem right and so my understanding and you probably are more of an expert than i am on this is that current self driving car vision systems have problems with obstacles meaning that they don't know which obstacles which quote unquote obstacles they should stop for and which ones they shouldn't stop for and so a lot of times i read that they tend to slam on the brakes quite a bit and the most common accidents with self-driving cars are people rear-ending them because they were surprised they've warned expecting the machine the car to stop yeah so there's there's a lot of interesting questions there whether because because you mentioned kind of two things so one is the the problem of perception of understanding of interpreting the objects that are detected right correctly and the other one is more like the policy the action that you take how you respond to it so a lot of the cars braking is a kind of notion of to clarify there's a lot of different kind of things that are people calling autonomous vehicles but a lot the l for vehicles with a safety driver are the ones like way moe and cruise and those companies they tend to be very conservative and cautious so they tend to be very very afraid of hurting anything or anyone and getting in any kind of accidents so their policy is very kind of that it that results in being exceptionally responsive to anything that could possibly be an obstacle right right which which which the human drivers around it it's unpredictably yeah that's not a very human thing to do caution that's not the thing we're good at specially in driving we're in a hurry often angry and etc especially in boston so and then there's of another and a lot of times that's machine learning is not a huge part of that it's becoming more and more unclear to me how much you you know sort of speaking to public information because a lot of companies say they're doing deep learning and machine learning just attract good candidates the reality is in many cases it's still not a huge part of the the perception this is this lidar there's other sensors that are much more reliable for obstacle detection and then there's tesla approach which is vision only and there's i think a few companies doing that protest the most sort of famously pushing that forward and that's because the lidar is too expensive right well i mean yes but i would say if you were to for free give to every test vehicle i mean elon musk fundamentally believes that lidar is a crutch right fantasy said that that if you want to solve the problem of machine learning lidar is not should not be the primary sensor is the belief okay the camera contains a lot more information mm-hmm so if you want to learn you want that information but if you want to not to hit obstacles you want like are it's sort of it's this weird trade-off because yeah it's sort of what tesla vehicles have a lot of which is really the thing the price of the fallback the primary fallback sensor is radar which is a very crude version of lighter it's a good detector of obstacles except when those things are standing right the stopped vehicle right that's why it had problems with crashing into stop fire trucks stop fire trucks right so the hope there is that the vision sensor would somehow catch that and infer there's a lot of problems of perception i they are doing actually some incredible stuff in the almost like an active learning space where it's constantly taking edge cases and pulling back in there's a state data pipeline another aspect that is really important that people are studying now is called multitask learning which is sort of breaking apart this problem whatever the problem is in this case driving into dozens or hundreds of little problems that you can turn into learning problems so this giant pipeline the you know it's kind of interesting i've been skeptical from the very beginning we've become less and less skeptical over time how much of driving can be learned i'm still think it's much farther than then the ceo of that particular company thinks it will be but it it is costly surprising that through good engineering and data collection and active selection of data how you can attack that long tail and it's an interesting open question that you're absolutely right there's a much longer tail and all these edge cases that we don't think about but it's this it's a fascinating question that applies to natural language in all spaces how big how how big is that long tail right and i mean not to linger on the point but what's your sense in driving in these practical problems of the human experience can it be learned so the current what are your thoughts are sort of elon musk thought let's forget the thing that he says it'd be solved in a year but can it be solved in in a reasonable timeline or do fundamentally other methods need to be invented so i i don't i think that ultimately driving so so it's a trade-off in a way i you know being able to drive and deal with any situation that comes up does require kind of full human telogen sand even in humans aren't intelligent enough to do it because humans i mean most human accidents are because the human wasn't paying attention or the humans drunk or whatever and not because they weren't intelligent but not because they weren't intelligent enough right whereas the accidents with autonomous vehicles is because they weren't intelligent enough they're always paying attention so it's a it's a trade off you know and i think that it's a very fair thing to say that autonomous vehicles will be ultimately safer than humans because humans are very unsafe it's kind of a low bar but just like you said the iii i think he was get a bad rap right cuz we're really good at the common-sense thing yeah we're great at the common-sense thing we're bad at the paying atten thing being attached a thing especially moral you know driving is kind of boring and we have these phones to play with and everything but i think what what's gonna happen is that for many reasons not just ai reasons but also like legal and other reasons that the the definition of self-driving is going to change or autonomous is going to change it's not going to be just i'm gonna go to sleep in the back and you just drive me anywhere it's gonna be more certain areas are going to be instrumented to have the sensors and the mapping and all the stuff you need for that that the autonomous cars won't have to have full common sense and they'll do just fine in those areas as long as pedestrians don't mess with them too much that's another question i don't think we will have fully autonomous self-driving in the way that like most the average person thinks of it for a very long time and just to reiterate this is the interesting open question that i think i agree with you on is to solve fully thomas driving you have to be able to engineer in common sense yes i think it's an important thing to hear and think about i hope that's wrong but i currently i could agree with you that unfortunately you do have to have to be more specific sort of these deep understandings of physics and yeah of the way this world works and also the human dynamics like you mentioned pedestrians and cyclists actually that's whatever that nonverbal communication is some people call it there's that dynamic that is also part of this common sense right and we're pretty we humans are pretty good at predicting what other humans are gonna do and how are our actions impacts the behaviors of yes this is weird game theoretic dance that we're good at somehow and work well the funny thing is is because i've watched countless hours of pedestrian video and talked to people we humans are also really bad at articulating the knowledge we have right which is a been a huge challenge yes so you've mentioned embodied intelligence what do you think it takes to build a system of human level intelligence does he need to have a body i'm not sure but i i'm coming around to that more and more and what does it mean to be i don't mean to keep breaking on up yeah laocoon he looms very large yeah well he certainly has a large personality yes he thinks that the system needs to be grounded meaning he needs to sort of be able to interact with reality but it doesn't think it necessarily need to have a body so when you think of what's the difference i guess i want to ask when you mean body do you mean you have to be able to play with the world or do you also mean like there's a body that you that you have to preserve oh that's a good question i haven't really thought about that but i think both i would guess because it's because i think you i think intelligence it's so hard to separate it from self our desire for self-preservation our emotions are all that non rational stuff that kind of gets in the way of logical thinking because we the way you know if we're talking about human intelligence or human level intelligence whatever that means a huge part of it is social that you know we were evolved to be social and to deal with other people and that's just so ingrained in us that it's hard to separate intelligence from that i i think you know ai for the last 70 years or however long has been around it it has largely been separated there's this idea that there's like it's kind of very cartesian there's this you know thinking thing that we're trying to create but we don't care about all this other stuff and i think the other stuff is very fundamental so there's idea that things like emotion get in the way of intelligence as opposed to being an integral part and part of it so i mean i'm russian so romanticize the notions of emotion and suffering and all that kind of fear of mortality those kinds of things so i i especially sort of by the way did you see that there was this recent thing going around the internet of this so some i think he's a russian or some slavic head had written this thing a sort of anti the idea of super intelligence mmm-hmm i forgot maybes polish anyway so at all these arguments and one one was the argument from slavic pessimism do you remember what the argument is it's like nothing ever works so what what do you think is the role like that's such a fascinating idea that the what we perceive as serve the limits of human of the human mind which is emotion and fear and all those kinds of things are integral to intelligence could could you elaborate on that like what why is that important do you think for human level intelligence at least the way the humans work it's a big part of how it affects how we perceive the world it affects how we make decisions about the world it affects how we interact with other people it affects our understanding of other people you know for me to understand your what you're going what you're likely to do i need to have kind of a theory of mine and that's very much a theory of emotions and motivations and goals and and to understand that i you know we have the this whole system of you know mirror neurons you know i sort of understand your motivations through sort of simulating it myself so you know it's not something that i can prove that's necessary but it seems very likely so ok you've written the op-ed in new york times titled we shouldn't be scared by super intelligent ai and it criticized a little bit just to rustle in the boss room can you try to summarize that articles key ideas so it was spurred by a earlier new york times op-ed by stewart russell which was summarizing his book called human compatible and the article was saying you know if we if we have super intelligent ai we need to have its values align with our values and it has to learn about what we really want and he gave this example what if we have a super intelligent ai and we give it the prob of solving climate change and it decides that the best way to lower the carbon in the atmosphere is to kill all the humans okay so to me that just made no sense at all because a super intelligent ai first of all thinking what trying to figure out what what super intelligence means and it doesn't it seems that something that super intelligent can't just be intelligent along this one dimension of okay i'm gonna figure out all the steps the best optimal path to solving climate change and not be intelligent enough to figure out that humans don't want to be killed that you could get to one without having the other and you know bostrom in his book talks about the orthogonality hypothesis where he says he thinks that systems i can't remember exactly what it is but it like a systems goals and it's values don't have to be aligned there's some orthogonal 'ti there which didn't make any sense to me so you're saying it in any system that's sufficiently not even super intelligent but is it approach greater greater intelligence there's a holistic nature that will sort of attention that will naturally emerge yes events it from sort of any one dimension running away yeah yeah exactly so so you know bostrom had this example of the the super intelligent ai that that makes that turns the world into paperclips because its job is to make paper clips or something and that just as a thought experiment didn't make any sense to me well as a thought experiment or the thing that could possibly be realized either so so i think that you know what my op ed was trying to do was say that that intelligence is more complex than these people are presenting it that it's not like it's not so separable the rationality the the values the emotions all of that that it's the the view that you could separate all these dimensions and build the machine that has one of these dimensions and it's super intelligent in one dimension but it doesn't have any of the other dimensions that's what i was trying to criticize that that that i don't believe that so can i read a few sentences from yoshua bengio who is always super eloquent so he writes i have the same impression as melanie that our cognitive biases are linked with our ability to learn to solve many problems they may also be a limiting factor for ai however this is a may in quotes things may also turn out differently and there's a lot of uncertainty about the capabilities of future machines but more importantly for me the value alignment problem is a problem well before we reached some hypothetical super intelligence it is already posing a problem in the form of super powerful companies whose objective function may not be sufficiently aligned with humanity's general well-being creating all kinds of harmful side effects so he goes on to argue that at you know the orthogonality and those kinds of things the concerns of just aligning values with the capabilities of the system is something that might come long before we reach anything like in super intelligence so your criticism it's kind of really nice as saying this idea of super intelligence systems seem to be dismissing fundamental parts of what intelligence would take and then you know kind of says yes but if we look at systems that are much less intelligent there might be these same kinds of problems that emerge sure but i guess the example that he gives there of these corporations that's people right those are people's values i mean we're talking about people the corporations are their value are the values of the people who run those corporations but the idea is the algorithm that's right so does the fundamental person that the fundamental element of what does the bad thing as a human being yeah but the the algorithm kind of controls the behavior this mass of human beings which help whatever for a company that's the outs of for example if it's advertisement driving company that recommends certain things and encourages engagement so it gets money by encouraging engagement and therefore the company more and more it's like the cycle that builds an algorithm that enforces more engagement and made perhaps more division in the culture and so on so on again i guess the question here is sort of who has the agency so you might say for instance we don't want our algorithms to be racist right and facial recognition you know some people have criticized some facial recognition systems as being racist because they're not as good on darker skin and lighter skin okay but the agency there the the the the actual algal recognition algorithm isn't what has the agency it's it's not the racist thing right it's it's the that the i don't know the the combination of the training data the cameras being used i whatever but my understanding of and i'll say i told agree with benjy oh there that he you know i think there are these value issues with our use of algorithms but my understanding of what russell's argument was is more that the algorithm itself has the agency now it's the thing that's making the decisions and it's the thing that has what we would call values yes so whether that's just a matter of degree you know it's hard it's hard to say right because but i would say that's sort of qualitatively different than a face recognition neural network and to broadly linger on that point if you look at elon musk goes to a rustle or bostrom people who are worried about existential risks of ai however far into the future the argument goes is it eventually happens we don't know how far but it eventually happens do you share any of those concerns and what kind of concerns in general do you have a body i that approach anything like existential threat to humanity so i would say yes it's possible but i think there's a lot more closer in existential threats you had as you said like a hundred years for so your times more more than a hundred more than a hundred years and so that maybe even more than 500 years i don't i don't know i mean it's so the existential threats are so far out that the future is the immune there'll be a million different technologies that we can't even predict now that will fundamentally change the nature of our behavior reality society and so on before then i think so i think so and you know we have so many other pressing existential threats going on new hangouts even their nuclear weapons climate problems you know poverty possible pandemics that you can go on and on and i think though you know worrying about existential threat from ai is it's not the best priority for what we should be worried about that that's kind of my view because we're so far away but i you know i i'm not i'm not necessarily criticizing russell or bostrom or whoever for worrying about that and i'm i think it's some some people should be worried about it it's it's certainly fine but i i was more sort of getting at their their view of intelligible intelligence is mmm-hmm so i was more focusing on like their view of the super intelligence then just the fact of them worrying and the title of the article was written by the the new york times editors i wouldn't have called it that we shouldn't be scared by super intelligent and no if you wrote it be like we should redefine what you mean by super in i actually said it said you know something like super intelligence is not is is not a sort of coherent idea that's not like it's only new york times would put in and the follow-up argument that yoshio makes also not argument but a statement and i've heard him say it before and i think i agree he's kind of has a very friendly way of phrasing it is it's good for a lot of people to believe different things yeah well no but he's it's also practically speaking like we shouldn't be like while your article stands like stuart russell does amazing work bostrom does amazing work you do amazing work and even when you disagree about the definition of super intelligence or the usefulness of even the term it's still useful to have people that like use that term all right and then argue it sir i i absolutely agree with video there and i think it's great that you know and it's great that new york times will publish all this stuff that's right it's an exciting time to be here what what do you think is a good test of intelligence iq is is natural language ultimately a test that you find the most compelling like the the original or the what you know the higher levels of the turing test kind of yeah yeah i still think the original idea of the turing test is a good test for intelligence i mean i can't think of anything better you know the turing tests the way that it's been carried out so far has been very impoverished if you will but i think a real turing test that really goes into depth like the one that i mentioned i talk about in the book i talk about ray kurzweil and mitchell kapoor have this bet right that that in 2029 i think is the date there a machine will pass the turing test and turn says and they have a very specific like how many hours many expert judges and all of that and you know kurzweil says yes kapoor says no we can't we only have like nine more years to go to see i you know if something a machine could pass that i would be willing to call it intelligent of course nobody will they will say that's just a language model if it does so you would be comfortable it's a language a long conversation that well yeah here i mean you're right because i think probably to carry out that long conversation you would literally need to have deep common-sense understanding of the world i think so and the conversation is enough to reveal that so another super fun topic of complexity that you have worked on written about let me ask the basic question what is complexity so complexity is another one of those terms like intelligence it's perhaps overused but my book about complexity was about this wide area of complex systems studying different systems in nature in technology in society in which you have emergence kind of like i was talking about with intelligence you know we have the brain which has billions of neurons and each neuron individually could be said to be not very complex compared to the system as a whole but the system the the interactions of those neurons and the dynamics creates these phenomena that we call we call intelligence or consciousness you know that are we consider to be very complex so the field of complexity is trying to find general principles that underlie all these systems that have these kinds of emergent properties and the the emergence occurs from like underlying the complex system is usually simple fundamental interactions yes and the emergence happens when there's just a lot of these things interacting yes sort of what and then most of science to date can you talk about what what is reductionism well reductionism is when you try and take a system and divide it up into its elements whether those be cells or atoms or subatomic particles whatever your field is and then try and understand those elements and then try and build up an understanding of the whole system by looking at sort of the sum of all the elements so what's your sense whether we're talking about intelligence or these kinds of interesting complex systems is it possible to understand them in in a reductionist way it's just probably the approach of most of science today right i don't think it's always possible to understand the things we want to understand the most so i don't think it's possible to look at single neurons and understand what we call intelligence you know just look at sort of summing up and the sort of the summing up is the issue here that were you know that one example is that the human genome alright so there was a lot of work on excitement about sequencing the human genome because the idea would be that we'd be able to find genes that underlies diseases but it turns out that and i was a very reductionist idea you know we figure out what all the the parts are and then we would be able to figure out which parts cause which things but it turns out that the parts don't cause the things that we're interested in it's like the interactions it's the networks of these parts and so that kind of reductionist approach didn't yield the the explanation that we wanted would he would use the most beautiful complex system that you've encountered most beautiful that you've been captivated by is it sort of i mean for me that is the simplest to be cellular automata oh yeah so i was very captivated by cellular automata and worked on cellular automata for several years do you find it amazing or is it surprising that such simple systems such simple rules and cellular domino can create sort of seemingly unlimited complexity yeah that was very surprising to me i didn't make sense of it how does that make you feel this is just ultimately humbling or is there hope to somehow leverage this into a deeper understanding and even able to engineer things like intelligence it's definitely humbling how humbling in that also kind of awe-inspiring that it's that inspiring like part of mathematics that these credible simple rules can produce this very beautiful complex hard to understand behavior and that that's it's mysterious you know and and surprising still but exciting because it does give you kind of the hope that you might be able to engineer complexity just from from these can you briefly say what is the santa fe institute its history its culture its ideas its future stuff i've never semester g i've never been but so has been this in my - mystical place where brilliant people study the edge of chaos exactly so the santa fe institute was started in 1984 and it was created by a group of scientists a lot of them from los alamos national lab which is about a 40-minute drive from the santa fe institute they were mostly physicists and chemists but they were frustrated in their field because they felt so that their field wasn't approaching kind of big interdisciplinary questions like the kinds we've been talking about and they wanted to have a place where people from different disciplines could work on these big questions without sort of being siloed into physics chemistry biology whatever so they started this institute and this was people like george cowan who is a chemist in the manhattan project and nicholas metropolis who mathematician physicist murray gell-mann physicist nism so some really big names here ken arrow an economist nobel prize-winning economist and they started having these workshops and this whole enterprise kind of grew into this research institute that's itself has been kind of on the edge of chaos its whole life because it doesn't have any it doesn't have a significant endowment and it's just been kind of living on whatever funding it can raise through donations and grants and however it can you know business business associates and so on but it's a great place it's a really fun place to go think about ideas from that you wouldn't normally encounter i saw sean carroll so physicists yeah yeah external faculty and you mentioned that there's so there's some external faculty and there's people there's a very small group of resident faculty maybe maybe about ten who are there for five year terms that can sometimes get renewed and then they have some postdocs and then they have this much larger on the order of a hundred external faculty or people come like me who come and visit for various periods of time so what do you think this is the future of the santa fe institute like what and if people are interested like what what's there in terms of the public interaction or students or so on that's that could be a possible interaction on the santa fe institute or its ideas yeah so there's a there's a few different things they do they have a complex system summer school for graduate students and postdocs and sometimes faculty attend to and that's a four week very intensive residential program where you go and you listen to lectures and you do projects and people people really like that i mean it's a lot of fun they also have some specialty summer schools there's one on computational social science there's one on climate and sustainability i think it's called there's a few and then they have short courses where just a few days on different topics they also have an online education platform that offers a lot of different courses and tutorials from sfi faculty including an introduction to complexity course that i talk and there's a bunch of talks to online from there's guest speakers and so on they they host a lot of yeah they have sort of technical seminars and colloquia they all and they have a community lecture series like public lectures and they put everything on their youtube channel so you can see it all watching douglas hofstadter author of get olestra bach was your phd adviser he mentioned a couple times and collaborator do you have any favorite lessons or memories from your time working with him that continues to this day yes but just even looking back through throughout your time working with him so one of the things he taught me was that when you're looking at a complex problem to to idealize it as much as possible to try and figure out what are really what is the essence of this problem and this is how like the copycat program came into being was by taking an analogy making and saying how can we make this as idealized as possible but still retain really the important things we want to study and that's really kept you know been a core theme of my research i think and i continue to try and do that and it's really very much kind of physics inspired hofstadter was a phd in physics that was his background it's like first principles kind of thinking like you reduced to the the most fundamental aspect of the problem yeah so there you can focus on solving that fun than i thought yeah and in ai you know that was people used to work in these micro worlds right like the blocks world was very early important area in ai and then that got criticized because they said oh you know you can't scale that to the real world and so people started working on much like more real world like problems but now there's been kind of a return even to the blocks world itself you know we've seen a lot of people who are trying to work on more of these very idealized problems or things like natural language and common sense so that's an interesting evolution of those ideas so the perhaps the block's world's represents the fundamental challenges of the problem of intelligence more than people realized it might yeah is there sort of when you look back at your body of work and your life you've worked in so many different fields is there something that you're just really proud of in terms of ideas that you've gotten chance to explore create yourself so i am really proud of my work on the copycat project i think it's really different from what almost everyone is done in ai i think there's a lot of ideas there to be explored and i guess one of the happiest days of my life you know aside from like the births of my children was the birth of copycat when it actually started to be able to make really interesting analogies and i remember that very clearly you know it was very exciting time well you kind of gave life yes artificial so that's right what in terms of what people can interact i saw there's like a i think it's called meta copy kinetic hat mad cat and there's a python three implementation at if people actually want to play around with it and actually get into it and study it maybe integrate into whether it's with deep learning or any other kind of work they're doing what what would you suggest they do to learn more about it and to take it forward in different kinds of directions yeah so that there's a douglas hofstadter's book called fluid concepts and creative analogies talks in great detail about copycat i have a book called analogy making as perception which is a version of my phd thesis on it there's also code that's available that you can get it to run i have some links on my web page to where people can get the code for it and i think that that would really be the best way i get into it yeah play with it well melanie is a honor talking to you i really enjoyed it thank you so much for your time today has been really great thanks for listening to this conversation with melanie mitchell and thank you to our presenting sponsor cash app downloaded use code lex podcast you'll get ten dollars and
