imagine you have a choice between $100 right 
now this is money now you can take it or $100   but it's later this is money later that's a 
no-brainer money now is going to win every   time there's going to be inflation by the time 
you get that and think of what you could do with   money now money now every single time but what 
if tell you what i got some quarters here what   if i gave another another dollar on this side 
do you want to take that money later that's   now $101 oh to it $102 or rather how much 
money would i have to put over here what if   you know what 50 bucks give me back the dollar 
give it back thank you there's a 50 what if it   was $150 in a year well obviously now you're 
going to pick money later so the question is   how do you calculate the benefits of money now 
versus more money later and this is the exact   problem that faced the city of chicago in the 
year 2008 they were considering leasing their   part parking meters to a private company to get a 
lot of delicious money now but they had to weigh   that up against just keeping the parking meters 
and earning money later so we're going to have   a closer look at the calcul hey there standup 
math heads i'm raley williams from the youtube   channel climate town and i am pleased as punch to 
tell you that i've recently purchased a couple of   minutes on every standup maths video for the next 
75 years yeah i just reached out to one of matt's   producers offered him a little bit of that money 
now and for three generations i now get to reap   the benefits of matt's delicious math brain you 
see what matt didn't realize was that his video   about parking meter math had swerved directly into 
the oncoming traffic of my video about usa freedom m so thanks so much for tuning in to a very 
special episode of standup math toown all about   the time chicago got absolutely hosed when they 
sold control of their parking meters and streets   to morgan stanley and i know matt lives in like 
the tower of london in france or wherever but i'm   sure he won't mind joining me on a little trip 
to chicago through the magic of editing magic of   editing so much effort for joke i can't i've got 
a family at home hey we can compl the commute is   is it zero hours it's more than zero i knew you 
would only say it if it was a lot or a little   look we can just knock this thing out in 30 or 40 
hours and then we can get you home to your alleged   family man fine fine fine anyway okay so today 
we're going to look at parking meters in chicago   that's how you do intro yeah i say a concept leave 
a beat opening titles in america we do it like   this hey i'm raley williams and this is michael 
parken berger and this is standup math toown climate hey let me just go ahead and tape this bad 
boy on it just looks more professional with   the blue tape i'm getting so little money this 
is appropriate hey you're getting zero dollar   zero dollar that's what your producer and i 
agreed to you signed it i know and i tried to   do the math but you kept shouting usa usa that's 
not how we do things exactly i had very little   warning i signed a thing so that's a legally 
binding contract in this side of the mason   dixon right anyway let me just go ahead and 
take you to a beautiful little time known as the   year 2008 ah yes 2008 what a year the apple 
app store hit the internet barack obama was   sworn in as president and america's tallest 
fish michael phelps won eight gold medals at   the olympic games this is a relevant backstory 
absolutely abolutely because a financial crisis   is brewing and don't even ask cuz no one knows 
how it started no one knows which country is   most respons with the mortgage back securities 
yeah one very specific tough to tell it could   have been any leman brothers the point is it 
was happening and no one knows whose fault   it was practically every city on earth was hurt 
by this mysterious financial crisis of 2008 and   chicago was no exception they needed to fill a 
150 million hole in their city budget now they   could raise property taxes but that wouldn't be 
very popular with the voters so their intrepid   mayor richard m daly decided to sell the city's 
parking meters and their commensurate road space   to a private company that's right 36,000 
parking meters would be privately owned bid was millions technically yes thank you 
morgan stanley and the amir of abu dhabi purchased   all of the meters in chicago for $157 billion 
for 75 years billion with a b billion with a b5   75 with the numbers 7 and five and then years just 
spelled normally and then we're going to whip out   of this oh okay ready yep and 1.57 billion now 
$1.15 7 billion certainly sounds like a lot of   money but it's not immediately obvious how much 
36,000 parking meters take in over the course of   a 75-year contract especially when morgan stanley 
had plans to quadruple the rates extend the meter   hours they had a real vision to extract a lot of 
value out of this lease that's right so was 1.57   enough money it turns out the answer is super no 
now this is going to have a lot lot of important   math questions that only you can handle this is 
my time to shine thank you okay so we're going to   have a closer look at the mathematics of the deal 
and then we do a wipe nice very professional and   then the wipe happens yeah the is it i love that 
for chicago to be able to calculate how much money   they would need to get now to justify giving 
up all parking revenue for the next 75 years   they need two things factored in first of all 
how much will that revenue be and secondly how   much is it worth to get the money up front as 
opposed to across 75 years in terms of revenue   in 2008 their consultant worked out a range of 
possible rates first of all they decided the   first four years of the lease would be a write 
off because the amount of capital investment   that was required from year five onwards they 
would get between 85 and $130 million per year   and that would increase 3% per year which was 
just what they assumed inflation would be across   the remaining whatever that is 70 odd years of 
the lease in 2009 when the inspector general   did their comprehensive investigation into this 
terrible terrible deal they split that range into   subcategories they said the 85 million a year was 
pessimistic you then had the slightly pessimistic   the slightly optimistic and the 130 million was 
fully optimistic and then for good measure they   put in the exact midpoint as well so there's our 
range of possib values all we have to do now is   work out the discount rate of getting the money 
now which is slightly more complicated and occurs   to me now that stand up maths is a subsidiary 
of the climate town enterprise system i can   use all of their conventions and and video syntax 
which means i can just do a crash cut to the edit bay to the edit bay we can now have a close look 
at how the city of chicago should calculate a   discount rate that's how much you have to discount 
money later to make it be worth the same as money   now or rather how much money you'd have to get 
later to foro money now and i'm going to base my   calculations off this report which we've already 
mentioned it's the office of the inspector general   city of chicago they had a close look at all of 
the numbers in 2009 and right at the end here they   show how they actually calculate their recommend 
ed discount rate and you got to factor in a few   things you got to factor in inflation and they 
assume inflation is going to be 3% so just every   year everything's going to cost 3% more that's the 
amount that money has become devalued they then   look at how much it would cost the city of chicago 
to borrow the equivalent money now so if they turn   down money now and they're going to wait for money 
later what if they realize they actually need   it now they have to borrow it well they looked 
into here in this table here now if you're a   government organization you can borrow money a lot 
cheaper money is cheap if you're the government   so they took the five years prior to the report 
they averaged them and they got 2.19% so that's   the cost of borrowing money they're going to 
use they didn't have to combine 3% inflation   with 2.19% cost of borrowing money and you think 
well that's easy that's pretty straightforward   math why they somehow find a way to make it look 
really complicated so they they here they step   through just the mechanics of how you combine 
percentages so they add one to each and then   multiply them and then subtract one because they 
want to get it without that lead one like just   ignore the one that's what we do it's the same 
number anyway they work out it's 5.26% but then   they add in a measure of risk now technically the 
city shouldn't care about this this is more if   you're the person taking on the contract you want 
an extra premium because of the risk you're taking   on and i mean the city could say they don't care 
but the inspector general worked it out properly   they well they made a number up well they took 
it from some research in australia that seems to   be about it and they said that you should add on 
an extra 1.8% just you just add that on to your   discount rate so everyone's happy i guess they 
want to calculate what's a competitive amount like   they want this to be an appealing proposition so 
that some someone does buy the contract but they   don't want to make it so appealing spoiler that 
they get terrible terrible value so at the end   of all the calculations the discount rate is 7.06% 
this is the this is the accumulation projecting   into the future for how much it would be worth 
for different discount rates from 5% 6 7 8 9   and then how optimistic or pessimistic you are 
and what the future revenue may be and these   categories these are 15 million apart that's 
the that's a unit of optimism and you need to   be really pessimistic and take a 9% discount rate 
to get the actual value that they ended up taking   now if you've watched the companion video to this 
on the climate town channel which you absolutely   should and subscribe while you're there great 
channel they do some really good stuff you will   know that when i was on that channel i showed 
this fantastic plot this is the amount of value   over time and in the distant future because the 
money is so later it's barely worth anything so   they show in this report that if you just did a 
half length contract so if you only did 37 years   you're still going to get $ 1.08 billion of value 
so you're still going to get 93% of the value by   doing half the length of the contract and so you 
think if you just need a billion bucks do that   why do 75 years but i was looking at this when 
i was doing it for the climate time video and   i thought how could i combine this cuz they've 
obviously simulated every single year could i   combine this projection into the future for every 
year with the table that shows you the different   levels of optimism and pessimism with different 
possible discount rates so you know i went and   made myself a spreadsheet here it is so i've got 
uh you different levels of optimism and pessimism   at the top i've then broken it down for every 
single year starting in 2009 all the way down   here somewhere actually we can probably zoom in 
a tad more here we go here's 2083 at the end of   the contract and i this is just the inflation 
so i've moved everyone up 3% every year so   there's a few years of no income then you've got 
this is all than $209 it goes up by 3% every year   for each of the categories i've then taken the 
7% discount rate so i've included as well as   the inflation i've got the full discount rate for 
all the different options and then i've actually   got an accumulation of that to work c the total 
value in each of these scenarios if you sum   all the way down to the year 2083 and i'm close 
to the official figures i'm within 5% is of each   one but it occurs to me with all our talk about 
discount rates but yet we're increasing things   it might be getting a bit confusing so i just want 
to simplify things have a quick look at an example   where you can buy $100 a year income for three 
years into the future by paying money now and you   might think well that's great that's worth $300 
but this income goes up with inflation inflation   3% so after one year you don't get $100 you get 
$103 and it goes up by 3% every year now what   you pay now to get that income later you don't 
just add them together because we have our friend   the discount rate and up until now i've been 
increasing the amount of money you have to get   later to compensate for not getting it now but in 
reality you're just going to get the income you're   going to get all you can do is decrease what you 
pay now that's why it's called the discount rate   so after 1 year it'll be 7% discount rate after 2 
years it'll be well it's that twice 7% to the^ of   two and then 7% cubed so inflation i just did 
year after year sequentially you can actually   just do each year individually it makes it a bit 
easier in the spreadsheet and we divide by these   to lower what the money is worth now compared to 
getting it later and if you divide that through   you can see now it's all below $100 and if you 
add those together you'll get the amount the   income is worth now which in this specific case 
is $278 12 and that that's the number we want   that's what the income is worth based on this 
expected level of inflation and on the discount   rate that we i don't know kind of made up and if 
we increase that like here's 8% discount you can   see the value has gone down go up to 99% discount 
it's gone down again so we actually go back to8   $273 7 what if we decided nine and that's why 
the discount rate is so important you have to   do so many calculations and add it all up and you 
can see you're putting on the inflation and then   you're actually taking it off again cuz it's 
in the discount rate and you can get inflation   free versions where you keep everything in now 
dollars it's very complicated i did my best to   try and recreate everything that had happened 
in the report and i was close enough but i was   able to simulate everything that's in the report 
myself so i've now got year-by-year breakdowns of   everything that they were predicting would happen 
with the recommended discount rate which i'm very   proud of it also means that now we can look at 
any given year in in what was the future in 2009   but now that a lot of those years are our past 
we can compare them so we can actually take what   they predicted would happen and compare it to 
what happened you know in reality and see how   close the predictions were so actually if we head 
back over to chicago for this so hang on let me   just skip ahead in the edit that's me here this 
is us chatting about discount rates blah blah   blah in excel and oh here we go right so we'll 
find out if the predictions is is what they said   accurate or isn't it it's not in 2022 the city of 
chicago released an audit of all the money taken   in by the private parking people up until the year 
2021 and it turns out they were making a ton of money not only have they already recouped the 
entire purchase price on top of that they've   had an extra half a billion dollar of delicious 
net revenue and they've still got 63 years of   profit coming at them but okay they they're making 
money but does that match the predictions well   because i was able to reverse engineer all the 
calculations in a spreadsheet i could look at   just the predictions up until the year 2021 add 
them all up and let's just say they're not in   the optimistic category they're not in any of the 
prediction categories because they are literally   off the chart they are two steps up two optimism 
units above the chart they've skipped over very   optimistic and landed in extremely optimistic 
and that includes having a global pandemic   when revenues took a dive imagine if that hadn't 
have happened they're making so much money and   that doesn't even include the fact because they 
bought a lease at below market rate they're able   to refinance on the correct valuation they've 
made another half a billion dollars just from   refinancing the assets that they own that the 
the city basically gave away at a real discount rate and i would not accept any impossibility 
argument saying well that you know the council   couldn't have made that much money because they 
can't like increase rates the same way a private   company can well all the rate increases were 
baked into the lease by the council the first   5 years were pre-agreed increases and after 
that the private owners have barely touched   parking rates it was all the council that put 
the rates up and there's other ways that the   council could have got more money so when morgan 
stanley took over only 5% of parking spaces use   these pay and display boxes the rest were meters 
where you put coins in if you switch to these you   no longer have to have individually marked bays 
one per meter you can just have an open area and   this increases occupancy by 10% cuz cars can just 
squeeze in and cars can no longer use up the money   the previous motorist left on the meter they 
always have to pay again from scratch when san   diego switched to these their revenue went up by 
24 % when boston switched to these their revenue   went up by 34% with no price change the council 
left so much money on the table it's such a bad   deal they should have done more maths and they 
should have shared that math with the council   so they can make an informed decision and not 
just have three days to decide what's going to   happen over the next 75 years but enough of 
the numbers it also occurred to me that now   that raleigh has a stake in the standup mass 
channel we should get them to do some of the   heavy lifting because it's not just numbers it's 
not just finance there are other implications and   impacts on the environmental policy of the 
city now parking meters are not like hot dog   stands they actually are a vital force in 
controlling the traffic in any given city   another problem with giving a private company 
control of your parking spaces is that they're   going to want to keep them as parking spaces 
for 75 5 years which of course locks wherever   you are into car centric infrastructure for 
the foreseeable future there are actually a   ton of pretty negative climate implications 
in all of this and we're going to go into all   those on my channel climate town if that feels 
like something you might be interested in it's   a really good channel you should absolutely 
check it out i'm in the video as well he is   and he's really funny in it he actually houses 
like a ton of hot dogs you know what i think a   75e contract i have with stand up matt's channel 
might be a little optimistic given how many hot   dogs i just saw matt eat so i hereby release 
him from the contract but before i go remember   to like and subscribe to stand up mass it's a 
terrific channel let's cherish matt while we have it
