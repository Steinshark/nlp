i love the community that sprouted up around me and the rest of the tech youtubers it really does feel like we're one big family sometimes doesn't it but like every family there's at least one of us that's the weird uncle with the crazy politics excuse me tech hot takes and if i had to pick one out let's just say it's probably not austin but if there's one thing i've learned reading an obsessive amount of youtube comments is that i'm not the only one with awful takes i mean look at this one forcing usbc on mobile phones forever isn't the best idea but come on apple's been using lightning which is usb2 for 10 years it doesn't exactly feel like they're trying to innovate over there so that's right folks today i'm going to be reacting to some of the absolute worst takes from you guys courtesy of those of you who were primary sex characteristic enough to share them on twitter but not before i share you on this segue to our sponsor corsair immerse yourself in the world's first bendable oled 21x9 gaming monitor from corsair the xenia on flexes ultra slim 45-inch 240 hertz display is practically a feast for your eyes delicious check it out at the link below [music] internally we have a rule don't attack the audience no matter how wrong or how stupid they are but we're making an exception today because you guys specifically put yourselves out there ready for my rebuttals let's kick things off by elaborating on this a little bit yes in the very very long term everyone being stuck with usb type-c could ultimately be a problem except that in the phone space ah man see i'm gonna get myself in trouble here i don't see us needing more than 5 or 10 gigabit per second ever by the time we do it's likely that companies like apple and their follow alongs will have ditched cables altogether in favor of more wireless charging and wireless data transfer standards so i see your point but also you're wrong max here mac os is just plain better for professionals professional what man i see that argument all the time x is better for pros why is only for do you know how many different kinds of professionals there are some professionals never leave a web browser in which case chromebooks are probably just plain better for them what about professional engineers mac os is dog for that let's do samsung ssd should not be put on the pedestal they seem to stay on years ago they were the safe bet they are not the only option anymore i don't know if this even qualifies as a hot take the only reason samsung has ended up on the pedestal that they have is because they were consistently at or near the top of the performance charts and perhaps more importantly consistently among the lowest rma rate drives as rated by puget systems as for whether that's changed i'd have to check if puget has released their latest reliability report oh oh update on samsung ssd reliability from last month blah blah blah incredibly low failure rate something changed in the last year 980 pro 2 terabyte wow they've switched over to sabrin i still remember like it was yesterday when sabrant came out of absolutely nowhere with these great products and they've just continued to innovate from there good for them but with that said i think this is a really valuable lesson here that no matter which brand it is you should never be loyal to the brand and always evaluate the product individually god on the other hand tech reviews are often wildly removed from the intended user experience what someone who switches phones several times a year once in a phone is not representative of the user experience most companies are targeting this one i'm not sure i agree with there are things about the tech reviewer lifestyle that can give us blind spots for example when i was reviewing a super low end device i would make it a habit to carry an iphone or at least a high-end android phone around in my back pocket in case my kids or my pets do something adorable so that i'm not stuck with a potato camera that's not tree that someone buying that phone as their only device would have however when you are fully switching between devices one after the other i feel it can actually give you a much keener eye both for what is better about one and what's worse and that's part of the reason that you guys watch us for that experience that we've built up using all these different devices oh max is back apple's 30 fee is fine and fair as an app developer i'm not happy to have to pay it but i'm not delusional about why it's there it's not an apple tax it's a platform fee just like shopify amazon see that's the difference you list a bunch of things that are not monopolies amazon for all of their anti-competitive behavior is not a monopoly you can go shop on walmart.com or bestbuy.com and you can decide to shop somewhere where they have a lower markup the point is not whether the 30 percent is fine and fair in fact it's the same 30 percent that valve takes on steam the point is that apple lacks competition and they unilaterally decide that 30 percent is fine and fair that's the problem the fact that you're even making this argument means that you fundamentally do not understand what's going on here monopoly isn't a valid argument because a property developer has a monopoly on selling apartments in the building they built except there's other [ __ ] buildings is this guy serious yeah oh mathematica ken the cheapest cell enabled ipad works better and has more features than the most expensive car infotainment system right what a hot take that's the coldest take it's ice cold i am gonna take so much crap for this video i don't even thin and light laptop with egpu set up like a desktop is better than a traditional tower pc so you have both the performance when you're stationary and the ability to take it with you on the go you're not wrong but you're out of touch see the issue is not that the convenience of a thin and light with an egpu isn't great the issue is that it's so expensive i mean even ignoring how costly gpus have gotten you're adding what now another 300 400 for the enclosure that goes around it plus whatever extra you end up paying for a laptop that has a nice gaming capable cpu and a four-lane pcie thunderbolt connector on it it's a very costly option and it's loud shank mods while this can't be that bad of a hot take pebble is the only smart watch ever made that doesn't suck 100 agree with you i've been trying to go back to it i've been trying to use that one you gave me but i've had trouble getting rebel to work in less than three minutes and then i put it down and kind of forgot about it i will deal with it dvi is the best video connector okay but dvi dl okay dual link dvi slightly better smartphone hardware peaked at the note 9. okay are you just are you trolling me are you mocking me specifically as a gaming device the raspberry pi is overrated the number of people that talk about like raspberry pi okay if all you want to play is like main stuff sure how many people unironically sit and while away the afternoon playing main games natural dl the days of skype were great and i understand why discord didn't overtake skype in popularity immediately with that being said discord is on top we're out of necessity and ease of use rather than being a clear winner i gotta say trying to use discord for the first time it's kind of a crap interface and if skype had been slightly less garbage i think a lot of gaming communities would not have bothered to switch over though i'm gonna counter with my own hot take if microsoft hadn't nerfed then killed msn messenger we wouldn't have needed either of them the reason we stopped using skype though was nothing to do with the functionality of the software and everything to do with some vulnerabilities and i think it was the protocol basically there were these tools called ip resolvers that assuming that you had someone's skype username you could use to get their ip so whether you were gaming with people you didn't know that well or say hosting a live video podcast if anyone figured out what your user account was they could resolve your ip and ddos you great avery physical keyboards on phones from 10 years ago infinitely better than touchscreen keyboards of today that is wow is that ever wrong as someone who has gone back to a phone with a physical keyboard not that long ago let me tell you it felt good back then but it was crap special characters forget about it hot take the removal of headphone jacks is a positive step forward one if bluetooth headphones are owned by most people prior then it's not really an issue but they weren't two cables are annoying and get tangled wireless do not okay but they get lost three wireless price equals wired price are you talking about why would you say stuff that's just demonstrably false wireless price equals what know it isn't terry says rey tracing is pointless doesn't add anything of value to gameplay and most of the time you're moving too fast in game to actually appreciate the better reflections use that extra horsepower for more frames i have to stop you here because in a utopia right where ray tracing hardware is plentiful basically everyone has it and game developers can assume that if they build their game lighting engine with ray tracing in mind that everyone will be able to run it in theory it actually dramatically simplifies the process of lighting a game which adds a layer of realism and immersiveness that simply cannot be replicated with our fakie light reflections that we've been doing for the last 20 30 years the problem is that we're in this in between stage right now where it does feel gimmicky and it does have a significant performance impact but you can tell that nvidia in particular is playing an extremely long game here and i do think ray tracing is here to stay and it could be a benefit in the long run smartphones for 300 are now sufficient for all tasks in terms of hardware no one should spend more money yeah yeah i can't i can't even disagree with that they're sufficient however there are certainly features that are beneficial on smartphones that cost more for example you cannot get a 300 smartphone that does this it simply doesn't exist kizu ultra wide is and i quote garbage all right i was big on the ultra wide train for a long time then i came around to actually wendell from level one texas argument where he kind of goes have you looked closely at the pricing of these things they basically cost the same as a 16x9 monitor that's the same width but also happens to be taller so in terms of pixels per dollar it's much better if you really want the ultra wide experience why don't you just put black bars at the top and bottom of your screen and if you have an oled that's a pretty strong argument especially if you're sitting in the dark but then i got my hands on corsair's 43 inch curved monitor and i was sitting just kind of using it as part of the review process and i was like steam deck is destined to be discontent i don't even need to keep reading this that's a terrible take steam deck is going to steam deck has already changed the gaming industry valve is now officially a console manufacturer they're planning for a long life cycle for this thing they are cording developers they are doing all the right things and they've got the revenues to support this product in the long term through their yes 30 take on steam game sales steam deck is here to stay karen i love motion blur what the [ __ ] especially at higher frame rates why don't you put vaseline on your screen honestly if you like blur i mean why do we even bother trying to build low persistence displays why don't you go get like a dell flat panel from 2005. you'd love it you get this nice little smeary trail behind every moving object on the screen it's great the one justification for motion blur okay is games that run at 30 fps and you need some way to hide that awful jotter as you're panning the camera around that's why it exists it doesn't exist because it looks good dex fox switching to an ev isn't as environmentally impactful as one might think especially when everyone's expected to buy the new shiny thing expanding public transit building walkable cities and preventing e-waste is far more impactful no doubt the problem is you know i'm assuming this but i have no way of verifying it no you're from salt lake city i would have assumed you're european has a big part of the problem is that in north america i don't see any path back to walkable cities there is literally nothing within walking distance of my house and the only way to fix that would be to bulldoze entire neighborhoods and build more like what like shopping centers restaurants entertainment it ain't happening rcs rex linux will never take off like people say it will linux has already taken off do i need to remind you steamvac a million units and sales do you think a million linux gaming computers ever in the entire history of linux existed before well there are a million now right now in people's hands miss micro usb micro usb along with micro hdmi is one of the worst connectors ever made i don't believe i actually do not believe i think they are lying about the advertised durability of micro usb that thing is a piece of garbage usbc is not a good standard there are too many inconsistencies in implementation and apple was right to resist it for iphones until their hand was forced don't take my word for it apple thinks you're wrong look at the way they equip their higher tier more functional more premium products with usbc like the ipad with pc makers like lenovo selling laptops with fedora and successes by hp we'll see many more desktops and laptops with linux 2025 is the year of the linux desktop 2025 man you're giving yourself over two years for this to come true that's enough time for windows 12 to come out and be like two sucks in a row and if that happens you might be right jeff says ssd was the only technological revolution in the computer world for the last two decades two decades good gravy going all the way back to 2003 no multi-core multi-core was huge do you not remember if we didn't get multi-core processors that ssd would be bottlenecked by your stupid single core processor nvidia didn't kill sli based on greed nvidia killed sli because high resolution gaming and the faster gpus they kept building necessitated such a fast interconnect between the gpus but it just got so cost ineffective for the limited number of users and game developers that were being served by sli technology it just stopped making sense i get it i don't have to like it but i get it okay narwhal in terms of features amd's drivers on windows are so much better than nvidia's i love that i can see performance metrics overclock and undervolt my gpu wow spoken like someone who has not used an nvidia card in a very long time geforce experience is not the driver that's a separate utility you don't even have to install it like yeah sure it's just another game launcher or whatever but it also has performance metrics it doesn't allow you to overclock an undervolt but i mean i would make the argument that it's fine to have a third party utility for that especially given how much more functional they are anyway even compared to amd's built-in tools and features nvidia has way more features i mean look at the last week alone they just announced vsr their video upscaling feature that uses your gpu to smooth and sharpen web video it's really cool and amd has absolutely nothing to respond to it 99 of tech youtubers love to talk about how great amd is and how everyone should buy it but the end of the day name a tech tuber that uses amd as a daily driver outside of a challenge i've been daily driving an amd cpu for three and a half years yeah ever since i upgraded the threadripper what's up pcs are at the verge of being obsolete for gamers looking at the performance affordability and range of games on current consoles this is just cyclical it's it always happens the first year or two after a new generation of consoles launches they are untouchable in terms of price to performance ratio and then sony and microsoft just sit there and let the hardware stagnate and become obsolete pcs catch up and then a new generation of consoles comes out at leapfrogs and so on and so forth this is what happens when you ignore all the historical context and focus only on the moment at hand there is no point unlocking your frame rate your pc will render frames that can't be displayed past the refresh rate creating unnecessary streaming hardware and costing more electricity which is a waste of money and worse for the environment unfortunately you are wrong when you render at a higher frame rate even higher than your display can support what you're doing is you are reducing the latency and therefore the perceived performance of the game even if you don't see more than one of those frames for every refresh rate of your display we made a whole video about it featuring shroud it's got like over 10 million views maybe that view count should be 10 million and one after you watch it and get yourself educated pure future proofing is possible for example by getting a powerful cpu now would allow you to upgrade your gpu later when games become more demand you drank the kool-aid pier if you get the mid-range cpu today and by the mid-range cpu three years down the road when it's time to upgrade your gpu that would be a better experience overall than spending twice as much on your cpu today it's just math polaris apple is not overpriced especially when you consider how long their products last and that they make all their own hardware too no they don't i don't mind paying the apple tax to get a macbook that will last many years over a pc that i will upgrade in future okay the fact that you choose to upgrade your pc is a completely irrelevant point to how long that pc will last and this is something i've seen so many times i'm reminded of the time that my uncle's business partner showed me his amazing macbook air he goes look how fast this thing boots it's outstanding you know how they did it solid state drive yeah i know phil i've got an ssd in my computer at home apple didn't [ __ ] invent them it's just the fact that apple users tend to compare against pcs that are not as well equipped as the apple computers that they're comparing against so while you're kind of right in that there is no apple tax by being right about that you are wrong about how long that device will last you because if you buy a high quality pc device that's at the same price and similarly equipped it can last you a very long time that's this point noctua just can't release any product that they're becoming irrelevant like are you buying an hd 15 at this point considering other options yes man noctua has so many benefits beyond just the performance the fact that you can get new mounting hardware for new sockets as they come out nothing would prevent you from using a knock to a cooler from like 12 13 years ago emailing them being like hey i need mounting hardware for socket am5 and you're ready to go gavin says mega transfers per second is the right performance metric for dram and not megahertz i don't know we switched over to mega transfers per second mostly just to bother ian dr cutris oh my god max is back lack of side loadings on ios is a good thing and it should remain a closed system people only want it because it makes piracy easier without having to figure out jailbreaking apps and yeah it would have nothing to do with just common sense things that apple doesn't build into their operating system like oh i don't know t9 dialing or whatever else alternate app stores are a huge security risk because you can't know if the official instagram app downloaded from not ccp app store has been well then you would just download from the official app store this is the thing that apple users who argue about this seem to not really understand the existence of alternate app stores does not in fact mean that you would not be able to use the official one neural canvas ai art is the modern day renaissance that is yet again giving everyday people the ability to creatively express themselves the only people complaining are the ones who see their artist nothing but a cash cow and not showing of their passion and creativity okay wanting to be fairly compensated for your work does not mean that you see art as a cash cow rather than a showing of your passion and creativity it means that you expect the value of what you've created to turn into some kind of value back to you if it's creating value for someone else this is a pretty bad take using gyro aim on a controller with aim assist and acceleration turned off is better than better than a mouse and keyboard though better than a controller yeah but you probably just aren't very good with the mouse and keyboard headphones are the worst they heat up your ears and destroy your hearing speakers for the win they only destroy they only destroy your hearing if you turn them up too loud just like speakers that's clean that's and they they heat up your ears i mean i guess ryzen cpus are touted to be the best value processors on the market okay a we talked about brand loyalty and just painting with broad brushes not necessarily but let's continue while that's true on benchmarks and in-game performance they tend to be less user friendly because of all the frequent bugs and glitches the plot what are you even talking about are you talking about first gen ryzen ryzen 1000 you are so out of date here retro breezy what is mac even good for all i see is that mac and iphones are products for rich people to only buy them for the excuse that they have money anything matt can sell windows and linux can do better no there are exclusive softwares that you can only get on mac i mean we did a whole video on reasons that mac os is just plain better if you use final cut man you are gonna want mac in fact even running premiere we find that it is more stable on mac os than it is on windows another thing mac's really good for is continuity okay being able to take what you're doing between devices there's just no analog like it on the pc side of things i've really tried but have never been able to understand the appeal of gaming while on the go just not the same as a monitor with a proper mouse and keyboard all i have to say is i guess you've never really commuted on transit because when i was taking the skytrain back in the day having a nintendo that i could just have in my pocket or my backpack absolute game changer to take away the boredom dark mode may be better further your eyes but in terms of legibility light mode greater than dark mode i'm a light mode boy not gonna lie there's a couple of sites that i go dark mode on like our forum for example i tend to use dark mode but in general eyebrows and light mode edge greater than chrome i mean i'm not going to argue that chrome isn't kind of a piece of crap these days but i just can't get used to the edge interface car shouldn't have an infotainment system the screen in the dash is all that's needed to see ferrari 296 gtb no yeah i no no no 100 i would rather have a touch screen that i can interact with like i want to type in a destination or something like that what am i going to do use that ridiculous stupid audi little like touch track pad and draw letters on it like a child and finger painting or something no no no no no honorrito apparently got a reply from one of our staffers on this okay as someone who loves tech gaming etc i wish games were shorter games have trended towards patting their hours with grind heavy content to justify their costs yeah it's not even trended towards that has literally always been a problem right arcade games were unnecessarily difficult so that you would have to keep feeding the machine with quarters and then during the rental era you know your snass playstation games were unnecessarily padded so that you couldn't complete them during the rental period and you'd have to buy them then as we moved into the subscription model era games were padded so that you would pay for the subscription for longer looking at you world of warcraft and as you move into the mobile era games are padded so that you have to keep grinding or better yet buying endgame armor weapons and items and perks and all of that so that you can compete but i mean it's literally always been a problem for one reason or another you're totally right regarding linus's stance on unionizing at a certain head count there's just a need for some representation of employees this should not be about failing as a boss but having a structure where every employee has the ability to get his voice heard well it's not a hundred i can tell you that much honestly my stance on this isn't going to change if people felt like we weren't taking care of them yeah i would feel like we failed if you want to interpret that as a bad thing you can but you're reaching pretty hard legally i cannot put up any kind of barriers to unionization here so i never would but if it was necessary yeah i'd feel like we suck we have a hot take from the one and only andy screen bar is the best lamp in the world good god andy you're not gonna win this with me pointing a light at your screen is literally the opposite no i will hear nothing will not shine on your screen tell your union representative and i'll sit down with them about it someone pull the screen bar online [music] the difference between 1080p and 1440p is way different than going from 144hz to 240 100 yep you're right eric says i prefer my 1989 model m over any modern gaming keyboard i use it for gaming all the time yes a good keyboard i wouldn't personally use it for gaming it has kind of a long travel for gaming but the difference is pretty small five inch 16x9 is the perfect smartphone size so strong disagree i actually really like the taller screens that we have today that was a huge difference maker for me as someone who reads a lot and mints less scrolling it's definitely better most modern mechanical keyboards are an ergonomic nightmare people use thick wrist rests with them because the keyboards are too darn thick weight so are you saying that you think apple's approach is better well if you like that i got a mouse to sell you with the charging port conveniently located on the bottom and i've got this message from our sponsor xsplit whether you're a streamer content
