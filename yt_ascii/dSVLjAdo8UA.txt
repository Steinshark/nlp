something happened where they forced my hand it's the only time that the soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the united states so i'm waiting for the a train on a dark morning still in queens and there's this man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears you gotta come back or else you're dead the following is a conversation with jack barsky a former kgb spy author of deep undercover and the subject of an excellent podcast series called the agent there are very few people who have defected from the kgb and live to tell the story it is one of the most powerful intelligence organizations in history and this conversation gives a window into its operation both from an ideological and psychological perspectives but also it tells the story of a man who lived one heck of an incredible life this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's jack barski let's start with a big basic question what is the kgb committee right so that is the committee of state security yeah there's an apostrophe threat okay and bs means this without right and i guess that directly translates to security without threat so and don't don't exist anymore it was disbanded when the soviet union fell apart and the successor agencies were are now the svr and and the fsb fsb supposedly the equivalent to the fbi and svr the cia but the svr is is relatively weak and the fsb has has taken on a lot of espionage and you know active measures and they're much bigger and stronger but the most capable intelligence agency in russia is the is the gru military intelligence then nobody knows very much that's right i when i was in the kgb i had no idea that there was military intelligence nobody ever mentioned anything like that and by the way i recently had a the pleasure to give a talk at the dia when they reached out to me i didn't know they existed either interesting yeah that's always the question if you want to be an intelligence agency should the world know anything about you because in some sense you want to create the legend in order to attract great competent individuals to work for you but at the same time you want it to be shrouded in complete mystery if nobody knows you exist you might be able to operate well as an intelligence agency that that is fascinating but fsb is the thing that carries the flag right of of kgb kgb being probably one of if not the most sort of infamous famous infamous and powerful intelligence agencies in history yes ever absolutely 100 it was founded in 1954 after the death of stalin you've in writing your book looked back at the predecessors of the history right is there some way in which the kgb is grounded in the culture the spirit the soul of its predecessors oh absolutely they just changed names and they changed personnel rather frequently and that had had something to do with stalin's paranoia from between 1923 and i don't remember what i think it may have been the nkvd at that time it started as a chika and then it became the the gepe gpu the three or four letters yes but with those name changes you also had changes at the top between 1923 and 1953 when stalin died that is 30 years they had eight heads of intelligence and of of those eight six were executed when they were replaced so that's an that's an indication that you know this was an organization that ate itself from the inside the soviet union was the only dictatorship in history that did not rest its powers on the military they rested its powers on the intelligence apparatus and that thing was unstable so you know where that leads eventually if you rest your power on something that is made out of bricks that don't hold a lot of load it will it will fall apart on sand yeah why was it unstable would you say what what of human nature or what does that mean it's the paranoia it's a you know stalin was always worried about you know what the the most powerful people coming after him so he proactively killed off heads of the kgb and and he had this great purge where he got rid of a lot of his generals you know really capable generals and that that cost him dearly when world war ii started because you know he he started off with with a a force that wasn't as capable as it could have been was it paranoid at all levels i believe so i believe so it it comes from the top and so if the top doesn't trust you you always have to worry about your peers snitching on you yeah okay so so and and i think we have a very similar situation in russia today and and and in this in in this kind of atmosphere the truth will never get to the top so no matter what moral rules the organization operates under trust is fundamental to its competence oh absolutely and i want to extend this to my own existence and this is kind of strange it's it's almost dichotomous because you know i was running around lying to everybody and you know i couldn't fundamentally be trusted but the relationship that i had with the kgb was based on trust if they don't if they don't trust me they don't send me out and if i don't trust him i'm not going and i eventually broke that trust and they knew there was always that danger they knew that because something about you or just something about human beings no there were there were hints about you know how long my assignment would be so 10 to 12 years and you see it makes sense all right i was becoming an american and over time i would become more and more american and there was always a chance that i liked it more here than there that that i was really successful in what i was supposed to do and it sort of happened but in my case it happened because of i fathered a child who who i didn't want to leave when they wanted me back so love always screws up oh your employment competence yes you're absolutely right yes so that but they thought you know that i had an anchor at home because i had a wife and a son at home which you know you've got to worry about them if you defect because in the past the kgb was would go after after family ruthlessly including perhaps violence yeah this is a hard question about the kgb because it's one of the most ruthless organizations but in general are there lines kgb agents at every level of the hierarchy that they would not cross political legal ethical or does anything goes to achieve the goal i was only in touch with the two types of agents as well the technical experts the ones that taught me tradecraft and they were like engineers and you know they were in charge of the secret writing and the uh the morse code shortwave radio and reception decryption encryption and that kind of stuff those were just doing their job all right and the others the ones that trained me that prepared me for life in the united states they were nice people they were elegant people i i don't think they that they would not fit into the stereotype of the ruthless gun carrying agent is it possible that you would not be aware of the parts of the kgb i mean it's very modular would you yeah it's possible that you're not aware the parts of the kgb that that are the quote-unquote muscle oh i didn't know i would find out afterwards after i you know retired and then started doing some research i had no clue you're kind of operating in a bubble oh we very much so i mean this is what the kgb did really really well compartmentalization and and that was based on you know the communist movement while it was still underground you know the the cells were very small and the so that maybe there were three four members in one cell that knew one another and then they had a liaison to another cell so with the bottom line is if if you got one one of those folks were caught they could maybe betray four people or three something like that and in the kgb continued with that tradition i have reason to believe that the my handler the person in moscow that sort of directed me and made decisions what to do and where to go never met me personally there's no reason to right why wouldn't so and and this this actually was a big advantage over other intelligence services because you know you look at what the cia does everybody blabs there's a lot of leaks coming out of american intelligence i don't think there's as many leaks coming out of the mossad strong words from jack barsky so i mean that is a question i want to ask a little more systematically is there something unique about the kgb compared to the other intelligence agencies let's let's talk british intelligence mi6 mossad cia is there unique cultures spirits souls of the different organizations that maybe somehow connect to the structures of government connect maybe the the values of the people those kinds of things i believe we were all pretty much strong believers in communism in the future of the world being in kgb yes i think that that unified us to a large degree even the technicians so even it wasn't something like yeah yeah the the parents believe this thing but we know the truth you really believe the story of conor absolutely did and it and you need to look at the time frame the soviet union after world war ii made quite a bit of progress in uh influencing the third world and i still remember in when i was in middle school we had a map on the map of the world and it was color-coded so red was communism that was the soviet union and then the the eastern states and then blue was capitalism and then then we had green which were the third world countries and the green slowly turned pink because a lot of third world governments like i'm looking at angola i'm i'm looking at vietnam a lot of these countries were very sympathetic to to the soviet union and so we sort of knew that this would go on like that and eventually we would take over and and you know pretty much uh overtake that was that that was the the myth overtake the united states not only militarily but also in terms of industrial production and and so forth that was a stupid pipe dream the military it was a standoff as we know well stupid pipe dream hitler had a stupid pipe dream yeah that he executed it exceptionally effectively and on if not for a handful of military mistakes the world could look very different the biggest one being invading the soviet union particularly at the time that he did it because he ran into the same thing that napoleon ran into general winter well within so operation barbarossa within that he could have made different decisions yeah for example attacking skipping kiev and attacking moscow directly overthrowing the government so marching i guess that that would be learning the lessons from napoleon as opposed to as opposed to a different kind of distribution of forces and then getting bogged down in the winter but the point is these ambitions sometimes do you know the ambitions of empire sometimes do materialize in the growth and the building and the establishment of those empires and those empires write the history books in such a way that we don't think of them as as empires or we certainly don't think of them as the bad guys they write the history books therefore they're the good guys and right now america has effectively written the book about the good guys i happen to believe that book but it's we should be humbled and open-minded to realize that that is in fact what is happening is effective empires write the history books and tell us stories and tell us propaganda and tell us narratives that we believe because we are human beings and we love to get together and believe ideas we love to dream of a beautiful world and try to build that beautiful world together in the united states that's a beautiful world the freedom of respect of human rights of all men are created equal yes pursuit of happiness you know it always sounds good if you look at what the the dream of communism is it sure as heck in its words on the surface sounds good respect for the workers yes the working class the lower classes that have been trodden on that have been stolen from by the powerful they deserve to have the money the power the respect that they have earned through their hard work sounds great and everybody gets along and we just have to you know and all men are wonderful people and if they if they go bad it has something to do with the fact that they have they have been oppressed right and that dream just never worked out and even even it is when you think about it and i didn't think about it when you're young you know you just emotionally you accept it but when you think about it somehow that new wonderful organization has to organize itself even though lenin predicted that the state eventually would go away how does how does that work then you have like anarchy right you have to have an organization and the only way to really organize a large number of people is with a hierarchy so and who gets to the top the the ones that are that want to go to the top the ones that believe in themselves the ones the ones that know better than everybody else and once you have that hierarchy established there is no guarantee that it doesn't that that it won't go bad and actually when you look at history every such hierarchy has gone bad you know you look at cuba for instance i believe fido castro was a an honest revolutionary i do believe that and so what did cuba turn into yeah there's something about when you speak about vladimir putin in this way but let's step away from that for a second is there something about being an honest revolutionary that wants to do good for their country and you start to believe that you know better than everyone else how to do good on the country and you very well might first but then somehow that grows into a distortion field where you know you keep believing you know what's right and all the people who disagree with you you stop seeing them as having a point you instead see them as like evil manipulators of the truth that are actually trying to hurt people for their own greed for their own power and you will protect the people because you know what's good in the case of stalin i mean i don't know but it seems like he really believed that communism would bring about a much better world i mean there is a sense the you have to crack a few eggs to make an omelet right this idea that sacrifice is necessary to bring about a greater world and then the other aspect is sort of ruling by terror creating terrorism justified political mechanism to achieve a better world so it wasn't i mean perhaps he had to do that to be able to sleep at night with the atrocities he's committing he i think he believed he will bring about another world and by the way the tarot didn't start with stalin it started right after the bolsheviks took over when lenin told mr jaczynski commodore trezinski to build the chicago and then execute the this is what he called it the red terror so so at that at the birth of the soviet union there was already terror and it was deliberate and it it also was it wasn't just focused on the enemies it was focused on whoever you didn't like there was there was no rule of law there was no there were there was no no court cases you know people were just pulled out of their apartments and shot on site yeah and the this was done by con revolutionaries who were convinced that eventually you know that these sacrifices had to be made and eventually that would lead to a much better planet and the populists believe this too that those sacrifices in part yes this is such a dark thing about dictatorships is you believe it but you're also too afraid to question your beliefs like you're not directly afraid but almost like i don't know what that is that's almost like a subconscious fear like don't there's a dark room with the locked door don't look in that door don't check that door and there's something about the united states that says especially modern culture so go to that door first and sort of question everything kind of that's the power of the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press but you can get almost become too critical and too cynical of your own culture in that way so there's a balance of strike of course but man is if that's if communism is not a lesson of human nature i don't know what it is but you believed without thinking too much about it you believe right in the story of khan what did you see just you know i came from the soviet union what did you maybe feel that's right and good about communism about the vision of communism do you remember like i think the biggest impetus and me believing in communism was that com the communists when when just before hitler took over the communists were the only force in germany that fought the nazis in the streets and that's a historic truth yes and and communists were hunted down by the nazis killed put in concentration camps and so what we knew when what we were taught and i think that was a huge unforced era by the western countries particularly the united states that there were ex-nazis in the government in west germany yeah and the most famous one was reinhard galen who was in charge was the general in charge of uh the intelligence on the eastern front under hitler and when the the allied won the war it was decided that galen was too important with his knowledge of the his and his organization was too important to to not use so he was co-opted by the cia and eventually wound up being the head of the bundesliga the cia of west germany that gave us us when i say us you know the east german party a huge propaganda victory i wanted to because his the emotional aspect of this was as follows when we we were in uh juniors in high school and and though in those days when you you were only allowed to go to high school if you were in the top 10 of students okay so this was going to be the next set of ruling elite in the country we were sent we were required to visit a concentration camp and if you know what what we as as 17 year olds were made to look at it was gut wrenching how can men do something like that to men piles of corpses lamp shades made out of human skin because they that skin had tattoos on them and a shrunken head so heads like the size of my fist and i mean the girls all cried and it would have made a huge impression and that was the that was the nazis yeah and then yes the communists i mean the united states course you know in in hindsight if the communists had come to power it would have been just the other way around as we know given the example of stalin and mao right so but we didn't know that right from the russian soviet perspective the communist regime banded together to win the the great patriotic war and that was the the second one you know the big brother the the soviet union i mean when when i was approached by the kgb that was like oh i felt so honored so we should say that we're talking about east germany that you're from east germany can you describe you were born four years and what is it yeah four years ten days yeah sort of very good after unconditional surrender in world war ii so what is east germany what is west germany what is east and west germany what is that what's the difference what's this the historical context here what is world war ii again and then let's do for we don't have to go to world war one which the result of which actually ceded world war ii in some respects yes there's a long history yes but let's start with world war ii so uh when hitler came to power he he and his his leadership decided that uh the germans needed more what they call laban's rom that means room to live so and they would you know they would start expanding at and they went into france they they took belgium the netherlands uh they annexed uh austria and and got a piece of the of czechoslovakia and then they decided to march into the soviet union and after after they took poland uh cut up cut up poland together with the soviet union yes they were friends yes they were no there was a non-aggression pact but between that was signed by robin trump and molotov right i think both parties knew that eventually they would fall apart but at the time it gave the soviet union a little more a piece of poland and a little more time to prepare what they thought might happen down the road and and the german the germans had you know the the time and the in the ability to pretty much conquer all of western europe do you think stalin really knew that it's gonna fall apart why would somebody like stalin trust somebody like hitler but why did he blunder so bad not to read the intelligence that was coming his way oh his troops are amassing on the border of the soviet union he didn't trust his own intelligence apparatus here's one one example there was a german communist who who went on the ground when hitler took over and he would he went to japan as a journalist his name is richard zorger and godzilla had really really good into intel about what the japanese would do and not do and it i forgot exactly what it was but it was it came to moscow and stalin totally totally ignored it and and when zorga was uh captured by the by the japanese the soviet union denied that he was one of there so he was executed that the paranoia again does a lot of damage we when you don't when you don't believe your own intelligence apparatus why why bother having one yeah i mean there but i'm sure there's contradictory information coming in from the intelligence apparatus so it's difficult i mean first of all nobody likes to be disagreed with especially when you get become more and more powerful and then the intelligence apparatus is probably giving you information you don't like but it's often negative information about yeah basically information that says that the decisions you made in the past are not great decisions and that's a difficult truth to deal with yeah so there you know in the modern times if we hop around briefly is vladimir putin has been not happy with the intelligence of the fsb thereby at least if you read the news right choosing to put more priority to the gru for the intelligence in ukraine right but i guess i suppose the same story happens there as it dis throughout history is paranoia i give you an example that that comes from a very reliable source and that my my best german friend worked as a chemist in the anastasi east german intelligence and he eventually he he rose to the rank of major and was in charge of the forgery department it's very likely that he made passports that i used to travel he was aware that there was intelligence that that was that was collected to start he was really good they had about a thousand people in west germany undercover agents some of them in government and the central committee of the party and the decision makers ignored it because it didn't quite fit in their world view it didn't quite fit into their plans so and and one one delicious uh thing that i just want to add on to this when when gorbachev wrote his book about perestroika and glasnost the the east german rulers did not like it they were much much more orthodox so they had to print the books in translation guess where they wound up they were in the host they piled up in the hallways of the stasi they they bought the entire print run it's fascinating so but let's backtrack so operation barbarossa invasion a hit right to the soviet union and then hopefully that leads us all the way to east germany west germany right after the end of the war so what happened was that the soviet union rolled into the eastern part of germany and the the western allies took a larger chunk which was eventually it was occupied by the three allies the french the the english and the americans and the eastern part was occupied by the by the soviet troops and the soviet troops actually conquered berlin yeah but as a and and as an in a contract they decided that berlin would be ruled by the four allies and they all had you know had free access to that city i was born in the east german part which very quickly became ruled by communist socialists the the communist party in the socialist party united and but the leaders of that new party for all communists it's nevertheless called democratic yes the german democratic republic which was formed a couple of months after i was born i was born into a the remote southeastern corner of of east germany and interestingly enough genetically i'm only half german the the other half the other half is czech and polish nice because where i grew up you know we i could walk to the nicer river which was the border with poland and and it was only about an hour by bus to get to the czech border so that's why i'm a mix so okay so east germany after the war was communist socialist yeah then the west germany was representing the western world with the right democracy and what the united states did when this was really really very forward-looking very strategic the the marshall plan to rebuild the economy in the west as compared to what the soviet union did they whatever they hadn't destroyed on the way in they took with them on the way out for reparations because you know they had every right to do that but it was not a good idea because you know east germany was always behind in economic development to to their western counterpart so when you're young as today but when you were young you were clearly an exceptional student yeah you're a brilliant academic superstar let's go to your childhood what's a fond memory from childhood that you have in being woken up to the beauty of this world and sort of being curious about all the mysteries around you that i think ultimately lead to academic success or was it the fondest memory that comes to mind is my first kiss how's that do you want to go to the details of that what what what what what'd you make of that would you make that guess what what would that teach you about yourself and human nature and all that it taught me only in hindsight at the time i was just like my god i was head over heels in love i was 16 years old yeah and i knew in those days i admired girls i knew that girls were like sort of magical beings they were not capable of doing evil things they were beautiful and they had to be adored and one of them actually loved me too she came after me initially right and that was like that was that too was magical for you oh my god yeah and i literally i dedicated that's when i started studying up until that point i just like did whatever i had to do to be in a minor students and that's when i started studying in every a that i got i dedicated to her sometimes explicitly because i knew i was going to take care of her you know when as i grow up so you're going to have to work hard in this world to be somebody that could be adored by the by those you lost yes you're right you know that that case the next day i was running around in school with a grinnell in my face and maybe that in some way that grin never fades so what about the heartbreak that followed the heartbreak surely but just to expand on this a little more yes because that that passion that i had was an indication that eventually love would play a big role in my life i wasn't aware of it i was just directed at this one girl but but that you understood that that feeling oh my god that taught you something like that you're somebody that can feel those things absolutely and there's that's a strong part of who you are and therefore it will also be a part of directing your life trajectory yeah so we we were an item for two years i lost my virginity congratulations she was not a virgin at the time she see my my my competitor was there always is a competitor isn't that how it works he studied medicine in in college already in which ways was he better than you he wasn't he was older and he was more experienced yeah and he was going to be a doctor and i but you know i was there and he was not ah the you know presence wins yeah but you still had big dreams you wanted to be a a 10-year professor yes yes so you you still want to outdo that guy oh yeah and she he eventually told me that you know he was he was not in a picture anymore so it was back and forth back and forth and the our senior year we were an item and and i was just dreaming of you know the future but sort of we didn't figure out that you know in those days if she went to college in berlin and i went to college in yena and the the distance to between the two cities was too it was too much to for a weekend visit you know public transportation was very slow and nobody had cars and so so the circumstance of life you just yeah and so we interacted with a couple of letters and then i got the goodbye letter oh my god that hurt i can still feel it [laughter] you know when that's that's a good thing that you could feel that pain that's still part of love that's that's that the pain of loss is still part of love and then you kind of change that you shape it and you give that love in deeper more profound ways to future people very well put but at the time it emptied me out yeah if if i had a tendency to you know to have suicidal thoughts i might have killed myself it was so you would you say that was one of the darker moments of your life let me see yeah as a single moment yes so you know i'm i still remember we had a mail slot in the front door and i was expecting a letter any day and there was the letter i go upstairs into my my bedroom and i open it and i read it and i was just like the life went out of me you're just there alone and you have to experience this pain alone so but now you're deeply alone in this world yes because i didn't have a there was no emotional relationship with my parents i literally had nobody so this love you have in you had no had no place to go it was choked off all right so but i what i did was i i wanted to go on right and so i threw myself into the study of chemistry i outworked all of my fellow students in a big way i just like i worked my ass off and since i was pretty smart too i just aced practically everything and for the first two years in college and look we go to college there all these pretty girls and their dances and everything we had this this great student club where i didn't look at any girls like eventually i knew i was going to you know want to have female companionship but love uh-uh no more than hurts there's a song that goes love hurts yeah yeah i know that one that's true there's actually many songs that have a similar message yes so during that time during your excellence just being an exceptional student of chemistry let's go to your story so in your book deep undercover my secret life entangled the allegiances as a kgb spy in america and in the really really excellent podcast series that i've been listening to it's people should definitely listen to it's called the agent you document your time as a kgb spy before during and after can you tell the story when you first were contacted by the kgb those how you were in invited the offer to join was made well it was a big surprise and i never thought of myself as as a potential agent you know i was going to be a tenured professor and joined the ruling elite because in in in europe tenured professors are few it's not like in the united states you know anybody who teaches at colleges as a as a title of professor easy now it's true yes that's not a criticism so we should also clarify that to any professor or not it is a very prestigious position throughout history of europe and i would say especially communist i don't know actually know the full landscape of the respect but at least in the soviet union where i grew up it's a prestigious position absolutely was and the the town of yena had about a hundred thousand people live there and i would it's a wild guess but maybe 30 tenured professors and they were part of the ruling elite i was trying to do it as much as i can to live the good life right you know you know have access to things that that are nice yeah but i think the powerful thing about being a professor in that context of east germany is the prestige and the feeling of superiority you know i was full of myself you know when when when you are the best of the best and i and i in my third year i received a scholarship the karl marx scholarship that was limited to 100 concurrent recipients in the country so my god no i was full of myself i believed in myself hook hook line and sinker and and and i was also uh this i got a lot of accolades from teachers and fellow students they were feeding the ego the old i mean yeah you have to believe in yourself often when you're young to truly try to excel and and you sure as heck did but you know as a balance you need a mentor somebody who puts things in perspective and i didn't have one my father was a non-entity and nobody else they they all looked up to me yeah i was an up-and-coming guy right so there's no father figure that put you in your place not at all and i give you one extreme example it was down the road when i fathered a child out of wedlock that was in my fifth year i believe the the communist party in east germany was very moralistic if you did that they would have a talk with you and give you whatever a severe reprimand nobody even mentioned a word about this so yeah so this is this is how this ego gets gets nurtured but anyway getting back to how the kgb uh came in contact so they most likely got knowledge of me by you know looking at the stasi records this stuff what's stasi oh that was east german secret police stat zika height security for the state there's that word security again [laughter] and that they pretty much kept the record on on everybody in the country and so when you when you look through this in and and this is what the kgb was looking for they were looking for candidates particularly for this kind of job that they had in mind for me for candidates who were not you know in their mid 20s who were not fully developed yet but mature enough to to get there and and and still young enough right because because at that level of maturity you can test whether they can handle this kind of yes absolutely right so and one day i got a knock on my door and my dorm room door was on a saturday and they knew that i was by myself how did they know it we had a i pieced this together and we had an exchange student from the soviet union and he was next door and to me and he you know he he befriended me so he got to know me a little bit and and the pattern was that my roommate would always go home for the weekend and of course they also knew which door to knock on even though there were no name plates right so somebody knocks and i knew it was a stranger because if if it had been a student the the pattern was that we would knock on the door and then go in we wouldn't wait for somebody to to let us in so i didn't i waited for 10 seconds and i and he didn't come in i knew that it was a stranger i said come on in and then came a person who spoke fluent german so that was not a kgb guy there was a collaborator when and so he started making a bunch of small talk he introduced himself as the as a representative of called seize yana which was the optics um company that made that was made really really good optical instruments was one of the best in the world so it's it's like though you know the the super prestigious company in that place right and he said you know that he was a representative of that company and he would just want to find out if what my plans were after graduating from college and at that point i knew he wasn't from cause i sana because in those days there was no recruitment you when when you were done if you were in the top 10 of the graduates you would most likely pick to stay and get a doctorate right and the rest of them were assigned you know where you had no choice so so that guy was an idiot he he didn't know the basics about you interviewed him a little bit to understand like oh sure you know i you know i started like feel out is this guy full of shit because yeah there's a stranger showing up to your dorm room and i knew that at that point i know he was stasi which was wrong but it doesn't matter because it was german and i had no idea that the kgb would be involved so i'm sorry to pause briefly did you have a sense did people know that there's a stasi type of organization that there is a large number of people doing this kind of work in east germany in order for you to make that guess yeah we we we knew that the stasi existed we we even had our james bond you know we had a series called the invisible visor where and a stasi employee in east german would go into west germany and hunt down nazis yes so yes the stasi was was known to be there and admired in part or feared or both i thought they were necessary and i admired them james bond the read yes the reason i did so because i had no information to the contrary i never knew anybody personally or even you know somewhat removed who was uh followed by the stasi uh was you know put in jail i had no clue i had no clue that they did a lot of damage and that they were like doing a lot of surveillance of of the east german population the same way the kgb did for for the soviet union so for me to be talking to somebody from the stasi it was it it raised my interest i was curious what comes next because i sort of knew something interesting would be coming at me and i had no i had no other thoughts about that at that point so when when he was finally when he he went and he went for the kill by reversing himself he said you know i gotta tell you that i really i really am not from cal size you know i'm from the government okay thank you for pointing that out and then he asked this question he says can you imagine to one day work for the government and so i gave a pretty clever answer i said yes but not as a chemist so we i answered the question that he didn't ask i helped him out so we made an arrangement to me meet for lunch which in germany is the main meal at the number one restaurant in indiana you know i still remember what i ate what was that rum steak with with butter on top and french fries was my favorite anyway so when i get to the restaurant i saw this fellow sitting in the back there at the table and there was another person at the table so i was a little bit hesitant because in those days it was not unusual for for perfect strangers to share a table because there wasn't wound enough tables and chairs and so forth so i didn't know if i could approach him but he he got up and came to me and he took me to the table and he said i want to introduce uh herman we work with our soviet comrades aha kgb and then he he disappeared he says i got something else to do i never knew his name i he just handed me over to the kgb what was the relationship between the kgb and stasis as collaborators close collaborators or just distant associates they were pretty close collaborators as i told you that you know they they they bought forged documents that the germans made because the germans were better at forgery they also exchanged information but they didn't trust each other 100 and and and i and i tell you why i know that so they recruited me to send me to west germany as i already said east germany had a thousand agents over there why would they have to want to have their own yeah yeah okay this is a fascinating internal and external dynamic of distrust yeah okay so there you are welcomed by the kgb when did the offer the invite come well that took a while so herman and i had an unofficial relationship for about a year and a half i would meet him maybe once a week once every two weeks initially in his car but then uh he he he took me to a conspirational flat this was a an apartment that was occupied by a a party member a lady single lady when we came in she would leave she left us tea and cookies and then we could freely talk he also at that time gave me some west german literature magazines to read which was of course forbidden so already i'm starting to feel somewhat special and as we were talking about what they had in mind for me in general i knew that i was going to be even more special because i would be above the law i would i would operate outside the law of the countries i would go to as well as east germany because you know that the magazines and and eventually when when i joined up they told me i had better watch west german television which was also not explicitly prohibited but it was uh something that could get you in trouble so on many levels you're super special you're the gym yes yes so what was that recruitment testing process like testing whether you are you have what it takes to be a kgb agent first of all we had very in-depth talks on herman and i about life and i was i still am very honest and sharing my feelings philosophical or personal personal personally i even i even told him that i was shy around the girls he was giving you a relationship advice or what how old was he so what was the dynamic can you tell me was it a father son no older brother older brother brother yeah he was maybe in his early to mid 30s and i was maybe 10 years younger and what languages did he speak oh you speak german he spoke german pretty well oh but he's originally from ohio yeah with a russian accent so i got in trouble one time with him when when i asked him is your real name german he didn't like that he didn't like it what was he good with girls was was no no he just you know i remember what he told me he says you know you got to understand one thing they're looking for guys too that's that's all you know oh girls are looking good yeah it's right it's a competitive game yeah yeah don't don't don't worry about it you know don't be so shy so that little flame of love that we talked about yeah in all the shapes that it takes in our life did he talk to you about that that that could be taken advantage of that that could be used or was it implied yeah but not in it was not very focused not in great detail so let's so we talked about personal stuff and you know like dislikes he gave me tasks for instance when my friend and i hitchhiked from from east germany all the way down to bulgaria he told me to write a report about it what i saw so fundamentally he wanted to see how well i can i can write and how well i can report how well i observe he also asked me to write some profiles about fellow students i don't believe that was for them to give him to the stasi it was just like how well do i characterize people what's that that's important when you're talking about when i was in the u.s active in the u.s i operated as a spotter so i did exactly that i wrote profiles about people he also gave me some tasks to do that were rather unpleasant what he would give me an address and the name of of the people who lived at the address and he told me to go there ring the doorbell and find out something about a relative who lived in west germany that is undercover exploration right so you go you you make up a story and somehow win the confidence of your target to tell you something that you want to know was that did that come naturally to you no no i hated it the charisma involved which part did you hear charisma i think i didn't know that i had it it took you some time to discuss because you know i was i always was and i still am to some degree a bit shy i lost a lot of the shyness after moving to the south because here in the united states because you don't have to be shy you know you can let your love shine that's exactly right so but anyway i hated doing that but i did it well i still remember so i in those days i had a i had a beard i i rang the bell and tall handsome fella yeah and and i looked the part i said i'm i'm a sociology student and i'm i'm doing a survey and i asked a whole bunch of questions can would you like to answer the questions no problem and then i directed the conversation to the lady's private life and and she actually gave me information she volunteered information that i wanted to know beautiful i did well and the other one that i didn't like but i also did well with when when herman drove me around the city and showed me a building and he said find out what organization is in there what they do maybe get to know some people and i did that pretty well also you know you have to be inventive you know to to come up with a cover story and and i've always been quite uh inventive you know i'm a storyteller and at heart and that i didn't know it then but you know but there was still something unpleasant about it yes yes which part was well the shyness and then you know you know i wasn't very comfortable lying i became comfortable down the road but you know i was brutally honest and never never hid anything of me but you know over time you lose that that uncomfortable feeling and you rationalize that you got to do it there's only one way right and you're serving a good cause so you were talking to herman for a year and a half year and a half and then how did that progress yes so he said he finally i guess he sent a report to headquarters in berlin and then he sent me on a three-week quote-unquote practice trip to berlin this was the first time when i had an and like a con conspiracy conspiratorial meeting where i would i had an address in a time and a code phrase and i met another agent his name was boris these names me were meaningless they were all like cover names right and so what was the code and the meaning what was then what can you give a little more code i don't remember no but not the code but like what do you mean by code oh i tell you my the the code we used when i when i met while i was active i would approach the other person who i thought maybe the the person i want to meet we both had some something to with us or on us to make us more likely to be the right person so and i would i would ask him the following questions excuse me or i'm looking for susan greene and he's and he would answer yes you must be david stupid if if i if i ask a stranger they would look at me how could i help you so yeah no one's the wrong guy yeah it's just a low probability that that the right thing would be so it's absolutely nice and it seems like a safe statement yes if it's not the right person exactly right you'll just come off you're absurd or crazy or whatever you you would have you would have made a good secret agent you you i know i'm not this is this is we'll discuss this i'm dressed like one actually yeah where there's any dress code no just fit in fit in no matter what and then be creative yeah figure out ways to ride so anyways he give me some tasks and we and he and since i had rented a room in a house he gave me western literature to read and we spent time together and there was a practice run to west germany actually there were two and that was very important in hindsight i figured that out so i traveled to west germany you know not to west berlin with an east german passport that was stamped that that individual was allowed to go to the west and there was a a part of the border that was only guarded by soviet troops and that's where they smuggled me into west germany i got on the subway and and then uh appeared in in west berlin no no no americans no birds no french knew that i had entered forged documents or not no no no this was a an east german passport it was real okay okay so and the first trip all they wanted me to do is just walk around you know smell the air you know have a beer or whatever and eat a sausage and then come back the second trip i had a task very similar to the one that i had back in yana to ring the doorbell someplace and talk to some people and that worked very well as also i should mention that you talk about that you know eat a sausage drink some beer i suppose that's a good test too to see how you behave under western like when first introduced to the western college like this is why i might not make a good agent is when i first came to the united states and the supermarket oh like bananas as many bananas as i want to eat that i think i would that i think that would break me it's just just it's a shock to be to have access to western culture you're getting very close to the reason they actually made me do this these two practice trips the when i first emerged on west berlin territory i felt highly uncomfortable that was the enemy right yeah and i saw the cops everywhere and even those those cops had like light blue uniforms nothing they weren't standouts so i was wondering you know if they knew that you know i had like kgb yeah on my forehead you were paranoid that they would know they would see i was scared but i overcame that so that's can we just linger on that because i suppose that's a natural like if i give anybody on the street the mission to do the mission you have to do is they would be paranoid that's the natural human feeling is am i being watched do they know like if you try to steal something from a store you're there's going to be a feeling like are they watching me are the cameras watching are there people watching me they all know that kind of stuff so you have to overco you have to be somehow rugged and robust to that kind of feeling and overcome it yes exactly so and and something very interesting happened while i was being trained in berlin i met a classmate of mine from high school and he confided to me that he was recruited by the stasi to become go as a spy to west germany and he also had this practice trip and he peed in his pants he went back and told him i can't do that just from the terror the yes that paranoia now this guy's career was over he hadn't he had an he had an engineering degree he was a pretty smart guy he he was just for the rest of his life and he's still alive i believe floating around and you know trading in model railroads and stuff like that you mean do you think that experience broke them or they wouldn't let him back in oh i see they yeah so this it's a test that if you fail you pay the bill i have no idea that that you know something bad would happen if i failed that test but i didn't yeah i didn't fail so and this led then to the offer all right and after and you know boris was happy with me and he told his boss who was most likely the the head of the kgb in in in east berlin and i had an appointment to meet in east germany yes in east germany yeah all of east germany yes that's right an appointment to meet with him and as we walk into the room there was this huge desk and the little guy sitting behind it very very just like little and not unimpressive nice a lot of paraphernalia like you know the bust of jazinski on on on this desk and and some some some paintings lennon and so forth but when the guy opened his mouth he was like whoa a huge psychological energy he spoke only russian now and initially he would you know start about with five minutes worth of propaganda why we're doing what we're doing i didn't need that i understood most of it but what i when when i didn't understand i asked boris to translate and then then he sprung it on me and i was not prepared he said so what are you in or not i was no i'm gonna i'm i hadn't made up my mind i wasn't expecting that would come and so i said to him i'm not really trained you know there's a lot of things i need to learn and i came up with a couple of really stupid things one one not so stupid but the other one was i don't know why i said that i said for instance i need to learn how to drive a car and to type with the typewriter and he he was he got really annoyed and he said don't worry about it we'll train you yeah but i gotta tell you we need people who are decisive so i you got until tomorrow noon to give boris your decision that made for a sleepless night so what was going through your mind well i had this was almost 50 50. i knew i was gonna have a huge career a good career i would i was on my way because you know this i was already employed by the university as an assistant professor so that career would be to become a professor become a ten-year professor be a world-class yes jenna had become my hometown i really loved the place it was my oyster and and my family was my basketball team i was you you loved playing basketball that's what you mean yeah so this is home is this home this is where your love is home did you understand that the choice involved leaving yes behind yes and and the one thing i didn't have the two things i didn't have an emotional relationship with my mother and i didn't have a steady girlfriend at the time i think freud would have a lot to say about that but yeah go ahead but the connection between those two but yes yeah i'm sure by the way my my my friend gunther the one who worked for the stars he was also the stars he tried to recruit him as an agent but he had a love relationship at the time and he said politely no i won't i can't so you didn't have that's the one thing that really could would have helped me would have held you to this place is love so you got the career on the one hand my basketball team the town that i would be part of the ruling elite of and then we had this great adventure and the ability to contribute to the victory the worldwide victory of communism and and stick it to the nazis and of course the feeling that you're really special yeah james bond yeah what's [laughter] the the question do i want to be a ten-year professor or james bond yes and and that's as funny as that sounds that was probably a difficult decision it was a difficult decision but fundamentally it wasn't it and it wasn't my zeal to to help the revolution it was my my what they called what they started was looking for the kgb was looking for in in a character that they would send over a well-controlled inclination to adventure okay [laughter] yeah yeah james bond what do you say and the love of women yeah it was yes sir but i got to put this in right here because i i'm telling people i have two things in common with james bond these are my initials jb and and i got the girl too three times [laughter] yeah i mean that's and that's adventure yeah and and and and the ability to travel to the west because the west was closed off to us we could go to foreign countries but they all had to be communist countries you know i wanted to see paris because i had fallen in love with the onori balzac who wrote zach a phenomenal set of novels that i just ate up and so i when i eventually did go to paris i knew all the places already because he described them all but anyway so that one it was a it was 5149 but eventually it and you know when you when you do the side by side intellectual comparison that doesn't work it becomes a tie and then you know you just go with your guard and i said hey i'm in so now that you successfully passed the test and you were sitting with this unimpressive man and had the invite and had to sleep on it and have made the decision to join yeah what was next i was just told you know that i was being recruited by the state department of east germany i was going to become a diplomat i must have had some paper but i forgot because you just by saying so then that would that wouldn't have worked there's some kind of document that says yeah yeah and that was the only entanglement you had to that to that place no love no that's just a basketball basketball giving up basketball was huge for me i loved playing that game i started playing basketball when i was'. that's a little late are you better offensive defensive what do you like more do you like to shoot from a distance do you like i was a runner i was very very quick on my feet and i was a good jumper too i typically pay played the the the four position you know what's that forward oh the forward position forward position but anyway so that that that was the hardest uh for me to give up but and the the other thing that i remember i had to do to hand in my party document to the party secretary of the university and he made a comment yeah we probably won't hear much about you but we know that you're going to do something very important so he thought i had an inkling that i'm going i'm gonna go someplace undercover or something like that and then i packed my bags and got on a train to berlin for another one of those secret meetings with my my new handler nikolai so and he came another test that that would have been quite easy to fail so all right had lived in vienna for six years in a dorm even when i became a an employee of the university they didn't they didn't have apartments i was still living in a dorm in any one in a single room with a bed a chair and a table and a toilet down the down the hallway so i figured you know berlin kgb i'm gonna get a nice apartment right and so nikolai took me into his car we started talking a little bit and then he said i have a task for you already your first task is to find yourself a place to live i mean i don't think i showed it in my face but you know my heart my my my heart dropped like down to into my pants i knew this wasn't nearly impossible because there was a severe shortage of of housing in in in everywhere in germany east germany and all the apartments and homes were controlled by by the government you you know there were long waiting lists nine i know i knew couples that were promised maybe to get an apartment five years down the road so and then they would postpone their decision to have a child anyway this wasn't possible oh well you know but this was a test i'm gonna and so again because i had to be inventive now i had to figure out how to get out of an impossible situation i didn't realize it then at all i just like went with a flow you know what do i do so what i did i went i took the the train the city train to the very last stop a little town called acna and i wandered around in that town and knocked on doors and asked people if they knew where somebody might have a place to live and after a couple of hours somebody said there's this lady that and she gave me they gave me the address and i talked to the lady and she said i happen to have a place that you might that where you might be able to stay it was an outbuilding and i don't know what it was what it served it was not a garage it was concrete and it had a bed and a chair running cold water and a stove a cold stove that was my was going to be pretty basic pretty basic that's the basis are you kidding me that's the toilet across the the yard of course yeah well all the essentials what are you complaining about you were right you're right you had to run the the special the james bond had to run this special operation out of the yes to my credit and i think that that that established part of my reputation i didn't complain at all to nikolai that was part of the test probably yeah i just told him you know i found something and so for six months i would get up in the morning get on the train and walk around in the city you know did some operational stuff and operational training i went to the library did a lot of reading in the library and then i found the basketball team that i could join so at least i could take a shower to twice a week and and apparently i it took about six months that i was still on probation because after six months nikolai one day we were still meeting in his car he said he handed me a key he said i'm gonna take you to your new apartment now i and i didn't know this you know that now i was really in okay imagine you know the hurdles you have to jump over and how many times you can fail but you know but not complaining not asking questions yes i mean that was something you've written about i think he wrote that bosses do not like to hear complaints or problems they prefer solutions that's right so what was your interaction like with the bosses is that essentially represent the way it went forward as well i no complaints get no complaints no arguments no no i know this better i was taking it all in now the the the technical guys you know they taught me something i didn't know that made sense what nikolai some of the stuff that he taught me was somewhat questionable he was a generalist and some things he didn't know really well so i could have like asked probed a little bit but i didn't so i just played along so this new apartment was it was a studio it had a kitchen with running cold water and the bathroom was just one flight down the toilet not a bathroom one flight down the stairs an upgrade it was a big upgrade yeah and he gave me i think he gave me a thousand mark to buy buy furniture and in that place i actually i also bought a tv and started watching west german television so so it i finally had a decent place to stay and the the my training in berlin took about two years what was the training what were the interesting aspects to the training what were sort of if you do an overview systematic of what was the training process what was difficult right what are some insights that generalize to the training process of what it takes to be a kgb spy right so let me start with a trade craft so i was taught morse code that took a while i was instructed in how to you know use a shortwave radio and to receive you know the the shortwave transmissions with morse code i was taught uh in a encryption and decryption algorithm manual algorithm you you might be interested that eventually i figured out at least one of the patterns the the algorithm was such that the and this was all about digits like and the algorithm was such that in the end the the digits that were used to decipher other digits that were handed that were sent to me by a shortwave radio there were let's say if there were a hundred digits there were an equal number of ones twos threes fours fives six and seven and up until zero and i was told that these algorithms these manual algorithms were good for about 300 uses after that they could still be deciphered i'm assuming nowadays that wouldn't take as much yeah with computers for sure but there's probably they're probably designed in a way that you can manually sort of it's efficient and convenient to use them manually well not to optimize cryptographic security is to optimize it's like the balance security and like humans being able to actually yeah no i got to disagree it was neither efficient nor convenient okay it would took a long time when what was what was significantly easier to do but that would require you to have spy paraphernalia with you this is what's called a one-time pad so you have the set of numbers on on the sheet of paper that had to be developed i had to use iodine to make those numbers visible those are known to be unbreakable unless they are used multiple times the same the same sheet of paper because you know the person who encrypts has the same set of numbers as the person who decrypts and one one time use you cannot figure out what the message is oh interesting but this is a quick way to communicate from one person to another one time one time well one time when i had a pad with multiple paper right and the reason that they gave me a manual one is because i literally i had only when i when i wound up in the united states i had only one thing with me that only a spy can have and that was a a writing pad with where the first 10 pages or so were impregnated with a trace of a chemical that was used for secret writing but you really would have to know what you're looking for to you know you see this pad it was bought at you a walmart and can you explain a little a little further what what is the chemical here that what are we talking about so how i don't understand how it's possible to have a physical pad that does the encryption without any computing i how does it include right so so no no it doesn't it doesn't do any work you know so and the the communication that the encrypted communication was was a set of uh groups of five five digits and then another five and there's always a gap in between and so let's say if i get this radio transmission i write them all down and then i then i use my develop my algorithm and then i do mathematics either addition or subtraction the resulting set of digits had that then had a one-to-one correlation to letters and this is an easy way to then do the correlation yes well that's cool that's you're saying the algorithm was not efficient it was not oh the manual it took a long time and and you can't make an arrow right would you know where can you is it easy to debug no you no you do it twice you do it twice and that's how you change it's identical then you know but like if it's not then then one is right and the other is wrong you gotta don't make mistakes no that's right and i really didn't but anyway so i was i was learning that i was also told that i was required to become proficient in another language and they gave me a choice and i picked english that's what was the other one oh no they gave them pick one friend you know whatever is spoken in the west got it what was what was what would be second to you would you think french because of paris what would you what why english english was a no-brainer because i was a straight age to a student in english without studying like it came so easily to me yeah so that's why i chose it right so that was that then i was taught the basics of counter surveillance you know some trickery and and surveillance detection routes where you wander around in the city for three hours and determine whether you're being followed or not that requires you to plan the route very well i give you one example that that will illustrate that it's my my favorite spot when when when i was in moscow i did a lot of that also and if my favorite spot was i it wasn't not well traveled uh road it went down the hill and and curved and at the bottom of the hill there was a telephone booth and when you open the door and pick up the telephone you have to look back so it wasn't like this right it wasn't a giveaway this was normal it was natural so yeah i could see if somebody would come walking after me you know these kinds of things or you would you know use public transportation big buildings where you needed to use an elevator and see who's because surveillance the the object of surveillance is to never lose sight of the individual who you're surveilling because at that point you may miss the window where he does something that that you're looking for so somebody always has to come close right did you have to also study surveillance no counter surveillance and what helped me in in all my training you know i would be would have a competition with the folks that were coming that were following me and me and i beat them every time they were at a disadvantage because one of them always had to be close and and if you saw the same face twice you know that you were being followed and i had a very very good memory for for faces so basically figure out a fixed route and then a fixed route that allows you to survey the area and then record the faces you've seen inside your mind and if you see multiple times a single face that's that's a bad sign and they they could they could you use different clothes yeah but they didn't have was face masks yeah the cia does nowadays they can give you a different face within seconds yeah so i mean again you talk about paranoia is that part of the is that a big part of the job counter surveillance like being constantly paranoid that you're being watched yeah i was supposed to isn't that quite stressful so is that is that one of the is that actually an effective way to operate no but it sort of becomes a routine i was told to do it while in the u.s once a month and okay it's like a cleaning out oh not every day no no no no no once a month or before i would say mail a letter with secret writing so i was sure that you know nobody saw me put an envelope into a postbox so this is one of the tools in your toolbox so there's morse code there's yes the decryption and encryption there's the kind of surveillance photography photography making making micro dots you know what a micro dot is well that's that's you use you you take a photograph and you use a microscope in reverse and make that photograph really small so small that it's like the the head of a pin that can be used to hide under opposite stamp yeah in reality i knew how to make them but in reality they they never asked me to to make use of that technique so it's a sort of an encryption mechanism for photographs yeah so what we do nowadays is an embed code in in pdfs and stuff like that right yep beautiful okay all right so that that was a learning a training process both in the physical space yes algorithmically is there other things oh you bet interestingly enough the i was the first book i was given to read was the history of this these communist party of the soviet union also understand that's interesting because you said you had to read western literature yeah that too how much how much reading so history how much history of politics geopolitics not culture but they made me read that document other than that i wasn't supposed to study the soviet union i wasn't supposed that that was not and i didn't when they sent me to moscow it wasn't to learn russia russian right it was to learn english the the second document they gave me was the the constitution of west germany and then i got lots of magazines and stuff like that as i told you i was also told to watch west german television which i which i embraced with a vengeance because it was better than east german so i would get up in the morning and have a little breakfast and watch the german version of sesame street and that that that helps you that helps you get an understanding of the culture if you have to do any kind of interaction yes kind of spying then you have to be and be able to effectively integrate well you also have to know like and that would have been easier if they had sent me to west germany you know all the soccer teams you know stuff that everybody knows when i came to the u.s i knew very little stuff that everybody knows that's why i had to be very cautious and you know take it in over time anyway and the the last thing i want to mention is they i was strongly encouraged to expand my my cultural education in other words go to visit museums go to the theater not so much movies opera read read books from all kinds of authors that was important to them and once a month i had to write a report what i did but the interesting thing there was not a there was no curriculum there was no agenda there were no check marks it was all ad hoc you know now you do this and then you do that and and a lot of this also they relied on my initiative again i mean that's part of the evaluation too are you able to have creative it's interesting that they're like developing a james bond type of character here which is what's the reason to go to the opera as you become yes cultured in a certain kind of way where perhaps that makes you more charming more charismatic in terms of your ability to integrate yourself in different situations you are absolutely right i was i was when i came to the u.s after about two years roughly i was cultured enough to not make a bad impression at it at a diplomatic soiree in washington dc i mingled freely yes all right and and and so the whole idea was for me to sort of reach into the upper realms of society where the targets would be juicier than you know the worker bees and how did you end up in moscow why yeah what is that journey well so i told you and i started studying english so i started back from scratch you know i had went and they paid for a tutor and i went from like english 101 and that i went through that in a couple of months then and then i got another guy with whom we i expanded this we had conversations rather than working from a textbook and i and i worked like a maniac i threw myself into the study of of uh english like you wouldn't believe and and my inspiration came from vladimir lenin i had read somewhere in a book that when lenin was in exile he studied german and he learned 100 german words every day new german words so i started reading newspapers and every word that i didn't know i wrote down on an index card german english and i piled them up and so i really learned 100 new english words every day i know this because i counted them and i had a system how to do this so you take your index card and you have five categories it's a really good way to learn road by road so you got category one that's the new ones and you got category five so you start with with five five you already had right four times if you have it right again it goes up go ahead to the archive oh like long-term cold archive yeah yeah four if you get it right it goes to five if you get it wrong it gets relegated to three so and so you go through this and and occasionally i would throw the archived things back into one so i really i really acquired a phenomenal vocabulary when i was done with my english my vocabulary was significantly higher than the average american because i didn't discriminate whatever word i didn't know i learned which is not necessarily the best way because you know english has a lot of synonyms right yeah and and one synonym is usually the preferable one and and i when i first interacted with people i very often used the one that wasn't as good and people found that i you know i have an interesting way of talking they didn't know what that meant but yeah well so it builds a good foundation for a language just getting a large vocabulary yes it's really interesting there's something i do which is called space repetition which is a programmatic way of doing this kind of system that you've developed yourself which is if you successfully remember a thing it's going to be a longer time before it brings it up to you again yeah now that's requires a computer to keep track of my information if you have cars that's a really interesting pile system one two three four five you upgrade it one two three four five maybe i wouldn't go to the archive and go to number two to pile one right away maybe i would go to like i don't know pile five perhaps is probably the right place to put it because you have to go through the full step again but that is a really powerful way to learn definitely language but also facts like people that go to medical school disconnected facts yeah and and you pretty much when you're done you you know what you know yeah you don't have that again to use it to integrate it into the music of language that's more difficult that's why you talk exactly right is that there there's a charm i mean maybe it's not good for spycraft but there's a charm to this kind of to having an accent and using words incorrectly but confidently there's a because language isn't a simple formula language is the play of words so you're actually using the incorrect synonym it you know as a you know if instead of saying i'm cold saying i'm chilled yeah something like using off beat words can actually be part of the charm so it's interesting if you can learn how to use that correctly because i i've know a bunch of people with the russian accent and i feel like they get get away with saying a lot of ridiculous shit because they're able to sort of leverage the charm of the non-sequiturs and by the way by the way just one one thing you talked about using a computer when i had my first personal computer i actually wrote a program that does that it does that by the way when was that one because you were a world-class programmer for time yeah very good programmer when did the pc was probably 1984 1984 when did you fall in love with programming when i went to college in the us and part of the core curriculum was that you were required to take a course in computer and it was mostly just you know talk but we also had to learn a language we had to write some programs in fortran which was what five at the time it was a it was a dumbed down fortran but listen so i see the ability i see what what you can do with this i program the sign curve and then i divided the design curve into really really small rectangles and then ran the program and it came up with the right area wow this is great that's incredible it's incredible it's so powerful it's you're creating you're creating a little helper yeah that helps you understand the world to help you analyze the world and so on we'll we'll return to that because it's interesting okay so you have so many interesting aspects to your life but in moscow so yeah no let me let no let me how i was sent to moscow okay so one day i had a visitor from moscow and he came to visit me in my apartment together with nikolai and he you know we talked and then he said so how's your english i said i pulled a book from the shelf and said i can read that without the help of a dictionary oh that's interesting and he said you know what i'm we're gonna send you a tape recorder and you just talk say something you know for 20 minutes whatever you want to talk about and they sent this thing and two weeks later i was on a plane to moscow because yeah i also spoke english sort of the british variety of english with not a strong german accent because i've always had the ability to imitate others and sounds there was an innate ability i would you know when when when we were in a lab and as students i would very often not do monologues imitating east german comedians you know i just impressions yes yes i'm not good enough to to make a living out of it but that raised some interest and so i went they sent me to moscow that was the first time on a plane by the way and i had a conversation with two ladies who spoke english one was a russian a professor at laminas of university she was obviously kgb that was her cover and the other one was an american-born lady oh by the way she was an actual professor and using that as a cover or is it just a story no i she said she was a professor she may have taught there too and that's an interesting distinction yeah one is like a story you tell people no and one is like you legit are doing the thing but it also yeah there's a couple anyway that's that's that's the intrigue interesting aspect of how to be a good liar you might you might as well live the lie yeah exactly right so and the other one was an middle-aged the the russian was pretty young the other one was middle-aged american and and so we talked for maybe a couple of hours and then they withdrew and i was left alone eventually my my liaison he came back in and he said it was close but the american thinks you can actually become you get close enough to become becoming a native speaker of american english and he said the russian was very doubtful so i think wishful it was a tie literally wishful thinking prevailed so within a couple of weeks i was moving to moscow and what what was the task in moscow and what how long were you in moscow two years and what was the task there is it training or is it espionage no it was training it was so it was i th the american american-born became my tutor i met with heart twice a week i also listened to a lot of bbc shortwave bbc worldwide i read more english books so a lot of that was about the language and the culture of english american and and i did phonetics exercises nice every night i had a tape that was about a half hour long and they would say a word and i would repeat the word say a word repeat the word and it was it's mostly about the vowels by the way most of the accent and particularly let's say coming from german into into english but also russian it's the violence are we talking about the so you would have a single word a word apple and you would just say apple yes american english or british no american english and and i give you one example that almost nobody gets right the difference between hot and hot [music] you know yeah yeah you know yeah and and german speakers it's very nice you know which one for everyone is different for example i could say this in a podcast something that my brother struggles with i struggle with too when i first came to this country to learn english is there's differences there's embarrassing differences like beach and bitch right and you get so as a young kid also you get so nervous that i don't want to say the wrong thing i can also say that this is almost as a jokey thing but there's a there's a famous philosopher emmanuel kant and you can guess which other word is very similar to that so there's a there's a nervousness about the what is that that's interesting i mean and germans probably have a different tension of like what is hard to learn the difference between the pronunciation of the vowels or the control of the vowels yeah it's interesting so you had to really master this daily exercise and you know and this this was my discipline i did this every night routine boring as hell so english was the focus and i also had interaction with some agents who had operated in the united states as diplomats on a diplomatic cover they would come and talk to me a little bit and tell me and and sort of prepare me what was ahead of me and then i did a whole lot of operational training particularly surveillance detection that was big i also they also taught me how to drive a car in moscow finally one skill you need what's surveillance detection okay so this is what when when you find out whether you're being followed ah gotta gotta got it so it's the enter yeah the the abbreviation that's used in congress and and yes in intelligent circles is sdr surveillance detection route you know when they say that you know what that is and and that was it and a few other things you know one-offs for instance i was once taught to read silhouettes of ships when you see a ship from a distance what kind of a ship it might be they they thought this would come in handy actually that they there was in in 1982 andropov started a campaign was now i forget the name operation something something where everybody who was in the west was supposed to look for signs that the west was uh getting ready for war and i had an everybody had an object to to pay attention to i had a a harbor and military harbor in in new jersey near red bank it was called earl weapon station and this code name for that was early so they asked me to just wander by there to see if there was something unusual going on because the soviet union were at that point it was ronald reagan were really afraid that reagan was going to start a war they were absolutely 100 afraid of him is there something memorable to you on a personal level on a philosophical level about your time in moscow something that kind of stays with you outside of the training stuff maybe like the details of the training you love the answer you will love the answer i was really guest i was given tickets to two performances by americans there was a theater troupe that played our town and then there was this i forgot the name of the guy but uh you may not be old enough have you ever watched hee haw maybe there was a it was a country music show real kitschy but the star of hee haw was giving a concert in moscow and i guarantee you at least half the audience were kgb oh man and at the other end the uh the the the opposite of of of a highlight was my visit to the to to to the mausoleum where lenin is still still today there there was so there wasn't nothing you know he was he was my hero but he he looked like a wax figure and and and you walk by there there was nothing inspirational not not it was not a religious experience nothing it was it was a big old nothing is that did did your faith and belief in communism start to crumble at some point here is that around that was still pretty small what i did notice that the standard of living in in moscow was significantly lower than in east germany the uh in the supermarkets you could you could expect with reliability that you can find canned fish and mineral water everything else was whatever and if you saw a line and at a store you just line up you don't even ask what they have because if you don't like it somebody else will it was it was not poverty but it was close to poverty there were a lot of drunken men in the streets and this is the 80s no this is the late 70s mid to late 70s and and also the they had these high-rise apartment buildings that looked pretty good from the front but you went into the backyard ouch you know yeah you're describing my childhood here okay but it's interesting even even with the professor even with everything else it's interesting because i think the standard of living was much lower yeah right even in moscow yeah absolutely was though the one thing that they always had at least in my days was in those two years there was always fresh bread in the bullet snails yeah always yeah that's probably one of the memories i have of childhood is well you're hungry a lot but when you eat is bread yeah and the bread was good it was good i mean i don't i actually wonder i wonder how good it was but i remember it being incredibly good to me it was really good and and you know you had it from white to very dark and in all the varieties the other thing that was good was if you knew where to get it was four rubles not only is it good vodka but it's a cheap vodka i like it yeah but you had to know whether you know this would be like holes in the wall someplace well i think a lot of the way they operate i wonder if these germany's this way but a lot of the ways that moscow operates you kind of you had to know yes like there's a very kind of if you make the right friends if you give money to the right guy the guy the friend of the friend of the friend is gonna hook you up and this there's a culture this this is how you work around a very big bureaucracy underground economy yeah underground economy yeah you have to which is a boy such a stark contrast between between that and the united states the capitalist system yeah that was a very big culture shock to me to understand yeah the the different way the different fundamentally different way of life but the interesting thing is human nature pervades both systems and there's something about the russian system that reveals human nature more intensely because of the underground nature of it because you get to deal with greed and trust and all those kinds of things in the united states there is much more power to the rule of law so there's rules right and people follow those rules right they have to break the rules nonstop well in in east germany and russia i believe theft if you could get away with it was part of your economic activity yeah i have a friend you know who who i went to school with up until my fourth year and we reconnected and he told me how he survived you know he would you know he would just steal stuff and then sell it and or trade it yeah thefts i mean it's a relative concept you are taking stuff bro bribery all those kinds of things people you know corruption you know it's a relative term no i'm just kidding i mean it is you have to work around the giant barack bureaucracy about the the giant corruption corruption builds on top of corruption and it just becomes this giant system that's unstable as you talked about one last word yes the two years in moscow taught me how to be alone i had no social interaction not with friends not with women not no i was the only interaction i had was with the folks that trained me so i was alone it was a lonely two years for a person who who loves love yes that prepared me for my first year and first and second year in the united states because i could not interact socially without giving away that something was wrong with me i had to learn how to be an american they didn't teach me in moscow they couldn't so if the first two years in in america you had to kind of listen more than two you you bet the very first year i couldn't even work because i had to acquire the ducking documents and a social security card and a driver's license to get a job and then when i had the job and i worked as a bike messenger that gave me a good opportunity to listen as you know because these people did they weren't very curious about me what was your name in east germany what was your name in moscow what was your name in america okay so in my the name i was given at birth is ibrahim nobody's so sexy when you speak in german the german asset i hate i hated that name they i didn't like it it was it was very rarely used my mother named me after a famous german painter ibrahimo my cover name in moscow was known as dita and in in in the united states i became jack barsky in between i used a whole bunch of other names that were associated with false passports that i used the one of the names and i remember is william dyson because that is the name that was on the canadian passport i used to enter the united states so how did you enter the united states can we take the journey from moscow to the united was states assignment what was the what was that leap what was like what just one one one thing in between i had a three months practice trip to to canada that was that was a good idea and i got to tell you this this one thing that happened there okay so because you know the one one thing that that i like to tell people nowadays is the one of the secrets to happiness is the ability to make fun of the worst situations that you're in yes absolutely you see the humor yes okay so here's come here comes something quite humorous in hindsight at least one of my the tasks that i had in in canada was to acquire a birth certificate but the name the name was henry van randle who was born someplace in california and i was supposed to you know write a little letter saying i'm henry van randle please send me a copy of my birth certificate the fee is enclosed and and and i lived in a small hotel so the return address it wasn't visible there was a hotel that was important so and it took like three weeks and i get nothing four weeks i get nothing eventually i got annoyed and i i i mustered the courage to call them up for myself from a pay phone i called up the office registrar whatever they were called in this in this town in california and i and i yelled at them i said you got my money where's my birth certificate well a couple of weeks later it came so i see the envelope this is the henry van randle yes i had prepared the caretakers of the of the hotel to that i'm expecting a letter from my friend so i went up to my room i opened it and i was like yes yes this is a success and and then i opened this thing and it was it was a copy of a birth certificate but it was stamped with big letters across in red deceased now think about it so here's the dead people who was asking for that person who was asking for more birth certificate i had the presence of mine to to leave okay i went to a couple of other cities i should have left the country but i know that the royal mounted police was following me and i was given that information by the fbi later on and they were you were able to just oh you were able to at least suspect that at the time i would through the the the the i knew that i knew that there was trouble so i [music] my counter surveillance route yes didn't discover anything so i kept on going i had to supposed to i was supposed to visit two more cities and they were always one step behind what what what is interesting to me is that they didn't catch me on the way out you have to show your passport to the airline i mean i was known by name i would in the past because i had to give that to the hotel right and i and i escaped with that so how would they buy a hair they would have to keep you on a list right yeah yeah that's interesting but that requires like a good computerized updated yeah this was swiss air so [music] well you got lucky yeah part of life is luck you bet so so and and other than that the the trip to uh canada was a big success because it it gave me the culture shock that that i needed to not be blown out of out of the water and when i could get to the united states so you hopped a few places in canada yeah and then swiss i even had an i even had a relationship with a young lady canadian french canadian regular canadian french canadian and she she gave me a book winnie the pooh because we went to see the movie and then she wrote the dedication she says to the nicest german i've ever met was she lying no or you don't know maybe speaking of spycraft and that that led to heartbreak too no that was sexual i was not at that point ready for love not ready to return to that dog well and i was all i was already already married in germany okay that woman i loved we should return to this yeah so swiss air where did you land in the united states oh when i came where did i land i an american airlines flight from mexico city to toronto but they made me deep plane in chicago i have no idea i think there was over engineering that didn't make any sense to me you know why can't the canadian just take it take a flight from mexico city i don't know with this stopover this kind of nonsense yeah but okay but nevertheless that was it and then you landed in chicago right and then tell me the story in america what was the day-to-day life now this is now you're a spy no no no no i got to tell you another funny story yes so this is another there's two things that happened that could have ended my career as a spy right then and there so i'm so i'm i'm arriving in in chicago in the evening it's already dark i had no idea what kind of a hotel to take you know i picked one out of a out of yellow pages and then got a taxi when i gave him the address he looked at me like a little funny whatever what do i know you know just keep on going i need to get i need to get sleep because i was extremely tense you know having gone through customs and border control so and we were going in the southern direction and i noticed that the neighborhoods were became less and less inviting didn't didn't know what that meant either and i get entered the hotel it was a five-story brownstone and something else looked funny so the reception desk was protected by plexiglass not having enough background i didn't know that this was unusual because all i knew that there was a lot of crime in the united states so i thought maybe every hotel was like that so i go up into my room and drink a half a bottle of johnny walker red because as one does yeah because i was so damn tense i just wanted to sleep i wanted to get into a coma which i did and yes and the next day i woke up with a head it was twice as big as felt twice as big but you know i was prepared i had aspirin with me so i killed the headache and went outside to see if i can get something to eat and so i was right smack in in the middle of the south side of chicago i didn't know that this outside of chicago existed i found later i found out where i was so it was time to go very quickly go up there and at that point i decided i would i would register at the next hotel on the jack barsky so i went to the bathroom and i tried to kill kill off mr dyson by burning his passport unfortunately i was not trained in how to train passport i don't know how to destroy passports so i tried to burn it and these things were flame retardant and it created a cloud of smoke and i'm looking up there and there's a smoke detector yeah oh no okay so presence of mind i threw this thing in the toilet and then then took out a pair of scissors and cut it into small pieces and flushed it down yeah if that smoke alarm goes off i'm busted right if somebody if if some some criminal steals i had six thousand dollars on me in cash steals either my passport or my or my money or both i don't know what to do yeah you can't go to authorities you can't do there weren't there weren't any russian soviets in chicago do you have any contacts no there was no there was no there was no plan b for chicago at all that's an oversight and i shouldn't i shouldn't have gone to chicago they they could have shipped me into uh san francisco or washington dc because both of them had soviets my end goal was was to go to to new york fine you know i would have been a really really dangerous agent if i had gone back and worked with a kgb because i could have told him all the things how to do it right right so in that sense there is some given the scale of the kgb there is some incompetence and some a lot of encouragement with regard to preparing me to be an american is it was almost totally incompetent and that do you think that's representative of the way they operate as there's an incompetence like to the logistics to the strategies involved all that kind of stuff none of these guys had operated as illegals they they were outsiders to american society they had interaction with americans and but they all lived in you know in new york they lived in a compound in in northern manhattan where they all lived together with their families and and they most of the time they spent interacting with with themselves with their own people at work so they really didn't integrate well they did not know what it's like to be an american to have a job to to you know live like an american they didn't know it it's interesting that kgb didn't put a high value to that kind of integration they didn't know what they didn't know yeah and and by the way this was mutual do you think the cia had good knowledge of the russian culture ah same thing and so there was a lot of lack of understanding because good good intelligence could have possibly avoided some of the high tension that situations that we had when when in the 80s we got close to nuclear war so good intelligence would be integrating yourself in society yes and understanding that ronald reagan was not a warmonger but he was talking about the end times because he was a a christian but then that kind of integration can be dangerous because you start to question the propaganda the narratives that on which the kgb is built oh yeah he's built and and then they they have all they always have to have the options of ignoring the intelligence that they're getting right well let me ask you this question sort of to jump around there's a lot of conspiracy theories in this in this current climate i mean throughout history but now especially and some of the conspiracy theories put a lot of power in the hands of the intelligence agencies like cia fsb mossad mi6 they're basically the conspiracy theories go that they control the powerful people in this world and are able to thereby manipulate those powerful people and manipulate the populace in order to deliver different kinds of messages and so on given your experience with this kind of tension between competence and malevolence would you say there's some truth to those conspiracy theories not one way i think i think there is there's collusion there's collaboration but i would think that like for instance uh some folks in the cia and the fbi are are being used by the ones that are really in power power is money power is wealth i know power is going to go the other it can go both directions you can acquire wealth first which leads you to power or you can acquire power first yeah power is also knowledge i understand and in a in a position in society in the military or in intelligence but i don't think it's a straight one way that all the intelligence agencies control the powerful people in their country you see what's happening in russia i mean putin dominates his intelligence agencies right well so the question is which way the direction goes but you're saying that there is it's not one way flow of power i would think so and and i also believe it exists but it's not as prevalent as you know not every conspiracy theory pans out and most of them don't they're just damn rumors but that doesn't mean they don't exist i guarantee you then there's there's collusion there's people getting together and not necessarily preparing a specific action but more sort of a plan to go forward and maintain the position or even you know strengthen the position that they already have so kgb who can generalize fsb cia do you think a kgb agent would kill someone against international law if they were ordered to do so so we talked about they did they did and there's there's a famous case of one uh i think it's vasily kuklov who defected he was a killer he was a train killer and he had done assassinations in other countries he was sent to west germany to kill a defector a kgb defector and he decided not to do it he he talked to the guy and he said i'm supposed to kill you i'm not and then then he eventually wound up in the united states i have a connection to this fellow because the kgb once asked me to go to california and see if the guy still lives and works there and we i found him and we looked at each other so there was an active kgb agent looking at a man that he didn't know was the the kgb defector looking at each other neither one knew who the other one was and i found out later but he was able to survive yes and you know that there have been assassinations not not a lot and you know that that we know of a good point this is very difficult the the the question is how many lines are intelligence agencies willing to cross to attain to achieve the goal i i think none of these agencies have the ultimate line i think eventually the last line will be crossed if they believe it's necessary well i think you can justify a lot of things especially in this modern world with nuclear weapons that you can justify that you're saving the world actually let me ask a few difficult questions and we'll jump back to your time in america but vladimir putin has been accused of ordering the poisoning and assassination of several people including alexander livenenko early on all the way to alexey navalny do you think these accusations are grouded in truth and we will return to a couple more questions maybe about vladimir putin's early days in the kgb which would be interesting yeah there's a there's a phrase that i'd like to say in response it's called plausible deniability i don't think putin gave a direct command as they do that he would just maybe muse it would be nice if something were to happen and then somebody picks it up and does it is there can you steel man the case that putin did not have direct or indirect obama who who who would know who would know you know just well the the international the reputation perhaps perhaps catalyzed by putin himself is that he is the kind of person that would directly or indirectly make those orders perhaps the case there is he's somebody to be feared and thereby you yeah we are sure out there but the act itself the the the poisoning of litvinenko and oh and then the the assassination of the bulgarian markov and with the with the umbrella and and they all directly traced back to russian soviet intelligence and so that's enough to be feared right my answer that i gave you is an educated guess you know i can't pretend to know this for sure but it's frustrating to me because there's a lot of people listening to this would say would even sort of would chuckle at the naive nature of the question but if you actually keep an open mind you have to understand what is the way that intelligence agencies function is it possible to the head of an entity intelligence agency not to make direct orders of that kind where there's a distributed no the head of the intelligence agency would most likely give the order even though it's compartmentalized yeah but but but not the the head of state not maybe not the head of state although in the case this is the case in the united states as well but certainly is the case in russia there are close relationships between the head of the fsb and the gru and personal relationships not just even the head of the fsb was now in jail there's there's interesting details especially coming out recently around the war in ukraine so let me actually ask about the war in ukraine all right what is your analysis of the war in ukraine from 2014 to the full-on invasion of ukraine by russia in 2022 and february 2022 what there's many questions we could ask one is what are the sins of the governments involved what are the sins of russia ukraine america china are those sins comparable who are the good guys and the bad guys that was more than one question though let me just uh give you my the basics about this savvy observers saw this coming they were a very small minority because vladimir putin was pretty open about what he told the world his mission was was the re-establishment of a strong russia the re-establishment of something like the the russian empire to unite all the russian-speaking uh people in under one country and the world ignored him i mean he was open what was there was at a conference in in france i believe when we we set this out out in the open and then what we had in the united states we had wishful wishful thinking you know obama had this reset with russia you know we all get friendly and then when when putin invaded crimea we did nothing so and it and it just escalated slowly but surely it was pretty clear and then they said it was i think two years ago there was an essay published by putin whether he wrote it or not doesn't matter but that was also out in public where he was again quite clear what he was going to do now how do you do this with force and and the the sins committed by the american government was that we ignored it we were in engage in wishful thinking and we didn't stop it with sanctions before the shooting started to push back i don't think you're fully describing you are describing the sins of the russian government and putin i don't think you're fully describing the sins of the american government here because not only didn't you're doing you're describing the miscalculation so not only did they not pressure correctly with sanctions and so on and and and clearly respond to the actual statements and the essays and the words spoken i know where you're going but yes but they also at the same time pressured pressured russia and they also as putin himself said sort of there's a rat and they pushed the rat towards the corner by expanding nato and and arming ukraine and well the military-industrial complex is a machine that that led us and i think a lot of younger people i mean when i came to this country and this is the country i love i lived through 9 11. i lived through the full roller coaster of emotion yeah i am a at that time before that and after was a proud american i went through the whole roller coaster of being sold i would say a lie about the reason to invade iraq and even afghanistan and i got to live through understanding of this military-industrial complex that leads to the expansion of vampires of the delusion that we have in the populace in in the government that convinces us that we are the good guys and somehow with military force we can instill our values instill happiness the pursuit of happiness that all men are created equal these ideas in into other lands and we can do so with drones and we can do so with weapons and we could do so without significant cost to our own from our own pockets and so this idea this machine doesn't just apply to afghanistan and rock it doesn't just apply to yemen and syria it doesn't just apply to china it also applies to ukraine it also applies to russia agree two thoughts if i may first of all one does not hear the term military industrial complex in the public discourse these days eisenhower warned about it eisenhower was a capitalist he was the president of the united states so it exists and it is very powerful the more weapons you can sell the more you have to replace them or send over you have to replace them so yes the the other thing is there's also a messianic streak that powers american foreign policy we want to make the world just like us why don't they get it because they don't want to it's almost like it's not communism but it's it's a very similar romantic idea that we can make the world and fashion the world the way we are and and and that's the romantic side and the sort of honest side but it doesn't work it it failed every time right you know afghanistan is a royal mess and was would never become a functioning democracy i don't know if if ukraine can become a functioning democracy so well i don't know if american weapons can help ukraine become a functional democracy i yeah absolutely but there's a huge amount of interest in seeing the world in black and white and selling the story of the world is black and white that ukraine is the symbol of democracy in this east eastern european world and russia is the symbol of authoritarian dictatorship and the story is not so simple as as as many indices show ukraine and russia are the number one and the number two most corrupt countries in europe they're two peas in a pod one is bigger and and one is in this case the aggressor now you know two p's the aggressor is still ultimately responsible and the person that throws the first punch now there's a lot of people going to disagree where the punch came from yeah sure but there is there is magnitude yes and and the struggle by ukraine for its sovereignty stretches back to the beginning of the 20th century it stretches back even further than that but there's been the ukrainian people are proud people and they've been in many cases tortured by those that sit in the kremlin throughout the 20th century the the famine in the in the early 30s and it's always it's never the middle class and upper class that suffer so is the lower classes the peasants in that time that this history stretches back far and this is yet another manifestation of that and there's a lot of interest to play china watches closely russia america watches closely and there's an extra caveat here that there's nuclear weapons at play as well exactly and it's what this is the situation is as dangerous as i have lived through in my entire life i believe and beca because it's not necessarily at the highest point of escalation but it will be in my view a protracted crisis and the longer that crisis lasts the more of a chance there is of an accident yeah one rocket yep there seems to be a strong incentive to prolong to do siege tactics to prolong this conflict over perhaps many years which is terrifying to think about yeah and over that one a single rocket can lead to given that there's leaders that might not that might be losing their mind yeah and ukraine is not part of nato the thing i'm really afraid of is that somebody might think it's a good idea but for russia so putin might think it's a good idea for russia to send a message by launching a nuke against ukraine because they're not part of nato so surely the west is not going to respond what is the west going to do yeah if if russia nukes ukraine to send a message i don't know if anyone knows the answer to that question but it's a terrifying question and and i don't know the exact protocol that needs to be followed to to launch a nuclear strike from from from nato's end because we have several countries in nato that have nuclear weapons so for let's say for france to fire a nuke does the united states have to agree i don't know how that works i don't know if anyone knows how that works yeah i worry now we have different very kind of anecdotal perspectives on these things but the people i've interacted with in the dod department of defense in the military there is a compartmentalization there is a bureaucracy and within that giant bureaucracy there's incompetence we'd like to think that there is like really well organized for really important things there's going to be the best of the best in the world that's going to execute and the correct decisions both geopolitically militarily all that kind of stuff and i've seen enough to know that competence at any level of government at any level in the military is not guaranteed let's go back to the law of hierarchy the the government is is the biggest hierarchy there is and so invariably politicians find their way to the top and once you have politics in dictating substantive decisions they're they're going to be weak or wrong it's i don't i don't know how this could work any other way there well right now we have some functional idiots in in the central united states government well let me because you did you said that i think elsewhere you said that putin was not a good kgb agent that's right a mediocre one but is an excellent politician yep and a good organizer he was known as a really really good organizer when when yeltsin hired him as a prime minister he he cleaned up the mess to because he yeltsin was it was under yeltsin russia deteriorated tremendously and it became sort of an a mix of an oligarchy and a criminal enterprise and chaotic so he had skills that made him a good executive absolutely now let's go back to him as a kgb agent he was a kgb agent i mean you know according to him once a kgb agent always a kgb agent but 16 years let's say something like this what do you think about from your experience now you're maybe same age as him approximately the same age as him he's a little younger a little younger what do you think about the kgb experience he had made him the man he is what aspect of that from your own experience well how much that does that define you who you are how you think about the world how you analyze the geopolitics of the world how you analyze human nature now i got to tell you one thing he had a different type of training than i did mine was one on one and he went to school so to speak so classroom journey right so but but fundamentally he he was not a top agent and this is very simple to there's only one one thing you need to know he he knows german pretty well so he where was he deployed in east germany not in west germany not in switzerland not in austria that's where they sent the best right one would think generally we're learning here right so this is your classification of where they send the best you know there's people classify all kinds of stuff like what is the best university in the world what is the best football team in the world you start to get a sense the good guys get sent the the best athletes get sent to well we can disagree on this but the football team is but you have a sense and you're saying that the best agents would have been sent one would think so now that this is not for a forcing argument but uh i also have it from from a word from the horse's mouth which horse what kind of horse what's the breeze oleg kalugin you you know who oleg kalugin is and he's still he's still alive he was at one point the head of counterintelligence for the first directorate espionage right and putin was in the first directorate and reported to collogan for a while and oleg told me to my face that oleg was not an impressive that agent trainee or aj vladimir putin was not impressive not impressive at all now he's biased given his current situation and well yeah you know he could still make it up because he had this big ruckus when when he was in parliament and called called putin the war criminal about the war in not only could he make it up i wouldn't trust his analysis i mean i have to you know what when people i've been working very hard even before this war to try to understand objective analysis of all the parties involved you have to really keep an open mind here to see clearly to understand if you are to try to help in some way make a better world in this case stop this war yeah or have all the countries involved flourish bring out the best of the people remove the corruption and the greed and the destructive aspects of the governments and let the people flourish for all that you have to put all the biases aside all the political bickering all the i don't know all the biased analysis and there's there's a lot of propaganda that says that in fact putin was it was a good agent how else would he rise to the ranks right because he he was a good politician and he had made a lot of good connections and with within the kgb allow me to say something and you just you just taught me a lesson and and and the lesson i should have figured out myself because i keep on telling people that in the intelligence world you never know the truth 100 so when you said all i could make that up of course he could have but you get to a point where you're forced to make a decision or have an opinion and then you use your best educated guess yes so i'm i'm going to take the certainty of the statement that i made back yes because you it's quite possible that you're right well what i've noticed about vladimir putin and this is true about for example donald trump and all those kinds of divisive figures that some for some reason people's opinion on the details of those people are very sticky once you decide this is a bad guy yeah there's like a black hole and people are not able to think like one act at a time you don't have to like that doesn't somehow justify this that somehow doesn't remove all the evil things that are done but you can analyze clearly each of the actions and to me it is interesting to see how did this man rise to the ranks now you're saying that to be a kgb agent there's a lot of skills involved and perhaps raw technical skill of spycraft is perhaps not related to the skill of raising rising through the ranks right and you're saying as a politician he was good at right lying and influencing that is something that that is significant as a significant talent and ability that an agent must have that helps you as a politician continuing the kind of thread of the role of kgb in defining the the heart soul and mind of vladimir putin let me return to yuri bismanov who was a soviet kgb agent that wrote a four-step framework for ideological subversion on a national scale as practiced by the soviet union so the the four steps are demoralization destabilization crisis and normalization he had a lot of other kind of systematic ways of describing this kind of stuff so can you speak to some of these ideas about the systematic large-scale ideological subversion goals of the kgb is there truth to that kind of those ideas yes but you know i think i already sort of mentioned that i think bessmanov was a fraud and i have i have again can you elaborate good arguments let's put it this way first of all we we know that the kgb was involved in active measures which is you know you can call it uh fake news yeah seeding fake news into the advert in the countries that are your adversaries and and the russians have been doing this lately by meddling in our election and and focusing on the left and the right fringe and influencing them to become more left and no more right so that and and vasily mctoken has and as in in one of his books he has a whole chapter about active measures okay so what he has to say about the department and i forgot what department that was was the one department that was the least desirable for kgb agents because these were desk jobs for people who had to come up with fake stories in countries where they didn't quite know too much about the country now there were some successes like one of them the two most famous successes that i'm aware of is that uh the canard that the eighth virus was concocted in a cia lab and so a lot of people around the world believe that and the other one was that j edgar hoover was a secret cross-dresser cross-dresser that was that that is still known by a lot of americans who are of a certain age that this was the truth but mitrokin actually traces it back to a story that was placed in a sort of left wing but close to mainstream french magazine and it was then taken taken up by more you know larger newspapers and and well-established papers so so they had some successes but this kind of a massive well thought out campaign to destabilize the united states i don't believe the kgb was capable of doing that mitroken seems to agree with me i was trained i would think you know i was one of the crown jewels of the agent one would think that they used the best that they had to to help me how to become an american and they didn't have a clue so how did they co if you don't know how a country operates how do you come up with with this this this this kind of a very detailed long-term plan that's that's also timed you know two years this and one year that and all that yeah so we should actually just clarify so he has this whole idea that there's 15 to 20 years i need it for demoralization where you're you're basically infiltrating a country from a young or people from a young age manipulating their mind you're destabilizing them that's the second step that takes two to five years you target the country's foreign relations defense and economy you create a crisis artificially and then you normalize it as as if it always was this way so it's basically saying that the kgb is capable of at scale over many years manipulate an entire population of people right and this is kind of there's a lot of people that believe in conspiracy theories that are amenable to this kind of idea now my own experience is that there is in fact just a giant amount of incompetence and this is something that's actually very difficult to pull off because yes it's incredibly incredibly difficult to achieve this kind of manipulation i think it would it would require first of all not much bureaucracy not much slowing down you have to have incredible in the modern world digital systems are able to do surveillance manipulation there has to be a strategy that is carried out in secrecy across a huge number of people effectively that also requires you to hire the best people in the world and i think it's difficult to execute on this kind of thing with the if you com compartmentalize because there has to be great collaboration there has to be a great work where there's a unified vision coordination and coordination across multiple groups there has to be i mean there is it's very difficult to do now nevertheless especially with technology this becomes easier and easier so the bar comes lower and lower to achieve mass surveillance becomes easier and easier and easier mass manipulation through platforms because we're now digitally connected you can now do that kind of manipulation so it becomes more and more realistic that you could do this kind of thing but you're saying that no intelligence first of all intelligence is hard and to do it at scale and to do it well and to do it in a way that it's also not just collecting information about the populace but manipulating the populace is very very difficult right now let me now give you an another argument why i think that besmanov was a fraud i mean i already have i have uh matrookin on my side and and my personal observation of the incompetence that that i witnessed i mean they really really didn't know what they didn't know so now basmanov was kgb where was he stationed in india he he was a low-level agent in india and i told you with the one thing that the kgb was really good was that it was compartmentalization how does bezn bismanov in india find out about this massive plan that should have been super secret right he made it up sorry yeah and and you know why he got away with it because americans eat that up because it's not our fault it's like the damn russians that don't do doing all that that bad stuff speaking of the damn russians doing all that bad stuff you know about the internet research agency they have been doing quite a bit of damage and i i'm now familiar with the world of enhanced artificial persons these are the avatars on facebook and twitter and you know so forth that look like real people and and and there are quite a few of them and and i have a good friend who operates in in that realm and you know he he uses for instance facial recognition when he uh thinks that there's a suspicious character say on linkedin or or on facebook and very often he finds out yeah that that person exists but it's not the person who it pretends to be so basically detecting the artificial yes the enhanced artificial yes but but he can also make them you think the united stand in hand yeah the united states doesn't do it we do it too but well this is to push back against your pushback right yeah bezel might be a fraud but is it possible especially in the modern age that there is these kind of large-scale systematic operator wouldn't you as a government more so that's investing billions of dollars into military equipment in in a world that's more and more clearly going to be defined by cyber war versus hot war right wouldn't you start to have serious meetings large amounts of hires that are working at how do we manipulate the information flow how do we manipulate the minds of the populace how do we sell them a narrative so even though he might have been making up a story because people eat it up could it speak to some deep truth that's actually different than the the truth you came up in as a kgb agent oh i agree with you 100 is much easier when you know all you need is is an army of nerds who also know that's no fantastic that's a term of endearment yes i love nerds i used to be one myself but anyway i was a nerd so you know so what i was going to say here is all you need is an army of nerds and and what but also experts in the culture of the target country okay and and nowadays the world is different there's a whole lot more fluidity there's a whole lot of more people that like say russians for instance study in the united states chinese an army of chinese studying in the united states they they have a lot more knowledge of how we function than the kgb did and it's vice versa not as many americans in in russia but we have some but in the the chinese and the russians have an advantage here okay ask your question based on your experience so i have been talking to a lot of powerful people and some of which have very close connections to in this particular conflict ukraine and russia but in other places as well i don't believe i've ever been contacted by or interacted with an intelligence agency cia fsb mi6 assad i don't think i have well let me say explicitly i haven't had an official conversation which is what i assume i would have because i have nothing to hide right so i think there's no reason for people to be secretive but what i why why is that what i know am i interesting at all how how are people determined if they're in person of interest or not and i guess the question i mean some of it i asked in a bit of a humorous way but also perhaps there's truth in some of the humors would i know if i have ever interacted with the intelligence agency spy well you you don't know that you haven't been contacted but you but certainly not i think you you never had a conversation that related to intelligence in any way shape or form right right like where a person another person introduced yeah and just themselves or you know becomes sort of wants to be your friend and then talks about these types of topics right yeah but i [laughter] there's people because because of who i'm interacting with they're i mean even just even with elon musk like if you think about elon musk there's a lot of people that are that are part of the conversations that happen how do i know they're all trustworthy they all present themselves as trustworthy now again i have nothing so this is this is for the intelligence agencies i have nothing to hide i am the same person privately as publicly well-intentioned real no no controlled no weird sexual stuff where you can manipulate me what else no drug use no drug use no no skeletons in the closet none of that kind of stuff but you know i don't i don't know i mean just even having these conversations you know i tend to trust people as a default like me too and you start when you think well especially with some of the people i've been talking with and some of the traveling i'm doing i'm realizing there's a you know there's hard men in this world there's military there's serious suffering and there's war and there's serious people that are doing serious harm and so you have to be careful of thinking who to trust was when the person approaches you with a smile and asks you a question my my natural inclination is that person is a cool person i'll answer the question become a friend but it becomes difficult when you realize that there's there's things like intelligence agencies with thousands of employees there's people that are doing major military actions that involve tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of soldiers this is serious stuff and so how do i how do you know how to operate in this world the folks that you're interacting with have a responsibility not to tell you what they shouldn't tell you right right so and most of them probably won't and and i'm guessing occasionally they will say well i can't go there right yeah so so what what what you are aware of is sort of public and what you're doing is you you you're collecting it and you you editing it to some extent you're not you're not changing the word the verbage yes you you just repeat what they say so from that angle you're not you're not privy to any real secrets what you have possibly that could be of use is you learn to get to know the person so i'm thinking there's a good possibility if you get the interviews in in the east that somebody may actually approach you and ask you what's what's your opinion i just hope they approach me and introduce themselves properly i just yeah there's a kind of i mean would you know like how many russian spies are there in the united states how many american spies are there in russia do you have a sense is it no idea just like with the gru no idea is it is it possible there is like tens of thousands and we're not or like thousands not not thousands like i used to operate we were too hard to train and we weren't that successful to begin with but particularly russians and chinese you know both governments know who is going abroad and i guarantee you there's a lot of amateur spies they they're they're being asked you know help us out you know do something for the motherland and crowdsource spying yeah sort of not not seriously training but yeah and yeah for instance this this lady i forgot her first first name boutina she was a rank amateur she used social media to communicate with moscow so she had no training but she was reasonably successful i mean she and and and i the difference between let's say the current russian intelligence and the kgb vladimir putin and his his henchmen are okay with people being caught because and every time i go and talk and give a talk someplace i'm always asked this question honey i mean how many russian spies do you think we have here because that it scares the people right and putin likes to scare people the kgb was very solicitous of of their agents they were you know they they didn't want any one of them caught all right so that's that's a big difference and you know so getting caught so for the fsb getting caught sends a strong signal to the world that there's yeah there could be many more and there probably are but and because also the world again there's a whole lot more travel going on a whole lot more interaction studying abroad doing business and you know there's there will be attempted espionage probably one every minute in this country that doesn't mean they will be successful no uh but there is a a cottage industry now that is doing quite well that teaches companies how to you know fortify themselves against like industrial espionage or also foreign actors spying it's all over the place yeah as it becomes easier and easier with digital yes with cyber yes it becomes a serious and very serious threat we might wind up in a world where nobody knows anymore what's up and what's down if i was to have a conversation with vladimir putin and or vladimir zelinski is there something you would ask about the time in the kgb the time in his past we are all of us men and women are creations of the experiences we have throughout life early on in life and through the formative experiences successes and failures so yeah you you just said the key words you know i would ask you know without giving away anything you know just being high level your biggest success and your biggest failure as a politician or in the realm of uh kgb when the wall came down and he was in in an office kgb office in the city of dresden and these germans were besieging stasi offices and they also dropped by the kgb office and they they were it was pretty threatening it looked like they won't actually storm the office and get you know the documents and stuff like that and initially then the first demonstration was um was told that if if they come any closer weapons would be used so they disappeared and then they came back and and i don't know some somebody in that office called berlin and said what are we going to do can are we allowed to use force and the answer came back that gorbachev said absolutely not and so this is where putin all of a sudden you know he was at one point a member of the greatest the most powerful intelligence organization in the world and all of a sudden he was powerless and he had to watch how you know this this was a defeat big one and and it's a supposedly a powerful intelligence agency cowering yeah sort of crawling back into a position of weakness and he probably promised himself never again russia needs to be great again the kgb fsb russia the russian empire needs to rise again and that there's a feeling for him that that's as he talks about the collapse of the soviet union being a great tragedy there's a feeling like that was that was like never again yeah and and i believe that he has a he has a strong conviction that i don't know if he's religious he carries across now but i don't know what that means but and somehow but that it's the destiny of the russian nation to be great and that that is sort of that that's whether there's it's it's determined by god or some some higher power that that is very important for him of course that nationalist idea is one that americans share as well and you know it could help a nation flourish so by itself it's not necessarily a bad thing oh it's how it manifests itself as a question well one other thing is if i were to get a chat with the ukrainian president i would ask him how many lives what what what what is the equation between giving up some land and how many lives are worth this land and that's a it's a good way to phrase the question of course that question gets you killed in ukraine but because there's another part of that equation which is it's not just land versus lives it's the sovereignty the the knowledge that you're free and yourself determined and like it's not about like fighting for the particular land it's saying we are messed up corrupt we have problems it's a messy world but it's our world i think stephen crane has a poem about like a man eating his own heart and he was asked how does it taste and he said it's bitter but i like it because it is bitter and because it is my heart and that there's a sense of like i want this is not just about land this is our nation the same love of nation that putin has for russia the greater russia this vision of this great empire i believe ukraine does as well there not every nate you know there's levels to this game and ukrainian people are some of the proudest people throughout the history of the 20th century throughout the history of earth the polish people are proud people you could just see in world war ii the people who said fuck you you're not having this we will die to the last man though there's different cultures that kind of really hold their ground and ukrainian people are that you know i have to admit in that respect i'm a i'm a bit of a coward i could not do what zielinski has been doing i would sort of try try to find a way to carve out something that i can live with however if if that force that evil force ghost gets to my family right there's lines yes that's that's right you're you become the world's bravest man as somebody across that line oh yeah you mentioned something about you've not been to moscow back and that you it might not be safe for you to travel there yes can you speak to the nature of that you know as somebody somebody that successfully got out of the kgb how are you still alive a number of reasons first of all when my story became public that was six years ago i was pretty old right and so the folks that may have a personal interest or may have had a personal interest in doing me harm most of them don't live anymore all right that's number one number two i did not i wasn't a hired hand a german i did not betray the motherland that's a crime that just punished by death you betray the motherland that's and and and the other thing is if there is a you know that these kinds of operations to assassination on a in another country are very difficult to plan and implement and if there's a list of people that they don't like i may not be at the very top having said that you know if i wind up saying moscow or even in countries like turkey where there's a lot of lawlessness you know accidents can easily be arranged and that's just sending another message you know just like you know we we we can do a lot of things powerful yes do you think it's safe for me to travel in russia and ukraine i think you you know very well how to communicate in both countries you know you've shown this in this interaction that uh you have a lot of empathy for the people you'll be talking with and empathy means good understanding where they're coming from and then there are lines that you can't cross yeah like the question that i was going to ask zelinski who not going to ask good for you yeah isn't that the funny thing about this world there's lines there's lines everywhere even in love even in personal relationships there's lines you should not cross yeah how did you finally get caught i resigned in 1988. so let's actually talk about that there's a okay resigned there's there's warning signs there's another yet another choice yet another crossroads yes okay what was the calculation what was the choice to be made to give a little background and it was it was 1988 and i was i thought they would my my time in the us would soon end because you know i thought 10 to 12 years it was already past 10 years there was no indication that they that they indicated you know that they said you know you know we're done you're done but in december of 1988 i got this one one thing that i never wanted to see so we had a system of signals that either one of those diplomat agents could set at a spot that i passed by every day or i could set where they would pass by like on their way from where they live to the united nations for instance who would just drive so and and mine was my the signal spot for me was on a on a support beam for the elevated atrian and in queens and it was morning in december that i walked by there and routinely look at it and i never expected anything and there was this red dot it was about the size of my fist with a you know red paint and you know since you have done it already i can i think i can curse in this moment because it's the only way i can really indicate how i felt i said oh shit because that was the danger signal yes there was like you must you are in severe danger of and you you need to get out of the country as soon as possible there was a a protocol that i was supposed to follow i wasn't even supposed to go home i just needed to was supposed to get my my reserve documents that i had hidden in a park in in the bronx and made make a beeline to to the canadian border i wasn't ready so i just like ignored this thing i mean i did i couldn't ignore it but i went on to work got on the a train get went to work and then went to my cubicle and stared at the computer screen all day because i couldn't think i could think only about what to do what to do what to do the reason for this indecisiveness was that i was a father at the time i was my my little girl by the name of chelsea was' months old and i was there when she was born i took her to tour the home i watched her grow up i watched her take the first steps and always look at me with these big eyes lovingly look at me and that is when i started my re-entry into the human race because i just fell in love with this girl that's when love came back and it was completely unexpected and there's a lot of fathers who understand you particularly fathers of girls who understand what happened there and i still thought i need to go back because you know there was there was probably some danger but i hadn't figured out how to take care of the girl you know and leave her but you know maybe she need to she need to have a good life and grow up and and have a chance and her mother had a she was from south america she had a fourth grade education that would have not worked very well so i played for time i obviously i could be sick i couldn't you know i could be in a hospital there was a precedent where i was sick where i couldn't communicate for about three weeks so i just did nothing that was on a monday on a thursday was my regular shortwave transmission i listened and they explained a little in in in a few sentences we have reason to believe that the fbi is on your case you need to execute the emergency procedure come home right away i still had some time because the radio could be broken or the transmission was bad or he still could be in a hospital right so i gave myself some more time and then something happened where they forced my hand it's the only time that the soviet agent was anywhere near me on the territory of the united states so i'm waiting for the a train on a on a dark morning still in in queens and there's this man the short man in a black trench coat comes up to me from my right and he whispers into my ears you gotta come back or else you're dead i can't imitate the russian accent there was a russian accent so now and it was a pretty strong accent the you're dead phrase can have two meanings and an american would have said or else you're busted or else you get arrested or else you're dead it's very strong so now you have to have to take it seriously to some degree because i know that they didn't they had a history of assassinating or at least trying to assassinate the factor so that that obviously raised the the stakes a little bit but i i just talked myself into believing this was just a bad phrasing and but at this point i knew and they knew that we both knew right so there was no more guessing he he found me he talked to me i know so now i had to act so in in the next radiogram i was asked for to execute a dead drop operation where they would give me money and a passport and that was in a park in on staten island it was a location that i found and i described and and i was always praised for my my ability to describe spots that are easy to find so that what that was a given so and the only thing that was different in this for this operation they they scheduled it for the dark all right so but it was still no problem because it was in a park and then a couple of about 100 yards in by next to a a fallen tree it would be hard to miss so i go to staten island and i read the signal that said i put the container in the drop that that was the protocol there's a signal that the person who who hands over with something puts at a spot not too far from the spot itself that means i would go in and just pick it up the reason i actually went to pick up this container because there was money in it so i didn't have to make a decision yet okay i could throw away the passport i it was like i was still trying to figure out what to do what to do what to do so i get to the spot i get to the tree and i had a flashlight with me that the park there was nowhere in the park and it was even during the day though this park was not it was more almost like a little forest and i don't see the container it wasn't supposed to be a crushed oil can pretty sizable nothing hard to miss and i do a double take and i look again and i look around and look around a little more see if they misplaced it i can't find it that's the only one that one of those operations failed and that just doesn't make a lot of sense so when as i'm walking away from this like sort of emotionally i said to myself i'm staying yeah that decision kind of signals some kind of muse just spoke to you that decision was made for me now you know that i'm a christian now and i think that was like god told me this you know but it was certain there it was right there that was it that was it that was it and so what i did uh to well first of all i divine into intervention helped me to find find a good explanation i sent him my last letter and with secret writing i communicated to them i said i wish i could come but i can't because i have contracted hiv aids that was the best lie ever because nobody wanted to have aids in their country those days it was a death sentence right yes and i knew i had we had conversations when i was back in moscow how they were snickering about what's going on in the united states you know that that depraved culture and you see when they they're killing each other and the debrief culture took you took over your being and yes no and and and i was and i was convincing enough i'd even traced it back to a girlfriend i had once that i had actually reported on that she you know i interacted with this lady who had a boyfriend at one point who was a drug addict and she was infected and she infected me so they believed it they sent and i asked him to give my my dollar savings to my german family they gave them some but they they told they told my family that i already passed away that i'm dead they believed it 100 and i guess the agent who took the money took half of it for himself so that was it and in the next three months i made sure that i wasn't reliably at the same spot in the same time frame so i went to work in different paths at different times just to you know you know just doing this safety measure so to speak and not not not huge but you know i did it it kept me kept my allowed me to keep my sanity and and obviously after i sent the letter i threw the shortwave radio in the hudson river destroyed the one-time pads that i still had so i was now ready to for a new life for a new life and live out my life as an american undiscovered but you know starting to work on my version of the american dream and the first action was was telling my wife the mother of this child you know she always wanted to have a house and say you know what we should buy a house and a year later we moved into the suburbs and then i said we should have another child and we had another child so and i had a career where i did pretty well i moved a couple of times wound up in a mech mansion but before that my second house was actually in pennsylvania in rural pennsylvania and this is where i was discovered by the fbi and how did they know about me i if if it if it hadn't been for this defector vasily mitrokin who was an archivist in in the kgb archives he was actually pretty high level he was in charge of the relocation of the archive from lu lubyanka to yasinovo and he really hated the he had reason to believe he hated the soviet system i think i remember that his son was quite ill and he could have gotten treatment in england and he was not allowed to to travel to england with his son so he his hatred he tried to figure out what to do and how to do damage to that system so he started copying notes little little slips of paper handwritten that he smuggled out in his underwear and in socks over the years and then he transcribed them with the typewriter and then put the pieces of paper and into some kind of a container and and and and buried this in his stature it was i believe in 1992 when he showed up that was already the the soviet union was gone so he showed up at the u.s embassy in moscow and told him what he had and it was on a weekend and apparently there was a junior person in charge and he said you know what what you got we're not interested in it's really old that's a career limiting move right because then vasily mitrokin then made its way to one of the baltic republics and contacted mi six and they said come on in old fellow have a cup of tea and so they they managed to get this stuff out of the dacha and and get it to england and eventually the mi6 shared it with the fbi and there wasn't a whole lot of information about me it was very very little it was like there's an a person by the name of jack barsky who isn't illegal operating in the northeast of the united states now if it was jim miller they wouldn't have found me jack barsky was easy to find so they checked social security and jack barsky was had gotten his social security card at the age of 33 bingo okay the all they knew though was that i wasn't illegal that i was still living there they didn't know whether i was active inactive they and the other thing that they knew that i was a really really well-trained agent because i was still there right so they took i think almost three years to investigate me watch me from a distance because you know if i was still active i would would have found out that somebody's investigating here so you started being less and less active in terms of oh i stopped completely what i mean is oh surveillance detect remote yes after three months i stopped all together okay yeah good point and fbi is still very careful they were very careful they they pretty much watched me and then and at one point i had a house in the country with one neighbor at one point that house was for sale so the fbi bought it and they put a couple of agents there and just keep a closer eye on me there was no indication that i was still active but they were still cautious and but at one point they they were able to plant a bug in my kitchen a listening device and i my wife and i didn't get along very well you know there was a lot of friction and she was constantly complaining about things and you know i got sick and tired of it and one day we had an argument in the kitchen and then i chose to deploy the nuclear option [laughter] and that is that is telling her what i sacrificed to be with her to so she would understand that i am there on her side yeah i'm supporting her something doesn't quite fit it is not because i don't love the both of them chelsea and penelope so i when i said that the listening device was active so the fbi was hearing my confession i was once a kgb agent blah blah blah blah and and i quit because then because of and then state state here because of you and chelsea and that also made it clear to the fbi that i wasn't active anymore so they had both of that so now they knew an attempt to turn me would have been useless because you know because you know you turned somebody was active but they figured they had there was enough reason to treat me nicely because they figured that i had a lot of information that was as as aged as it was but it was still important for the fbi to get to know and so one day there was a friday evening i i'm driving back home from the office and i'm being stopped by a state state state police and as i'm going through the toll oh that it's a bridge over the hudson and they had to pay a toll and he waved me he got me right where i stopped and he said could you please move over here it's a routine traffic stop and i thought nothing of it i had forgotten at that point that i once was a spy you know it was like this was gone and and then he said no could you sleep please step out of the car that should have aroused my suspicion that's unusual right routine traffic stop yeah i did it no problem and then again somebody came from the right came on into my view and he flipped this id and they said fbi we would like to have a talk with you now this is my now friend joe riley who who actually is the he's the godfather of my of trinity my last child but anyway he told me later that when when i heard that phrase all the blood left my face it became totally white but i recovered very quickly and he said it himself so you know he they took me to a vehicle and there was an another agent in the vehicle and he had a gun strapped to his ankle so that was pretty real first question i had so am i under arrest and the answer was no and then my instinct kicked in in my ability to to operate in very well under high pressure situations and i asked them so what took you so long you know the intent of that was to to de diffuse any kind of tension yes and i saw a smile instant friends yeah i knew i knew that i had to make them like me and i'm i think by now i know i'm a pretty pretty likable person so i would say so so so and i when when they took me to a motel which they had rented there was an the two two wings at a right angle they they had one they bought all the rooms in one wing and they had a guard at each end of that wing and they took me in the middle and there were some props there some binders with labels and i immediately thought now this is pretty silly because what what i know but i noticed that the the labels all referred back to my early years i knew that they didn't know much else so i told joe that afterwards and that was not a great idea but anyway [laughter] but but i volunteered i made the following statement before we even started the the interview i said i know there's only one way for me to and my family to have a chance to get through here without much damages if i'm if i'm completely 100 cooperative and this is my intent to do exactly that all right so we spent about two hours in the interview they allowed me to call my wife tell her that i'm going to be late that that indicated to me already that they would let me go and after two hours they let me go but they had the area covered with a whole bunch of people and the head of that that team talked to me and said if you think of running we got every intersection in this area covered you can't i didn't say anything but you know i had no no thought of running so and that was the beginning of another phase of my life where i was on cooperating with the fbi for quite a while and living still undercover for several years until i had real good documentation and became an american citizen seven years ago today seven years ago so recently yeah wow quite recent the bureaucracy took a long time to figure out how to how to make me real and and also not put me in in in this witness protection program you know to keep my name and then just you know make everything like official so for instance i had to change my birth year simply because if i jack barsky was born in 1944 if i kept 1944 the fbi would have helped me commit a crime because i would have collected social security of four years or sooner so and anyway details of that yes it took quite a while and when i finally got the call from the office of homeland security since the lady says this is agent so and so uh from homeland security can you come to the office tomorrow and i said let me look at my calendar and then i said wait a minute what am i talking about what time do you want me to be there because i had waited for that moment for a long time and i was sworn in right then and there it was a good feeling to walk out of there because i had a country again you know and i love this country just as much as you said you love it with all its warts and its problems that we're going through right now and then the last thing that changed my life again and i don't want to get into details because it's a little complicated story i never wanted to be a public person and then i was discovered through a number of dots that were unlikely to be connected it had to do with a relative with with a half brother of my wife who lives in germany was taken to to germany by his mother who came to visit somebody not us but that somebody that he came to visit lived 50 miles from our house and that my my wife and and this half brother never never met in person before they knew about each other to social media and when he found out my background he he was a conductor who was a german railroad at the time he said oh this is a big story and one that's gonna be big big big okay well he happened to know this one person who happened happened to know one of the star reporters of der spiegel and after she did some research and determined that i was real she was on my case and she happened to know steve croft the guy guy from 60 minutes you see all these connections i had nothing to do with it that's how life works dots get connected somehow sometimes yeah most of us it does stuff happens you get lucky you you don't know lucky a few times in your life but yeah i think i'm must be part irish too [laughter] yeah so it's it's been it's been an interesting ride i'm just still shaking my head about all the stuff that happened oh it's been a fun one what you wrote because i'm allowed to leave behind a documented legacy of my unusual life yeah i'm praying that the legacy will be described by a single word love so let us return to the thing we started the conversation with which is love yeah what role does love play in this human condition in your life and yeah in our life here together i give you an answer by telling you what happened one day i gave a presentation at microsoft headquarters that's a strange beginning a long story but yes no that's not a love story and so there's this there's this young this beautiful young lady sitting in the back and she's she's paying a lot of attention found out later that her her job at microsoft job job title was storyteller it's soft marketing right yeah you could say that yeah but but that's if you can't afford somebody like that that's that's good anyway she questioned and answered she raised her hand and she asked me so all the things that you have done and you've experienced what's the number one lesson you've taken away from from your life that was a new question for me i've never never been asked that question and i thought about about it for 20 seconds and then i came up with this this phrase that we all know love conquers all because in my life it did in the end and and it's it's the strongest human emotion and that is what makes us human really and he spoke about the i mean offline as i've spoken with you it's it's clear to me how transformative how powerful the life of your children are your daughters in your life and who you are and why you think life is beautiful and why you think this country is beautiful now that that i'm pretty mature to put it mildly i'm i'm also more loving towards many more people you know these things like random acts of kindness for strangers i do them i'm looking for them now and you know what it's good for me well welcome to texas because this random kind acts of kindness a stranger seems to be a way of life which is one of the reasons i love it here it just reminds me why i love human beings which is that they there's just this warmth this conduction yeah and and georgia is the same thing yeah amen do you have any regrets do you yeah looking back at life do you wish you've done something different well i like i could have but i then i would have had it would have a different regret i betrayed the wife the german wife that i loved i really did love her and i betrayed her but if i don't betray her then i betray the child that is a source of so much love for you now so maybe your life is a kind of you get to choose your regrets it's a it's a little bit of a strange way of putting it but i there's no other choice and i tell you what what i don't regret and and that's that may be you probably understand it now because you have enough background about me i don't regret having lied to my mother because i had no really strong emotional relationship with her she took care of me she was proud of me but we didn't hug we didn't did we didn't interact emotionally whatsoever so you don't feel like you betrayed that i love that that well i did i know that i know that she she was looking for me until she the day she died she she wrote a letter to president gorbachev asking him for help to locate me she she checked with the stasi she just was like hell-bent on finding me and couldn't find me so she passed away without knowing what happened to me now there was this this rumor that was flying around and she possibly may have bought into that rumor because my cover for when i went to the united states was that i changed careers again and i joined a an institution in kazakhstan that did space research intercosmos something something and i had an i had a piece of paper that one that invited me to start there and that was theo it was a forgery the intercosmos didn't never existed but but people knew that in kazakhstan there were super secret in facilities so and some one of my classmates old classmates from high school started the rumor that i died in a rocket accident and everybody knew that so when i came back to germany went back to germany i found the telephone number of this girl that had dumped me i called her and i said i said also so guess who this is but maybe you hold on to your chair she says yes i said this is albrecht it's a good payback no we actually met so there's two elderly people in their 60s who meet each other after so many years and the one that ended the relationship started the conversation by saying you know what i made a really bad mistake and and the tears came down her cheeks i wasn't asking for that i wouldn't i wasn't happy about it but it did feel good now now uh a while later i knew why she said she made a mistake i met her husband yeah i mean there's this there's a town waist has a song called martha where you make or an older gentleman calls somebody he used to love and they have a conversation they're both married now and it's sometimes you can meet people from your past and it gives you a glimpse of a possible different life you could have had oh yeah and you know i was actually when she said i made a mistake and i was thinking to myself no you didn't there was none there was nothing left there was nothing left and also the person that you became personality-wise wasn't as as attractive as as i remembered her you know it's puppy love you know but it's still love yeah it was happened it was a passionate love for sure and i would have i would have thrown myself under the bus if i could save her it was that strong and just as strong as the love for my two girls yeah life is full of moments and periods like that of love and then that's what makes life so so freaking awesome but it does come to an end and so does this conversation i guess no this goes on for many more hours but yes do you think about your own death huh do you think about death do you think about your own death yes are you afraid of it yes even though i'm a christian as a christian you have a sense what's coming after or is it full of uncertainty i have a hope i have a hope you know [music] there there's a lot of there's a lot of christianity which is quite logical a lot of christianity which is also you know the life of christ there's a lot of a lot of proof but you know and i became a christian starting with a head and and and i was already quite old and i uh you know when you don't when you don't get this faith very early it's it's it's tougher to buy into everything you know there are some there's some things that are difficult for me to understand and and believe but but there's many many other things that i can't explain only with the existence of a god but whether he lets us go again for an eternity i just hope i won't convince somebody else at this point which is doesn't make me a really really good questioning because i'm supposed to evangelize but there's still a fear yeah there's a fear and a hope on the other hand i know that you see see this this is this is how i approach the the last years of my life i will not i will not mentally or physically get decrepit i will do everything i can do to be alert and fit i still run i run four or five times a week and i'm going to start lifting weights again good if you stay physically mentally sharp yes go out with guns blazing that's that's and and i once read a book written by a by a medical doctor he said most people uh when when when when they're becoming mature that the the rest of their life is a slow downward move and [music] not for you no the last years are pretty bad he said you got to do this boom that's that's pretty good advice from a doctor and if nothing else from christianity whichever parts you take on one of the big ones is love yeah and that's something you've lived from the very beginning before yes before god was part of your life before anything was part of your life it seemed that love was part of your life and has been a consistent thread throughout yes sir and uh there's there's a short sentence in in the bible it says god is love and and the other thing is i want to say that the christian morality is is i'm i can sign that with my blood okay god is love amen jack you're an incredible person have lived an incredible life thank you for talking today thank
