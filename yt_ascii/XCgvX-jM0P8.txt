then check this out [music] wait i can make a million dollars working in tech my first year according to tick tock you told me so the tech industry is booming and it's no wonder that so many people are looking to switch into tech and it's one of those things that you see there's flexibility good pay why wouldn't you want to switch into tech and according to the report by comp tia i hope i'm saying that right the tech related hiring contributed to the national growth of 400 basically over half a million jobs in u.s last year alone that's wild and another factor along that is the number of jobs increasing has not decreased the salaries tech remains an industry where anyone can look forward to a good salary if you're willing to put in the work he is willing to put in the work tech jobs such as software developers it management and systems analysts all have average salaries in the high six-figure range so all of these things considered why wouldn't tech appeal to anyone but there are some things that no one tells you about landing a job in tech some things that you might not learn until it's too late today i'm going to share with you some things that i wish i knew when i was landing a job in tech my first job and as someone who recently went through the interview process things that i still learned along the way it can be competitive and although there are so many jobs in tech i just said that and now i'm saying it can be competitive i mean it's it's kind of crazy there is still so much demand but the competition is really high as well so anything you can do to stand out will really help you imagine when companies post a job resume or a job posting and you put in your resume you are competing against hundreds if not thousands of other people and a lot of times the first person to evaluate your resume is bought based on keywords you put in based on different kind of well basically keywords but it's not even typically a real human evaluating your resume sometimes it is but it just goes to show you how crazy this industry is i know some people who actually write scripts that automate sending out their resume to any you know job postings on indeed that have certain keywords it's just bonkers but there are some tips that you can do to really stand out first go to networking events get back out there this can be in person or virtual some of the places that i go to look for virtual or in person really networking events include meetups.com eventbrite those are my two main ones and depending on where you are located this could either be in person in toronto here there are great ones that they host in person or you can attend it virtually this is a great way to really build connections because everyone is there for the same reason they want to network they want to learn about whatever the topic is and you can really connect with them right on that and this will definitely help you stand out from the crowd as far as you are showing that you're interested in these topics you are taking initiative to get out there and this goes a long way it's something that's easy to do but it really helps you stand out from the crowd having connections is so important in any industry but especially in an industry where it's so close knit although tech is a huge industry people talk and they talk a lot imagine just how much you sit and talk with your friends and then they repeat to their friends and it's like a telephone the words kind of get lost in translation and i really wanted to point that out because it's so important to really have connections because a lot of times the reality is it's who you know and i know that's kind of cringy to even say but it's so true when you are getting a role into tech the more you can network the more people you can meet the better off you will be because a lot of times someone will be like oh hey i know so and so who would be great for this role because it's one of those things that if you're applying for a technical role anyone can learn technical skills even if you're not the strongest coder strongest technical person but what employers are typically looking for are people who are willing to learn who are really nice team players who want to communicate with others and work well with others and although it sounds pretty obvious it's a huge thing that employers look for and then i always hear the thing of you can learn the tech you can learn the tech stack but learning how to be a good person and put in the work that's something that i don't think an employer can really teach you second work on side projects that you are actually passionate about and i always get asked well tiff what kind of project should i be building i don't know what i'm passionate about i'll give you a little example here when i was learning how to code and i was building my first full stack web application and it was a final project at the coding bootcamp i was at they said build whatever you want so for me what i decided to do was build a skin care app because i was really interested in skin care and thought why don't i merge the passion i have for that with my passion for technology so whether you are interested in sports fashion whatever the case may be build a project around that and a great idea to do that is see an existing project so get inspiration from an existing project and you can take that and alter it into what you want to build obviously not copying it but rather looking for inspiration through it side projects are truly one of the best ways that i was able to start off my career by standing out and i made a bunch of little side projects well one of my mistakes i did is i made quality over no quantity over quality at first and i really realized when i was first starting out in the industry way back when i feel like i need gray hair now way back when you know but truly way back when i made quantity over quality because i just was like i need to fill up my portfolio don't make that mistake do quality over quantity even if it's one or two really good projects finally consider creating an online presence for yourself blogging creating videos i know this isn't for everyone but in whatever format you are comfortable if you are willing to put yourself out there share a little bit about what you are learning and your knowledge it can really go a long way in opening up many doors for you now this isn't to say you need to become a youtuber or a social media person but even if you do a blog once a month once every two weeks about what you are learning it shows that you are really taking initiative sharing with others what you are learning tech is such an industry where we really encourage people to share what they are learning to teach other people and if you are showing that you are doing that it's another great way to to really stand out so having these kind of side hustles not only prove to employers that you are good at what you do you are knowledgeable but you do what it also does is it shows that you're willing to take leadership and innovation you're willing to put in the extra work the extra effort you're really passionate about the subject that you're learning or teaching about and it goes a long way it's someone who is a content creator and recently went through the interview process i heard from pretty much every company i was interviewing with the praise or a pot that praise isn't the right word but a positive about tiffin tech like wow you took initiative and did this on your own now i'm not saying you need to go create a platform like tiff and tech but what you do need to do is just be aware of how having a side hustle or putting yourself out there can really be a positive thing as long as you know you're putting yourself out there in a positive light okay that is much better in here where the ac is the tech industry is often glorified for its high salaries flexibility but you really need to hone in on if this is what you want to do do you want to switch careers for the right reason because this is something you're going to be committing to for a long time and if it is still something that you're really excited about and passionate about you need to hone in on your skills and experience well how do you get experienced if if i've never worked in the tech industry as i mentioned earlier side projects blogging putting yourself out there really makes a difference and helps with experience going to networking events it's one of those things so that i think a lot of times and it's our generation and younger that we want results now we know we click a button and food gets delivered we turn on tv we can watch any movie we want results now but the reality is if you want to be successful in the tech industry and grow your career you're going to need to put in the work you're going to need to put in the work of studying of preparing for interviews and when you get the job actually work i think a lot of times you see on social media these tech talkers or whatever being like i make seven figures and i work you know one hour a day and i take five hours of naps i'm not kidding you and i'm sure you can relate i have seen videos like this and like where do you work i want that job i it's very unrealistic but at the end of the day you need to put in the work and you will reap the rewards reap the rewards reap the rewards is it reap the rewards reap the benefits got paul in the background here and next up is don't take rejection personally wait what how is that even possible to not take it personally let me explain as i mentioned earlier a lot of tech is and breaking into tech it really helps when you know someone when you have those connections and it goes back to what we spoke about earlier with networking and it's one of those things when you're going through the interview process you're vibing with the interviewer it's going great you know and you go through the whole process you're like i nailed that i got this job there's no question about it only to receive a letter a few days later saying unfortunately you know we went with a different candidate and you're like what how is this even possible i have totally been there and one of the things that was uncovered later and i think this happens a lot more than we realize is it might be that the boss had a friend they wanted to hire it might be that they decided to go with someone internally there are so many factors outside of you that do not take rejection personally because a lot of the time it simply has nothing to do with you and that isn't to say this is always the case it's very important to be aware of interviewing and why you were rejected or told no at the time if possible but a lot of the time it goes back to it had nothing to do with you or your skill set it just wasn't the right fit for so many reasons that outside of what you could control and this isn't fair it sucks i know but it's the world we live in and it goes back to the importance of networking and building those relationships and something that might actually be a bit controversial and i probably would have disagreed with early on in my career is to pick a boss not a company and you're like why tiff i want to pick google i want to pick facebook amazon whatever great as long as you're going to have a good boss or manager so why is this so important one second here what i have learned is if you have a good boss or manager they will really take your career to the next level if you are at a great company but have a terrible boss or manager the problem is they can either be holding you back or just don't really care or pay attention to you and in turn your career can suffer if you have someone that you can look up to and that supports you in your career journey it makes a huge difference in how fast you grow in your career and alongside a boss make sure you are aware of what the company culture is like before you start do they work you know 15 hours a day do they work saturdays and sundays okay maybe not that extreme but you get what i'm saying ensure you are really aware of what the company culture entails before you sign on to anything because the worst thing you can do is take a new role think it's a great company and then end up really hating your life and in turn not putting your best work forward and it goes back to how it affects your career tech jobs are looking more and more impressive to people or people really wanting to get into the industry i would say every day and it's becoming more in demand so although there are so many more so much more people getting into the industry the demand is also there the flip side of that it can often seem quite glorified or you know as i'm going back to the salaries making a million dollars your first year and and having these unrealistic expectations as long as you are aware of that and go in with an open mind willing to learn and grow you're going to do amazing things in this industry these are just some things to really look out for and be prepared for that no one really wants to talk about i
