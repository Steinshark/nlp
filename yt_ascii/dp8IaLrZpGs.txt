now i'm covered in wine. - congratulations, mrbeast, whoa! - i appreciate it, boys. all right, do you guys mind? i wanna watch the next meme review. it just came out. hey, would you buy any chance have five million pieces of popcorn? - i don't think we have
five million. no, sir. - what do we do? - big buckets. - yeah, can i have a
bucket of popcorn then? - all right, it's gonna be 9.40, man. - well, then i also want
a bucket of popcorn. - two buckets.

- three buckets. - and give the viking a little one, 'cause he's-
- i'll take a small. - yeah, he's kind of tiny. - i'll take a small. - so this is what we got. i don't think this is working guys. i think we need to find a different place than a movie theater to get
five million pieces of popcorn for our five millionth subscriber. i bought five million pieces of popcorn. load 'em up boys. this is a perfectly drawn map of america. this is where we're located at. this is where our five
millionth subscriber is. as you remember, i gained
2,000 subscribers at one time. oh, we're almost, five
million subscribers! so i just picked a random person
out of those 2,000 people. and he's based in illinois. so we have about 11 and a half hours left until we arrive at our five
millionth subscriber's place. we've been driving, it's late at night, but thank goodness we got the golden state warrior game to keep us entertained, right garrett? - si senor! wait.
- you're pitch black. so we drove all night. it's now the morning, we drove all night long. we're gonna take a nap
at a hotel real quick. and then after our power nap, we're gonna deliver
the five million pieces of popcorn to my five
millionth subscriber, which literally lives right over there. but we don't wanna film the video while the whole crew is really tired 'cause then it wouldn't
turn out that great. so power nap time. - wow, they were really tired. - hello. - hey, what's up, brad? it's me, beast.
- hey, what's up, man? - yeah, hey, we're on
our way to your place. yea, so we'll be there

paul logan, paul logan, paul logan, paul logan. only intelligent people stop at 50,000. - i would not recommend it for anybody. it was possibly the worst

tie it again in illinois. - we already did a video on this. and as you remember, it
didn't work in illinois. it didn't work in any state. wait, why is it working now? are you saying our video was a lie? - they ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine. you're not really fine. - boom, right there. - what's in the truck. what's in the truck? what's in the truck? what's in the truck? - oh! popcorn. - yeah. - five million pieces of popcorn. - fresh for you, man. - do i get to keep this? - yeah, if you want it. - yeah, absolutely.
