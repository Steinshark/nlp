already in 2019 i've been blown away a few times at the shear value for money on some of these phones we've had devices from oneplus on a asus quite a few more and yet none of them have impressed me as much as this guy the bread meat k20 probe this is the china version right here and inside the box it's pretty simple you get an' watt fast charger and a usb type-c cable there is also an insert that came on top and inside of that you've got a hardshell plastic case it's quite a contrast to the body of the phone speaking of which this is different to give you a bit of context this phone was nothing but a rumor until right after the announcement of the wom +7 as soon as that happened the vp of xiaomi posted this tweet implying that whilst oneplus had just released a flagship xiaomi was about to drop a flagship killer 2.0 he then tells people to hold his dragon we'll leave it at that the implication is that in exactly the same way that oneplus has referred to their phones as flagship killers by offering similar specs to much more expensive phones redmi has just pulled the same move on oneplus the k 20 pro spec wise sits somewhere in between the 1 + 7 and the 1 + 7 pro but in terms of price it even makes the base standard 1 + 7 look expensive the china model i have right here has a starting price that converts to 360 dollars so even if this ends up being 399 when we see it on the mass market there's a definite price gap so where is the compromise it's definitely not in the body of the phone the k 20 pro is surrounded by 3d curved glass and the design itself is apparently inspired by fire the wear actually looks depends massively on the lighting conditions you see it in in broad daylight it glistens in its own trippy multicolored way but move out of the light and it becomes subtler and a little bit less polarizing than it looked in the official renders i like it there is a definite illusion of depth and it doesn't look as cheap as i was worried it might not to mention that pop-up camera has led lights built into it that is a massive power move and also allows the ring on top to double as a notification led i would say it's not as use as having one on the front of your phone because it does restrict what angles you can actually see it from but nonetheless better than not having one oh yeah and the phone has a headphone jack now in a lot of ways this device is a very direct competitor to the 1 plus 7 pro and so it makes sense to review it in relation to that both have identical large 4000 milliamp hour batteries with the capability to charge at a similar rate although for some reason in the box itself it only comes with an' watt charger they're also both equipped with really good optical in display fingerprint scanners although one pluses is on average a fraction faster even the camera arrangement looks almost copy and pasted with both you have a pop up front camera and this vertical triple camera set up on the rear with one main camera one ultra wide and one telephoto lens but there is more than meets the eye for starters this phone really makes you appreciate what a great job 1 plus has done with the speed of the pop-up there's a pretty reasonable time like here when opening the one on the redmi although closing it is better in terms of selfies it's good compared to the back camera shots look a little bit washed out but it feels intentional as it's more flattering on people's faces they've added a mini panorama feature that lets you quickly tilt your phone around and capture a much wider selfie almost simulating having an ultra wide lens on the top it is super simple but super effective as for the primary cameras on the back while both are using the same of 48 megapixel sensor a combination of oneplus is larger aperture and two very different image processing algorithms does mean that for the same photo you can still get two very different results if you move to an extreme scenario the red-meat does fall behind in dynamic range but for the price they've knocked it out the park the k20 pro also has a 2 x telephoto camera and it's serviceable it just won't look great if you want to digitally zoom further than that then there's the ultra wide which has a completely different story it's got a mega field of view making even objects that are pretty close to you look distant which in this case is a good thing i was relieved when it came to video it's one of those areas where corners are often cut but in this case you can still record 4k video at up to 60 frames second and it's pretty crispy in fact just to see if you'd notice i actually recorded one of the earlier clips in this video on that phone nobert night mode is definitely on the noisy side although because this is early software it's very possible you could see an improvement the hardware is definitely more capable than the end result is indicating if you do want to see a detailed camera comparison with this phone then do subscribe i would really appreciate it now both of these devices even have a lot of the same emissions no wireless charging no ip rating and no micro sd card support the latter is a bit more of a blow to the k20 pro because in order to achieve that headline-grabbing price their base model starts with only 64 gigs internally if you're the kind of person who wants to download music and videos or keep your photos stored locally i wouldn't recommend that option i'd already used 23 gigs by the time i just installed some of the games i wanted to test it with the other thing i did notice was the phone's haptic engine is pretty mir you'll notice a stark difference between this and let's say the latest iphone but for most people this is a subtle point when it comes to display the k20 pro checks quite a few boxes it is completely uninterrupted across the front of the phone it's fairly bright and is punchy thanks to amoled tech as a cherry on top it also supports hardware dc dimming which for some people when your phone's displays on lower levels of brightness it can help to reduce eye fatigue however it's not really comparable to the 1 plus 7 pro in terms of resolution refresh rate all that phone's ability to support hdr 10 plus content and falls much closer to the 7 but it's easy to forget that that in itself is an achievement the redmi k20 pro is so good in so many ways that a lot of the time it doesn't even register how cheap it is and for me that is exactly what a flagship killer should be it's using gorilla glass 5 so not the absolute latest and greatest but up there with the likes of oneplus worth noting is the audio is a little muffled compared to some of its dual speaker counterparts in fact a lot of those phones use the earpiece just to handle higher frequencies and so because this phone doesn't do that it's overall pitch is a little lower but the volume is equivalent because it does have a really large sound chamber the phone is powerful in many regions this will be the cheapest snapdragon 855 smartphone money can buy and it combines that with an 8 layered cooling system and the thermals on this phone are really good this right here is the heat map after having been used heavily for 45 minutes the k 20 pro pulls nearly 370 thousand points on m22 so yeah that should tell you most of what you need to know about performance but in case it needs it clarifying yes it's really snappy the software me why 10 is no match for this kind of hardware every animation feels fast and uninterrupted and i really like the visual overhaul compared to me why 9 i said this before but the navigation gestures here are some of the easiest and the most intuitive and it's great to see that the phones android q at beta build has already been released all right so i'm not a huge fan of all the marketing gimmicks associated with the k 20 pro but that doesn't change the fact that this phone really is a life hack it is far cheaper than the competition and there is very little to show for it if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you you
