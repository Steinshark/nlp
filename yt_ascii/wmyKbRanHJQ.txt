okay there are eight things we need to talk about regarding the galaxy s ten some good some not so good but together they paint a pretty clear picture of what this phone is going to end up being number one the s10 will almost definitely be powered by samsung's new xc90 820 which is an eight nanometer chips so in terms of efficiency is a little step up from last year's ten nanometer but at the same time isn't as exciting as the seven nanometer alternatives from huawei apple and qualcomm on the bright side the graphics processing unit is close to a forty percent improvement from last generation so if gaming is a priority then this is one good option the chip also has one other eye graphing feature as well as a neural processing unit to handle ai tasks it has the capability to record 8k video at 30 frames per second i don't think this will make it to the final phone because to capture 8k footage you need a 33 megapixel sensor and as it is pretty much no one has an 8k display to even be able to appreciate the improvement over 4k but this extra camera headroom can be used to improve the quality of 4k video to allow super slow motion at 1080p and the simultaneous capture of more frames when taking photos which can translate to better dynamic range number two is universal flash storage 3.0 which is the new storage speed standard that has 2 times the bandwidth of last gen so get ready for this transfer speeds of 23 gigabits per second you'll feel this through faster installation times improved general responsiveness as well as higher quality video recording because when you're recording high-res video faster storage means that more data can be saved per second number 3 the galaxy s 10 will almost definitely run their new one ui on top of android pi and one ui for the most part looks like a great improvement menus have been made more intuitive and it tries to make handling larger screen phones more comfortable but i do think samsung is treading a bit of a line here i think these icons look cleaner and i'm glad they're moving away from that weird space-age look they've had for a couple of years but the replacements are a little at risk of looking generic they look pretty similar to 25% of icon packs you can find scrolling through the play store and just having a look at the comments on that post the majority of people seem to prefer the old ones what do you think one other interesting feature of one ui is that many elements of it will be tailored to the color of the phone being used and this leads us on to the next point the s10 will be a more colorful offering than before and something hasn't dropped any specifics about this but dj ko who is head of the company has told us to expect big changes and out their most recent developers conference they showed us some of the ui colors they have planned while i doubt that samsung inadvertently revealed their whole s10 lineup like this silver green black blue and pink are all pretty plausible colors and the company might just also make some of these as gradient finishes also on a bit of a side note these videos take ages to put together so if you are enjoying it it would mean a lot to me if you could smash that subscribe button down below number five a triple rear camera setup which means that as well as all the other camera improvements we're gonna see just because of that new chip we should also be getting a wide-angle lens which has been one of my favorite things about the huawei mate 20 pros so consider me excited also a night mode is long overdue on samsung phones but at the same time has the potential to be amazing samsung's variable aperture setup already takes pretty good low-light shots without this feature you could say better than the pixel 3 when you're not using a night mode and so with it who knows it could even leapfrog of that phone number 6 the infinity o display now at this developer conference as well as all the ui stuff samsung gave us a peek at the displays they've been working on there's infinity u infinity v and infinity oh based on the shapes of the cutouts and then new infinity which is just all screen if i'm honest i don't know what they were thinking with infinity v it looks awful but infinity o is looking very likely for the s 10 while they've shown coincides with the supposed punch hole display described by evan blass he's got a pretty good track record i don't think it looks great from the renders but i reckon it'll look better in person this camera dot isn't as intrusive as a not for sure but at the same time i think the people who didn't like the knotch because of its asymmetry on exactly gonna be best pleased with this in terms of camera position i actually prefer the camera on the left in the middle and functionally this positioning means that when you're playing games your thumb won't cover it so it'll kind of look like you have a full screen display and this is where it's worth making a bit of a distinction there should be full galaxy s 10 models an s 10 light s 10 s 10 plus and then an s 10 plus 5 g and this infinity o is probably what we'll see on the top three for the light something might just stick with bezels leather done so far on their flagships then we've got the ultrasonic in display fingerprint scanner and we've talked about this in past videos but with the tweet from blass there is no more weight to the rumor than ever to be honest i'm not that first about it it's not something i'm super excited for but if it does come through it should be quite a big step above what we've seen on the oneplus 60 compared to an optical scanner that takes a 2d snapshot an ultrasonic scanner can create a 3d image of your print and is unaffected by surrounding light we also talked about 5g as likely in the top-tier s 10 but interestingly 5g is not a feature that is built into the latest exynos chip which means that if samsung did want to have this feature on their top phone they might have to jump ship to qualcomm which normally saved for the us market or alternatively it might mean that the 5g model is only coming to the u.s. we'll have to wait and see so what do you think the phone are you guys excited for it or is there a foreigner you're looking forward to more in 2019 let me know in the comments below as always thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr. he's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
