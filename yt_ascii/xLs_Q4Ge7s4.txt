comfort edge design that feels great to use even during those long creative roasting sessions without further adieu let's hop right into it first up is vera vrinik this is disgusting as someone that has a lot of mess on their desk most of the time i find this disturbing that we've got the cable management on the floor phones yeah why are there so many phones what are you a drug dealer no there's there's so many okay how many phones are there there's at least four phones okay hold on hold on a second hold on hold on i'm working on it i'm working on it and hence this looks like an old note or do you remember that old people spec samsung that was even bigger than the note so that's an impressive power bar does it have individual like plug that is way more common in europe oh no there's so many why are there so many why are there there's even more phones ah i think this may be a phone repair side hustle setup see there's some half assembled half disassembled phones and what looks like a work light the thing i never understand about these is like whenever if my system's a mess like my table is disgusting if i'm going to take a picture of it i'm going to take five seconds to like remove the dirty kleenexes that are behind his monitor not to mention the clean wipes which are definitely for repairing devices i honestly don't see what's wrong with this one wait do you sit on the floor oh that can't be is that what i'm looking at here floor actual gang this is a coffee table alex oh that would hurt i was going to say that i kind of like this one like especially the fact that they have like you know what looks like pretty good audio gear on yeah right there got the rgb speakers you got whatever this 70s 80s amplification gear is over here that's all pretty cool do we have specs it said it was only 300 cad you know what it's not about the car you drive it's about how you drive it okay i don't know if i'd go with a vasecchi ssd that's the one thing you don't eff around with cheap storage but other than that hey i like it we're moving to summerhouse idk what you are saying in canada what am i looking at this is a cupboard this is not one but two stacked lawn chairs you needed your chair a half inch higher but you didn't have a small piece of two by four to put under the like i don't even know what the better solution to this would be i like it two chairs your keyboard is hanging off the side of your cupboard and your mouse is literally operating on not one not two but three fabric surfaces here every time i open one of these i'm afraid of what i'm gonna see deus metorium oh rockin the fake plant wall got the custom fo neon sign with your name i don't know how to feel about the having your name on your setup as someone who has my name all over basically everything that i own i feel like i can't judge too hard i do avoid it at home though i guess the question is are they like a twitch streamer where it would be like good to have but then that's not even in the thing yeah it's not you're literally just like yeah i'm at my cellar and i got my gamer name here shining down on me i'm basking in its glow it's cringe that is a king-tier footrest wow can i please have a foot rest and while we're at it cable management like this i'll forgive you for your stupid gamer tag that is on a weird plant wall if you send me one of these foot rests mac mini m1 as daily oh pc for streaming and gaming got it what the hell is this this has never been cleaned it's not even difficult either like that's within arm's reach and clean your mouse pad ew yeah god what a lazy setup yeah you could literally just take your mouse pad put it on the floor and the next day it will be fine you don't even have to do that go get a microfiber cloth or something just get it wet and wipe it down with the grain and it'll be way cleaner than that same with the mac mini yeah why is your computer like covered in fingerprints what are you doing to it clean up just do it celeron laptop type beat also got a low spec court you do machine at home but no pics of it this is the entire set i see you had your potato handy to take the picture okay this might be very trendy linus i went to a show last night and there were some like cool looking kids and they had like old digital cameras and we're taking pictures that's super trendy now is it really i'm ahead of a trend for the first time i gave my kids my old power shot like a couple years ago i was like well this has no use to me whatsoever realistically i don't care if you beat the crap out of it their kids are so cool now yes okay wheely nerman you what how ew why would you show me this where there are spiders there are other bugs the fact that a spider made a web in here means that your disgusting ass computer had something for it to eat it also yeah it looks like it's probably a very nice case it's a kingpin yeah cpu this is a high spec machine is this this is an ek water blocks aio in here this is like a multi-thousand dollar computer with a disgusting spider web in it cayman ichida camel and cheetah apple computer m1 plate is for pizza wow this is like you got the check you got the bills two hard drives it's like a flex picture but these are one dollar bills you need to spend less money on youtuber figurines and more money on headphones that are not awful is this transparent like scotch tape holding it together what are you taking a picture with here is this this what is this are you a pad hole it's worse they're holding a wallet case a wallet case just making this a nice setup is not that much work yeah yeah i mean you've got a natural wood desk that sure it's rustic but it has potential look at all this raw potential alex and then you just like basically took your junk drawer dumped it out on the desk scattered it around a bit cleared some space put a macbook in the middle of it pulled out your awful wallet case for your phone and took this picture this seems like the kind of room where like i walk into it and like my sinuses start clogging up this seems like the kind of room where they should be too ashamed to let you walk into it if you visit they should be like yeah i know i don't have a room let's hang out in the living room all right nathaniel fife oh damn this is nice got the led strips up in here got the low resolution image uploaded okay use the microphone once in a while wow got the his and her set up with the matching ltd desk pads what am i supposed to roast here i mean you could organize your files a little bit better i also can't say i'm a huge fan of the carpet protectors going over this rug hump here it's probably not the best but are the computers inside these ventilated cabinets because that i like can you go back i think that it said that he custom made the whole thing no way [applause] custom computers are in the cabinets on the left and right complete with built-in fan sucking air through the mesh on the cabinet doors wow i like it you know what they say about how the state of your room says a lot about your mind and on in person your mind might be a little busy do you have a busy mind also i don't know why you gotta get out and say the headset's not for porn like a what made you think we were gonna go there with it and come on there's a lot going on i love this camera mount what could that possibly be attached to such that it would sit at that angle is that just a like a monopod yeah but what is it anchored to the first sentence of this tweet first sentence is i sleep on the beat what wait that's your bed that's not okay are you a dog no no no your back does not like this you must be young and it might seem okay now but that is not okay yeah please don't do that like just seriously don't get a bed specs 3600 1660 cable management is by no means great but not at its worst yeah it's fine either you watch a lot of soap operas at your computer or in fairness we see the bin right there and it's filled with other things so so what does that mean that they like to eat oreos while they enjoy i'm just saying there might be a low utilization of the tissue box i don't get any points for that i gotta say i do like the around the desk led lighting i know it's kind of an older style now but i'm into it what i am somewhat of a car enthusiast but that doesn't mean that your desk needs to be covered in car toys that doesn't explain the other garbage this is like a sticker bomb desk except these are not stickers this is actually just piles of crap it's like is there i don't know what you'd call it it's like triggering my like tryptophobia bit of cars is that a six-pack on the side yeah that's also just why is it not right yeah i was gonna say what are you gonna drink it warm oh yes you could take the duster flip her upside down is this peanut satay sauce why is that here is this fork to do with the satay sauce do you just eat it out of the bottle in fairness there could probably be a small animal on there for weeks and you wouldn't even know i hate this yeah this is my least favorite so far and that's really saying something this looks pretty nice love your wheel set up here dude okay justifiable vr headset yep all right yeah there's a wheel here for sim racing fair enough i don't appreciate the mic between the monitors what is this mic between monitors trend what is happening here we spent years the poor monitor manufacturers out there do you know how much engineering they've put into reducing the size of your bezels so your screens can be as close to each other as possible then you go you put a microphone in between them what is wrong with you wow i haven't seen one of those actually deployed at a gamer setup i think ever when i was working ncix we did sell some but i'd never seen one out in the wild it is is is this your it's probably just their room they probably have a shared bathroom they have a picture of the other side of the room okay let's see the other side of the what damn it this ruined it people get beds is this mouse pad on a separate desk wait they also have a steam controller speaking of things i've never seen in the wild i hate the ergonomics of this look how much lower this desk is so you're gaming like this also that's a tiny mouse pad what is up with these tiny mouse pads high sensitivity gaming is just incorrect right like are we all on the same page about this yeah why do people not sleep in beds alex i don't know i really like beds well here's a bed oh good job college dorm room setup this is looking kind of sick actually i love this by the way actually printing out memes and posting them on your wall i love it that is some that is some next level art also rocking the ltt store water bottle got the ramen bowl at the desk triple monitor setup dang where's the pc under the bed oh i think you're right that might not be just for cooling but shout out this amazing bed spread are those your dogs that is so cool it's almost even more fun if they aren't this is looking like a pretty cool setup yeah okay you're really embracing that 90s living room vibe i feel like we need to look for a bong this has oh this has big bong energy yeah i think we can agree that the comfort of a couch is inversely proportional to the ugliness of a couch in many situations and if that's true then we can assume that this is one of the world's most comfortable couches what this is a beautiful cave it looks like it looks like it's designed to hide poo stains i do not like the microwave the fact that you cannot get off your ass and go to the kitchen to microwave a hot pocket there's a 30 90 in that what okay just back up for a second you missed a big one what what is happening is this not a pcie extension with a separate fan card propped up on what appear to be prescription inhaler cartridges with a back plate heat sink just like what thermal taped onto it and a desk fan attached to that oh my god also there's a sloppy drive tell me racing is the only thing you use your computer for without telling me racing is the only thing you use your computer for the thing that kills me most about this one is that there absolutely is room for these monitors to not be overlapping you just you move this one to the left your keyboard is already aligned that way just move it to the left a little well but it's pretty clear they have it set up for the sim rig so they just have the one it is too high up but like whatever yeah it's a little too high this is easily removable this is like eight screws to pull this thing off the top it's not like you're using the space under it just put this cable on the ground with the rest of your cables okay inca 1200 you're up wow me oh i'm wowed oh boy the thing is i never want to dunk on someone for being poor you gotta make the best use of what you've got but those rubbermaid containers are expensive for the price of that rubbermaid container you could get an old used door and a few two by fours and screw the thing together i don't think this is acceptable also there's a mouse pad here and your mouse is on what appears to be some kind of xbox branded box this is not a chair also like people give furniture away for free all the time yeah just go on facebook marketplace search free get yourself a desk in a chair please wow high-end rig 2060 and an rtx 3060 why do you have two all right what am i even looking at here holy crap it's a samsung tablet yet another thing that i know must sell otherwise costco wouldn't carry it but i've never seen anybody use sylvania now that's a name i've not heard in a long time with the nest well tell me there's a light gun there's a light gun are you playing some duck hunt what am i looking at back here super into zombicide what is zombicide we got a board game enthusiast here i love the collection here's my parallax virtual multi-screen setup i set up in my dorm room two months ago parallax you mean you have eye tracking and it and it moves or what makes it parallax also this looks awful where's your mouse go what is what dude i'm so confused are there humans that are not like me that have very different length arms yeah and well i mean yeah but are they this common i guess is the real question is this a sideways laptop wait this is one of those pictures where we really do need the thousand words you know that's a pretty cool setup the wood walls is a choice i wasn't i wasn't gonna go after the wood walls too hard maybe they were already like that i mean these appear to be like drop ceiling style tiles yeah is this like a storage unit or something what is this i was trying to be nice they bought the merch you know you don't want to be rude to the customers but why is your center channel behind your monitor you're it's on an arm it's that's not even ergonomically good for you to have your neck down like that but also like who cares they're probably just using their headphones all the time anyway yeah but then don't like why is it there at all then holy crap look at these specs this is a top of the line system unless you're a big liar whoa i love it oh damn daily driving the steam deck wait are you out on the porch my most common setup currently hardly use my pc what are you playing right now i am not familiar with this game but i am loving it i mean i chickened out but i've said there is no reason you shouldn't be able to use the steam deck as your only computer this is awesome is this on battery is this just a giant battery bank so you can stay out here for longer i love this setup wow that is baller as hell setups like this like man i'm jealous i do feel like these controllers are a little optimistic though you know what i mean like you don't have four friends crammed around this what do you need all these controls are they different controllers though for like different games xbox xbox elite can't quite tell maybe they are just different controllers maybe yeah ps4 switch maybe on the one hand i look at setups like this and i feel like kind of jelly you know like looks way better than my setup on the other hand i feel a little superior because i didn't spend over a thousand dollars on memories you know i feel smart it's clear that some of you guys need an upgrade and if that's you then hey massive shout out lenovo's sponsoring this video and you
