hello everyone and welcome in this video we are learning how manual transmissions work and i am here with charles thehumblemechanic.com.com is part of his name indeed thanks for having me over to the shop man yeah man thanks for coming the weird rule of charles is you have to wear a spectator wristband if you are to be in his garage but you know i'll play by the rules i don't mind i think you got to sign in and sally was happy to check in this morning so awesome the waiver seemed extreme you know you gotta dot your eyes and cross your teeth you're absolutely right so hopefully we have a manual transmission in front of us hopefully we can actually explain how it works that's the goal for today's video well we already have it in front of us so we're like we're doing 90 we're doing great all right so we're gonna start off super basic and then work our way down to the details in this transmission so the first question what is a transmission and a transmission is a link between your engine and eventually the wheels so it comes from the engine it comes to this shaft right here this is the input of the transmission the output from the engine then it goes to an output on the transmission then it is sent to a differential and then the differential sends it to your wheel so the whole idea of a transmission is that it's transmitting power from the engine eventually to the wheels and you have different gear ratios within that transmission i like when parts tell you what they do right in the name of them it is very cool transmits the transmission transmits the transmission all right so you mentioned gears and we need to have these gears inside the transmission otherwise we would really only be able to go so fast right so this is a four-speed transmission as we're looking at it it's actually a five-speed gearbox fifth gear lives up on top and it's covered you have to have the case on otherwise none of this you could see so we have it all apart for you only showing four gears so the reason why we have gears is there a trade-off between torque and speed so for example first gear you get lots of wheel torque but you don't have a very high top speed with first gear on the other hand sixth gear fifth gear whatever the top gear is for transmission you can reach a high top speed but you have a very low wheel torque so for example if your engine is turning at 6000 rpm with a three to one gear ratio the output speed is going to be 2000 rpm if we had that same engine rotating at 6000 rpm but a 0.5 to 1 gear ratio so that would be an example of like a higher gear we are turning at 12 000 rpm much much faster 12 000 is faster than 2000 for the output yes so you're trading off there you can have high torque in that lower gear ratio with the low top speed or if you're for example at that point five to one and the output is rotating at 12 000 then you're obviously cooking down that road you're at a very high speed but your wheel torque is unfortunately quite a bit lower okay so we understand why higher gears reach higher speeds but why do lower gears have higher wheel torque and so this is our demonstration here so let's say we're in first gear this is coming from the engine this is our input shaft in the transmission and it's rotating this first gear right here three to one gear ratio so the engine rotates three times the output this first gear will rotate one time and so our torque is going to be a force multiplied by a distance so in this case the force is supplied by the engine rotating right here so there's going to be our force this gear pushing this gear to rotate and then the distance is the distance from that force to the center of that driven gear so let's say we're in a different gear let's say now we're no longer connected to this gear we are connected instead to our sixth gear which has a point five to one ratio so we've got that same force that we had earlier being delivered to that sixth gear ratio but the distance to the center of that gear is very short so the torque that's getting sent to the wheels is actually smaller all right so now we're going to get into the operation of a manual transmission how it works and that of course starts with the clutch so we're going to reorient this transmission so that we can see kind of how this clutch operates what happens when you push in that third pedal that clutch pedal and so we're going to move this around so you can get a better idea of what's going on yep first we'll take out the input shaft this is what's splined to the engine then we'll remove the output shaft then we'll go ahead and turn the case up we'll reinstall the input shaft because it actually makes a little bit more sense when you see the input shaft so our engine is going to be basically right here next we'll install the clutch fork so this is what's actually moving when you're pressing the clutch pedal right so show me if for example you were to press the clutch pedal when you press that clutch pedal in you're actually pressing up against the clutch fork which moves the fork and the release bearing into the pressure plate the next piece is going to be our pressure plate now that release bearing is actually pressing on these fingers right here it installs this way and as you can see someone was playing johnny race car and smoked the pressure plate so that pressure plate you're going to be pressing in with that release bearing that's going to force these springs to move this disc right here the steel disc back away from the clutch which we will now have go in so the clutch is going to go on like that and so by pressing on those springs this detaches away from the clutch itself which the clutch you can see is splined to that shaft so your engine is going to be rotating that input shaft of the transmission and this pressure plate by pressing on that release bearing he was showing is going to be whether or not this is sealed up against the flywheel or just rotating freely right so if we were to continue building this outward you would have your flywheel assembly and then your engine would be next in line all right so now that we know what happens when you press in and out on that clutch pedal we want to know what happens when you take that gear lever and put it into first gear so that's what we're going to show right here right so we have our input shaft again from the engine and our output shaft which will go out to the wheels these gears are in constant mesh which means they always all turn so what i'm going to do is i'm going to remove the input shaft because it's going to make it a little easier to see what's actually happening with gear engagement our first gear is down here at the bottom and then we have our synchro assembly and our synchro hub when you move that shift lever into first gear there's arms that actually hook in this little channel right here that will watch your fingers push that gear now that's going to lock the gear to the output shaft so i can hold and we can rotate these other gears freely but first gear essentially now is attached to that output shaft okay so we've seen how it goes into first gear now we're going to kind of review these gears overall and then we'll work through each of the different gears right so we'll put our input shaft back in the transmission you can see here there's a very small drive gear with a very big driven gear on first gear if we were to then shift into neutral and then into second gear we're now locking second gear to our output shaft we have a slightly bigger drive gear and a slightly smaller driven gear and so you can see that trend continue up so you've got first gear here second gear here third gear here and fourth gear here on the input side it consistently gets larger on the output side it consistently gets smaller changing the ratio right and if we had fifth gear that would be bigger here and smaller here and shifting into third and fourth basically works the same it is on a different collar so we would have third gear here and then fourth gear there and so let's remove this and then show that this is locked in fourth so there it's in fourth gear and if i rotate this output shaft you can see that fourth gear right here is forced to rotate however the rest of them can spin freely versus if we were to go down to third gear now fourth gear can rotate freely third gear is locked in and it's forced to be used but charles what about reverse all right that's a great question jason of course when we're in reverse we need all these rotating pieces to rotate backwards now of course our engine isn't going to rotate backwards so what we do is we introduce a third gear that lives on this idler shaft that will allow it to rotate backwards i'm going to drop the input shaft back in and then go ahead and put that reverse gear in so in our forward gears power comes in from the input shaft and directly rotates the output shaft now with reverse our power still comes in obviously from the input shaft but it goes to another gear so the power transfer is input shaft reverse gear a lot of times called a reverse idler then to the output shaft and that allows that shaft to rotate backwards there is a fork that'll lift this into place to engage reverse you can always tell reverse gears because they're straight cut gears and forward gears are generally helical cut for example if our input shaft is rotating you can see our output shaft is rotating one direction if we engage reverse it'll rotate back the other way okay so now we're going to review the entire process i am going to be the driver charles is going to be the transmission so i hop in my little volkswagen here i press in the clutch put it in first gear we're in first gear i start to release the clutch we're driving along now and now i shift i get the top of first in the second gear there we are barbara ambram going along going along now as i go from second to third it hits neutral on the way hits neutral on the way gets into third gear get back on the gas here we go and then i put it back into fourth gear boom now we're really flying and the volkswagen's running out of juice doesn't feel like it's got a whole lot more in it here oh fifth gear out of nowhere well charles that was some excellent shifting on your part i think that was a great review that's quite loud people have to listen to this thank you sorry thank you so much for having me i always appreciate being here and the spectator band that's a new touch but i think it's kind of classy next time pay extra for the wi-fi yeah i'll pay extra for the wi-fi next time and if you haven't yet you probably haven't before but do it again go check out the humble mechanic i'll put a little link for his channel he's an awesome dude he likes volkswagens i think this is out of volkswagen huh this is out of my 98 gti vr6 turbo that is getting rebuilt to install that limited slip differential right there which i'm super jazzed about sorry super pumped about so in order to replace a differential and the clutch he took apart the transmission yep okay glad we sorted that thank you all so much for watching any questions or comments leave them below check out that dude's channel
