hello everyone and welcome look this video is just like all the others we're looking for one thing the truth so the question is can you really make your car faster using stickers how many horsepowers de stickers really add because you know they add some horse powers but how many do they really add you know i've been a mopar guy in my whole life it's like i always say mopar no car that's why i drive across look it was a good deal now before we get into any testing i want to explain how stickers work so you've got the fast side that's the side that looks pretty and then you've got the sticky side of a sticker that's the side that's sticky well that's all there really is to know about how stickers work now we're not only gonna try out some stickers on gas cars for you electron nerds out there i see ben will be testing the theory on my tesla as well yeah i've got a tesla look i know what you're thinking sorry folks not gonna happen now i'm no idiot alright so maybe i sold my ass mm one of the baddest roadsters ever built and maybe now i drive this crosstrek so i'm definitely boring but i'm not an idiot okay i know most people's common mistakes and here's where a lot of people go wrong they just slap the sticker on and assume it's all good no no you need to put down a base layer to promote the bond between your machines and the sticker paint match tape is the only way to go you also need to make sure you're using the right stickers i see a ton of folks using stickers like these if the words like or subscribe come out of your mouth frequently and especially if they're on the side of your car talk to a doctor you've been swindled by the social medias into thinking that you're the next lebron james and here's the thing your name's blake and you're scared of turtles right back to the sticker thing you want to put down a nice base layer that perfectly matches your car's paint probably hard to see because of how well it matches trust me it's there now again you've got to be strategic with your stickers you can't just slap a nice most sticker next to a turd racing sticker they don't play nice but putting mugen next to type r you better believe that's a couple extra ponies and if you ever want to be able to get past 140 miles per hour you're gonna be nice now some folks say amateurs don't use nitrous oxide good thing i'm not an amateur i'll take one of the big ones you know what make it to i need it tonight all right let's run some tests so first up is the cross track and the first test will be without any stickers now because this car is a manual we're gonna change up the testing a little bit we're gonna do 25 to 50 miles per hour in second gear only so we're gonna eliminate the lunch eliminate any shifting keep it as simple of a test as possible to see the acceleration difference before and after applying stick again we're going to be doing all the tests in second gear so i'm going to go ahead and floor it [music] come on come on 40 come on 45 all right yeah it's embarrassing lis slow there we are 50 so 25 to 50 in second gear wow just ten point one seven seconds so these cross tracks man they're just they're just embarrassing frankly okay that was embarrassing did we learn anything no once slow always slow the crosstrek let's put some stickers on [music] here we go foot down second year 25:35 wow it feels a lot quicker 50 are you kidding me 4.6 3 seconds wow wow wow wow now this is padre but seriously unbelievable results five and a half seconds faster from 25 to 50 miles per hour is it quick no extrapolating the data out it still takes over 11 seconds to go from zero to 60 so we didn't cure the crosstrek but we did make it twice as fast and that has to count for something now i'm sure a lot of you are upset because the environment what not and look i'm a car lover to my core i don't care if your car runs on dinosaurs or light bulbs or toilet paper i'm here for you alright so we're gonna run the experiment on my tesla as well wait a minute i need that it's fine it's just your last roll close call a couple things to note about stickers on an electric car you see i'm no idiot did i buy a car that immediately took a massive depreciation hit because that's the lowered its prices months after i bought it yes so maybe i'm financially illiterate but i'm not an idiot and that's how i know stickers on an electric car is a bad idea and you're thinking wait a minute jacob jared jennifer whatever the it is didn't you just prove that adding stickers to your car use massive horsepower improvements yes but that was with a combustion core not an electric car electric cars hate combustion cars i even tried adding oil to mine once and i will not make that mistake again so what do electric cars like magnets how do magnets work jazz magnets work by causing the flux of electron spin to align based on the probability amplitude of a wave function theorized by quantum mechanics and the coronary period of the cenozoic era for you dummies out there electric magnet good electric sticker bad now there are always exceptions to the rule and i found one with this sticker right here and you can probably guess why you know people say it all the time in fact investors say it constantly tesla is the appleby's of cars i never understood this expression people keep telling me the great thing about applebee's is that it just works it's intuitive its innovative and everyone else wants to be just like them and again to be honest i wish they'd stop innovating i feel like the riblet basket went downhill years ago so i don't know about all that stuff but i have heard that applebee's products can't get viruses and in the year 2020 that seems pretty ideal applebee's and 64 grams of protein for just $300 more all right let's put all of this to the test so let's see how the old ride does without any magnets all right here we go 60 yeah okay so that was 7.11 seconds which seems a little slow wow 7.11 seconds that is not acceptable still way faster than mine ah stop crosstrek but we can do way better now maybe you're thinking jason don't you need a base layer for the magnets like you did with the crosstrek oh yeah pickle magnets need to be as close to the surface as possible so their flux can penetrate to the system's core now look i've done the arithmetic all right that's why i picked up a stage 3 plus kit all right these don't come by easy you got to be advanced you got to know what you're doing with magnets if you're gonna mess with a stage 3 plus kit i strongly caution you if you haven't touched magnets before you really want to start out with a kit for beginners not something like this we're looking for a thousand horsepower here right massive gains double what this thing comes from the factory width because we're trying to cut this to 0 to 60 in half let's get to it oh gee that's gotta be worth something ooh if it sounds too good to be true it probably is there that's something that actually works tomater that's the kind of thinking that's gonna make you lose horsepower now like i said i did the math and so here's where we've landed things universally accepted to be exceptional sports players fast and furious cat memes everyone loves everything on the back of this bumper and it's gonna bring us to a thousand horsepower now look i could have stopped there i'm dangerous that's why i'm gonna underline the most important word and you know what an underline means on a tesla we're ready let's run the test oh yes things are gonna be a little bit different i suspect all right plaid mode do me proud wow oh my goodness 3.37 seconds all right plaid mode magnets man three point three seven seconds the data does not lie now i know what you're thinking you're thinking look jamie joshua joe why is it so hard to remember your name regardless this is all nonsense the results are fake and honestly i don't know how to convince you that i'm being truthful let me leave you with this guy did people believe galileo when he said the earth was at the center of the universe no he was the only one but he was right did everyone buy an einstein's theory of relativity no but he was right did people believe flat earthers when they said the world was flat well no because it's not my point is that history will show with this experiment i was ahead of my time you can't believe everything you see on the internet but you can trust me i'm an engineer i mean not really but i play one on the internet now hear my warning playing with stickers and especially magnets is extremely dangerous it should be left to the professionals whose pigment cells of their hair follicles are beginning to die i'm talking about gray hair all right do i have a lot of gray hair sure like anyone over the age of 55 i don't see why it's a big deal if you have any questions or comments for once in your life for once in your life just try using google it's pathetic honestly thank you all so much for watching stay safe [music]
