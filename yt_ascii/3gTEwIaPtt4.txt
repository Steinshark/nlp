when people visit singapore for the first time and make youtube videos about it they often mention how they can't chew gum there which inevitably leads to corrective youtube comments saying that chewing gum is legal but selling gum is not good stuff but one thing that caught my attention recently was learning that 30 to 40 percent of singapore's water supply is recycled wastewater a percentage that will grow to 55 percent in the near future so singaporeans drink their own albeit recycled wastewater that's interesting how did that happen new water is a brand of recycled wastewater first introduced to the water supply in 2003 by singapore's public utilities board or pub obviously all water is recycled via the earth's water cycle but you might react a little viscerally when you ponder about where that water in a bottle might have been just a few weeks ago so yeah the interesting thing to me was how pub got widespread acceptance of their new water in this brief video let us drink in a bit about singapore's new water initiative but first i want to remind you about the newsletter check out the newsletter to read the entire scripts for previously released videos including those you might not have seen before the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out once every week maybe two alright back to the show our modern municipal sewage systems first emerged in the'00s has a public health measure maybe the most famous is london's heavy industrialization and urbanization were contaminating the water supply leading to big cholera outbreaks in'32'49 and'55. then we had the bad as it sounds great stink of'58 where hot weather and human waste in the river thames caused a titanic smell this smell or miasma was thought to be the cause for the aforementioned cholera outbreaks this finally prompted the london authorities to assign sir joseph william basal getty the colossally expensive task of building a modern sewage system it worked though not exactly for the reasons thought so at the time wastewater refers to water with its quality affected by human activities there is industrial wastewater discharged from industrial locations like your semiconductor fab this water is usually treated on-site per regulations before being discharged to the sewers and then there is domestic or municipal wastewater this comes from homes schools hospitals and places like malls this wastes water is mostly made up of three things one soaps and detergents two gray water from showers sinks and clothes washing and three black water from toilet flushes which yes does include human poo poo and pp for this and all other types of wastewater you treat it using one of three types of treatments physical treatment sedimentation screening filtration so on for the removal of suspended solids chemical treatment where we add chemicals to remove solids disinfect and remove phosphorus and biological treatment this is where we use microorganisms to remove biodegradable organic matter in the water to an acceptable level today all sewage is treated to a certain degree but wastewater treatment plants can put the wastewater through an assortment of stages to get that water to a certain quality a preliminary and primary stage which use a variety of physical and chemical treatments to remove suspended solids then there is a secondary treatment for removing nutrients like nitrogen such nutrient removal has become increasingly important after that we have tertiary and advanced treatment stages targeting specific items these are needed if we want to use the water for something like drinking at least half of america's water treatment plants treat water up to the secondary stage for many cities this is good enough and the water is then tossed into a natural body of water like a river or a lake this might be a bit of a waste for instance in water starved california a 2018 study found that 1407 mega gallons of treated wastewater or effluent as it is called is tossed into the ocean or used for irrigation and industry this is equivalent to some 35 percent of the state's domestic demand and we just throwing that into nature or even the ocean which i think has no shortage of water of course the very significant reason why we have this situation is the yuck factor associated with drinking recycled wastewater the key phrase that has come up again and again is toilet to tap originated by a member of miller brewing's pr staff it first appeared in a los angeles times story in 1993. the phrase goes viral all over the newspaper media miller coined it to protest at reclaimed water project in southern california's san gabriel valley at the time but this backfired on them and they withdrew the campaign the phrase bob back up again in 2000 in the san fernando valley an urbanized area in los angeles county since 1990 the area's department of water and power had been building a pipeline that would use reclaimed water to recharge the local aquifer seemingly uncontroversial the project dripped along as normal until a homeowner went to a local paper telling them that the department was poisoning the water supply the paper ran daily stories of all the horrible things that happened to people who drank reclaimed water despite already spending 55 million dollars mayor james hahn turned the project off similar stories have occurred in tampa bay florida and san diego california neighboring orange county receives 100 million gallons a day of reclaimed water none of that is used for drinking or tap gosh well that's just california right nibby crazies well so let us turn our gaze to australia to the town of toowoomba in southeastern queensland home to 95 000 people the town gets us water from three damned catchments which reach unprecedentedly low levels in the early 2000s after placing water use restrictions and demand initiatives the city council issued a policy document that mentioned a range of solutions including the construction of a potable quality recycled water factory public opposition rapidly cascaded against the initiative politicizing it six months later ten thousand people signed a petition against the water factory coining phrases like pulumba a plumber said at the time well the problem with the purifying and my biggest concern is that the impact of drinking treated sewage wastewater will have on my family and all other families and i'm concerned because there is no guarantee there is absolutely no evidence that the treated sewage wastewater is free of all contaminants in july 2006 toowoomba held a referendum on the project and 62 percent of the residents voted against it despite a serious ongoing drought the project was abandoned my point is as clear as the water itself the single biggest obstacle to recycled wastewater projects is neither technology or engineering it is community support now you might be thinking that singapore is different people trust the government or that they are compliant to its operations asian collectivist culture so on yada yada yada but the reality is that singapore holds elections and the people's action party has to win those elections to stay in power they can't just steamroll popular sentiment or they can spill an election like many other urbanized areas in the world singapore is a water-stressed city reliant on imports for a significant portion of its water supplies i already discussed singapore's water issues which intimately tie into its political relations with neighbor and frenemy malaysia in a previous video so i'll skip all that the main point is that singapore's geopolitical status pushed it to develop new sources of water or new water the systems behind new water date back to the 1960s to a product called industrial water first introduced in 1966 industrial water was a non-potable alternative source of water for industries operating on jurong island as well as the jurong tourist location they tried to build a potable water recycling factory even back then but abandoned it for cost reasons over the next few decades the government's ministry of environment continued to monitor water filtration technologies waiting for them to sufficiently mature by the time new water moved forward in 1998 new waters core reverse osmosis technologies had been used in the united states for over 20 years the singapore government first built a prototype demonstration plant in 2000 in bedok after extensive tests and training the government made its first big leap forward with three plants ultimately the vast majority of new waters blended back into the reservoirs most of the rest as destined for industrial or cooling use rather than drinking it is estimated that new water makes up just five percent of the water coming out of the tap so you can't exactly buy new water bottles what you see in the photographs are part of the public relations campaign pub's foremost issue when it came to introducing new water to the public was how to avoid a backlash like what happened in california and australia in those situations water administrations had moved forward with the project like as if normal but were caught off guard by a negative response the singapore government has made water self-sufficiency a critical policy goal they frequently talk about it it is good to have political support at the highest levels but negative responses can still arise despite particularly dire water shortages like how it was in australia people will care more about the quality of their water than its quantity pub decided to be proactive in addressing the public's psychological yuck factor the key goal in its public relations campaign was to move the public's focus away from where the water was coming from to how they were treating the water this wasn't necessarily easy boiling down complex technologies like reverse osmosis for the average layperson to understand is hard but by focusing on process rather than source they can build confidence in the quality of the output phrases in the streets times called new water systems a marvel of modern engineering a major technological breakthrough and state of the art and articles noted how california water managers were looking to adopt singapore's technologies for themselves implying that singapore has surpassed the americans in water technology in focusing on the process pub can also validate the water safety with a mountain of data during the demo period pub took twenty thousand test results in seven locations inside the plant testing for 190 physical chemical and microbiological parameters over 4 500 test results for new water found that it had surpassed who and united states epa drinking water standards this torrent of testing data helped convince policy makers and experts both foreign and local tobacco the toilet to tap debacle shows the runaway power of words with negative connotation so pub deliberately tried to reframe the context by using phrases that emphasize the water's value as a resource which of course it was so rather than saying wastewater or worse yet sewage pub communications would say used water the goal was to dispel the public's predisposed stigmas and come around to the notion that this water had value media articles flipped the toilet to tap notion again emphasizing the process and end product with phrases like good as new and pub engage both the media and the community early on one key message was that water reclamation was already being successfully practiced in countries like the united states for 20 years it was far from new so before launching new water pub brought members of the media abroad to water reclamation locations in the united states orange county in arizona for instance this led to articles written about water reclamation already being a normal part of society in the u.s documentaries aired on local television briefings were arranged with grassroots leaders and business groups in order to avoid misunderstandings interestingly singapore semiconductor industry was engaged early on semiconductor manufacturing requires a great deal of ultra pure water they had never drew reclaimed water to source their ultra pure water before but pubbed work closely with them on it helping to build a upw plant specifically for them their endorsement helped assure public opinion of new waters purity and of course the central aspect of the public messaging was the new water visitor center a new water museum for anyone interested in learning more about how new water was made this came with bottled new water for the public to sample themselves major high-level leaders appeared at the visitor center's opening another public endorsement of the water safety this geyser of engagement did its job communications work dribbles on but new water has largely been accepted as a part of singapore society there is very little that is new about new water the tech has been around for decades and the water is being blended into natural resources just like anywhere else but it was really interesting to me just how the government approached the problem of building widespread acceptance amongst a public oft sensitive about the quality of their food and water has the world's climate continues to change and urbanization continues water shortages will become a serious problem with that tossing reclaimed water into the ocean makes increasingly less sense but this can lead to more situations like what happened in california and australia overcoming this barrier is a legitimate social issue singapore's approach can help all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you
