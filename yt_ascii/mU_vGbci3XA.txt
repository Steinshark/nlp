for a while i was thinking with regards to so-called gender affirming care i'm not exactly sure even what terminology to use it's it's it's what it's surgical mutilation essentially yeah hormonal manipulation and surgical mutilation y okay should you have the right to do that to yourself as an adult yes i thought sure why not knock yourself out y but you know i'm starting to wonder about that there there's two ways you can approach that one would be well you might be able to request it but that doesn't mean the surgeons should be allowed to provide it oh sure right and i think they've actually showed their absolute inability and unwillingness to police themselves in that regard that's just clear and then it's also the case that you don't know the limits to what people are willing to do to themselves to stand out and the answer to that is there are no limits so you saw the recent case in canada i presume where we have a diaper fetishist because that's a fun class of people who's just pursuing his own thing after all who wants to have a neo vagina created somewhere down below well maintaining his penis intact and he couldn't find anyone skillful enough to perform that particular act of butchery on him in canada found someone in texas and then sued the canadian government right for paying for it right and and they that's the key and they're going to that's the key that's the key for me right so all right so at some point i'm sort of thinking no we're done with all this we're just not doing sex reassignment i don't care if you're 90 right it's it there's no surgeons that have the right to do that to another person mh so now and if is it a slippery slope argument well for me it's sort of for me it's more like i i've just had enough of this argument i saw where this went we started with this in 1960 something or rather with the first sex change operation which i think was a dubious enterprise back then and the cascading consequence of this has been like the worst medical m practice in maybe ever mhm probably not you know cuz ever is a long time and there's been some dark things done but in terms of mass assault on children it's certainly in the top too but children are different right right but but that's the thing is that you know at what point does your the perversity of your desire to go to hell in a hand basket your own particular way start to actually become in and of itself a social threat okay well well yeah but let's but let's put the kids aside because the kids are a special case right right and you got then you got the problem of you know who gets to decide the parent or the state the easiest case to resolve and find agreement on are with adults so let's ask this question is there anything that a of an of ag adult full adult competent should not be allowed to do to themselves if they're not imposing upon other people not coercing them not interfering with them not taking their stuff and my answer is nothing i can't think of anything now that does not mean that i think the state should be involved as in running the health care system i don't think they should be funding it i don't think they should be providing services i mean i we shouldn't have from my mind we shouldn't have a public healthare system but so if you take that away it's like in other words you should be allowed to go if you can find a doctor to do this strange thing that you want done to yourself and the doctor agrees of his own free will and you agree of your own free will and you're willing to pay the doctor as far as i'm concerned the fact that i think it's weird and strange and wrong and harmful i'm not the king so i don't i don't think my opinion about it has any relevance to it and that applies to gender surgery it applies to assisted suicide it applies to prostitution it applies to drugs it applies to anything because it's not my it's not my life it's their life and i don't want to impose my there's also the danger there of deciding who's going to make the judgment it's not like it's a risk-free prohib there's no prohibition that's risk-free it's just the see the problem i've having with that more and more bruce is that there's kind of no end to the number of monsters who are going to crawl out from underneath the woodwork as we've seen that's going to get worse and so you know you you say if you can find a doctor who will do that i mean i i could i would respond if i was making the contrary cases that there are things that if they were actually doctors they wouldn't do right right and so we already saw in canada i think the removal of two fingers that was a month ago could right because the person had a form of body dysmorphia and right claimed to be at suicide risk unless the fingers were removed well let's take it let's take an easier one then how about how about assisted suicide now now there are three there are three models of assisted suicide the conservative one is no can't do that it's not not moral can't outlawed no assistant suicide the the progressive version is the one we have in canada which is it's publicly funded the government provides it directs it supports it promotes it pays for it and it comes with a free rain unicorn kill yourself we'll help you and they encourage it by by by not giving you timely service on other things that you really need so that your life becomes miserable and so the best way out is to kill yourself that that's untenable okay i am not advocating that at all the third version is the government has nothing to do with it if you want to kill yourself with the help of a doctor that is your business and i might not approve but it's got nothing to do with me well that's kind of where we were before the assisted suicide law practic that's kind of where it land but the conservatives will not put up with it yeah yeah right so if if i'm in my old age and i have some kind of difficulty and i'm not having any fun anymore i want to be able to kill myself and i do not want to be under the thumb of conservatives any more than i want to be under the thumb of the woke and this is the problem that we have between these two philos opies the the the the conservatives portray themselves sometimes as virtue people i've called them that virtue people in the sense that they put virtue before freedom and there's something to be said for that so here's here's the way the argument goes in order to be truly free in your own heart or your own mind you have to be virtuous in your own heart you have to understand things you have to have discipline you have to understand the good or some notion of it you have to have faith in something in order to it's even the purpose of freedom exactly you have to have meaning so that you don't give into your base desires and your animal instincts okay but that's not about the law and the conservatives a lot of them anyway say no the law should make you behave virtuously yeah enforced virtue enforced virtue and my answer to that is enforced virtue is not virtuous it's obedience in order to be virtuous you have to decide you have to have free will to decide between dark and light and if you don't have the choice then the fact that you are made to behave in this way right so part of part of the like part of the reading of your more libertarian argument there would be i i guess part of the reason that i've often always believe that people should be allowed to go to hell in a hand basket in their own particular manner is because you're going to learn you are going to learn that's right and that's and and then you'll know absolutely and that's the libertarian version of responsibility yes right right [music]
