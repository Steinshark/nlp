- today we're gonna test
multiple different ways to stop a cannon. we're gonna try magnets. legos. a bulletproof vest. a mannequin. we put some baseballs in the cannon and we put some gloves on the people. need i say more? do you think this is the first time a baseball's ever been
fired from a cannon? - can't be. - hey, chandler. what's that? - made you look.
- whoa. the legs are standing here.
- did the glove catch it? - no way.
- i very much doubt. - did the gloves croak? - did it go through the glove? - kind of broke it.
- dude, wow. - found a baseball. - oh, wow. - oh, there it is.
- wait. - oh, there it is.
- oh, my goodness. - it's still perfect. hold on. let's see. - that is a crispy baseball. - is that what it smells like? popcorn? - it smells terrible. - is that what popcorn? - ooh, man, that smells bad. smell it. - this is legit real bulletproof glass. i'm actually curious if
it'll stop this cannon. - you don't think that
the bulletproof glass can take a cannonball? - no, it's a cannon. - but you think so? - oh, it's coming back. it's
right there. it's right there! - whoa. whoa. - yo, the bulletproof
glass beat the cannonball. dude, here's the cannonball. - so i'm confused. why didn't blackbeard just
have bulletproof glass? - i know, right? - easy. - they're watching the
slow-mo, guys. watch. - oh, damn. - oh, my god. that makes you, like, jump. it's coming right at you. - i love it. - bulletproof glass can stop a cannon, but can a bulletproof vest? let's say you become a cop one night and a guy robs a convenience store and he comes out with a cannon. is your vest gonna protect you? i will answer that. well, by me, i mean brandon. - i'm just here for the ride. - we will answer it together
'cause we're a power couple. - whoa.
- wow. - how many?
- oh, my gosh. look, we caught three. - dang.
- look at this beauty. if you had a chest made
outta steel, you'd be fine. - it's a cardinal feather. - that's a leaf. - the state bird. - that's a leaf.
- that's a leaf, dude. - just let him. let him. - you know, they only
come around once a year. - yeah, they do. eat it and i'll give
you a thousand dollars. - what'd you say? - nevermind. - guys, we're going hot. - we're going hot. i'm ready. - you ready. whoa. you are ready. - hey chandler, high five. high five. - oh, you missed it.

this biodegradable confetti. - this right here is manny and he's very self-conscious of the fact that he can't grow hair. - baldy. - it makes him- chandler. don't talk about him. he said he's self-conscious. - stop being a bully. so to make him feel better,
we're gonna take this wig, we're gonna cram it in the cannon and then we're gonna put a
lot of that black powder stuff and then we're gonna shoot it as his head. and hopefully that allows
him to feel more confident in his own skin. - you look like the dude
off of "irobot," honestly. you know will smith? - ah. - well, well, well, boys. we meet again. - going hot! - oh, going hot, guys. going hot. - oh. - look at that sexy beast. - all right, let's do it. ooh. - oh, my god.

something on the fridge? - it burned a o on it. no, an a. what? - hey, the a. - and a u - and a e. look a e. - guys, if your alphabet
magnets aren't working just shoot 'em with a cannon. here's the new game plan. this is a cannon. it's about this wide. that wide fits right there. so we're gonna slide that cannon in here. will it work, brandon? - we're doing what? - oh fuck. - we need a third. - oh, my gosh. - we need a third. - you got it. - oh. oh. - oh. - what is this, chandler? - a cannon. - and what is it inside of? - a cannon.

front row seat viewers. - fuse is lit. - oh, wow. fuse is lit. - we can't find the cannon. - yo, where did the cannon go? - oh, my goodness. - the cannon, like, disappeared. oh, you've got to be kidding me. - all the way over here. - how many yards do y'all think that is? - at least three. - i think it's three plus, uh, 25. - twenty. so 20. - dude. that is the cannon right here. and that's where we shot it out. - oh, my god. - we have 50,000 magnets,
a watermelon, and a cannon. so yeah, we're gonna see
if these 50,000 magnets can catch a cannonball mid-air. so here's big chungus, and
this is a 40 pound cannonball. i'm scared. i don't wanna break it. - and you give it to chandler? - he's already broken half the stuff. - oh, god. - the oven is ready. - all right. it's good. fire it. - i'm excited. i like cannons. - we're about to shoot the

- did we hit it? - it did not stop it. - the watermelon and the
magnets couldn't stop it. what? let's get a closer look. did you like having a
cannon ram through you? yes. the 50,000 magnets didn't
catch it outta the cannon. so maybe if i throw it slower it will. - it got one. two. - got it. - oh, jesus. - chandler, your turn. - are you sure?
