ladies and gentlemen chess is a difficult game and the learning curve to improve can be very tricky to navigate there's a lot of resources out there you don't know exactly who you're supposed to listen to and how much time you should dedicate every day to what area of study well i've got a lot of years of teaching experience both here on youtube and previously in schools and private lessons and let me tell you in this video i will be demystifying this learning process for you by showing you what is in my opinion the most important skill it's the skill that you are really neglecting and that skill is analyzing your games you may say well i do that all the time no it's truly seriously going through your games and going step by step and coming out of those games with general pieces of feedback that you can then use to improve in the future in today's video i have taken seven volunteer subscriber games they are wonderful by the way and we will be going up the rating ladder from 1100 to 2100 we're going to be covering so much space and we are going to scan the opening the middle game and the end game and i will be showing you how using stockfish after you play your games will help you in the long run improve your chests and avoid making the same mistakes over and over let's take a look at this very first game gotham sub has the white pieces opens the game with a little queen's pawn action all right kind of a queen's game but declined life is good it's a 10 minute game all right h3 is not really a move and also i get wanting to defend your pawn with the bishop by playing this the opening can be a little bit better but i'm not super mad about it both sides play in a very similar way and now white jumps into the black position and i'm just gonna kind of click through here what happened why is black completely winning what happened right so let's back up what happened i mean well compare the position right black suddenly took two pawns black is now up two pawns in the center of the board and white is completely lost black is about to come here and white's got to jump out of the way how did that happen from from a position that was relatively fine well let's check off the first box did white do anything wrong in the opening a little bit a little bit like a kind of an unnecessary h3 move the bishop should probably be out and beginners you frequently have blind spots and you leave pawns in the center to be really tense together where whereas you can just make your life significantly simpler as a newbie and just make a center pawn trade so you never accidentally blunder everything and you know what maybe in the future you will even take this pawn and then there's going to be no blunders what white did in this game was got a decent position from that from from the opening but then jumped into the opponent's position destabilizing the center and then started firing pawns forward and then did it lost that pawn so completely just blind spot right lost that pawn and a couple moves later pushed the pawn and lost this too so pawn play for this person especially in the center of the board is a massive blind spot and if you're going to play the queen spawn opening think about this you are playing d and c in the first two in the first two moves you can't lose both pawns right so that's why this person lost this game just a little bit of central pawn blindness just in general it would be good if you're gonna play with the queen's pawn not to let that tension dictate the game because you are anchored right here for the rest of the game like the pawns have to defend everything whereas if you capture in the center in the queen's pawn once or even twice if possible it'll really simplify things what happened in this game is white lost two pawns because of pawn blindness right just not thinking about you know continuity and then got the night pinned to the king because it's like a psychological thing you know you don't want to go back to where you were you would rather go back to a new square and anytime you make a move and a piece is loose you've got to think how can they put me under pressure and in this case they're putting you under severe pressure and the bishop can take this opening up an attack here yeah and black just played a great game i mean just bulldozed really and i like what white did here to try to create counter play but it was just yeah from bad to worse so why did you lose this game i mean you got crushed right you got crunched because you played a very stable solid opening but then you started implementing a totally aggressive and inaccurate game plan and you lost two central pawns and that was it that the game was over you never had a chance to be on that so moving forward what i would want this person to do if they were my student is to clarify that central tension before they start jumping forward and every single time they move upon they got to think about what changes in the position what they stop defending and just in general pay closer attention to pawns that interact but the opening was pretty good let's take a look at this game gotham sub in this game has black there's a spider on my ceiling plays the karo khan okay this time we're going 1300 c5 good stuff and gets hit with f4 f4 is a good move it's the best move in my opinion against knight c6 so white now hangs on to this pawn and if you are well prepared in your karo khan opening you know that against all of this you try to put a knight on f5 you try to fight back and then you try to break with these two black doesn't do that black doesn't do their opening successfully they're not going to win this pawn because white has c3 and then b4 and very simply also white just can offer a queen trade so now black as a result of not getting a successful opening so they didn't remember their opening like whereas in the last game the opening was fine in this game black needs to go re-review their opening now black just gets really rattled starts fighting with one piece all right that takes all right fine knight f5 bishop f2 now i kind of like this i like where we're going now both sides castle now what i would have really liked to see here from black is acknowledgment of the opposite side castling and realizing okay maybe i can't do a whole lot of damage with my pieces but let's try to break the position open yes i'm down upon but i'm getting my rooks down there and look at this back to equal despite being a pawn down because the bishops are so good this could be used as a battering ram in rook c8 opposite side castling right you've got to adapt to the situation black in this game for the remainder of this game basically played the whole game in one movers which is crazy because black is 1300 like black's got to be thinking a little bit more than in one move bishop a4 attacks the rook bishop b5 attacks the rook bishop c4 attacks the rook and loses another pawn now white starts thinking in one move g4 knight h6 when a knight is stuck on the edge of the board don't let it back into the game just play h3 that knight is a prisoner on the edge of the board instead white plays g4 and g5 don't even say just go back the knight now lives there forever i don't get your two pawns down but you maybe you'll create something over here instead of that white again black just thinking in one move and just one move and now comes back and and tries to hit the rook but the rook runs out and then a5 i mean right like totally scatterbrained white is just attacking and then black just blunders the knight like black played the move h6 and then decided i'm i'm scared of rook g2 so i'm gonna move my king here and then resigned not a good showing but why did black lose black lost this game because they did not remember how to deal with this but they let that trickle into the rest of the game they got a slightly bad position but then they just the whole game was spent one move at a time whereas they should have adapted to the position and and just hit the pause button for a second and went all right we are counseled on opposite sides what does that mean how do i maximize my pieces which of my pieces is the worst this guy open him up open him up right there's a king on the other side instead i mean bishop a4 one movers you gotta you gotta start removing that from your arsenal so i think that's really what happened here and black needs to be a little bit less rattled when they don't get the desired opening outcome because if you notice about 10 moves in a row in this game we're literally just one movers black it just completely went away from playing with a game plan so it's okay to not get the opening trust me it's okay not to get the opening on the board you still have to adapt and beat people would hikaru win this with black against the 1360 yes right like with an'00 win yes but that that that's what it takes right so next game we're gonna keep moving up the rating ladder or although i think this is right around the same yeah okay this is like a 1200 game i i got a couple of these carl khan again this one exchange variation in this game black got everything right in the opening like absolutely everything just the picturesque exchange corocon knight e2 now do you know the plans of your opening beyond this point maximize your pieces pressure your opponent's weaknesses so if i'm looking at this position i'm putting a rook on c8 i'm putting a knight on e4 maybe i'm playing a6 or a5 opening the position is probably fun okay black doesn't play exactly the right plan but then gets an excellent position queen c6 personally i would have taken maybe with the pawn and tried to play a5 but i like queen c62 and okay i would i personally would not play g6 why is the queen a problem no i don't think so it doesn't attack anything this is guarded by this and this like i mean this is guarding this this and this this is guarded by this when you play this move now your queen has to stay guarding the knight g6 is a dopamine move you play the move g6 like i gotta attack the queen and even if stockfish says it's fine i wouldn't i wouldn't play this i would probably start to fire at this queen side with my pawns in my in my rook this is okay it doesn't lose the game by any stretch of the imagination but see now look at this you're wasting time right all the way back here you got a perfect opening why are you not bringing your rooks to the game right this person got a spectacular opening fantastic book preparation on the board but not utilizing rooks or pawns at some point in this game black made many many many queen moves in a row it's the same exact position now white is getting back into the game and now white starts an attack and credit to black because black did not panic and right here black found a very nice idea the white queen is trapped opportunity falls into your hands and you capture it good idea by white sacrificing the knight to escape now king f8 is is an okay move but i gotta tell you you gotta go here i mean the most incredible thing is king f8 is evaluated a slightly higher by stockfish never run your king to the center like nine times out of ten it's the wrong decision in the long run you will make a mistake i think the king is so much safer there and the point is that your knight is safe like if they try to attack your knight you will just defend it and then you have backup and your king is just tucked away all right going to f8 might involve some problems because now your king is right there and actually the problems arise very quickly in this position black plays knight g3 and here for the first time we see a tactical mistake as black played knight g3 and simply forgot it could be captured like all of this tension here knight g3 just taken and that's a tactical thing you're gonna make one movers and someone movers are fatal knight d2 here would be lights out you would fork and win a rook and the game would be over but sometimes you play 27 good moves you play one really bad one and black is completely lost now make no mistake it is like hopeless white just takes everything but black actually keeps fighting and in an unbelievable turn of events black actually fights back to a pretty complicated rook end game and then right here just what should you play if your rook can't take the pawn you gotta this gotta go right no d2 here would have drawn the game but black unfortunately with five minutes on the clock that's not excusable right so in reality why did you lose this game actually you lost this game because of a lapse of focus in the end game not realizing that you know you you we're still in the game but if we go back why did you lose this game just literally a one move oversight and the truth is this happens if you play a game like this this is actually a net positive for your chess i would argue the loss that we just saw just like getting into this one move tunnel vision is worse for your chest long term this is gonna happen to you until you're 2000 probably even beyond that okay one movers it happens this game was great little things like not dancing your queen around in the middle game not creating unnecessary weaknesses but overall a really really good game this one was funny so this was actually i did not mean everybody to be a carl con player in this video but a lot of people submitted carl con games so this is a 1700 rated game and you'll notice that black is just doing like whatever i'm sorry white is just doing whatever against the gotham sub like why does playing the queen out and now is like like what is queen c3 queen c3 is trying to defend both of these pawns and it actually loses the game so as you go up and up to like 16 1700 your opponents if they mess around in the opening can literally lose the game that's how fatal it can be and black is winning here why is black winning because wouldn't it be nice if white could pin the queen to the king wouldn't that be great well how are we gonna do that of course we're gonna play e6 right but then black is then white is going to castle well e5 wins just the whole game whole game because if anything takes you play bishop b4 so white actually has to go here and now you are just a pawn up the queen is super cramped you overwhelm in the center you're up a pawn and it's minus three so e5 just wins the game so when you're 1700 and you know your openings well and you're facing garbage like you're like queen c3 you gotta look for refutations if not queen c3 knight e4 get aggressive try to refute them don't just play lazy chess and in this game black made a mistake of playing lazy chess what is bishop b4 now it doesn't pin the queen to the king there's nothing there right it's just a lazy move in fact you can argue the queen is in the way of the night the queen is in a bad position right now just go here and here and then start attacking but by playing this it's a dopamine move and it was made in eight seconds it's a dopamine move and by the way how long did it take again three seconds for e6 three seconds for e6 just a little bit lazy people at this level are so good they don't think about moves like e5 because they just very rarely happen right just a little bit lazy here all right so come back now black for the rest of this game played like a 1700 played really well was slightly better the way i would play this is i would probably invest in my center and try to you know blow up this three pawn structure somehow i would probably try to trade the bishops like i would do this so i can put my rooks on c and b and just just rain down on the queen side but it's a very it's a very equal position it's very close and white is a very annoying player because white just trades everything like that's just what white did against players like this you've got to be aggressive i mean you've got to go for d4 you know you gotta open up the position hit this hit this create threats against them right otherwise you're just gonna sit there and make a draw and unfortunately rookie 8 is just it's a little too passive rookie eight because it you know you want to play e5 but they're just gonna go here and and i like i mean i i really like how how black played this all right but sometimes it's just not enough sometimes like look at white white just trading everything i mean how is this fun right now you're in an end game and you try to triple stack and i already talked about this in in earlier in the video don't create unnecessary weaknesses ah that's kind of pushing it a little bit rook d2 comes in and now the queen is like dancing you're trying to find a way forward and now black is lost because you just cannot prevent rook d8 just a complete miracle white played so mediocre for 35 moves did nothing impressive and wins there are some people who play like this this is just one of those things like sometimes you play a decent game and then you just lose you just you just straight up lose the game so what was the mistake here well the mistake here was not punishing bad subpar trash approach in the opening right e5 tactical but just in general a little bit lackadaisical bishop b4 like just because it attacks the queen doesn't mean it's a good move right what you need to do when you're 1700 to win games is like every decision in the game counts you you can't just lazily like all right i'll trade the knights no problem i love how black played this all right i love how black played this but if you're playing someone who very clearly wants to trade all the pieces keep the tension as much as possible keep as much tension on the board as possible play h6 don't let their pieces get close to you even 94 you want a big center f6 take a little risk you want e5 it's okay to play f6 e5 now you have a giant center now you can play rook d8 and d4 and just tuck your king away in the corner you need to take a little risk otherwise they're gonna suck the life out of you if you play somebody that just does what this person does this is a strategy and it got this person to 1666 all right black played a great game and lost just just lost the game basically in one move because of this g6 black just didn't know what to do they should have just went in one move weakened that square and that was the square on which the game was decided it's tough like how do you learn from a game like this you just got to be a little bit more aggressive and punishing of that lazy style you know what i mean black played a great game second time in this video the first guy hung at night this guy hung a square literally all he did was he weakened f6 and he lost it happens all right it happens now i have a couple more examples these are already 1900 and 2000 so this first one i'm very frustrated by a 1900 rated subscriber has no opening at all against the french you gotta have an opening against the french defense like i advanced variation you know do something aggressive i'm always going to er on the side of aggression like milner berry gambit they can't do this because bishop b5 check okay milner barry is like i mean you have to pose problems for people in the opening in this game my dear subscriber has like almost the worst position after 10 moves i mean like yeah he gets like an okay position and then he starts like doing not not 10 moves 50 15 moves after 10 moves in the opening he was a little bit better he was like a little bit more developed and then he just went for some wild tactics hg knight g6 and when the dust settled two pieces for a rook just busted totally bad position go in a little and the reason for that is that i personally i think like you need to post problems to people at this level you cannot just exchange french and i get why you play it because it's like very annoying to face and you still got a good position so but if you're gonna play the exchange french you have to know the plans and the plan is not giving up two pieces for a rook and being losing you know what i mean like you just went for a tactic that totally didn't work now just like the last game when you get up to 17' 1900 you're so good that you're lazy chess has been easy for you you're like in the 98th percentile of players so you're the knight of four ah and then you lose because you're still not as good as you think so my personal opinion is even at 1900 we see a game where guy's not he's not doing anything crazy in the opening some of these 1300s we're more prepared than this person but at 1900 you're so solid you're not gonna make dumb mistakes this was not a dumb blunder but it was just a complete misvaluation of the position and at this level you lose games like this quickly bishop f5 bishop g6 g4 now your rook is kind of stuck now your rook is almost trapped black develops knight b6 puts the knight in the center and you get forked just knock out dead headshot leon edwards style it's over i mean literally what was this game you booted up a game and you got vaporized now personally if i gave this like if this person was my student i would make them learn a better line against the french okay like your openings need to ask questions of opponents you're not asking any questions when you play the exchange french you're just being annoying and you know i personally i find it slow down like just bring the bishop back bring the bishop back rook d1 you have a lead in development there's no need to start crazy crazy tactics especially if they don't work so this person just lost because of a complete misevaluation but in the long run i would also tell this person you need a more challenging weapon in e4 here's an example of a game of gotham sub already at 2100 a vienna a vienna where my sub did not know five the right move in this position is d3 they completely didn't didn't remember that and got a worse position but then they bounce back then their opponent didn't punish them in the most emphatic way all right they tried to like give a lot of checks and then white found a beautiful tactic bishop d6 counter-attacking the queen and trapping the knight in the corner and great c3 move and bringing the pieces back and everything was good it seemed like everything was going swimmingly all right bishop came back to f2 and white is just slightly better and white loses the game in one move so this is an example of being good enough at chess to completely forget your opening on move 5 which by the way just cannot happen cannot happen after this you got to go back and you gotta review your lines all right because this is what are we doing you don't remember d3 you have to remember d3 omposite is not the move but still good enough to get a position and then here it was just you're playing against rooks don't put your rooks where they can be you know i'm sorry don't put your pieces where rooks can bulldoze you just a tactical oversight it happens and you know just so you're aware like if this was the position oh sorry if king f8 was the position this would not win for black because you have a check and here you can also have check and then move your knight the reason why this is losing is because you cannot move either piece if you play knight g3 trying to fork you get checked first now you're just down a rook so why did white lose this game a one move oversight is there is there like any general feedback from this game not really bad things happen i mean obviously like pay attention to rooks on the file but this is useful as a 2100 in a speed game because you will not make this oversight again the next time that you want to you know fight against two rooks on an open line like this you just won't make that mistake as a 2100 hopefully but this was a one mover opening was fine not played right learn it middle game was tremendous one mover just like that other guy one mover okay and the last example i have for you is my gotham my dear gotham sub playing against an english opening at 2100 level doing our best playing what looked like natural moves knight d5 bishop g5 getting their king opened with bishop f6 and queen h6 and getting absolutely vaporized sent to the shadow realm with g4 g5 and then just forget about that whole queen side thing and and just smooshed to death smooshed to death rook f3 and my sub resigned resigned the game because they cannot stop this mate when i say levy slow down why'd you go through the game that fast so sometimes in chess it's actually good to lose games like this why i call them throwaway games this game is really good to lose because you got beaten so badly that you will never get beaten like this again my subscriber had no idea how to play against the english no idea did not understand the english opening is an opening that fights for the center via flank via these two pieces and white can either play it in a king's fiancado style or by taking the center like this seizing control of d5 and then advancing and fighting for the light square complex and look at the way this was played by by black black never fought back black never took on c3 like in this position you know if black wanted to black could take the knight and then like nothing's getting here and also just in general like if you're going to play e5 this pawn has to come here so you have to be wary of this pin and knight d5 and you learn the hard way all right you never took this knight so you put your bishop out here now your bishop is useless completely useless this is coming here and you're already losing and yeah i mean you tried your best but it's hopeless now you're gonna lose f6 you're probably gonna get mated so learn an opening against the english have an opening against the english that complements your repertoire if against the queen's pawn you play the dutch play the dutch against the english if against this you play d5 and the queen's gambit declined play that all right if against d4 you play i don't know the budapest gambit you can't do that against the english so you got to learn something against the english don't play an opening that surrenders this play queen's game but declined play in a way that what you play against queen's pawn can be played against the english or if you're gonna play this learn how to play it play the line where you try to attack counter attack the center and not let white get what they want play c65 okay losing a game like this is nice because you had no idea what you were doing in an opening in an opening that's not theoretical you can't learn crazy theory against the english i mean you can but for 98 percent of you 99 of you you have to have a game plan rather than learning the theory so have an opening against the queen's gambit or the queen's pawn that you can then play against the english a setup based opening a king's indian a grunfeld queens game of decline or if you're going to play c4 e5 which is completely unique you have to know what you're doing so hopefully in this video you kind of understood how to play some chess games and walk away from them with bullet points of what you did right and what you did wrong if your opening was wrong you have to go learn it or relearn it or realize you know nothing about it and you have to think about it like a test in school you wouldn't show up to a test in chemistry class not knowing anything right you quiz yourself before you get there with flashcards the same in chess do i know what i'm doing against the english no then don't play games all right don't oh i hope nobody plays the english against me that's a really stupid way to play chess okay i hope they don't ask this on the chemistry test what that's not how that works so that's number one number two in the middle game did i handle the middle game correctly what did i do wrong did i make the wrong trade did i dilly dally with my pieces too long did i create weaknesses did i not punish my opponent's bad opening or middle game play in the end game did i lose focus 40 50 60 moves in was my time too low did i not manage my time well was i down four minutes in a 10 minute game all these little things and you slowly start checking them off and you start climbing the rating ladder to your desired goal get out of here
