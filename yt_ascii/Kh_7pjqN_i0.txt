hi everybody my name is hendrick and today i want to talk about doing research for talks today and also some other youth useful tools which can help you along the way to your presentation so my my point here is you already have a topic you want to talk about and we already learned from tina about how to get to a topic and this is a complicated task on its own but now you have your idea and you need to do some research on it to to get the ideas of the stuff you want to talk about it more fleshed out and of course there's a lot of resources where you can look at for for doing your talk there's a lot of books blogs and articles on cpr plus reference there's a lot of other talks and written material and of course you can go through off through all of that and this makes totally sense to go through a lot of material but what my takeaway here is it is impossible to remember what is written where without note taking and writing stuff down and if you don't do that you might get confused along the way and i want to share a little bit about the system i use for that for note-taking and knowledge management because usually if you don't have a system you have something like this desk on the right here and this could be a picture of my desk in the past yeah so i like to have lots of paper lying around with stuff written on it and since doing research means reading a lot of things and taking notes this can happen pretty fast but i think notes on their own have less value if they are not organized or connected so you will never find the things you are looking for in which you need right now at the moment to for example work on a certain slide and you can easily lose yourself in unorganized notes and there are several systems for knowledge management and today i want to talk about one of them which is called a zettel custom settle custom which is the slip box and it's a method for organizing notes and the idea is that you have notes which are short and contain mostly a single piece of information and the value from this notes comes from tags like on on twitter with the hashtag and hyperlinks between these notes and with that you can organize and interconnect your knowledge and usual people have also folders like for example you have literature notes where you have a short summary of of a piece of literature like a book or a chapter or a blog post which then contains hyperlinks to notes which contain the actual knowledge from the literature and these are then the knowledge based notes where they contain then mostly one piece of information or knowledge and again hyperlinks to each other or to literature notes and something like fleeting notes where we have short-lived temporal notes with like you can write down what you need to do or where to look for new stuff to research and this stuff might be reworked or deleted later and you see here on the right hand side an analogous version of that but we have more in the digital world and i really like software which is called obsidian which is a note taking software based on markdown and it supports this settle custom method but also other methods and as well you can download it for free it has a graph view for showing you all the links it has templates and a lot of plugins and maybe i just show you a little bit how that can look like so here you might see this for example this system of notes i do from for the stuff from my personal stuff which contains a lot of different stuff about linux programming languages coordinators and you have all these interconnections here and you have notes with markdown syntax where you can put up text and code and links and tags and all of that and for me this is a really cool system to to organize knowledge here it also supports cps plus code yeah because markdown supports cpus plus code so here i did a little example of how something could look like if you're doing research for a cpas plus talk we have literature from cppreference.com which then has links to an actual note containing the knowledge about for example concepts or enable if and this is a really cool system to organize your knowledge yeah and if you're interested in doing that here are a lot of resources for the settle custom method which the first one is a youtube video which introduced me to the system and the others are more like if you're into reading yeah and now i will talk about like one or two minutes about other tools i like because writing slides can be hard as well so these are things i really really enjoy so i'm not an english native speaker so i really love the title capitalization tool so you can put up text here and it will capitalize it to the right way for english so yeah both i applied and this is from me a life saver because i don't know capitalization rules in english and also other stuff you have for highlighting code there's a slight slight code highlighter where you can get nice highlights or with carbon you can get images we have some sites for getting free image resources which is also pretty cool and if you're doing talk which also contains math there are online lattes editors and you can use might will put up the slides after the event so you can have a look there for these tools and yeah last but not least if you're already using markdown for your notes you can do also your slides and markdown if you're interested in that because markdown supports syntax highlighting and equations and one framework which i really like is called map and if you want to do something like that visual studio support visual studio code supports that and you can write really nice slides and mark down just by using markdown with a few additions and can get something like these things here on the right with a nice theme a footer a header some syntax highlighting for c plus some math and the typical lists you need for bringing down for your items and yeah and this is the end of my tool heavy lightning talk and i hope maybe some things of this can be useful for you for doing research and then materializing this research into some nice slides thank you thank you [music] hendrick that's really great i gotta look at some of those styles and tools
