between 400 and 600 dollars the smartphone market is becoming intense and in this video i've lined up pretty much all the top contenders at this price point and we're gonna see which is the ultimate battery winner including the new asus zenfone 6 which people are going crazy for okay so the phones in question are the 1 plus 7 with its three thousand seven hundred million power battery the seven pro with four thousand then the zenfone 6 with a gargantuan 5,000 milliamp hour battery followed by the pixel with three thousand seven hundred and then the xiaomi me nine with the smallest of the bunch three thousand three hundred what i've just done is set all the smart phones to an equivalent setting and now began a calibrate brightness so i pulled up the same google page and i'm using a lux ah meter to measure the luminance of each display they will look a little different in terms of brightness and color profile but that is just because of the different angle they have from the camera alright now all the smart phones are equivalently set up i've unplugged the cables and we started the test and the first application is called seascape it's just a continuous never-ending sea simulation it's pretty realistic and actually if i played this back at normal speed you'd see it chugging on the pixel three axl because you might have noticed already that is the only smartphone here which has a mid-range chip all the other phones are powered by the snapdragon 855 that is on the snapdragon 670 i've also set every phone here to 1080p resolution which in fact is the maximum resolution for everything but the oneplus 7 pro when you get it out of the box that varnish she has an automatic resolution switching mode on by default but that's a bit of an imprecise way to measure it so we've forced a 1080p resolution to keep it a level playing field having said that that phone does have a 90 hertz refresh rate which is gonna put it out a battery disadvantage compared to the other phones which were at 60 but that is what the phone comes with that is what the phone is marketed as having and that is what most people are going to use so that's what we're testing it with if you take a quick look at battery percentages the figures on top you can see that the zenfone 6 is ahead but not buy as much as you might expect it to be given its massive capacity battery the pixel is pretty much neck-and-neck with it but that might change in between the 2 1 plus phones you can see that the 7 has already overtaken the 7 pro indicating that even though that phone has a smaller battery it might still be better at supporting that phone's of rush rate and smaller display in terms of the applications i'm actually running on these phones i'm basically simulating a slightly heavier than average usage case scenario so we started things off with lighter social media tasks when our 2d gaming and we're gonna step that up to 3d gaming and then start playing around with a camera and see what that does to battery so far at least you can probably see two pax forming you've got the zenfone 6 and the pixel right at the top there's still at 85 percent ish after a whole hour and a half that's really impressive you've then got the slightly lower pack which is the one plus seven the seven pro and the sharmini nine on the right pretty much all neck-and-neck with each other now you might be wondering how on earth the pixel is managing to keep up with the zenfone after all that phone has a battery that is over 30 percent larger and yet both phones have an almost identical resolution there are two main reasons the first one being that even though the pixel is not much of a smaller phone than the others its display is noticeably smaller because it has these frankly massive bezels on the top and the bottom and so just for a point of reference if you compare the six inch display on that phone versus the 6.67 on the oneplus 7 pro that's actually a difference in area of about 15 percent that's kind of massive the second thing is the chipset so like i mentioned every other phone here is running the snapdragon 855 chip and where it gets a little bit confusing is that that is actually a more efficient chip than the one on the pixel in terms of performance per watt the a55 does miles better than the 670 the reason though that the 670 ends up improving battery life is because even though it is less efficient it is so much less powerful that it still ends up drawing less power so we're getting to the three hour mark and we're just wrapping up a massive two hour session of gaming given that every single one of these phones is doing really well so what i've done now is opened up the cameras and started recording a 4k video clip on each phone at 30 frames per second we're going to do this three times before we move on and then if i just fast-forward this bit we're going to load up those three back-to-back 4k clips into a video editing program and we're then going to hit the export button and see what that does to battery if you take a look at the battery percentages again there's been a bit of a shift since the last time we checked the xiaomi me nine has fallen firmly into lust position as i suppose you'd expect given it has the smallest capacity of the bunch on the flip side of that even though the 1 plus 7 pro has the second largest battery capacity of all these phones it's not doing too much better clearly you can see that even though we're on 1080p that 90 hertz refresh rate is having a massive impact on the phone's battery life mind you we have just passed the 4 hour mark and anything above five hours in a test like this would be very solid so hopefully they'll make it till then just so you've got a point of reference on each phone we've got wi-fi bluetooth auto rotate as well as location and nfc on pretty much everything else is off combining this with the fact that each display is on maximum or close to maximum brightness and this test should be a lower limit it should be a lower limit of what battery life to expect you wouldn't realistically get less than what we get in this test in a normal usage key scenario the first smartphone to go turns out to be the charming me 9 but we are well past the 5 hour mark so even then commendable battery life 1 plus 7 pro is on is definitely next but that's ok that's ok considering its cot and 90 hertz display and it's not a small one it hangs on for a long time at 1% i'm pretty sure at this point this is what oneplus has programmed their phones to do but eventually it does call it quits and it's a fair bit ahead of the show me the oneplus 7 the standard one is going to be the next to go and it exhibits the exact same pattern of really clinging on to that last 1% not really something to complain about i guess sure enough it's come down to the final two smartphones and what is most surprising is that the pixel 3a xl with what seems like a really mediocre 3700 milliamp hour battery is outperforming the asus and it's not even by a disputable margin alright time to fast-forward this test and take a look at the final order and the results so the first phone finish was the sharmini 9 with a final time of 5 hours and 47 minutes really happy with that that's really good battery performance and it's made more impressive because the phone is so svelte and light next up the oneplus 7 pro which lasted 20 minutes longer and yet that's not exactly proportional to how much larger its battery is but it's a fair trade-off for many people for that ultra smooth display then we've got the 7 which lasted well a half an hour longer than its pro counterpart which i can imagine for someone who is picking between those two phones makes that choice much less simple now the zenfone 6 nearly an hour longer than that this phone is in a different league all together 5,000 milliamp hour battery that's probably what you expected what you didn't expect though was that the pixel 3a xl one and not by a small margin its final time was 8 hours that is a record for any phone i've ever tested which covers pretty much all the mainline flagship phones and almost every mid tier flagship that's incredible if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is aaron this is minister who's the boss and i will catch you in the next one
