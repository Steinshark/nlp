with a super smooth 90 hertz hole-punch display quad cameras massive battery 30 watt fast charging and this killer blue gradient back all for less than $200 this is the real me 6 and it very well might just be the best phone that you can't buy today i'm running solo which is giving me plenty of time to check out the brand new range of real new phones one of which is trying to slide off the desk now yes technically if you live in the indian market for example you're probably very familiar with these but as far as me being here in the u.s. it is very very difficult to get your hands on a real meat phone which is a shame because these things are really good so take the real me6 for example in india you can pick this up for around fourteen thousand rupees which is significantly less than 200 us dollars you're going to take a step down even farther you can pick up the real me 6i which is available for something like a hundred and fifty euros it actually has a very interesting sort of finish on the back although interesting it's actually plastic which it doesn't really feel like it's pretty premium now there are certainly downsized using such a cheap phone now yes the display while it's fairly large and it does have a notch is only 720p flacking like five key guards wi-fi there's certainly some performance issues but you have to consider just how cheap this is and it isn't personally it does still have four cameras no four cameras might be a little bit ambitious considering that while it does have a 48 megapixel main camera as well as an ultra wide it has a macro lens as well as a depth sensor which means it's like 2.5 cameras as far as i'm concerned however the quality isn't terrible so this is a budget phone is very clear well the main shooter actually isn't bad i certainly wouldn't call it great but it's fine and at the price no complaints but the ultra-wide is a little bit on the soft side a nice thing to have and of course the telephoto is just a cropped in version of the standard camera however i can't we have to keep in mind just how cheap this phone is and this is the the bottom of the range as the actual real me 6 is significantly better now keep in mind this is a sub $200 phone with a 90 hertz tandy p display you know like a better display than pretty much any phone that you get last year short of like the one plus i guess this is a great example of how premium features like high refresh rate displays have already trickled down to budget phones when they haven't even hit like the iphone yet now yes this is not a amoled display it is still an lcd but besides that it has a hole punch it is fairly vibrant it gets decently bright but importantly it is incredibly smooth with that 90 hertz for fresh rate now yes you can set the phone to automatically switch between 60 and 90 to save battery life but because it has reasonably mid-range specs and a giant 43 hundred million power battery i just left on a 90 hertz than it has been absolutely no problem it is so nice to see this on such an affordable phone and of course we do have the hole punch front-facing camera which is respectable am i not be incredibly impressive but when you flip around to the back not only do we have an upgrade from the 6i with a 64 megapixel camera wait let's take a photo of the camera but i realize this is dumb let me take a photo of i mean i'll say it is a lot of megapixels it might not be the sharpest thing in the universe but you have to consider that this is a fairly affordable phone this is a slightly awkward part of the video in which i try to take a portrait selfie by myself so okay wait wait that's actually pretty good i mean you definitely missed the edge of my glasses that's actually that's not bad we also do have the ultra wide camera here but i want to try is the video mode so actually can weno up to 4k i think we can that's probably a bad idea but while we try some 4k 30h evc encoding i'll be right back so this is what the 4k video looks like straight off of the real me 6 now while it might not make you throw your iphone or galaxy in the garbage what you're getting here is something which again punches well above its weight considering the price just like these standard stills as abouts it's not bad but can we yell at me if i said that it's perfectly acceptable even though it doesn't really do a good job of staying focused but that's fine are you really flogging with your real me six probably not although i guess technically you could inside you're getting impressive specs too so it is taking advantage of a mid-range mediatek helio 390 t processor but when you compare it to something like a snapdragon 845 of two years ago you're getting very very equivalent performance and keep in mind this is again in a foam which is really quite cheap i mean honestly a lot of the specs of this phone would absolutely have been cutting edge one to two years ago and they can get it for like you know fourteen thousand rupees i definitely had to look up how much fourteen thousand rupees are but once i found out i'm like hey this is not bad i know it sounds like i really love this phone at this point but there are even more features which are really impressive so in the box it comes with a 30 watt fast charger which similar to what you get with the warp charge on the one plus side can charge this phone from 0 to 100 in less than an hour it does have well ok it has a very loud speaker but it only has a single bottom firing speaker however get so loud i mostly listen to it like 60% volume and surprise surprise it still has a headphone jack to brave new world we live in my friends although i'm not gonna lie kind of kind of nice to have the headphone jack back for example this is what these single speaker on my $1,400 galaxy z flip sounds like and this is the real me 6 [music] however you've got a few extra rupees in your pocket then you could pick up the real nice 6 pro which still comes in at only about 19 to 20,000 rupees or just about $250 now in allah does it have this very cool sort of textured back but it takes a lot of what makes the real me 6 a very impressive phone and as to it with things like a telephoto camera as well as well different specs not entirely upgrade specs but different specs inside you're getting a snapdragon 720 g which obviously here in the west snapdragon is much more common however when you actually put it side-by-side in the benchmarks it raids blows with the standard rio v6 and actually falls behind in graphics so that's really not enough of a reason for me to pick this phone up now that has pretty much all the same features so do you have the 30 what fast charging and everything like that but in addition to the telephoto camera around back you also have a secondary selfie camera which is an ultra wide-angle turn-off beauty mode so this is a standard selfie and this is the ultra wide this is actually legitimately pretty nice feature and of course we do have the telephoto option which is fine the telephoto does do a reasonable job of getting you obviously a tighter shot but the rest of the cameras are pretty much identical which means that they're fine they're just not really great i guess no yes the probe does have a very slight of the larger 6.6 as opposed to 6.5 inch display realistically it's the same resolution same 90 hertz refresh rate there's not a lot of difference between this and the standard real me6 however there's one more phone which actually legitimately is a flagship and that is the real meat x 50 pro 5g don't let the real me name fool you this is a proper flagship with the same snapdragon a 65 inside as you'll find in something like the galaxy s 20 ultra now that does it also support 5g when you look at the performance it's actually slightly better than the s 20 thanks to the vapor chamber cooling inside also quick just take a second and point out just how nice this back looks it's got this sort of like burnt orange which cut turns red under some lights it is incredibly cool-looking and which is nice because all these real me phones actually do come with a clear case in the box normally i'm like i just throw a case on who cares but these backs man all four of these phones look legitimately really cool once you kind of get them in the reflections i mean that's just it's a very different look that's for sure you also haven't upgraded ninety hertz oled panel as opposed to the ips and the real me 6 and the 6 pro and it does have an in display fingerprint sensor as opposed to the sight mounted on those phones although i kind of prefer the sight mounted cuz it's a little bit more reliable but regardless there's a lot to like here especially considering that while yes you give up the headphone jack in exchange you get a ridiculous 65 watt fast charging solution now sadly my reunion actually didn't come with the charger in the box but supposedly this phone can charge from zero to 100 in just 35 minutes so at this point you might be forgiven for asking what's the catch i mean these things seem too good to be true why exactly are they so cheap while yes you can't import them generally speaking you will pay a fair bit extra but even so it might be worth it right well they're not perfect the thing is at 600 euros the x50 pro 5 g while cheaper than something i can s 20 + or an s 20 ultra does come with some downsides that those phones simply don't have so first of all are the cameras now the camera setup is almost identical to what you'll find on the stand real me 6 pro which is fine at that 2m $50 price point but it's 600 euros that starts become just a little bit more of a bigger issue now beyond that the build of android that all of these phones ship with is android 10 which is great to see right out of the box mini phones don't even have it yet but the downside is that it is taking advantage of real media ui now it's certainly not a terrible skin of android it is fully compliant with like the google play store right out of the box but the problem is it's a little bit heavy-handed it reminds me of kind of the older school days of android and the bigger issue is bloatware so all of these phones have varying degrees of blow we're inside a lot of which you just simply can't get rid of short of doing something like routing now just like with the rest of this video i'm willing to put up with some of this stuff if the price is right when you look at something like the real musics that is something that at $200 i will put up with a lot of bloatware because i'm saving so much money with this phone i'll find somewhere around it or i'll just ignore it but it's 600 euros that's kind of the line where i'm not quite comfortable making that trade-off and that's really where i do feel like the real me 6 is the best phone out of all these options that taking a look at if you could get your hands on it for that 14 thousand rupee price it seems like an incredibly solid value if you have to pay a lot more to import it like i would here in the united states though it kind of depends is it a little bit more sure totally worth it is it a lot more or maybe something like that pixel 3a starts to look like a little bit of a stronger option which is really why this is the best phone that you probably can't buy or at least if you can buy you might not want to buy zetaclear knife conclusion probably not well anyway thank you guys very much for watching make sure to subscribe for some more quality quarantine content like this until next time i'll be looking up how much it costs to import like these
