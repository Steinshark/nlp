windows 11 is now available to the masses but what if the software you use doesn't support it what if it's buggy or what if something goes wrong with the update process and borks your whole computer don't fret because we're going to show you guys the proper process to perform the free upgrade from windows 10 to windows 11 including backing up all of your data and with the help of acronis and their cyber protect software we're going to show you how you can update temporarily with the ability to completely undo it if you don't like the results i mean what could go wrong [music] before we can even think about running windows 11 we're going to need a system to install it on so to stand in for your average home computer we've got jake's test bench it's nothing crazy 16 core ryzen 9 59 50x 32 gigs of 3600 mega transfer tridensy zeneo memory a 2080 ti and a two terabyte nvme ssd okay it's a little crazy but you know jake he doesn't settle nothing but the best for jake look the important part is that we've got some critical documents okay we've got some family photos we've got some programs on here and we don't want to lose any of it okay we've got some family photos here none of these people are my family are these just are these just talk family photos or something royalty free excellent oh oh got the nudes i love your cat [laughter] now fooling around in order to install windows 11 we need to make sure our pc supports tpm 2.0 microsoft's new hardware security requirement what is tpm well in short it's a hardware device that provides the system with a safe and dependable place to execute cryptographic functions like for disk encryption or for safe boot to check if your pc supports it microsoft has a handy little tool called the pc health check tpm 2.0 must be supported and enabled on this pc more about enabling tpm 2.0 according to this our system supports all the other requirements so it's just a matter of figuring out if and how we can enable tpm 2.0 to find out if we have support for it we could google it but we are going to just go straight into our bios by going into the recovery menu and clicking restart now under advanced startup from here we click troubleshoot advanced options ua5 firmware settings you can also just restart your pc normally and mash the delete key or whichever key it is to get into your motherboard's ui5 bios but this way you don't have to worry about missing this prompt it'll go straight in there the setting we're looking for here is called ftpm on most ryzen boards and it's usually in the advanced menu on intel platforms it's usually under advanced then trusted compute or trusted platform module and we were pretty darn sure we were going to find it here because all ryzen cpus past first gen do support tpm 2.0 and the same is true for intel platforms past 7th gen so let's go ahead and yay ah no this is for when a new cpu is installed let's go ahead and just do that window update we got our system we verified it's compatible we just go ahead and okay this is actually not a problem we just need to check for updates again oh my god it totally doesn't go away but this is exactly the kind of thing that gives people anxiety about performing a major update like this i mean even going from windows 10 to a different version of windows 10 there have been situations where people have ended up with a bricked install so they gotta put all their applications on again which is a real pain in the butt or even worse than that a complete loss of data so it is always recommended that you back up your data before performing any kind of major operating system upgrade like this one especially if it's done by a company that can't seem to synchronize pc health check results with the windows updates i mean it's not exactly confidence inspiring is it this is where acronis comes into play since the last time they did a sponsored video with us some things have changed what used to be a kronos true image their backup software is now a cronus cyber protect home office so no more paying for antivirus from one company back up from another company it's everything backups antivirus malware protection all in one right away when we jump in we're presented with the backup menu which is exactly what we're looking for the software gives you a ton of customization options you can backup the entire system a specific disk a specific folder heck you can even cryptographically certify backups kind of like a notary would certify a document in real life for our purposes we want to make a complete backup of the system so if for whatever reason we decide we want to go back to windows 10 or even migrate our install to a different machine or to a virtual machine in case we wanted to go back and grab stuff but we probably won't need it we can do that you can see here we've already set up a backup to acronis's cloud service and i'm just going to go ahead and synchronize it they include 500 gigs of storage with the advanced tier and a terabyte with the premium tier so we'll be making use of that you don't have to use the cloud storage though you can back up to an external drive a nas a separate partition on your system drive if you have extra space or all four if you want now that our disk scan is complete you can see it's synchronizing all the changes that we've made since we last backed up that's really important because if it was doing a full upload every single time you would absolutely destroy the data cap on your internet connection so this is only going to take a couple of minutes here of course if you don't want to worry about data caps or you're impatient the fastest way to back up is to an external drive that particular one is a gen 4 nvme ssd plugged into a usb 3 10 gig port so this should be pretty darn quick let's go ahead and add a backup change destination volume d and let's go to options exclusions and we do not care about backing up our steam games folder for example so we're not gonna bother with that you know what okay this is a total weird edge case but there are particular games you may actually want to back up for example with beadsaber sometimes they roll updates that break all my mods and so it's nice to have my mods and stuff all backed up exclusions can be handled in a handful of ways for example by default it doesn't backup.tmp files because they're by definition temporary and then we're going to go ahead and select our common path because realistically if something goes catastrophically wrong we will just download our games again oh acronis survival kit allows you to restore your data even if your os fails special partition that's bootable oh cool okay yes yeah i think i understand so basically it's just a bootable partition on your backup that allows you to restore your entire os without needing to reinstall it that's awesome one small bug we found is that if you create a survival kit and then try to back up right away without restarting the software it gets a little bit confused because it just created a new partition on that drive we've let acronis know and they're going to fix it though there we are now we're ready now we're not going to get too deep into the options menu here because if you're a power user there are a ton of different knobs and dials that you can twist according to your liking we're going to go with the default weekly schedule but i mean you can tell it hey upon shutdown for example run a backup super cool we're just going to go ahead and put our exclusion back in here we really do not want to wait around for that to back up and then under advanced we're going to go to backup protection and we're going to encrypt the drive because it costs us basically nothing and it means that nobody else is able to poke around in our backup where you're going to use aes 256 encryption this is wow that's a lot faster than backing up to the internet it's going at two and a half gigabit per second now that the backup's complete we can see the file on the drive and as long as we remember our password open it up and browse it so if there's anything that we wanted to grab and carry over to our new install even if we decide we are sticking with windows 11 we could absolutely do that like these nvidia display drivers for example very important i'm glad we included these unfortunately windows update is still not offering us the upgrade but that's actually good because it gives us an opportunity to show you guys the workaround if you have a tpm 2.0 and otherwise compatible system and for whatever reason you're not able to get the update through windows update just search for the windows 11 installation assistant and download that it's like imagine being the team whose job it is is to clean up the mess of the windows update team right like you create this entire tool with this entire team of people just because those other tools and that team couldn't make their tool i know i know i know i know but if you the point is if you want to have a button to say force check for it it should just be in windows update this is going to take a bit but while we wait let's talk about what happens if you don't have a tpm 2.0 enabled processor well your first option is to ignore microsoft's recommendations and install windows 11 anyway using the official iso which is available on microsoft's website you can actually bypass the requirements as long as you are doing a fresh install it's worth noting that microsoft does not support or endorse this method so you're on your own if anything goes wrong another option is you may actually be able to install an add-on physical tpm on supported motherboards this would mean that you would meet the tpm 2.0 requirement but it doesn't necessarily mean that your cpu would magically be supported so we'd recommend doing your own research here finally you can always just do nothing windows 10 is going to be supported by microsoft all the way until october 2025 so you have nearly half a decade to upgrade to a compatible system down the line or switch to linux you know like me get subscribed so you don't miss that series of videos one fun little hack see how it's going way faster now if you type delivery optimization into the start menu you can pull up this settings page where you can allow downloads from other pcs nearby not necessarily even on your local network and it'll just go like way faster and here it is windows 11. now to be clear under normal circumstances i always recommend a fresh install but the subject of the video was how to upgrade right now it's working on it yeah with the 16 core cpu don't worry windows 11 fast it should be noted microsoft does have their own backup solution built into windows it's just that it's i don't know if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all the best part is after all that we get to sit through this now what was it doing the whole time obviously the first thing you do when you get a new window set up including a big upgrade like this one is make sure you've got all the latest drivers particularly for ryzen processors amd actually released check this out today a chipset driver update that fixes a scheduler issue that was causing ryzen cpus to not have very good performance in windows 11. and we've landed we got that new sexy center start menu if you're into that sort of thing i gotta say the muscle memory is gonna kill me on this one wow it actually like has some idea what you might actually be looking for okay do you have team viewer on here because if i search for teams it'll t-e-a-m-s on my computer upstairs it'll find team viewer instead okay this is awesome yeah immediately i mean i was expecting it to work because basically windows 11 is a windows 10 update on like roids but it worked that's great now let's show this okay this is cool so if you hover over the maximize button you actually get all these different options for how you want to maximize you can be like oh i want to put it here and then maybe i'm going to put this one here and we're going to put this one here cool right but can you do like diet you can yeah i clicked the two buttons and it went to a corner okay that just changed my life oh auto hdr that's what we wanted to do okay so let's use hdr and then let's hope yeah it doesn't look like absolute poo poo the second we do that which is great auto hdr here we go nope that's definitely working in a window you can see it dimmed everything around it yep and let's just watch something that's not an hdr and it looks very normal wow okay oh this is huge when i'm duplicating my display because man i have had some situations where i'm duplicating my display for some reason and then notification comes up and it's like confidential information from like microsoft teams speaking of microsoft teams this is really dumb if you click the sign in button and then you enter your work account it just tells you your password is wrong which is not a useful error see i'll show you here we go ready that's definitely the right password your account or password is incorrect if you don't remember your password reset it now but that's not actually what you need to do what you need to do is get microsoft teams work or school that's right the integrated microsoft teams is not the other more different microsoft teams that you need for your work account so you know what then let's say i'm so angry about that that in spite of all the coolness and i'm definitely going to upgrade to windows 11. in spite of all the coolness i hate it i want to go back to windows 10. let's show that so we'll pull up our acronis cyber protect home office and let's go find our backup here let's jump over to the recovery tab entire pc recovery this action is irreversible all current data including documents and applications will be removed okay do you want me do you want me to back it up then okay yeah fine we'll back it up that way if jake needs to get any not destroyed screen cap he can do that with this install that's actually interesting i wonder how smart it's going to be like is it going to go oh this is a different os and create a completely new backup or is it going to go oh i recognize a lot of this and just do an incremental backup now it's time to head over to the recovery pane so we're going to recover our entire pc rather than just files which we could also do or partitions or disks nope entire pc and we're going to choose the version from 11 28 am and recover now this is irreversible all current data documents and applications will be removed and changed by data of the chosen backup alrighty then here we go let's restart acronis not free obviously but if you're a techie who's performing upgrades for people and stuff like that man could this ever save you a big old headache like because you never know right what if you lose power in the middle of applying an update like stuff happens even if it's not microsoft's fault we're back everything works jumping right into our right into our gaming here the rocket league executable is missing because we didn't back up our steam games you know what it doesn't matter the point is we were able to quickly and easily restore our windows 10 installation like with a couple of clicks and that takes a ton of the anxiety and guesswork out of a big move like changing your operating system so huge shout out to acronis cyber protect home office is a pretty sweet product we're gonna have it linked down below thanks for sponsoring this video thanks to you guys for watching if you enjoyed the video maybe check out the time we deliberately installed ransomware that was also sponsored by acronis and was a lot of fun
