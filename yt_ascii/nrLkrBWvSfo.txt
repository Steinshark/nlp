if you've been looking for a windows laptop or tablet there are actually quite a few systems that are now featuring qualcomm processors that's right the same company that probably made the chip that's sitting inside your android smartphone but why the heck are they putting arm architecture qualcomm chips in windows computers instead of the x86 architecture cpus from amd and intel that we're all used to is this kind of like what apple's doing with their arm based m1 chips well yes and no so as consumer-grade arm chips have become more and more capable in recent years i mean just think about how much more powerful smartphones are than they were a decade ago it's become clear that you don't necessarily need a high-powered x86 chip to handle common tasks like watching videos shopping online or working inside of an office suite so windows on arm was conceived as a way to give laptop and tablet users the full windows experience they're already familiar with but with significantly better battery life as arm chips tend to use less power than x86 ones windows on arm first appeared in 2018 so we were well into the era of smartphones as do-it-all devices by the time it showed up but it wasn't especially well received users complained that the qualcomm based systems were rather sluggish and it certainly didn't help that the first systems used the snapdragon 835 an already year-old chip that was designed more with phones in mind than laptops so while it was cool that snapdragon gave these laptops 4g connectivity basically by default that wasn't exactly a feature that made up for generally poor performance meaning they didn't get off to the rock and start that apple did another contributor is the fact that windows for arm doesn't have the advantage of a vertically integrated company behind it making the hardware and software go hand in glove together another issue was that early windows on our machines couldn't support many common windows programs natively windows itself and apps offered through the microsoft store were specifically written for arm chips but other programs had to be emulated which is to say basically they had to be translated from x86 instructions to arm instructions in real time which taxed the cpu and resulted in even worse performance making matters even worse increasingly common x64 applications so the 64-bit version of x86 wouldn't run at all as windows for arm didn't originally feature an x64 emulator but 2018 was years ago now and windows on arm is a lot better these days so what did microsoft change we'll tell you right after we thank secret lab for sponsoring this video secret lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work or play their new titan evo 2022 chair keeps you feeling comfortable for longer hours than ever with their four-way lumbar support and ultra-comfortable line of different seat materials all chairs come with up to a 5-year extended warranty and a 49-day return policy and you can head to the link in the description to check out secret lab today so microsoft's plan wasn't to just leave windows on arm running on weak hardware with poor software support qualcomm started to come out with chips like the snapdragon 8cx which was specifically designed for laptops and tablets and packed a much bigger punch than the reused phone chips microsoft then tweaked the hcx and created their own version of it called the sq1 which made its way into their surface pro tablet lineup in 2019 qualcomm then expanded the chip product line to cover more price and performance tiers and while their new lineup still hasn't caught up to intel or amd in terms of performance the newest chip set to be released at the time we shot this video had a multi-core performance score in geekbench comparable to a ryzen 5 2000 series so it's definitely nothing to excuse me sneeze at indeed reviews of more recent devices have noted snappier performance combined with multi-day battery life and we should see better compatibility with third-party apps going forward windows 11 is finally introducing support for x64 programs though the feature has notably been removed from windows 10 since windows 11 came out okay the way windows on arm handles emulation has also been streamlined with windows 11 being able to emulate portions of programs that haven't been ported over to run natively on arm so developers can actually run combinations of x86 and 64 and arm code at the same time if they have a program that isn't fully written for arm yet which is super cool microsoft has also made more developer tools available to programmers which should encourage more software studios to write for windows on arm in fact adobe has recently rolled out native windows on arm versions of photoshop and lightroom with more of the creative suite apps to follow of course windows for arm isn't a magic bullet for solving the performance versus battery life problem especially if qualcomm is the only one building chips and they have been microsoft has had an exclusivity deal with qualcomm for windows unarmed pcs bow that is reportedly ending soon meaning we could see more competition coming down the road in fact it appears the industry may be moving more toward getting chip fabricators like tsmc to directly customize off-the-rack arm designs instead of buying whatever qualcomm is offering that way other chip makers that want to get their hardware inside windows for arm systems can bring their own innovations maybe resulting in higher levels of performance and allowing windows on arm to become a true rival to apple's m series ecosystem just be prepared to shell out some money if you want the best performance you can get on a windows on arm device as these laptops sell for amounts that rival higher end x86 64 systems but with obviously less performance but better battery right i mean who needs a charger thanks for watching guys like or dislike depending on how you feel
