so hello everybody we are back with richard rowland for another universal history moment and this time we're going to go a little more a lot of people been asking what are you going to talk about american stuff american history because i understand most of us are in north america and so richard proposed that we look a little bit at the symbolism behind groundhog day this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so we're recording this it's january the 28th the feast day of scene from the syrian by the way and who we're not going to really talk about today but it is feast day and if you watch this channel then you probably you know essentially is important yeah you know he's important so it's january the 28th so this video will probably land sometime shortly after groundhog day february the second and i've been this is a a topic and a holiday that i've been fascinated by for a really long time and so i thought this would be a fun way to talk about universal history we are going to get back to talking about the grail a little bit more and maybe some other arthurian stuff in future videos but i think that this is maybe an important thing to talk about because it shows away that there is a remnant you could say like a like a ruin of a very important aspect of medieval universal history still present in our culture today in kind of this goofy way and and so i thought it would be kind of fun for people and i was super excited because i know nothing about the original ground like there's a there's a bill murray movie that is of course pretty famous which we will talk about a little bit because i think it's and this is not before we started recording i said that some book was like the greatest book ever and i was being a little facetious this is not being a little facetious i think that groundhog day with bill murray is one of the best movies ever made and i have i have reasons for that which i'm not gonna really necessarily get so much into today but as we talk about the symbolism of groundhog day you're going to be able to understand the bill murray movie maybe a lot better so let's get to it all right so the immediate the the the so because europeans won't know what groundhog day you have to start with that oh but europeans are supposed to know what groundhog okay but i okay all right go for it okay but let me let me i'll just explain what groundhog day is and how we observe it here in the usfa although they actually also do it in certain places in canada and certain places it originally comes from germany so it usually comes from western europe and there's actually even a version of it in ireland which is celebrated not on february the 2nd but on february the 1st which is the feast day of saint bridget of kildare so here's what it looks like in the united states there's this weird tradition what appears to be like kind of like a weird folk tradition that nobody really remembers the origins of and that is that on february the 2nd for some arbitrary reason on february the 2nd a groundhog in other words a marmot this is it's like a it's like a really giant fat ground squirrel i don't know how it's to describe it if you have a sequin just go google that or something in fact i was once staying in at the ozark heritage center in arkansas we went there with our family and they just had groundhogs everywhere and they were extremely friendly but basically it's like if you can imagine a squirrel without a tail or it's like a tiny little tail that's as big as most dogs they're they live on the ground yeah they live underground but they'll come out especially like if they're used to people to come out and you can feed them and stuff and they're it's it's scary though because like they're big they're big yeah they're big so the so the idea is and this this is celebrated particularly at one particular place in in pennsylvania so we have this very famous groundhog punxsutawney phil right and so the the the myth or the kind of the the folklore is that if the groundhog comes out of his holes the idea is he's been in hibernation for the last you know six weeks or so for winter so if he comes out of his hole and he sees his shadow then he'll get scared by it run back into his hole and go back into another six weeks of hibernation and that's how you know that there's going to be six more weeks of winter if he comes out of his hole and he doesn't see his shadow then it's supposed to be an early spring that year and so that's the folklore and of course in practice there's always he always sees this shadow there's always six more weeks of winter because basically we're materialists and so we make the groundhog conform to when we say winter is over rather than making winter being over conformed to when the groundhog says it's going to be over right so he always eases shadow basically he always sees the shadow yeah and so that's the thing and in the united states there there will always be like a little news story on february the 2nd affirming whether or not punxsutawney phil sees his shadow right and then has to go back in the hole so this is a really famous bill murray movie which you mentioned that was made kind of based around this concept and so in this case you have this guy a a newscaster a reporter named phil played by bill murray and he's he's kind of like most of bill murray's characters right you know very kind of world weary very acerbic kind of actually an awful person but because he's you know but but always with this sort of brilliance where they don't tell you he's an awful person they just let you pick it up in all these little ways and you start to realize man this guy's pretty terrible right and basically funny because he's terrible but funny because he's terrible right and so basically this this character this newscaster phil he he goes to sleep so he so he he has to go out and and it's on groundhog day on groundhog day is to go on a groundhog day and do this fake you know do this fake news story about the groundhog seeing his shadow and it's it's stupid it's made up he hates it he's really upset about it he treats all of the people like his producer and his camera guy and treats them all really terribly and then wakes up the next morning and finds out that he has to repeat the entire day and he has to repeat the entire day over and over and over again until basically he gets it right and in this case getting it right means he learns to be a much more selfless individual and he learns to and then he and then he wins there's some love too he wins this yeah well he learned still hey this is very important very important sounds tacky but it's very important yeah it sounds it sounds like it's corny or something like that but it's it's really important to understanding the story is that he learns to love and and then be loved by this this woman in his life who had been treating pretty badly up to that point so i mean that's it's a great fun movie and most people have probably seen it and if not like if you're just like real young and you didn't grow up watching that movie then you should go watch it because i think you'd be surprised how good it is so i want to talk about why is this a thing like of all the most arbitrary things like i used to joke that february like just really got the short end of the stick as far as months ago because it already has fewer days and then it just has like a bunch of seemingly arbitrary made up stuff going on in it like groundhog day it's like what's what's this about well groundhog day is actually the one remaining remnant within american popular culture of actually a very important holy day in the history of western europe and the history of eastern europe as well just within the christian tradition and that's a feast day in the orthodox church we call it the meeting of the lord in the temple in the western tradition it's sometimes referred to as the purification of the blessed virgin mary or more colloquially in the old english tradition it's called candleness right the reason it's called candlemas is because this is the day in the christian tradition when you traditionally you get a whole bunch of candles you either make them or you buy them and then you bring them to the church and you bring them to the church for a couple of reasons one is to give them in the middle ages you would you would give so they actually had these these groups of laypeople that would come together in a guild they were called candlemas guilds and what they would do is they would either make or buy a lot of really really big candles and then every year on candlemas they would donate the majority of these candles to the parish and it was how the parish i mean candles were pretty expensive in the middle ages illumination sometimes they were called illumination guilds like illuminating things especially most importantly illuminating the host at the at the moment of the elevation so that people could see it especially if it's kind of dark outside there's no electric lighting things like this this is a this is a really important function so it was a way for lay people to serve the community they would give the candles so that the church would have candles for the year right right but then also they would get their own candles blessed and so that so the you'd get a holy candle and you could take this holy candle home and if there was sickness in the house or there were other reasons to suspect demonic activity and i don't say that at all cynically in fact i have hold on i still have a handful of my own holy candles left over from last last year so if there's sickness in the house or some other like hint of demonic activity you light the holy candle to drive out the darkness and to drive out the demonic influences so so that's why it's very often referred to as as candlemas so the event that this feast celebrates in the life of christ is of course mary and joseph coming to the temple bringing bringing the christ child presenting an offering of two young turtle dubs and as they're doing this they're met by these two figures who kind of represent the you could say like the last of the old guard of the righteous remnant of the old testament so one of them is the elder simian and there's this whole tradition about the elders the elder simian that he's actually several hundred years old doesn't say this in the bible what it says in the bible is that he is that the lord had promised him that he would he was it just says he's of a great a of a great age and that the lord had promised him that he would not die until he had seen the lord's christ until he'd seen the messiah but there's a tradition about him that says that he's extremely old you know several several hundred years old and that in fact he's one of the original translators of the septuagint oh interesting so there's this maybe the best way to understand that is simply to say that he's got this explicit tie to the old testament right so that he's he's one of those 70 elders who translated the septuagint into greek so he's he's got this explicit tie to the old testament so he's he's you could say like the last guard uh the the last you know oh i know that technically speaking like john the baptist is sort of the last old testament prophet right but you could see simeon as as also kind of filling that role to a certain extent right he's that he's the archetypical last elder of israel right yeah that the at this point in time the faithful people of god in israel have been you know it's just a very few it's a very small remnant and of that small remnant simian is kind of you know the type of all of them yeah and he also if he's the true translator of the septuagint that he also represents something like the last breath of the old yes old testament and that will be illuminated by the candle right we'll be illuminated by christ and will be revealed like it'll be revealed for what it is or for what his purpose is yeah so that there's that and of course what does he pray he says mine eyes have seen your salvation right a light to be revealed to the gentiles yeah and the glory of your people israel so the idea is that you have something that was the light was the glory of israel which could be the torah right could be the law the old testament the hebrew scriptures and then it's revealed to the gentiles revealed to the nations sometimes it's translated but it's really gentiles right the light dawning on the gentiles right and so it's this this this light moving out of a place of darkness and obscurity into kind of a more open place right and attached to this there is the symbolism of of attached to this is the prophecy which simeon makes about to the mother of god about her own sorrow at the foot of the cross he says that this this you know child has has been you know brought into this space brought into the world for the rising and falling of many in israel and for a sign that will be spoken against of course the sign that will be spoken against is the crucifixion and he says but a sword will pierce your own heart also right and so he's talking about the sword piercing the heart of the mother of god at the moment of the crucifixion her anguish and this is like the the predominant perspective that we get in orthodox holy week is mostly from the the perspective of the mother of god watching her son in the lead up to the passion watching her son on the cross yeah and so all of this is is under it is really important to understand what's going on in this holiday and i swear it is in fact connected to groundhog day well for sure like already yeah you can see the idea of of the perpetua if you think understand theophany because often we we think of theophany as the baptism of christ but theophany and its more original symbolism had to do with light that to do with the revelation of the divine logos of the light shining onto the world which made sense after the birth of christ which is the the solstice at the at the darkest day where the the sun is hidden where the the light is still looks like it's going down you don't know yet that it's coming back that it's actually it's moving up you know right it's it's moving into its revelation and so to think of of theophany epiphany as the first glimmers of that light yeah in the beginning of the showing of of what has happened you know on christmas morning moving in now to to the the to simeon recognizing and saying now the light he even uses the image of the light which will be a sign so i mean it's very powerful yeah so we'll come back to the the light in the darkness here in just a second because that's really important to this i do want to point out though that there's also this particular feast has these this really explicit if you look at the iconography for this feast it's very explicitly tied up with the idea of the temple of the sanctuary of a holy place and of the reception of the eucharist and so if you look at an icon of the feast what you'll typically see is the mother of god handing the christ child to simeon but simeon has his hands covered with his with his robe right and if you look at something like an icon of the communion of the apostles or something like that you'll see the same kind of thing in an icon you never see people taking communion with their bare hands right they've always got their hands covered with usually with like their outer garment or the robe or something like that to receive the eucharist right and then behind them in the icons of this piece behind them there's always this very curious looking structure it's got four pillars and then a dome usually a dome or kind of a roof over the top of those pillars and then very often there's a curtain that can be drawn around them yeah and so in the tabernacle of moses right obviously the whole thing is a tent but then when solomon builds his temple in the temple of solomon there was this there was this pillared a pillared curtain right so like a tent inside of the temple basically enclosing the the holy of holies right the place where the ark of god was supposed to rest and in the ark you're supposed to have the you know obviously you're supposed to have the the tables of the law and the ten commandments or the the tables of the law and the and the the manna and so on right well obviously as we've talked about in this series at some point the ark went missing right and so at some point these things are missing from the holy place the most holy place in in the temple and they're certainly not present in the second temple right by the time of christ right there's no ark in the temple which is why the the the parallel feast to this feast you could say like the four feasts together have i'm gonna try to do a piece on this for the symbolic world block so maybe cool it's already written i just need to like finish it up but in the winter feast of the church you have this like chiastic structure where you have like starting with the entrance of i keep hitting my microphone starting with the entrance of the theotokos in the temple and then going to christmas and theophany or epiphany and then finishing right at the presentation of the lord in the temple right nice yeah so it's really it's a really nice structure and so at the the parallel feast of this one the entrance of the theotokos and the temple that's a big deal because it's the first time the ark has actually come to the second temple but anyway that's a different different video difference yeah and so so now you have like the glory descending on right basically like one of the that type of imagery yeah so this structure this four pillar structure with the dome on top this is a chiborum and as you know in early christian architecture when christians started being able to build their own church buildings before the iconostas really develops right before that really existed what you had was this chiborum this is this canopy with a curtain that could be closed at certain points during the liturgy over the holy table which by the way the chiburum you can see it still if you look at images of the communion of the apostles usually christ is under a chiboro and the the in the ethiopian church it's they still most of their altars have chibuuru like that they're the ones that i've seen they still use that structure coptic churches still use that often as well and there is a there's even a little bit of a tendency now in in the modern orthodox churches to reintroduce it into the practice i saw chiborom there's one there's one even in in in south carolina at the by the greek church that i went to where there's some there are some very old greek churches like in greece that still have them and even some very old western churches in like the netherlands that still have them yeah yeah so when you see a chiborum in an icon right which as you just pointed out anytime someone is being given communion in an icon there's always a chiborum in there somewhere right so this is a way it's doing two things one is it's it's this explicit tie from the jewish temple to the christian temple right but then also it's this it's a sort of a shorthand to tell you something eucharistic is is happening and kind of the meaning of this feast right and so you have and so you have sydney in here standing in front of the chiborum and even you a lot of times on the on the altar under the chi borum you'll see a gospel book which is of course an anachronism from a like a a purely like boring sense of understanding things right but for us we we see it as a fulfillment what's supposed to be in the most holy place that isn't is the tables of the law right but the tables of the law in the christian church are replaced by we don't have a torah scroll in the altar we have we have the gospels right so there's this you know kind of all this all this great symbolism which again is is part of that thing of like the the hidden glory of israel now becoming the light for the gentiles right and so and so you've got simeon in the attitude of someone receiving communion standing behind in front of this structure which is all about the reception of the eucharist all about communion right and he's receiving the christ child and if you look at if you look at the hymns of the orthodox church around this feast like the festive maneon the they talk about this idea of of the use the eucharistic symbolism that's going on here it's really explicit in the hymns but then they also tie it back to another meeting of the lord of the temple right which is in isaiah chapter 6. so in isaiah chapter 6 you have a prophet who goes to the temple and he meets with god and in this story what you have is a prophet who's waiting at the temple because god isn't there but then god shows up to the temple right and so it's kind of this inversion of the isaiah 6 story and and so there's one of the hymns i wish that i had was that i had the festival moneon over here i think it's over on the shelf but one of him says something like the seraphim who is mary right so in that in that story in isaiah chapter six right isaiah has this vision of god and he sees him and he says woe is me i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips i live in the midst of the people of unclips unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts right and so a seraphim takes one of the takes a pair of tongs takes one of the coals from off the the heavenly altar and comes and touches it to his lips and when he touches it to his lips he says see this is you know your sin is taken away your lip you you've been purged you've been cleansed right and so what the and so the the the hymns around this feast in the mineon they they take that symbolism and it talks about the seraphim who is mary brings the burning coal that is the christ child right and gives it to the prophet simeon right and at that point he's able to say now let your servant depart in peace in other words i'm ready to die now and in the middle ages this is very closely associated with the idea this might seem weird to us now except for those of us you know who are maybe more traditional christians but even then like if you're a convert it's hard to think about things this way but in the middle ages one of the main things that people prayed for almost the only thing that people prayed for if you were very poor was that you would you would have enough anticipation of your death that you would be able to make one final confession and receive communion before you died right they called it like your your they would refer to it as like as like your traveling money in other words like that that you would be able to receive the eucharist one last time before you make the journey right into the to the next life and and so they saw candleness as being like sort of an example of this that he receives christ one last time before he crosses you know the river into death yeah and so so there's there's a bunch of really cool beautiful eucharistic symbolism in here and of course in the orthodox church when priests take communion right when they give themselves or when they take communion they say see this has touched my lips my sins purge right so they say those words from isaiah when they receive communion so there's this really beautiful like kind of triangulation between the feast of the meeting of the lord in the temple and the meeting of the lord in isaiah chapter 6 and then the and then the reception of communion in the in the in the ancient church yeah so i just wanted to point all that stuff out because it really helps us understand the symbolism of this feast and kind of what this feast is about right this feast it's about illumination it's about fire it's about it's about the the hidden glory right kind of being i mean it's about light yeah it's about life it is definitely about yeah about the the light manifesting itself more and more but it's not just about light manifesting itself because it's always light that comes with because there's also an as an element of it that is actually about a prediction of darkness right because because of simeon right he has this beautiful moment of light and then he says he's going to be a sign that is spoken against he's talking about the passion yeah and he says the sword is going to pierce your own heart also so it's it's this it's this it's a it's also the promise of darkness is the promise of a wound but ultimately it's the promise of pasca right which is which is the preeminent christian festival of light breaking into the world right coming out of the darkness so why february the 2nd right well obviously february the 2nd is 40 days after december 25th so it's it's 40 days after christmas and so it's the 40 days of the virgin mary's purification however february the second i mean you people don't know anything about this like you have to just say okay yeah sorry yeah go ahead that women would have to would have to purify themselves out of after a certain amount of time that they they had to do that regarding their menstruation but they also had to do it regarding after giving birth to a child so according to the law of moses 40 days after giving birth to the to a child women were supposed to present themselves at the the temple of god or the tabernacle the temple of god and bring an offering for their purification either you know like a young lamb or if you were if you're poor then you could bring like two turtle doves or two young pigeons i think i think i've read from one historian that like at the time of christ people only ever brought the the two birds but anyway and so you're supposed to bring an offering and it's basically you could say it's it i don't know we probably don't want to get in this too much but you could just say like in the old testament and the mosaic law there are certain things that bring you very close to life like this like the beginning of life or very close to death and it's like those things are too holy and so if you're exposed to them or if you participate at them in some way then there has to be this reintegration of you into kind of the normal liturgical community like the normal community of the people of israel right and so that's what this is about right birth being extremely close to like the beginning of life but also very close to today yeah yeah like both of those things at the same time and so a woman at the end of and we still do this in the orthodox church today we there there's you know the ceremony of churching for a woman and her child which we're going to be doing here in just a couple of weeks nice because we just had a just had a baby a few weeks congratulations yeah thank you thank you yeah and so so all of this all and again like you can even understand that purification right it's something that's that's hidden so like a woman after she has a child she's supposed to be hidden sequestered from the community of the people of god right almost because she's like she's like too special she's like too holy she can't she can't yet integrate into the into the life of the community right and then at the end of that time that hidden glory is now revealed into like a more public kind of a light however the traditional date for good friday is of course march the 25th which at one point in time was the spring equinox i know that the solstices and equinoxes they move around a little bit but at one particular point in time that was the the traditional date of both good friday and the annunciation right is march the 25th lots of people out there might want to like argue about this stuff all i can say is i don't care i don't care yeah this is the this is these are the traditional dates that's all that needs to be said about it so what you have to realize is that this situates the meeting of the lord which is 40 days after you know this situates the meeting of the lord or candleness as being halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox nice yeah so to me this is this this sort of reveals or sort of brings out one of the most important facets of universal history okay and this is why this is justly a universal history video not just richard talking about you know feasts that he likes right and groundhog day and groundhog day because one of the most important elements of universal history is the way that the is understanding the way that the christian story maps onto and it fulfills the sort of old agricultural cycle of the year which is present it's not just pagan it's present both paganism and judaism both paganism and judaism have this old this agricultural cycle that by the way predates the law of moses when when god starts telling the children of israel here are the feast of the agricultural cycle that wasn't the first time that they'd ever heard of them or celebrated them right he's just telling them here's how you celebrate these in a way that shows that you're my people right but everyone basically has these feasts and more or less with certain variations pretty much every culture in the world that lives within the same kind of climate and climate cycle has the feast right around the same points in time okay so what universal history does you know one thing that we've talked about is the way that universal history shows how a group of people try to tie themselves into the christian and the roman story yeah right but another thing that universal history does that's kind of part of this in this broader expansive way that i'm using the term is it shows how how how does my daily life tie into that story and so in so sometimes people will make a big deal about the fact that for instance in in like celtic paganism they had these sort of quarters of the year and these were the days that fell exactly between the each solstice and equinox right there's one on this date right in in ireland that it was celebrated on february the 1st which happens to also be the feast day of st bridget of kildare it was actually the the patron state of my new daughter so there you go it's all connected but and so people will make a big deal about this and and they'll be like oh this is just like see it's just a christianizing of this older pagan thing and again to that i have to say one i don't care i know you guys can be complaining we'll we'll baptize shark week like i'm sure you've seen that meme it's like listen if you guys keep you guys keep complaining about this stuff we're going to make shark week a christian holiday like that's right but but i mean in another sense you have to realize that this is the this is the way that things work right this is the way that that we we that reality manifests and this is the way that we know each other and the world that we live in and it's the way that we know god right is the way that these things manifest themselves in time in the cycles the recurring cycles of the seasons which were made by god right and so it's kind of like preposterous to think and this is why i just i get heartburn from these people who are like oh well this you know a long time ago when i was a pastor of a church there was a big fraucus because we we had a christmas tree up in like the the foyer the foyer you know which is what baptists called the nerf x you know yeah and and some people are like oh well yeah and you know like chris you know that's a pagan holiday and they sent me like this dvd series you know like you know you gotta tell the christmas exactly right i know you know what i'm talking about right but the reason that stuff gives me heartburn is is because it's like you know you think god doesn't own the days of the year like he made the year he made the agricultural cycle he made the solstices and the equinox you know like he made these things and so why would he not when he manifests himself in the world right when he becomes incarnate he becomes incarnate taking on human nature in this full complete total way but he also like becomes incarnate at a particular point in time at a particular place in history but what the what the whole sort of christian year shows is the way in which that particularity you could say again like the the glory of the people israel becomes a light to the nations right and so and so christ doesn't just fill up the 33 years that he's walking around on planet earth yeah but actually fills up all of time with himself right so there's no other way that this stuff could manifest right this is a feature it's not a bug exactly and understanding the relationship of the times of the year to the life of christ via the christian liturgical year is vital it's absolutely vital to the reading of medieval literature just to take as a for instance arthurian literature every great arthurian story happens at a particular christian feast day yeah sometimes it's pentecost sometimes it's christmas sir gowen in the green night happens on the feast not of christmas one of my many i mean happens during christmas tied but doesn't happen on christmas day which is one of my many beefs with a recent film yeah it happens on the feast of the circumcision of the lord which was very popular in england at the time that that poem was written yeah and also it's like don't you if you cut something a a monster in two and you don't understand that there's a relationship between the circumcision and that yeah and that it's like you're missing out on some of the story and i don't wanna i don't wanna like i don't wanna sound impious about this okay but first of all you have to understand in the middle ages people thought this was a pretty good joke right there's a beheading it happens on the feast of the circumcision of the lord like like people people were aware right but also like if you don't unders if you don't understand that that story begins on the feast of the circumcision you won't actually understand anything about the story yeah right which is like what to do with the remainder exactly that's what the whole story is about that's what the whole story is about i mean it's about you know like the sash and everything is always about it's always about that it's yeah so and so yeah and so if you don't understand this stuff then you won't be able to read medieval literature right and and kind of know what it's about so to me like if you want to understand something like medieval universal history one of the most important things you need to do is say well how did how did a certain group of people how did they celebrate this feast what did they do for christmas what did they do for easter would they do for if you want to understand like who they really were and what they thought about themselves it's not just how did they write themselves into the larger narrative on this really meta cultural level but how did they see themselves being as being a part of that story in their day-to-day life for instance candlemas england huge deal huge deal and in fact if you were if you were if you lived in a town that was large enough to do this most candleless candlemas celebrations were celebrated by a sort of mystery place procession before mass so you'd get one of the women of the town to dress up like the virgin mary which of course for them meant you should dress her as beautifully as you could afford to do right because they weren't interested in the fact that okay yes obviously mary just were quite poor you know for them it was it was you know this is they're trying to show her as as who she is right she's the queen of heaven she's the mother of god right so we want to we want to show that in the way that we dress her so they would dress dress her up you'd have an older man in the town playing joseph she would be carrying like a little doll right and then you'd have a whole procession right a whole procession with everyone bringing again bearing candles everybody would light their candles and they'd bear them together in this big procession to the parish church and then they'd have like an older man meet you at the door of the parish church and you'd come in and what would you do you'd celebrate mass and of course receive the eucharist right so there's this whole you know there was like this very you know it was very festival there are whole carols like we know about christmas carols right but there actually used to be carols for everything and christmas carols are the only things that have really survived because christmas for most people like living in the west most evangelicals is kind of the last surviving vestige of the christian year like even more so than easter yeah you're right yeah even more so than easter like i know that you know at the churches where i served christmas is a much bigger deal than easter right and and and that's when you know even a baptist church like they'll break out the nativity scene they'll put some graven images right up there in front of the pulpit for everyone to look at for the entire month of december you know it's it's kind of but it's just like when christmas hits that's when our nostalgia really kicks in for not just for like how did my family celebrate but also like a wider cultural nostalgic kind of kicks in and we do things and we sing these really old songs those are oldest hymns in any given protestant hymnal are always going to be your christmas carols right that go back you know as early as the 15th 16th century right before the reformation right and it's just like when we hit christmas a certain nostalgia kicks in but there used to be carols for everything and there are beautiful interesting fascinating carols even sandal mass carols candle miss carols even some written by puritans in like colonial williamsburg wow in fact can i just read you a couple is that okay did we sure it's up to you yeah all right so one thing that to know about candlemiss so this is like a a little kind of a superstition around cannabis is that cannabis is actually when you're supposed to take your christmas decorations down right so you put them up on christmas eve you take them down on candlebus we took them out on epiphany yeah well let me just read you all right there's a little bit of a conflict there all right so this one this one is a poem from colonial williamsburg okay when new year's day is past and gone christmas is with some people done so some people stop celebrating christmas on new year's day right but further some will it extend and at 12th day their christmas end which is where you go that's me yes at candle and some people stretch it further yet at candlemas they finish it the gentry carry it further still and finish it just when they will they keep good wine and eat good cheer and keep their christmas all the year so so some people some people are always partying right and i do have neighbors who keep their christmas lights up just all year long and i don't know what's going on there but they seem like we tend to creep the christmas lights outside people tend to keep them at towards the until the end of of winter yeah yeah yeah yeah but the inside the inside decorations go down yeah christmas lights like aren't quite the they're not quite as good as a holy candle but in our in our modern age they're pretty darn close they're pretty close that's yeah i'm a big fan of like please just like make your yards go crazy on christmas i think that's great so this i'll but i'll read this other one this is right this real quick this is like this is like a late 1500s this is a candleless carol it's called down with the rosemary and so and you can find like people singing on youtube but it goes like this down with the rosemary and so down with the base and mistletoe down with the holly ivy all wherewithy dressed the christmas hall so that the superstitious find no one least branch there left behind for look how many leaves there be neglected there maids trust to me so many goblins you shall see so it's like it's like for every like for every like leaf of christmas decoration you leave out you're gonna have that near god after candleness right so yeah so it's so it's it's and and that's kind of like a silly little rhyme but you can again see there's something about the day going back to simeon's prophecy right it's this revelation of light but it's also there's some kind of a prediction of the monstrous of something something that's going to happen so all of this is i think pretty important to understanding so where where did we get groundhog day from all right let's go groundhog day now so groundhog day in in various places in europe this day february the probably because of some well for all the reasons that we just talked about right you're halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox right all this stuff became a day of what you could call what's sometimes called weather lore or whether mancy right so it's basically trying to predict the weather how good of a spring like how good of a spring are we gonna have when can we start planting like all this different stuff right it's all tied up tied up on this stuff and and so what happened is that in pretty much all western european traditions they started using the weather on candlemaster which again hits at this midpoint but it's significant for these other spiritual reasons and for them like in the middle ages if you were like well there's like a meteorological reason and then a spiritual reason and like if you tried to tell somebody in the middle ages that those were just like separate things that didn't have anything to do with each other nobody would they'd look at you like you're a crazy person right and they'd be right yeah they'd be right so they use the the candleless weather to predict the beginning of spring and usually in germany the the the animal in question was actually a badger and so in fact in nova scotia yeah which is up in canadia or so i'm told it's called dox day with docs being like the the the german word for a badger yeah okay so not not groundhog day but doc's day sometimes also though it's a fox or a bear for our purposes it can basically be any hibernating animal like anything that goes to sleep in the winter and then wakes up in the spring interesting for the bear how would they get the bear to come out of during hibernation sounds a little trickier well that's why they tended to use badgers an angry badger is still a handful let's say but not not quite to the level that an angry bear is that's right grumpy angry right so when the pennsylvania dutch when they they're these are like basically immigrants from german-speaking areas of europe and they migrated to this part of pennsylvania where there were no badgers but what did they have that hibernated in the winter groundhogs right permits right and so that's kind of the that's kind of the that's kind of the origin of that so basically what you have is there's this obscure weather lore practice that is what's not obscure it's like pretty widely practiced but it's on the fringe of the thing that the feast is about yeah and in the united states we've totally forgotten the feast right we've totally forgotten the feast but everyone remembers the little minor weather lore practice that's associated like halloween you know right right how americans celebrate their holidays right right yeah like we take we take the fringe thing and the grip the gift giving that's the that's the feast you take the the monsters coming out that's the feast and now the right now the the badgers things that like yeah and so we take the we take the thing that's sort of like the fringe part of the celebration of the holiday which there's nothing wrong with that no it is place it's fine but then that's the we we take that thing we put it in the center it becomes the most essential thing right but i do want to talk real quick now now that we kind of understand like the background and kind of this you know the the spiritual and medieval map of of this feast to talk about what it means for the groundhog to see its shadow and to go back into hibernation right so the whole idea of seeing its shadow is that it's clear and sunny on the day right you're in the middle of winter right now right so six weeks into winter you've got six more weeks of winter coming so if it's the middle of winter and in this particular climate like northern european climate and it's bright and sunny and kind of a warm day such that this animal which is coming out of death right it's coming out of sleep is coming out of the earth comes up out of death it sees the light but you could say it like sees the light too soon and so it turns around and goes back right back into back into death right there's almost something that seems to me to be here about about kind of the dangers of you call it like the danger of premature enlightenment or the danger of unearned wisdom right in a way it's almost related to like you know the parable of the sower goes out to sow the seed and some of the some of the seed falls on rocky ground and it springs up really quick and then the sun comes out and it withers and dies because it it had sprung up so fast in the shallow earth that wasn't able to put any roots down and so well or what about i'm surprised that you see it that way like i would tend to see it as something like the the light casts a shadow right right and so you have this sense that when when light arrives it both reveals the light but it also reveals the darkness so that's why simeon says this is for the rise and fall of many right in in israel right so the badger the the the badger comes out and the question is which way is it going to go is it going to go towards the light or is it going to go towards the darkness so if it sees the darkness then it goes back into darkness and if it sees the light then it comes out into the light so you could see the the moment of revelation has a kind of it's always like a double revelation which is why that's how christ presents it as as you know as exactly what simeon says like as as something which reveals both the glory and the scandal yeah right all things will be revealed and so you actually see the sins of everybody and you also see the the goodness in the world so that seems to be something like that which is that that would be the way i would interpret it no i think you're right and i don't see this let me try to reframe what i'm saying a little bit right because you could say there's a right so man is microcosm right that's the most important medieval idea right if you want to understand anything about how they thought about the world in the middle ages or medieval literature you got to be able to understand what does it mean for a man to be a microcosm of of the cosmos right like a little cosmos so on a cosmic scale the ultimate day of revelation is the last judgment right when you know the fire of god the light of god reveals light and darkness but then also in some kind of a in some kind of a way like a participatory way that day is pasca right right that's the day when we say let god arise and let his enemies be scattered right that's the day of his uprising that's the day when he scatters the enemies of god up and he invites he invites those are who are his right into the light right and then on a personal level you could say that that moment this is what say maximus the confessor says he says that the the moment of the dismissal of the catechumens in the divine liturgy corresponds to participates in the moment of the last judgment so so that's the moment where you you you sort of cast out you send out the people who are not ready for the light yeah right and then those that are now they get to come receive it how do they receive it is in the eucharist which is kind of what this this feast the mystery of this feast is about that's an interesting idea like it's also it seems related also to the idea of adam and eve because you could also see it that way like yeah i mean they eat that not the the the the the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil and then they move let's say towards the tree of life and that light exposes their shadow in their case like they see their shadow they they're they're ashamed of that which is reveals you could say yeah and then they turn back into their hole and try to hide themselves so yeah that's that's exactly it like that's that's exactly it so i kind of see those things like i don't think i don't think these takes are like contradiction no they're not right yeah because you could say it's something like something like trying to take communion too soon like if you were a catechumen and you went up and you you tried to take communion like it would be to your judgment right it'd be to your judgment i've seen priests say like i'm not like if a non-orthodox person comes up he says yeah i'm not going to give you communion not because of me because you i want to protect you from right fire basically right yeah so this is also i think very closely associated with the idea of lent so the way to kind of think about lent right is you know because we start lent literally with the last judgment right yeah you know that's that's you know meat fair sunday right it's a sunday of the last judgment so we begin lent actually with the last judgment so it's it's exposing here's who you are and here's who you aren't right and for most of us that's just not a great experience like most of us if we're really honest with ourselves and we listen to the gospel on the sunday at the last judgment and we start to say well i haven't fed christ i haven't clothed him i haven't visited him in prison you know et cetera right so then what do you do you go back you kind of go back into death right and so your life becomes more austere the true services become more solemn and even you know darker like you see the six weeks of the of the the badger or the the marmot as lent basically so so it's six weeks long okay so in groundhog day the film right i've often heard people basically say the movies about purgatory yeah right which is not wrong but yeah it's the same it's similar yeah so here's what's interesting there have been a lot of film theories you can go out there and find how many days did he do like how many times did you do groundhog day right over and over again you can find like how many times you know and some people say well to to learn all the information that he learned it had to have been like 10 000 years or so you know something insane okay yeah taking that stuff aside the original script and the notes the director had it be like a thousand years but in the final script the one that actually got filmed in in the in the director's notes for the film he has it as a 40-day period nice so it's 40 days of what of basically learning how to repent yeah right that's what groundhog day is it's 40 days of learning how to repent not repentance is just saying oh i'm sorry my bad right that's not repentance what is repentance it's it's turning around it's a change of mind it's a change of heart and that's basically what phil in that movie who is the groundhog right he is the groundhog right in fact at one point he he kidnapped the actual groundhog and like they drive off a cliff together because he's just like wants to end all of this right but what is he doing he's going back down into the earth yeah he's going back down he's going back with the groundhog right yeah and so for fun that's what happens when you wake up in the morning and the day the groundhog hasn't hasn't moved on the ground of god's gone back into his cave and trying to stay in that cave until the sun the sun is really ready he's ready to see the sun like you said yeah yeah and so it's and so when he's able to actually see the light and not be scared by his own shadow right and you know you could go a whole direction with just talking about the shadow right but when he's when he's not able when he's able to not be terrified by his own shadow in other words his sin right this this false personality it's not really true to himself you know it's just like the armor that he's built up against the world around him that's when he's able to enter into this loving relationship and that's what that's possible right that's what breaks the the spell that's when he gets out right nice so anyway i think that's amazing i i it's so once we see it it's actually so obvious right there's a relationship between between all these things yeah but i never have thought about groundhog day ever in my life even though i enjoyed the movie but i didn't i watched it so long ago that i wasn't thinking about symbolism at that at that time so i didn't think about how it could be related to to to to lent and to pasca into the idea of you know like let's say purging your your passions in order to be ready to to emerge let's say yeah that's wonderful yeah so that's that's all that's right hug day yeah that's a great thing this is great stuff yeah so this is a like i said i hope that people understand maybe it's just the last thing i hope people sort of can start to see the connection between this and the broader idea of universal history right is that you have to think of history as being in you can think of it as like a series of fractals or wheels within wheels or however you want to talk about it right of you've got here's the story of history right this is this is what vodalovskin in like loras right gets this so beautifully right he he understands this so well is history is not a it's not just a line right it's not a complete circle it's more like a spiral right yeah but the way that you live that spiral out is in the cycle of the christian year right as you're moving towards the end of history and people get hung up about okay well when is that when is the end of history well the short answer this is also in loras okay the short answer is the end of history is when you die right yeah like don't don't worry about like when is you know the the last judgment or the rapture like don't worry about whenever that is supposed to happen the thing that you know is going to happen is that you're going to die right and for you that is that is the last judgment right exactly and so yeah so to to understand the way that you actually participate in that psych in that spiral you could say is by attaching yourself to the christian year which has left many little remnants like little ruins in the world around us today things like groundhog day right well when ground dog when groundhog day comes around this year instead of saying oh what a stupid thing i guess i guess we have six more weeks of winter because a rodent in the ground in pennsylvania says we do you know go to church get a holy candle light it keep out the darkness right and wait for the light of pasca well thanks for that you know this is great and so don't worry everybody we will we will back with more universal history we're gonna we're gonna go back into some arthur and move on to the millions of things we we could talk about in terms of universe history so richard thanks again this was really this was just a nice surprise for me and thanks for everybody for paying attention and we'll talk to you very soon hey symbolic world gang i just wanted to take a quick moment to
