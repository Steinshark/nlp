the great firewall of china is arguably the country's most powerful security and censorship tool i recall my first time behind the wall in shanghai pudong airport i managed to find a wi-fi connection at a starbucks and tried to get to my email i'd been in a plane for the past 13 hours and wanted to check in nothing nada oof i spent the rest of the day typing journal entries in microsoft word the firewall has been massively impactful on the chinese economy in blocking western namely american internet companies from the country china's been able to create a unique internet culture of its own and control the flow of information to its people because the firewall is internet plumbing few people know how it works and just how sophisticated it actually is they just see their email not working in this video we're gonna go look at what the wall is how it works its effect on the chinese people and how sometimes people can get around it alright so but but first i to talk about something new yes i have a patreon now ad income is always volatile but coffee always costs the same but i do want to call out a nice perk i make videos pretty far ahead of the schedule but they're always queued up in youtube waiting to be released the early access tier lets you watch all those videos right now ahead of time the number of videos will fluctuate but right now it's at eight and i'm going to try to keep it around five you can watch those right now if you're on the early tier that's all hope you sign up let me know if you do thanks okay back to the video the great firewall this nickname was first used in print by western media in 1997 has been up for so long it's hard to imagine a time when it wasn't around yet that time was not all that long ago the ideas behind the firewall began in 1996 a mere two years after the internet itself first came to china what we call the firewall is a subset of the larger golden shield project the rest of the golden shield project focuses on other ways of controlling and censoring information that includes surveillance software and computers web cameras and the regulation of internet service providers the government's intentions with the firewall has been to prevent the transmission of information relating to the undermining of natural unification distorting the truth spreading rumors promoting the overthrow of the government pornography and actions encouraging gambling violence or murder this is part of the security act from which it derives its mandate the firewall launched in the 1990s with the preventing of access through ip and domain name blocks out in the real world the government tightened internet access control in china's many internet cafes cafe owners were required to report behavioral violations and had to install surveillance software on their computers internet service providers were required to verify every user's id kind of like how american banks and fintech companies need your identity documents to open a bank account in 2004 the firewall introduced keyword blocking technology the tcp drop and i'll talk more about how this third leg of the firewall works later in the next section from then on the wall's basic implementation concept was complete in the years afterwards the government focused on improving that early implementation that includes dealing with anonymity tools built to circumvent the wall like shadow stocks and vpns it also includes more mundane details by building out capacity in china's western provinces and solidifying the border gates by which all chinese internet traffic exchanges with the west the firewall works so well today in part because of those tightly controlled internet border gates state-owned companies like china mobile and china unicom operate internet exchange points that connect to the rest of the world these companies resell to isps which serve as the retail outlet for internet access the firewall is also more than just technology it has a sprawling human component as well an army of human contractors monitor content and reports on violations sort of like how facebook employs human staffers to watch and label despicable content for ai filters china's firewall does the same okay so how does the wall actually work a wall in reality has a single face to it but the firewall is multi-faceted the government continues to tweak it in order to get the optimal results it has three overarching principles let's start with the first one the first is an ip address block this is a simple method a computer on the web is firing off packets of data off to the internet an ipa address roughly speaking identifies the location to which that data is going and how to get there the chinese government maintains a block list of banned ip addresses of foreign websites if a china-based ip packet is identified as going to an address on that block list then the packet is put on a road that goes to nowhere the data vanishes into the void and the sender has no idea what happened the drawback of this first method is that you have to keep the block list up to date more importantly it's also rather easy to circumvent with a proxy kind of like a third middle stop way station for your data packets so the next step to ensuring proper censorship would be to block more than just a range of ip addresses that's where dns comes into play this is the great firewall's primary method of censorship let's start with the idea of dns domain name system i am no networking expert but you can say that this is the internet's phone book it is the mechanism that turns the urls that you're familiar with nytimes.com or agenometry.com for example into an ip address the browser can then use the ip address to get to your website or server when a chinese person types into the browser google.com the domain name needs to be turned into an ip address so that the browser can go find the website in question these dns requests that they're called are fulfilled by dns resolvers computers on the web that respond to the requests the resolver receives the request from the requester and then queries what are called dns servers in search of the correct ip for the request china maintains a dns block list of around 15 000 keywords google is one such blocked site for that chinese person trying to go to google the firewall intercepts the dns request and sends the chinese dns resolver an invalid ip address in other words it poisons the request the requester never gets back a legitimate ip address without a legitimate ip address then the browser cannot load the website data this methodology works because the dns system was designed over 30 years ago in a time when security was not the prevailing requirement so when a resolver queries an authoritative dns server they have no way of verifying whether the response they get back is right or not for what it's worth a newer version of dns dns sec today introduces these new origin and hijacking protections the firewall is quite sophisticated here in that as routers are able to hijack dns queries and send back fake dns replies this prevents people from scaling the firewall by querying a third-party dns resolver outside of the country the first two parts of the great firewall that i mentioned focus on preventing a person from finding and then reaching the ip address of a block listed site the firewall's first generation began with these two methodologies this third aspect of the firewall interrupts the data transfer from server to client itself like as with the firewall's other two methods the chinese government maintains a block list of keywords a user connects to a server and requests data the protocol for doing so is called transmission control protocol or tcp the firewall then begins to scan the content for something on its block list if the website's content has such a keyword then the firewall sends a signal that kills the tcp connection between the server and the host the firewall would actually allow the first data get request from the server scanning it for forbidden content once it shuts down the tcp connection it does it in a persistent manner so that further attempts fail this explains why i felt like sometimes i could reach a particular website behind the firewall for a brief period of time before it slowly dies down and gets disabled interesting note content filtering and keyword blocking is expensive and complicated so china turned to american technology providers to source it the 2004 keyword blocking scheme was first implemented by california-based cisco systems much of the firewall's early technology was provided by cisco and sun microsystems now part of oracle these two silicon valley companies worked in close conjunction with fangbing called the father of the great firewall to make it so effective makes you think right soon after the firewall came up people began using vpn's virtual private networks to get around the wall most of these are technically savvy men looking to reach google twitter or the like a vpn is a private communications environment built on top of public communications facilities basically it helps connect to the outside internet world how can a vpn evade the firewall a user connects a computer to the vpn which encrypts the traffic and sends it to a foreign server since it's encrypted the firewall is unable to inspect the data packet and lets it through the firewall is smarter than you think though it has a good understanding of common vpn protocols it employs a few heuristics to detect vpn traffic for example if 99 of the traffic routes to a single address and it is encrypted then it's probably a vpn and it can be blocked the firewall can also recognize common vpn protocols like openvpn out in the real world the chinese government began regulating and restricting the usage of vpns not that vpns are totally banned but rather they cannot be used without a license from the government in 2017 they crack down on illegal vpns being sold on taobao a few people got three to five years in jail and were fined about a thousand dollars for providing and using a vpn without acquiring the necessary licenses the government continues to refrain from an outright ban on vpns but they do want to keep a close eye on people trying to climb over the wall this phrase by the way is called fanchan literally over the wall as for the chinese internet business world the firewall has restricted internet competition from western internet giants like google and facebook not to say that baidu alibaba and tencent wouldn't exist without it i would call that a misconception chinese companies had mostly beaten their western counterparts by the time the firewall blocked them alibaba and ebay by doing google for instance i think the bigger thing about the firewalls firewall's existence with relation to business is that it gives china's internet industry though much more leeway leeway to do certain actions that in the west would be called out for example weibo is a notorious ripoff of content from twitter baidu and their medical ad scandals are pretty nasty and of course there is how wechat won't load links from companies it competes with those actions were undertaken by private companies and if anything the chinese government should work harder to address those abuses the gray firewall is the most sophisticated of its type in the world but it's not alone parts of the firewall have been implemented in other countries for example germany uses content filters to block neo-nazi sites and the united kingdom is capable of carrying out a court-ordered blockage of sites dedicated to piracy and other crimes with that being said i don't think anyone should draw a tight line between that implementation and the firewalls western society has determined on a whole to disallow those things china's keyword block list was decided by the party alone i'm just saying that many people can agree on places where we need to restrict the internet's freedom china has its own notions the west is still grappling with theirs i think the thing about the great firewall that might seem most distasteful to ponder for outsiders is that the wall's existence and sophistication shows the government's commitment to a measure of openness the firewall is not a blanket if that was the goal then it would be a lot easier to implement rather it is a targeted block of a small fraction of the entire internet people focus really heavily on the blocked bits and rightfully so but the reality is that most chinese don't really care most just want to talk about marvel movie rumors and keep up on their sports teams when i reflect on it the reason why it might feel like the web is so restricted to a westerner like myself in a starbucks in shanghai might perhaps be because we primarily access the web through the very targeted bits that china blocks and i would say that's a reflection of just how much we rely on only google facebook wikipedia and twitter to tell us all that we think we need to know about the world i think that's something to think about alright everyone if you enjoyed this video this is where i say like and subscribe but take care of all yourselves out there stay safe
