and yeah it's good morning everyone thank you for coming it's great to see so many of you here in the morning even after probably a late night last night all right so as we said i want to talk a bit about helping open communities thrive and my experience in helping communities over the last 17 years to strive in the open and i hope some of that will be useful for your work here around c++ or other areas where you are involved so first of all disclaimer i'm going to talk a bit about history of k and so on and of course all of this is from a particular vantage point and necessarily not the whole story right but i hope the important parts so let's start a bit about me why i'm talking to you about this so for the past 17 years as i said i've been contributing to a number of free and open projects both software projects as well as open knowledge projects after i studied computer science i've been contributing to kde for most of that time and for since 2011 i'm on the board of the nonprofit behind k k ev and i was the past president and i'm currently the vice president of that organization that's my volunteer life and most of what i'm going to talk about in my work life i work for wikipedia on wikipedia's knowledge graph called wik data so if you ever need data for your project about the world that's the place to go and i also in my volunteer capacity support the video u people so those are the the guys behind vc the video player with the cone basically advising them in in governance stuff and so on so and i believe that gives me a fairly good picture good view into the picture of these communities and through all of this this work while i studied computer science and i'm rather technical person most of the contributions i've made to those projects are not on the technical side but more on the community governance strategy and product management site so to give you some context i need to talk a bit about kde and give you a bit of a recap on history of kde so kde started in 1996 it was started by a guy called matias atrish and you sent this email or rather news group post that you can still find online today titled new project cool desktop environment programmers wanted we cringe a bit at the cool today which is why it's no longer the cool desktop environment but kde we've grown and it's a rather long post but he he is trying to rally people around the idea of building a desktop environment and specifically he calls out stuff like wanting to build a gui for end users so he writes the idea is to create a gui for an end user somebody who wants to browse the web with linux write some letters and play some nice games specifically he's talking about his girlfriend but basically he wants more people to be able to to work on on linux in a in a nice environment also important he talks about already in that email about cute which he calls a very nice easy to ous powerful c++ library and he's really trying to get people on board he writes i don't have the time to do this all alone also since licks is my main project the lates editor but a thing like a desktop environment can easily be cut into to lots of parts there's very probably a part for you too if you want to learn some act programming why not do the small need projects for k and already here this is going to become more important later he's talking about k as a place to learn and he ends us with i admit the whole thing sounds like a bit like a fantasy but a very serious from my side everyone is talk i'm talking to in the net would love a somewhat cleaner desk and cute is a chance to realize that so let us join our rare spare time and just do it that was kind of the attitude matas brought into this so what to take away from this first of all matias was a rather unusual founder in that he was he started this project but then was fairly hands off for the rest of the project also k has always considered itself a rather technically excellent and pragmatic community it's been close to cute from the start it's been considering itself a place to learned from the start and it's always put end users as the focus not too long after that already kdev the nonprofit behind it was founded and it was established as a organization that supports the kd community and legal financial organizational matters like having someone who can sign some papers for a conference for example to host or to be the party in the kat fig foundation to secure cute staying free and open so and for many years k ev has very explicitly not gotten itself involved in the development it has not paid for development for a very long time it has not tried to influence the development but always supported the the kitty community to do the development it wanted to do this has changed a bit in recent years but that was very important at the beginning and over all these years as an organization it has provided a lot of continuity for the project and the community behind it um now history goes on kitty1 is released isn't it isn't it beautiful it's really anyone here by chance who has k used k1 nice very nice and we move on to ky 2 any k2 users nice more the like expected this is really cool we move on to kitty 3 we get a bit more presentable ky3 who are you yeah cool and kd3 was kind of a crossroads for ky when the kitty3 series came to an end cute was moving to cute 4 major breaking changes major rethinking of what what is going to happen so and this is roughly the time i joined kitty now why why did i get to kitty i've always been interested in technical things and computers from rather early on and i always loved the idea of being able to build something to tinker with something and the idea of creating something in the open and when i was studying computer science at some point i was like hm this window thing really not doing it there has to be something better and at that time ubuntu was the rage so i was like okay let's give this a try i installed it and tried it for an hour and was like like it's not bad but we're just not clicking and then i looked around a bit more and people were saying like yeah there's also this other thing called kubuntu which is basically the same but different so i like okay fine let's try that and i installed it i used it for an hour and was like oh my god my mind is blown this is amazing this is the thing and the the thing that hooked me was integration so here for example you see kitty's messenger up at that time copete and in copete you could say hey to this messenger contact get their address from the address book and send them an email with email program or from the file manager you could say send this file to that to that contact in coped i was like oh my god this is amazing from coming from windows with shareware freeware all this integration was just not did not exist so i was hooked and like yeah okay i'm going to use this this this is great and then i talked to this guy s who i was studying with and he was like hey you're you're using kd's software right i like yeah yeah hm i'm doing marketing for their for amarok their music player why don't you help us like okay i can do this i can help you write release announcements and so on and at some point he said like you know what in two weeks there's linux t in berlin and you're coming with us i was like oh my god i have no idea what i'm doing but there we were and finnally enough people who came to the booth were like asking all of them were asking the five same questions i had this i had this figured out quickly so that was good but the much more important thing that happened there is that i got to meet a lot of other kd contributors for the first time in person and that's basically what made me stay it's the people in that comm right and over the years people having faith in me and and letting me try stuff letting me also fail at some things and through that learning a ton so for example today i would not have my day job without all the things that i learned in in kitt my computer science degree is great but it did not get me my job so in k we say come for the code stay for the community and that's really i think a a core thing that is true for many communities so here you can see our grp photo from our last conference in tessalon in greece it was great okay back in history kitty3 i joined and that was around the time when ktie came into had quite some trouble years i would say because over the course of a few years many things came together we were moving from a central sbn repository to get very decentralized every program had their own g repository of course as opposed to how it was before in a in a monolithic sn repository which meant that people who worked together before in the same code base started drifting apart cute moved from cute 3 to cute 4 as i was saying earlier kd4 was very much a revolution not an evolution so we basically threw a lot of the work we've done before away and started basically from scratch with very good ideas and intentions and visions behind it but let's say the execution of that initially and the way the public expected it to be did not match people were not happy at the beginning which of course is not great for the people contributing to that right if it's like why did you destroy what i have been using for so long why did you why did you break everything why did you move everything why can i no longer do this on top of that the initial vision that we had that matia set out as a desktop environment for end users on linux we we kind of checked that off but also h not really and then questions came like does anyone even need a desktop anymore is this is this does anyone care or is everyone going to move to mobile phones anyway and then there was a lot of push to change the framing of of what kd is from k is the software that we release to kd is the community that releases that software all of that was leading to i would say a rather unhappy community a very stressed community a very splintering community and a bit of an identity crisis if you want so what do you do then to not have everyone freak out basically how do you how do you keep people together and what we did are three things over several years the first of which was to create a manifesto to basically define who are we what defines us what what does it mean to be kde and we wrote down values in that manifesto after a lot of discussion and we we ended up with open governance free software inclusivity innovation common ownership that was very important for us everyone k should be able to commit to every piece of the code for example and an end user focus but that's of course not enough we also had to explain okay what's the benefit of actually coming to kde with your project and we we call out things like you get to make use of kitty's infrastructure you get to be a part of a large community that does for example translations bug fixing bu triage for you and much more you get representation of the nonprofit behind it you get more visibility through kitty's promotion and so on and of course something that doesn't just come with benefits but also commitments so if someone came like hey i have this project and i want to come to k with that project i want to make it a k project we also had some expectations towards them now for the first time actually written down and agreed on like respect our code of conduct be aligned with our vision and mission do not have a mandatory contributor licensing agreement have some technical requirements checked off like if you have an online service then our assment team needs access to that and stuff like that and the same for copyrights and trademarks and patents and this basically for the first time gave was a shared understanding of should this project join kde and what are the expectations we have towards that project as opposed to 500 people having 500 different interpretations of what it means to be a k project very helpful also very painful so that was nice and useful but it didn't fix all our problems because we still weren't able to pin down okay why do we exist now now that we've kind of achieved but not really mat's initial vision so a bit later we started looking at okay what's our new vision what's our new mission and we ended up after a lot of painful discussion with kd and wish in the world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys freedom and privacy so one important thing to note here is that for example it doesn't talk about a desktop but it does talk about being in control of your digital life freedom privacy right which opened up kde beyond this kd is a desktop no it's a community de among many other things makes a desktop and then since this is very lofty we like okay how do we do this how do we give people control over the digital life and freedom and privacy so we said ktie has taken on a mission to create software products which give users control freedom and privacy we give them an excellent experience user experience in quality software we give that to them regardless of their location background abilities operating system and device and we are here to promote free and open source software and free and open source ecosystem so again this gave us much more clarity and also told some people like yeah okay what you want to do is maybe not what you get to do in kde so after we had that it was it was really helpful and and people kept referring to this say hey but according to our vision we said we would do this or we said we wouldn't do that but still it doesn't give us okay what do we do now what what do we do what do we do together as one community as opposed to everyone doing their own thing in their own little corner of this massive project so we set out to set goals and socialize them and this basically meant we would make a call for people to make proposals for what kde should focus on over the next two to three years and anyone anyone if they k contributor or not could come and and make a suggestion make a proposal and after some time we would have a have a discussion period where people could ask questions refine the proposals and maybe say hey i don't think this is a good idea and here's why maybe we shouldn't be doing this or here's how i think this should be done differently this should be done how this could be improved and then after all of that we had a list of potential goals for kitty for the next years and we set out to do a vote among active contributors for the top three and we've gone through this process for three the third time now and in initially in 2017 the outcome of that that first vote was top not usability and productivity for basic software so hey let's make all our software more usable and more more productive for people privacy software let's look at privacy issues in in our software let's make people more aware of the privacy the implications of doing something and last but not least streamlined onboarding of new contributors to make it easier for people to join now the interesting thing that happened here is that of those initial three winning goals two of them were proposed by people from outside k and this was very much an aa moment for me because this whole process gave them um the the ability to say oh i i have something i i have an idea i think this is this is good and i'm willing to put time into making it happen which before that they they didn't feel empowered to do and since then they have become some of the most prolific contributors to k so i consider it quite a success so we forb this in 2019 with the winners being consistency so making all of our software more consistent wayland getting ready for wayland and apps which is okay let's work towards making it clearer that people can use individual apps from kde also outside a kitty plasma desktop and the current ones voted in last here k for all so this is all about accessibility improvements sustainable software energy efficiency and more and last but not least automate and systematize internal processes so basically all the things that a community does at talk sometimes let's automate some of that let's not have a single point of failure person things like that so while all of these processes were rather painful to go go through this is really really helpful for keeping a project as large as kde together and united and working towards something that all all people like most people in a community agreed like yes let's focus on that and of course this is not all that kitty does but it it sets a focus and it makes it clear hey if you want to contribute in one of those areas that's a good idea so after those rather difficult years where is k today we have clearer goals i would argue we have better software we have partnerships to get our software directly to end users so this our hardware partnerships we have stayed true to our values that we laid out many many years ago we have a more cohesive community and we're able to mat much more clearly articulate why we exist what we do and why we do it and you can see this for example here in in these kitty for you pages as just one example which is a website where you can find specific pages for certain groups and how k can help them so for example we have ky for activists or kd for students for travelers and so on so these are the pages that tell you hey hear the things from k that would be interesting for you right now there are about 600 active developers and i would say as many in non-developer roles so organizing events and things like that with a size of about 50 million lines of code 80% roughly of which are c++ k software today is used in lots of places like c nasa in hollywood u for example in the shooting of gravity avatar the hobbit steam de is using plasma on the w is using plasma on their steam deck devices which you can turn into from the gaming console you can connect it to a screen and have basically a desktop that's plasma and many more in terms of most successful applications i would say plasma cr or painting application kaden life which is amazing for video editing kate our text editor she gr a learning suit for kids kd connect which connects your phone to your computer and kd frame more on the library side so and what is kd not and i feel like c++ is in a similar situation kd is not the latest hype of the day kitty rarely runs after the latest big tech hype be that bitcoin large language models or what have you if you're someone in that then kd is probably not the project for you and i feel like c++ is maybe also not the project for you so instead we're focusing on what actually improves lives and sometimes this might be one of those technologies right but so far but the problem with some of that is that it's sucking up a lot of the energy and a lot of the good people that may be able to contribute to something in my opinion more meaningful and i think a clearly people centered vision in the case of kd without a profit u motive behind it can act as a as a nice antidote to still get people interested in this and and contribute to it so over this years after learn a lot of lessons some of them painful so here's me trying to tell you about them so you don't have to go through the pain first of all so i'm going to talk a bit about lessons for you as an individual for community and then for society let's start with you as an individual do take care of yourself do not make any of this the center of your life the center of your un universe this is probably the hardest for me to to actually live by and one of the things how do that happens is train your successors have a succession plan if if you're gone life happens who is going to continue the work that you've been doing think about that talk to that person talk to those people or even better to not be the single point of failure for something in the first place again very hard especially in an open community with resources and one thing i've noticed in a lot of communities is that the leaders in those communities sometimes tend to have this urge to be the the first to answer a question the first to answer to a bug report the first person to review a merch request [music] this if this is you try not to do that try to give others some space to be the first try to let them answer that support question try to let them do a first code review and then go in that's one way to grow people into into the roles you need them in but you also need to be able to let go have patience and this is this is hard and one mantra that we have in in wikipedia that has helped me with this is good enough for now safe enough to try you might have worries about something but it's good enough and yes we can try this the world will not end and this cuts down on discussions quite a lot because a lot of times people discuss about the last 10% that maybe do not matter that much try it another thing i've realized over the years is that free and open projects are kind of the ultimate leadership tests right if you're in a leadership position in one of those projects you're really forced to rally people behind you you basically never almost never can tell them what to do you need to convince them and you need to engage them and one way to think about this is that people need three things to have fun in a in a task and a job in in in a position and that's mastery autonomy and purpose mastery you need to be able to feel that you can do the task it might be a little challenging but you need to be able to do it if if you're completely lost and overwhelmed it's not fun you're not going to going to do it autonomy you need to have a bit of space to do your thing you can't constantly have someone micr manage you and tell you what to do and what not to do surprise and last thing purpose why am i doing this is this is this interesting is this useful is this meaningful and the cool thing about open projects most of the time the purpose piece is just check and in general trust people to positively surprise you take a chance on people trust falls are hard but let people positively surprise you another thing if you ever find yourself in in some sort of leadership maintainership whatever position in in an open project it can be very lonely it can be isolating and what really helps is to find someone in a similar position in another project someone you can go to and say like oh my god they're driving me nuts today or i have this problem i do not know how to deal with it what do you think or just i need to wi for 10 minutes and you need to listen to me because often you can't necessarily do this with the people in your community so find someone in a adjacent communities who can be that person for you now let's look at the community scale for communities culture matters and as a community you're advertising your culture everywhere this for example is a a group photo from the will lear conference in dublin earlier this year and one of the things videoan does every year at their conferences is hand out the cones the cone heads and then they do a treasure hunt through the city so for the day first day of the conference the city is filled with people with cone heads running around which is amazing and you get so many people asking you like why are you why are you doing this what what's the deal what's the deal with your cone and then you get into a conversation like yeah yeah yeah we we're working on this project and we're doing a treasure hunt can you help us with this question do you know where this and that is it's very nice oh here magnet fishing or here from wikipedia wikipedia has the wikipedia acuteness association and this is is quer buu one of the members of the cuteness association so basically whenever there's a conference people bring their plushies and there group photos of the plushies and travel pictures and so on like it's it's very nice oh here this is a screenshot from wi data the project i'm working on at wikipedia and wik wikid dat has these data pages just basically and everything that b describes has a unique identifier random well not quite so random you can see that there are nerds behind this project darkus adoms for example is q42 there are more or here which is my favorite edit on wikipedia and if you want more of these i can highly recommend following an account on twitter or instagram called death of wikipedia where annie is posting a ton of really cool pictures so what happened here is there was an article with this picture and the it said piper car a me member of the scottish national arctic expedition placed the back pipes for an indifferent penguin march 1904 okay and then someone someone i know makes an edit and says piper care on the right i mean it's important to to specify this right there's a ton of this stuff in wikipedia i can highly recommend depth of wikipedia it's lovely so again people come for the code people stay for the community and stuff like this your culture and besides all the things i showed you another way how you advertise your community and how you advertise the culture of your community are discussions right if you're discussing in the open you're basically never just discussing with the person you're discussing with there are a ton of bystanders who will take that into account in understanding what community this is what's allowed here what kind of tone you're setting and and how you interact with each other and here initial tone setting of a community is especially important so if you ever are in a position to start a new community think about what kind of community you want because the initial setting is very hard to get around later in the life of that community a community needs a clearly articulated why this is as i was explaining earlier with kitty right the reason why we went through all this pain of defining our vision our mission our goals to to really have that and and have that agreed upon because you can't just dictate that from above if you want buy in for for such a thing you need to create this collaboratively with people and the goal or the end result the artifact that you create like our vision is great but just as important and maybe even more important is the process how you got there all the discussions you had getting there as painful as they might be and for this it can be if you're going through such processes it can be immensely valuable if you have someone lead those processes who is not invested in a particular outcome so i for example was leading the process around the creation of the vision for k but i didn't care about what we end up with i i cared that we have one but the details of what is in it i didn't care about as much and that really helped in the discussions speaking of discussions one thing that has helped me immensely from nonviolent communication training is dism of listen to understand not to respond often times and just as much in in real world discussions as in in mailing list post or on chat or whatever is we read we listen to be able to respond instead of listening to understand what the other person has to say try not to do that it really makes a difference in discussions and in how that other person feels hurt or does not feel hurt by you one thing i i try to live by is people should never be surprised by what i do and that means there should have been a time before any major major thing where we talked about it where we discussed it where people felt like yeah okay i could i could have my say i could give my input and i was hurt and a painful thing here is especially in open communities you have to say something so many times you can't hear it yourself anymore you've basically got to preach it for people to hear it and do not expect people to hear the first time you say something or you announce something or you think you have agreed on something can be very frustrating sometimes but it's good to keep in mind and one thing that helps with this is having a regular agreed upon and advertised way to stay up to date right my first point was do not make this the center of your universe and that also means not for many people not being able to stay up to date on everything that's happening in your community so what what i try to do in communities where i'm involved in is get them to the point where they have some sort of regular update of what's happening that's short and concise so for example for wick data we have this weekly summary which is just a once a week for the past 11 years 12 years almost message that people get sent by email and on wiki and on social networks with anything that that's important and for k we have nate who publishes these blog posts this week in kde which is also trying to summarize the most important things that have been going on in k in that week and that's an nice and easy way to stay up to date also for people who who are maybe just occasional contributors or who really do not have the time to stay up to date with everything that's happening in your potentially large community and then communities need ryles rituals and rhythms so this can be stuff like birthdays awards you give out conferences like this one immensely helpful so for example for for wick data we celebrate the birthday where people come together and there's birthday presents that people have like they they code little things they write documentation and so on it's really lovely there's cake cake is always good or for k we have the academy awards where every year we give out awards to people who have done something significant for the kitty community and then the really lovely part i think about this is that we do this at our annual conference and and then everyone gets to to sign these awards so you you have a an award to take home with signatures from people in the community and it's a really nice thing now to make stuff like that happen you need people who are connectors right the people who say hey you should talk to that people that person hey you should come to that event you should get together and and do this and those people are invaluable so anyone who organized this conference thank you so if you don't have them in your project um see if you can find them right see if you can find ways to to bring those people to your cont to your community who who bring people together and as as we've seen with the goal process right where in the first round two of the three winning goals came from people who had not made significant contributions to k before and your barriers are killer and in my experience so much of that entry barrier is in people's heads and not feeling like they they're good enough not feeling they are allowed to contribute to your project not feeling that they can make a difference so think about ways how you can give people that allow people to to join allow people to to to bring in their ideas and and so on all right now let's look more at the society level i think we need a lot more tinkering and i think you're the type of people who are very much in that space so please go out and get more people around you who might not be the type to tinker with something and it doesn't even have to be tech right can be knitting i don't know it i think really makes a difference in in how people think about their life and how how much agency they believe they have in society because i feel like we're moving more and more to a society that is take what you're given as opposed to take something and make it work for you and i don't think that's necessarily healthy for us i think we need a a lot more open infrastructure to build on and i thought this could was very insightful on that where it says for every shitty user hostile chain to a big tech service there exists a small independent service that could offer a viable replacement but continues to be ridiculed by the very users who complain about the shitty big tech service change so next time some proprietary big tech service gets on your nerves think about this and think about supporting alternatives where you are more in control which brings me to the next point is about all of these open projects are tend to be held together by a very small number of people and especially if it looks different from afar so for example blc is used by a gazillion of gazillion people but their team is super small and that puts a lot of strain on on that team right so yeah keep that in mind when you're making demands or have expectations towards those projects that they might not be able to fulfill but where you can help support them because there's always something to do and even a little thing like a thank you to your favorite project it helps a lot i hope this gave you some insights into open communities and how you can help improve them and i hope it was helpful thank you very much do we have time for questions yes okay audit questions hello hi so you mentioned that the community needs a rhythm and also rituals and that really piqued my interest because what makes a good ritual for a community and what is it that a ritual actually does right so what what a good ritual is i think depends a bit on your on your community of course but i would say things that happen regularly like anniversaries are always good things where people come together in real life are always good occasions where you can somehow celebrate something are always good and all of this why why are rituals good because i have noticed that if you don't have these regular points in time that that give people a rhythm things tend to flunder and people tend to just move on instead of saying hey let's look back at what we have achieved over the last year for example or let's now take the time to reflect on what's coming and and what has happened and plan what's coming yeah so anything that that has this regularity and and reflective character tends to be helpful i would say so it's like a renewal of the identity you have basically yeah you could you could put it like that you also mentioned that also regularly meeting up in real life really helps facilitate a sense of identity how do you say in general is like the difference from a purely online community to a let's say mixed community with mostly online but also offline meetings yeah i i wish i had that meme here but there's this there's this gif of two i think it's bulldogs who are baring at each other through a fence and being like really and then the fence is removed and they're like and it just personifies this hey when you when you actually see the person and when you met them in real life you have much more to go on much much better understanding of who this person is if you've shared a dinner with them i don't know then if you just know their name and their email address and and exchange a chat message here and there right and those can also be very valuable communities but i think there you can elevate them if if you can get people together in person thank you very much okay all right there's some questions from the online world and i you know be asking of the the first one it's a bit of serious question from honey as a woman have you ever faced the problem of getting your voices heard respectable of your technical competency and if so how do you deal with it yes but those were the communities i didn't stay [applause] in hi hi this is scarying like a more question can you maybe a missed but i don't think so can you maybe talk a little bit about c++ usage there so the stand compilers i don't know if everything is you need tested more or less like if there some hydrogenous devices targeted whatever i don't know anything about kd thank you how k is using c++ yes so as i was saying about 80% from from the last check we did is c++ code and largely through cute so cute as the make c++ nicer let's say and what standards can you use can how modern compilers can you target i cannot tell you that all thank you but maybe ian if he's here yes ian do you have an answer to that question okay so the answer is depending on on the project mainly the frameworks so the libraries used to follow what cute requires so whatever can be used to compile the current version of cute that works for frameworks for other projects we could go berserk and go for c++ 23 in c in 2017 it just depends thank youan being in the kde community for all these years how does the k community help you as a person i'm sure you have a lot of learnings how the k community has helped me as a person how in in countless of ways so while while i was studying i spent way too much time on on contributing to k if you ask my mom but the good thing about that was when i got a a student job next to my studies i went to this company that does semantic we stuff and i went to them and they had advertised the usability tester position for a student for a few hours and i did some usability testing for them and then at some point the boss came and like this is no no let's not do this i i saw that you do all this community management stuff we need someone who does developer outreach and you're you're why don't you do that like cool sounds great yes much more happy with that than usability testing and that's how i met the guy who founded wik and who was like hey i need someone who does who knows how to manage communities who knows how to talk to wikipedians about this new project that's otherwise going to explode and i was like yeah sure i can do this and none of that is anything i learned in in my studies like yeah so how did it help me on the one hand allowing me to do this like having a space where i can i can learn this and i can practice it and on the other hand also having a place where i can do this in the open and but people can recognize and see what i have done and basically having that as my portfolio and saying like yes this person really knows what she's doing there and and this is this is going to be helpful for us so there's an interesting question which i you know so how does kde but also viki like i i think you work for the foundation of the viki data and vik media that's what your dat job is and how how do like projects like kde survive financially and can you talk a bit about that side yeah so kde is largely funded by donations by individuals that can be one of donations or or or regular donations and then memberships in the nonprofit supporting memberships which can either be for individuals who pay1 a year or more depending on their choosing to be a member of the association and support the project and the same for for businesses who then pay a bit more grants so for example we had a had a grant from one of the german ministries to work on a project to get the german ecco seal the plow angle the for for our pdf reader oc so kti has a first software that has an eco seal from from the plow angle ever not just free software but so grants like that and then a lot of of the organizations around it some of them put their people to work on stuff in k so for example wal paid some people through consultancies for example to improve plasma so it can be so it can do what they wanted to do on the steam deck yeah i think you already answered the question that i had so i was wondering how the collaboration with external companies contributing to kde and development or external or other things works if it's all happy or there's training i don't know with the vision that ky has how's your experience with that yeah so yes i i believe they are the ones we have are happy that's why we have them the supporting memberships in the nonprofit give these companies a seat on the advisory board and space at our annual conference and general good wipes about hey this is a company just like here who who supports this community and and who invests in this community so those are the the the official k ev pieces and then the companies who hire people to work on kde that's of course at the end of the day just like any other contributor right but one with a lot more time and maybe some direction from their boss but their contributions go through through regular channels just like any other contribution thanks hi long-term user love love kd amazing i i want to ask a question more like a from a point of so i'm work at the commercial development and we have all the structure like you know you have a system supporting stuff and you have a management and so how does all of this works in the open source community when everyone is just volunteering so how who assigns tasks who maintains infrastructure how does it all work together like do you have informal leadership like how is it i'm very curious yeah it varies from project to project i would say for kde the only official representative body is the kde ev and and from the membership of k ev we elect a board that can for example sign contracts and stuff like that and say hey yes this is the location where we have academy next year or conf friends and stuff like that but when it comes to the individual projects a lot of it is meritocracy if you do the work you have more say and if you've been contributing for a longer time your word probably also counts more some k project have official maintainers who then can in in case it's needed make a decision like this is what we're doing this is not what we're doing but rarely is that the person who who has been voted into that position to have that power but it's more they've put in the work to be in that position yeah and for for wikipedia it's it's similar you have administrators for example who get voted in and you only get voted in if you can show that you have a track record of good work on the project and so on great thank you and one small question why did you stop naming projects with kay like what happened projects with k yeah like coner copit and amarok and all them i mean we we the cool desktop environment so the k as a on top of that kd was founded in tubing in in germany so k was and for a long time we we stuck to the k we've gotten over the k almost but yeah it's it's it's one of those crooky things at the end of the day that i was talking about yeah thank you yeah hey you said that in the beginning the k u foundation resisted to fund projects so i guess right now they do but as soon as money is involved you get a big trouble with communities how to balance that who gets money who does not how do you deal with that in the kd community yeah so transparency is is an important part we've gone through a long process around making a living what's the what's the title where we said okay one of the big issues we see is that people contributing to kde can most of the time do this while they studying or if they have a really nice boss who allows them to do it on the side or other such circumstances right and that is not sustainable unfortunately and we want people to to stick around longer term and that means giving them a a base to live on basically so we went through discussions okay if we do this where should we put money what's what's meaningful and the goals for example help with that right so now what we have is i want to say four for contractors who work on stuff like documentation getting framework six in shape for release and packaging apps for app stores all of which are tasks that are not super high on people's preference list let's say so it's not the oh someone is taking away something i would have liked to do most of the time that also helps yeah but it it's it's tricky to navigate definitely and that's one of the reasons why why we stayed away from it for so long and do you have administration work that is paid in in the yeah foundation as well yeah so we have an assistant to the board who does an amazing job without her we would be lost so she does all the paperwork accounting stuff like that and we've had someone to do that for i want to say 15 years or more so that has has been a much more regular thing because it was very clear that the board does too many things and this is not meaningful time for the board to to to do that work we we need them to do much more strategic work board still does too still does way too many underground things if you ask me but that's also the reality of of a nonprofit like that yeah would guess it's very hard to balance that also how much do you pay for such a valued job as you described it and also like making a living for a developer depends on where he lives what he does so it's very hard to decide who to give funds also yeah you have like influence from the companies like you mentioned wolf they will push their own directive their own incentives so it's very hard to balance that with the community they might have different ideas and directions and but that's with external companies pushing in in some directions that's a nice thing right they they don't have more st in terms of i'm the company and i give money and that's why i got to say it's more i'm paying someone to put time into it and that's why i probably have more say which can also be tricky but is i think the better option but i guess you also run into the same issue you mentioned with the big tech companies who show away services the users wanted you have companies contributing stuff yeah and then abandon it because it didn't get a commercial success yeah thanks again well you talked about onboarding and i think that would be something interesting to get into like how do you join kde host your mentoring how do you you know manage that within your community yeah so we have basically two big routes i would say one is unstructured one is very structured the unstructured way is when you get go to the kitty website you will find get involved lat l and that tells you different ways how you can get involved as a developer as a translator as a promo person and so on and then it's basically just joining and getting a feel for how things are going and then seeing where you can help and asking where you can help there's really someone pushing you to the next step there which is part of the the issue i was talking about earlier where people have this barrier in their head of not not feeling like they're empowered to do that next step and then a much more structured way are our mentoring programs so we take part in google summer of code and we have our own similar program called season of kde where so google sum of code is a paid internship basically the season of kde is less strict and not paid but you do get a mentor by your site you get a clear project that you can work on and if you complete that project and your mentor says yes then you get a certificate and a t-shirt at the end which is usually nice for the people who are who are taking part in that and you have a very clear like this is my mentor this is the person i can go to if i have questions this is the person who's going to be a bit on my toes to make sure i'm actually doing stuff so depending on what you want and need that that are the two roads we have thank you i think we have a question yes thanks for the talk do you also have people who come to kde after they retire from their jobs probably um i'm inclined to say that's very rare though but should be more maybe well people get older it's a it's a thing it's a thing yes i i do think everyone is welcome to join the community so yes there was a question about contributions to kd from companies and we we have to happen to have someone here from kdab with ian and i thought maybe ivan wants to tell us a bit about the contributions that kdab has made to kde and because i think it's like an interesting perspective to learn about okay so as the main issue with kdab and kde is that everybody who knows me from kde and they hear kda be okay so you're still working for on the same thing right because everybody thinks that kd and kdab is the same thing and it it's not helped by the fact that onethird of kdab is kd developers so let's say it's a little bit fuzzy of distinction and i would say that officially kdab contributed to kd in various software development tools like k develop kate obvious ly heap track clay the static analyzer etc and some of the things and a little bit more fuzzy for example david forb who has been the maintainer of kd frameworks since before lydia and i was ever born he has been employed by kdab for ages and maintaining those frameworks was largely a part of his work at kd but also his freework so it's kind of the edge is blurry but kdab as a company that kind of started from kde is a huge contributor still and a very appreciated one thank you so i'm going to see if we have more online questions but if you have a question that be kind of you know call now so maybe it be interesting you know this how did you as a community deal with the challenges that came with 2020 and being mostly remote and how like you know how this has shaped your contribution and how to you know kd be or no kde is working know more remotely than it did before that maybe yeah i don't think works more remotely now than it before because it has always been a community that's been spread out over over the whole world basically with hotpots in in germany in brazil and india but the pandemic of course forc us to not have our person conference and instead do that online we for quite some time didn't have sprints so our smaller developer contributor meetings and some of them went online but it's just not the same thing as getting people together in the same room so one of the things we we had some years ago for example was someone in in switzerland in a small town in the alss called randa who had a connection family connection to someone who has a huge old youth hostel and he would invite kitty contributors there for a week five days to hike on stuff in the middle of nowhere it's amazing and i wish we would still do that highly recommend it but anyway so besides those those inperson meetings i don't think it changed that much in terms of how we interacted with each other i think it did change a thing a bit the the motivation maybe even to to contribute to k in that i think some people including myself saw contributing to kde and wiki data other open project as a bit of a escape and as a hey here i can do something meaningfully to not go insane at home so yeah that's what i would say to that okay there's one question on wayland and k as you you had a slide on that this was one of your goals is this but now like the default or just it like was it about like adding support for it the goal was about making a lot of changes in preparation for wayland okay so work in progress i would say but getting there and and people are using wayland in their day-to-day work now yeah but ks to be ir out all right thank you very much that was a very interesting keynote and question session so thank you very much everyone
