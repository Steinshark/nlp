hello everyone and welcome in this video we are checking out the 2019 hyundai veloster n i am in germany why am i in germany well we did spend some time driving around the nurburgring and we are also we checked out hyundai's motorsport division which is based here in germany so you know they do have a development center at the ring and they also develop their racing programs for the world rally championship as well as touring cars here in germany so we're checking out the 2019 veloster and this car has a 2-liter turbocharged engine it is a twin scroll turbocharger producing depending on which option you get and we're going to get into the differences here but there is a base model and then there's a performance package so with the base model you're getting 250 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque with the performance package you're getting 275 horsepower same amount of torque the engine also has a variable induction system so there's two pathways that the air can travel depending on the rpm so they're optimizing it and there is a fairly broad torque range so peak torque is from 1450 rpm all the way to 4000 rpm now that power is sent through a six-speed manual transmission there's only one transmission currently offered which is the manual fairly close ratios and it's fairly short throws as well with this and there are two final drives which is a bit interesting so again depending on if you get the base or if you get the performance package you get different final drives for both of those final drives and so the first final drive is for gears one two and reverse and the second is for three through six and so if you do get the performance package gears one and two are about four percent more aggressive slightly more torque and then gears three through six are about two percent more aggressive so just slightly more torque but again you do have more power with the performance package as well as you can hear there it does have downshift rev matching which you can enable or disable right here on the steering wheel there's a little rev button and then there are different driving modes as well so depending on which driving mode you're in is how aggressive that red matching will be you know if you're out racing on a track you put an end mode it's going to react respond a bit quicker than if you're just kind of puttering around town it won't you know launch the revs quite as fast nice little pops there as far as the suspension it is an electronically controlled suspension so it varies depending on which mode you are in and also you know there's a difference between the base version as well as the performance package so the performance package actually has a smaller anti-roll bar in the front 21 millimeters versus 23 millimeters versus the base version and part of this has to do with the fact that the performance version also comes with an electronic limited slip diff versus the base coming with an open differential and they use the brakes for torque vectoring so with the performance package the reason they went to a slightly smaller front anti-roll bar was that they were attempting to reduce understeer have the core a bit more neutral if you do go for the performance package and then keep it a bit on the safer side on the understeer side but very stiff very responsive if you do just stick with the base version one of the things i do like that they've done is they've paired this core really well with the tires so you get good tire options which i'm happy to see plenty of cars out there they don't give you enough tire this will give you enough tire stock so the base car comes with michelin pilot super sports and then if you go for the optional performance package you get a slightly larger wheel 19 versus' inch and you get slightly wider 235 pirelli zeros and these pirelli p zeros were developed specifically for this car so they've got a little hn moniker on the side of them i was driving on them yesterday around the ring two laps you know heated laps about 10 minute laps and i wasn't noticing you know any degradation in the performance of the tires they did really well the understeer was not bad that was surprising to me and also what was surprising is just coming out of corners i you know i wasn't getting much tire spin from the front axle so you know cornering hard and then putting the power down that front limited slip diff did a nice job and the tires honestly were quite good so i like that they've put nice tires on it and they allow you to get the performance out of it now speaking of tires in europe they're actually going to offer tropheo rs as an option with a lightweight wheel and part of what they did to the body of this car is they changed it to make sure that it could handle cuff tires so there's some body rigidity which they added which i was speaking with the engineers about they were saying you know on these standard tires you're not going to notice it it's not going to have an effect but because they want this to be trackable they put in these additional stiffeners so if you are using a tire that has more grip and you're hitting higher lateral g's it's of course going to put more demand on the body of the car and so they stiffened it up specifically if you are to go with track tires and take this thing out on a track and you know hit higher g corners than you might typically now as far as the brakes they didn't go with any fancy outside companies there are not brembos on this instead they decided to keep things cost effective so what they did was they took larger brakes from a heavier model hyundai and they stuck them on this so this car is only weighing about 3 100 pounds with the performance package if you get the base it's a little over 3000 pounds so about just slightly lighter than a volkswagen gti depending on which one you get and it has you know pretty large over 13 inch brakes up front ventilated front and rear with the performance package ventilated in the front on the base car and solid in the back with the base model okay so you may hear a few pops from the exhaust there this is kind of a cool thing which they've done and it's most prominent in end mode but it can happen in the other modes as well so what they do is they record the ignition timing in order to have a little bit extra fuel going to the exhaust and then as a result you get those nice crackles and pops which you can hear there and actually which i was surprised to find out i was chatting with biermann about this one of hyundai's development engineers head of the end program and he was saying that this will act as anti-lag if you are in end mode and depending on the rpm and throttle position and things like that so for up shifting you know it will maintain that turbo spooling as you shift through it by returning the ignition timing so i'm going to probably do a separate video explaining exactly how that works but very cool that you know a car at this level of performance is actually coming with anti-lag depending on which mode you're in so if you're just in regular mode it's not going to be doing it but once you put it in end mode it will be a bit more aggressive with your shifting it will then record the timing dump a bit extra of fuel and then keep that turbo spooled up so a very neat feature for a car you know at this budget level that also is passing a mission so it's pretty neat that they have somehow figured out how to pass emissions and yet all the while are including an anti-lag system so how does this thing drive well like i was saying earlier i was impressed yesterday going around the ring at the you know relative lack of understeer this is the performance package so it does have the smaller anti-roll bar and it does have the limited slip diff up front but you know not too bad on understeer which i was surprised with and it does a nice job putting the power down 275 horsepower going to those front wheels and i don't notice too much you know coming out of a corner there it's able to put the power down and also with regards to torque steer you know i was chatting with them about this and they were saying they didn't really implement too much to try and eliminate torque steer they think that it's a something that gives the driver feel and so they didn't want to you know fully eliminate it but that said i did not really feel it all that much yesterday on the track and driving it now i still don't feel very much of it so i feel like the torx tier is well contained considering you know you've got 275 going to just two front tires now the limited slip diff may be helping out quite a bit there i have not driven the base version so i don't know what it's like with the open differential but here on the performance package i really don't notice any issues from a torque steer perspective so getting into the different driving elements and how they feel as far as the throttle it seems that there's a little bit of jerkiness on the initial tip in but then after that it's pretty well controlled and the throttle does change depending on which mode you're in so i'm in end mode right now which is the most aggressive and it's the closest to an on off switch versus the other modes which are meant to be more linear so you can change the way that that throttle feels here in end mode it kind of has an initial it pops in and you get that jerkiness initially but then after that it does feel fairly well controlled as far as turbo lag it certainly is noticeable you know the first time if you're off throttle and then you're planning it you will feel a bit of a delay between when you put your foot down and when you start to get that torque not super bad and i didn't notice it at all on the track so it maintains that boost once you're you know keeping the revs up but you know if you're driving around the city you'll notice there is a delay between when you put your foot down and when you actually start to get torque as a result of that turbocharger spooling up now having driven veloster turbo in the past i will say i do like the way that the clutch and shifter feel in this much more than the previous versions with which i've driven reason being i feel like you get a bit more feedback from both this shifter as well as the clutch itself i feel like the experience was fairly numb before and they've done a nice job of refining that there was a bit of notchiness to the shifting here it has a good feel to it nice mechanical notchiness and the clutch itself i find very easy to drive you know it's it's simple it's smooth you don't get that vibration in first gear so overall i do like this the manual setup okay let's get on brakes a little bit here not a whole lot of travel with the brake pedal and a nice progressive feel to it actually i like that quite a bit yesterday while i was on the track i wasn't paying too much attention to it but i didn't notice fade and you know so overall i wouldn't say i had any problems with it we're out on the track doing let's see 25 miles without experiencing really any degradation now that was a 10 minute lap rather than you know what this thing is probably capable of far better so i don't know if you're a better driver unlike myself when you start to run into issues with the brakes but i did not have any issues with it i did a really nice job yesterday as far as brakes are concerned so i like them i think they feel pretty good short travel good progressive feel they're not too punchy initially so i like the way that the brakes are and then finally just touching on the steering and i don't have a whole lot to say about the steering honestly it's a fairly short ratio not too much effort honestly required german roads are fantastic so the nice thing is out here you know you're not getting all kinds of bumps and things going through them you can see how beautifully smooth this road is but as far as the steering i don't i wouldn't say there's anything particularly thrilling about it that i that i really enjoy but on the other hand i don't think there's anything really about it that i don't find all that appealing so the steering is is ultimately fine i think the other aspects of the core shine a bit more than the steering itself but this car is fun you know the they haven't told us what pricing will be but they put a big emphasis on creating something that's affordable it's going to be segmented somewhere between you know the gti and the golf r in that range of cars where there are quite a bit of competition and and planted somewhere there in the middle as far as pricing is concerned but a lot of emphasis put on you know making a car that's fun to drive and still affordable and and i would say that they have met that i have been pleasantly surprised by driving it i was shocked by going around the ring in 10 minutes i know that's a long time but considering it was my first time on the track and sabine schmidt's getting it in 1008 in a transit van so i can now boldly claim that i am faster in a hyundai veloster are than someone in a transit van around the ring and i'm sure that's a very impressive stat to everyone out there as you can see there you do have a shifter indicator light up on the top of the dash there letting you know hey you need to shift gears and i do like the gearing in this car as well i think that's something that they've done nicely it's aggressive you know it's not just looking at let's purely get that 0 to 60 time it looks like second gear tops off before you hit 60 miles per hour somewhere right around just before it i'm so aggressively geared and i like that they did that i don't like cars that get too tall of gearing and then it sucks all the fun out of it so you do get to shift have a good time with the gearbox and get you know the full potential out of the car with aggressive gearing and putting a lot of torque down to the ground so as far as any downsides i there honestly i have very few complaints about this core so the the one thing is i don't know how much it costs i think that's going to play a big role in my opinion on it is where it ends up falling price wise the other thing is i have not driven the base version so this is the performance package it has the limited slip differential it has more power it has more aggressive gearing there's a lot of modifications to this core that the base veloster end does not have so i think it's certainly worth at this point in time getting this car right here but i have not driven the lower version i don't know you know how watered down it will feel in comparison to this but overall i have quite enjoyed driving this thank you guys all so much for watching and if you have any
