it's day 823 and my coveted lockdown beard still going strong if i'm on loopy sometimes i do wonder yvonne keeps telling me to move but i don't believe her it's all just a blur car studio car sleep i want a believer but my gaming setup's still exactly the same if i move wouldn't i have upgraded my burnt in monitor and where's the rgb lighting what's this microphone doing in my face why is there an lg c2 box on the ground and who's my sponsor kiwiko kiwico makes hands-on projects for kids that are designed to be much more than just a toy visit kiwico.com linus to get your first month for free you can learn more at the end of this video or at the link down below [music] the truth is i already have an s-tier gaming setup but there are a couple of things that have been nagging at me since my last upgrade starting with the monitor as much as i love the inky blacks of oled this particular model from aoris is based on an older panel that doesn't get that bright and does suffer from frequent image retention that it needs a pixel refresher cycle in order to mostly get rid of it's also absolutely huge meaning that when i'm streaming my camera even if i have it resting on the top of the monitor is basically looking down at the floor behind me which since i haven't finished moving in is not the most attractive scene another streaming related issue is lighting to be clear i love the key light airs wi-fi control adjustable color temperature adjustable brightness freaking awesome but since i prefer to stream in a darkened room i have to crank these things up so bright that combined with the dimmer display makes it so that i can barely make out what's on screen and i get a lot of eye strain now i'm not swapping out the lights i already said i love them but what i can do to fix that is turn down my lights by changing out to a camera that offers better low light performance we happen to have an a7s2 kicking around that has some issues that prevent us from using it for production but with a bare minimum fix it is definitely good enough for streaming so we're gonna swap out my rebel t6i for this which will mean better resolution and way better low light on top of improved low light performance the t6i is limited to i think at 720p or 1080i so i'm gonna get way better resolution on my facecam this next one's a very linus problem i find that when i'm gaming or using my computer in general i move around i shift my position a lot which means i am constantly moving my microphone around to keep it close enough to my mouth that its cardioid pickup pattern is still going to sound good which made me think i mean our video we don't use a microphone like this in our videos so why do i have to use it for streaming wouldn't it be better if i just took a lavalier microphone or better yet a shotgun put it in a fixed location where the pickup cone is gonna hit anywhere that i might happen to sit and then forget about it i don't know if this is gonna work very well but this mic was kicking around the ntg8 from road we don't really use it in our production so i figured hey i'll bring it home and give it a shot at the very least and finally every game streamer needs some rgb in the background right right what's in the box oh my god it's got a power brick where are we supposed to put these this is 75 watts i'm pretty stoked though this should be good i mean the only problem is where do you want to run it all there's a plan right here the issue yeah though is i have no idea how this is going to fit in there you can cut these probably yeah how long this lead is that's a pretty long lead yeah it's got to plug into this puck yeah where the devil is that's what we can plug it in here because you have a power outlet there every single one of these shelves needs a strip there's supposed to be power in a box here wait what is this is that not already like a bar of diffused lighting or something no this is a bar of being a bar and that is power i don't think these power outlets are supposed to be here what why not like it's supposed to be an integrated power supply for all the strips sure i mean that sounds great but i think the electricians just went and put a duplex reception yeah so then what are these like empty leads going to i don't know maybe nothing awesome i'll get a multimeter do you mind holding this for me for a second yes i just want to see if these are live sure okay zero yeah nothing try flipping it to ac there you go yeah that'll do zero yes okay so they're very fragile probably too which is oh good we could not do the rgb and we can do i can go with the cutiola and like summon displays let's summon dan all right hi dan yeah you're on speaker great here's what we're dealing with we've got these diffuser things in here these diffuser channels everything is wired i think down to this electrical box which for some reason contains a duplex receptacle this is the power supply for these strips and because each one of the enclosures has its own controller you need to power each one of these little controller dongles separately one of the other challenges is that the leads on the dongles are quite long and so if the idea is that we have like the controller pack here and then the strip in here we're gonna have a big dead zone over on the far left so we're just at kind of a loss his profile picture is so perfect for this conversation all right well i'm going to bring my soldering tools we can shorten a bunch of those leads there i'll grab some stuff and i'll be there as soon as i can okay okay do you have any thoughts on a 12 volt power supply that fits in a duplex receptacle that can do like a lot of oh my goodness these are 24 volt why devil did we end up with 24 volt led strips i love jake love you jake you know what i told jake i wanted i told him i wanted a simple five volt power supply addressable rgb like five volt with the thing these are like house lighting yeah i just want some ambiance the good news is i found where these wires go great you're not gonna like it where what they're all in here oh my god and in terms of powering them well we've got this wow bare ac wiring which is great i called the contractor and he's talking about ripping open the wall behind this in the closet and i'm sitting here going i do not need this project to drag on any longer so here's my proposed solution we put the little boxes with double-sided tape right here we wire up these with the barrel plugs that come with the included power supplies and just wire it into the back of the box right here we cut a little hole in the edge of the diffuser strip right there so it fits in there like that and every shelf just has its own little controller dude out of a jig sitting in the corner like that the wife approval factor of this solution is quite low but it apparently did make it over the bar because yvonne also doesn't want to rip open the drywall in the closet i might have another solution for you but i'm unsure if you're okay with you want like blue and rgb and all those different colors i was hoping for different colors yes okay because what we can do is we could probably just take the positive negative and white leads splice them together in the back side and then you just have white leds and with your two cables i'd really prefer to have rgb then we got to do the boxes did you pick a color and then just wire that color and then you're stuck with one color we've got these fancy z-wave aeotech strips and we're gonna run just one color i mean come on okay all right cool bye do you need something this is interesting well this is not a table what is a table [music] i guess the table is anything that you want to be a table but we were hoping to use this monitor for something can i help set you up somewhere else now that this one's liberated let's talk about the two main options for a king tier gaming monitor right now starting with the alienware 3423 dw it's a 34 inch curved ultra wide and it uses samsung display's qd oled technology in the panel that means you have all the benefits of oled like perfect blacks and amazing pixel response time but without the drawbacks it shouldn't burn in nearly as much or at least nearly as quickly and it's much brighter but lg maker of classic w oleds hasn't been sitting on their butts either this is the 42 inch version of their c2 evo which is brighter more color accurate generally better than their last gen in every way and most importantly is six inches smaller because as much as i have tried to make 48 inches work it's really big it's a little small yeah it's a little small i did not think about how much smaller this was gonna feel it looks gorgeous aside from that it's not running at the right resolution right now like the colors obviously just pop on this thing i know this is gonna sound kind of weird i do not like having multiple monitors at home i don't work at home i don't want to be tempted to work at home i just but it's not even about work it's like oh i want my game here and then i want like discord or reddit or something here i mean i usually put my chat here on my phone though okay sure so i do have a secondary display but i don't because yeah that's the other thing is i usually use it for like twitch chat and stuff i like to just do one thing at a time we're in a thousand nit peak brightness mode right now by the way like look at these lights they don't look like white spots on a wall they look like whoa hi buddy they look like lights and it does 175 for its regular but if you want 10-bit color you got to go down to 144. i'm okay with that right 144 is fine 144 is a lot good fire it's fiery see this is what cutie oled does this is not just a green colored kind of whitish thing with some green around it that's a green light it casts everything glowing green it's just a different level of realism you haven't seen the c2 yet though we do have to give the c2 a chance but i do definitely like this eye line a lot better and at 42 inches the c2 is gonna be a lot higher i'm not a huge fan of this stand but i could always just install an arm that is an option the bezel is almost too thin my webcam is going to interfere unless i put i'll just put like a little spacer in here or something like that so it sits up a little bit higher mine does yeah that'll that'll how's this going it's going really well are you being like dan about it or no no this is actually fine you'll get what you want and this all work really well come with me if you want to live i've got a full light hooked up already yeah i've gone through and traced all of the power cables for it and i cut the end off of your power supply cool yeah see you later yeah and so when we plug this in here no fire yet yeah and we'll go back in the other room what if we just take this end and pop that off yeah and attach the wires directly to the box and we don't need that big cable and we got a nice hole here oh actually that seems way better and yeah yeah so we do put the housing back on though right yeah the housing will still be on genius well relative to how today's going room temperature iq i have a question do we have to go moretz on these ones or could we just go shrink wrap shrink wrap or soldering or crimping whatever you want okay it's easiest for me to just do moretz right now because we've got to get rid of all that extra cable yeah i need to figure out a solution to deal with the crappy crappy jst plugs that are in there well we'll figure out a solution make it look nice hey vaughn how's the wife approval factor here it will sit like that on the bottom of each shelf yeah i think that's good okay we're good yep yes that's the biggest hurdle ooh all other things being equal i think i'm kind of leaning this way right now man it's much the screen space is really good that is a good size let's just go ahead and get it it should it'll turn on blue oh sorry i don't have an hdmi cable well i don't port i don't know what you're going to do then it's a tv linus it doesn't use display port unlike your old aorus monitor crap i have a whole thing i've got an optical displayport cable running downstairs i'm i'm displayport ready boys i checked your hub and everything hoping that there was hdmi and nothing we've got a hub and it's got hdmi but then it's going to display port over usbc so i don't know how well the signal is going to transfer over everything but we'll see we'll see whoa hey how you doing oh oh look at that 30 hertz hey see if it'll do 60. it will it will it'll just do 60. we're going to need another solution fortunately i brought home this optical hdmi cable with the intention of running it to the theater room from my pc so that i could game in the theater room for my computer which is in the mechanical room but i guess we can use it for this for today with the way i have things set up all i need to do is wrap a little piece of tape around this cable and hey blue start pulling i'm pulling wait what a slick idea oh okay go for it you can pull the cord back i might need a little bit off the spool no you're good i already loosened the spool a bit all right hey we're golden check this oh golden here we go one more 20 hertz 120. oh my god might have jumped the gun a little bit there 2.0 right not 2.1 i think the cable is the weak point sure particular link i think it'll do 60. that's okay though because i think i can still evaluate it like this if i just set it to 1440p 100 or something like that ooh oh active cable might not even do that no balls okay 60 then i guess i know it hurts man tvs have i get huh that's funny yeah you should be a writer oh wow i'm trying 1440 120 and it is it doesn't want to not working yeah it should do 1080 120. yeah but 1080 panel this size oh it doesn't want to do hdr 1080p 120. you gotta choose bloody cable man you got three points on the triangle and you can only choose two okay 1080p 60 hdr try that it does do like up to 800 nits or so peak brightness which isn't quite the 1000 that the alienware or the g2 does but it's still significantly brighter than the c1 or the g1 yeah other than that it's pretty similar wow though is gonna be how bright it gets relative to how bright these need to be once you swap out the camera because that's why it's so distracting because they're so much brighter than my display flipping on hdr was awful yeah it really doesn't like it it didn't give me the reverse settings i'm doing 4k 60 hd i don't think it's gonna work i think it'll work okay use hdr ready here it goes we got this balls it's a lot of it it's a lot of signal man 4k60 hdr because it switches 10-bit color but look it's got vrr and g-sync and freesync premium yeah and the size is like perfect right it's it's pretty great you assumed i was gonna settle on this one yeah hundred percent yeah eight bit okay that's fine i can live with that for this for this it's it's totally fine and you can fix this in the future yeah get it get a 2.1 cable it's not quite as good as the qdl i know but it's really close and you don't you don't want more screen like extra you just want more space so i think this is the one it fits your desk like perfectly it kind of does and the camera is in a way better spot actually we should grab obs and let's have a look at how we're doing there oh that is a way better way better angle yeah time to swap out this camera calendar asked me to point out that we haven't actually filmed the conclusion for the video repairing this broken camera and you guys can stay tuned to see that am i just using that lens and i'm just using this yeah yeah we got it we got a knee mount and or whatever and i've got the cables that should work for it power we're not 100 sure right now but i bought i brought a bunch of batteries okay so we'll use it with batteries if we have to but i think it can use the usb cable okay let's give it a shot oh cool sorry what kind of hdmi am i expecting to use here micro here oh okay yeah i have it i have a micro 2 hdmi this cable well really the receptacle on the camera side of it is the reason that these keep having to be put out of service for us because when you're shooting a video you can't rely on this tiny little screen you need an external screen that's big enough that you can see if the image is in focus and unplugging and replugging and unplugging replugging and strain from moving around they just all break but sitting stationary it's fine should be okay okay i can't see anything let's try deactivate activate hello oh hey there you go yeah easy peasy you want just 1080p probably right yeah i think 1080p is fine whatever's easier on the camera twitch can't do 4k anyway yeah sup david i can see that printer behind me though i got a solution you remove the printer from the room oh my god that's where the printer goes oh yeah that's not annoying right okay yeah this is way better i don't even notice them okay they could go brighter yeah having the much brighter oh man oh man well that's not gonna work oh yeah you want one a little brighter than the other that would go like eight percent sub dan hey freaking awesome wow love it we're definitely going to need to do a bit of a before and after for this this is my rode podcaster good mic just has to be in my face all the time let's give this a shot with a shotgun i do have to say i feel like i'm compensating for something a little bit right now maybe a little bit maybe a little bit it's gonna fill up you're gonna get every single part of the whole room with this thing yeah well so yes and no this is actually a pretty narrow pickup field microphone it's designed to be held by a boom operator like a solid three four feet away from the mouth of the talent so maybe but maybe not david says that this particular microphone might not have the ideal pickup pattern for an indoor application where we're going to have reflections from my voice bouncing off the wall behind me coming back to it we want more of like a a spherical pickup pattern right in front of it but at the very least we can use this to validate the concept so i think i've got this dialed in in my go xlr settings here and that's all that's left to do with monitoring see how it sounds hey now i can hear what's up guys what's up out there in radio land actually you know what it's not perfect it's definitely not perfect but if i have it like kind of here let me think up so i'll move around move around move around move around a little bit might have to go back just a touch in the meantime if i really wanted to have something like sitting in my face i could also use it like this and turn it down a little bit and there's still more echo absolutely more echo but with a little bit of treatment yeah i'm i'm i'm just gonna do it yeah i'm gonna get away with this i think i never have to think about my microphone i never have to look at it it's not in my way yeah i like it i'm doing it aside from being stuck with hdmi one of the challenges of using a tv as your computer monitor is that it won't necessarily be able to wake up properly when you come sit down and move your mouse when your tv's off it's off and the computer has no way to tell it to wake up however did we end up using the service remote or didn't use the service remote it's through an app called lg tv companion is that from lg no i don't think so i got it on github i don't know if it's going to do exactly what you want but i think it'll get pretty close basically what i can do have at least with this is that you can make your tv go into a blank state and then you use wake on land yeah you use when you turn on lan as soon as it uses your mouse as soon as it detects your mouse it'll go back on that is a really janky solution but it works okay let's give it a shot i swear to god it actually works okay so try it out turn it on touch the mouse touch the mouse hey look at that that was really fast it's because it's not like fully sleeping or anything it's just blanking the transmission but you're not going to get burned or anything because your tv is blanking and i've got it set to one minute right now but you can change the settings to like 10 minutes without any kind of motion on your keyboard or something how does this at work yeah that's kind of awesome it's actually pretty sweet right yeah that was one of my biggest complaints using a tv as a monitor this is great but that worked right yeah so open the app again how cool is jperson77 hell yeah shout out doing doing the lord's work naturally logistics will want me to take some of this stuff i borrowed back to the office so i'll just pack it all into my ltt store backpack which is finally available for order get yours today lttstore.com so durable and as much as i love my officemaster om5 it's okay the butt cushion is not firm enough for my for my butt i go through it and then it kind of goes to sleep after like an hour hour and a half so i've gone with a secret labs chair that ah complete with magnetic headrest oh yeah this is gonna be awesome i need to not put my screwdriver in my back pocket when i do that see call me chris video breaker chair or whatever i stuck a bit through the back of your chair did that not make it into the youtube cut i haven't seen her video it's definitely in the six hour cut on float plane for those of you who are wondering where and when i stream these are my botanical gardens by the way and then i think i also have my zoo here hey there we go there's my zoo usually it's on twitch and floatplane and then the archives go on floatplane.com oh look at that damn daniel i got a couple more boxes to get in oh we're nearly there wow that's awesome and over on the other side we've got you used only one power brick for 13 of them that's right yeah and now it's it's only at about 190 c so it's not going to start melting the plastic yet i hope this doesn't start a fire yeah probably not okay now what remains to be seen is whether or not they will like work hey it works let's try 99 it's blue green 50. i don't i don't know
