this is not clickbait i'm going to give a random homeless guys $10,000 today one two three four five seven nine [music] and just so we are all on the same page this is not my money this is a new weekly series where i'm getting companies to sponsor my videos and i'm giving 100 percent of what they pay me away to random people for example this video is sponsored by quid i'm doing a brand deal four quid and they paid me $10,000 and i'm taking that $10,000 and giving it to this homeless man so before i show me giving the homeless man $10,000 i need to mention quid because they were so generous enough to sponsor this video and allow this to happen quid is a new app on ios and android and it's pretty unique quid allows you to collect cards and stickers from your favorite shows like breaking bad or adventure time i like adventure time all for free i mean surprisingly it's a free app so as you see you open packs of cards and you collect cards and actually some of these cards are pretty rare there's only a limited amount which makes it kind of cool because you can trade these cards back and forth with your friends and you know you can just try to collect all these cards and if you really like a show collect the cards to that show and to make it even more interesting and the part that i personally like about the app is that you can send these cards through text messages you can actually drag and drop them onto text messages and you know me and my roommate have watched adventure time before so it's kind of fun just to send them some of those or i'm sure a lot of you have seen breaking bad or know someone who loves breaking bad you could you know open some packs and send them that it's just a cool way to interact with other people that like the same shows that you even just you know send cards like that through text and i don't know i find it pretty cool if any of that interests you it will be linked on the top line of description please download quit and make sure you add me my name is mr. beast but instead of a t on the end it's an arc because mr. beast was taken and a please just whenever you finish watching download quit they are they were just so gracious to sponsor this video and i want to make sure that you guys support them in return so i guess that's a good problem to have when your money in your envelope so there's $10,000 in this live look you know he's probably going to think you stole this money i'm an undercover cop and just kidding you don't look like a cop at all look at those they flip flop beachbum have an ass oh wait dad for me

family left really i'll move the green bills and do that with roberts got laid off basically ran out of money can stay hotels anymore and became homeless and it's a hard hole i still get this it's a hard hole to dig to get yourself out of you know you can't wash your clothes fix hours yeah it's so hard like it's so easy to get in the situation and so working hard to get out i can't relate i really haven't played too frivolous this is amazing man yeah i've done still waiting some coming a year oh man normally stay around here you just all over dreams real man like outside you can't i used to say it like the roadway man and it's just like i places so filled with drugs and hisses a little jungle is almost better just like when you came to sustain a tent and still working his craziness at shelter then you got to move the lock to keep the one you off everything else this is how i know what stage in my life this is like a nod to start yeah well i'm sure they are interested what do you think you would end up there with it i'm gonna get my [ __ ] together man i'm gonna i don't have anything about how you're getting them moffat or something to get transportation that are getting sad

job /g so we all went out to eat and you know talked and got to know each other i don't have much more footage because i didn't want to be like hey so tell me about living in a tent you know shoving a camera in his face the whole time just didn't seem genuine and you know i just wanted to treat him like a normal person so i didn't shove a camera in his face the whole time but you know he told me his story and you know how he got laid off and how that facilitated to where he is and basically the money's his you know the $10,000 is completely his all i made him promise me was that he would not spend it on drugs and he would not spend it on excessive alcohol you know like you know a beer or two is fine just nothing more and he promised me he wanted so as long as he's not spending it on substances i don't care what he spends it on he can all give it all away that was my only concern and you know substance abuse wasn't the reason he became homeless so i'm not really worried about him abusing it because he didn't have problems with him really in the past so you know we also started to plan his budget you know he's still debating between moped or cheap car he told me he's planning on getting a job in construction that's where he worked in the past before he got laid off and once he gets that here in north carolina you know rents pretty cheap so he can get you know house for like 500 not a house but i could duplex or you know one or two-bedroom place for like five seven hundred dollars a month and he told me he wanted to bring his mom down and you know because his mom's not in the best situation either provide for her take care of her in exactly one month i'm going to do a follow-up video with them so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss the follow-up video and if you are a brand or a company i want you to sponsor my next one of these videos i want to do a series where i just give away money to people you know we could pay off someone student loan we can give a hundred people $100 don't care what we do you know you could tell me what you want me to do any companies out there and i'll do it and i'll shout you out like a shout out would give you you
