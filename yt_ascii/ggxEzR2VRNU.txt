i thought it's a bit of fun we could extend what we've done already you don't have to watch the videos you might want to go back and watch the previous videos later on we certainly here in western europe when we utter a tend to be happy with subject verb object order the man goes to town it's really quite common across a lot of languages what we've done is put together a vocabulary with lots of silly things in it like the dog the man the robot for the subject bit kick stroke for the verb and the object of course is the the thing that these actions are done on so you can have the robot kick the dog whatever you like but then we got to thinking subject verb object is this favored by all beings in the universe are there some beings out there that regardless of the actual details of the language and the words be it finnish english french spanish don't like subject verb object orderings they'd like to do it a weird way around how about object subject verb so instead of saying the man goes to town as we would say to town the man goes sounded to me 20 years ago when i first stumbled on this very much like yoda the jedi master for those of you coming into this cold and direct because you saw the word yoda and grepped over the entire universe for what this could possibly mean you landed back here in nottingham and you're finding that we've done a yoda syntax transformer we started off by doing the furry grammar and being able to make up sentences like the robot stroked to furry dice but we didn't do anything with it all we did in those early ones but there are details there you might find it interesting to say how is it decided that the robot stroke to fairy dice is in some sense legal and okay because that's what we've done we're basically saying it's okay you use rule four use row three use rule six so we were sitting there struggling wondering what would be what you typically do in a compiler we've analyzed what's wanted in a compiler you generate code so what's our code generation because we're not doing anything at the moment our code generation is going to be so simple it's going to be take the subject verb object parse tree as it's called for the input sentence swap around the object to the front leave the subject in the middle and the verb at the end so it's quite a good exercise on how to hang your actions off what's called the yak grammar that implements this and i think you might actually enjoy that so just for a bit of fun in this limited vocabulary of words we've got what we're going to do is analyze the input and say have you really put this in in subject verb or object boring order and if you have done that correctly then as the action of our parser we will yoda rise it we will turn it into yoda order and put it out that way i just wish we had a speech synthesizer in here sean bring one with you next time so that we could speak it but let's see i have got a compiled up program to do all of this it is called yoda it's waiting for input the standard sentence the one we like best of all in this silly grammar we've put together is the robot stroked two furry dice so that shall be our first test piece furry dice oh look at that not only has it analyzed for me which rules in the grammar were used to analyze our subject verb object sentence and to be happy that it is in svo order that's a necessary starting point but then the transformation the action of our brilliant yoda compiler if you like is yoda says to fairy dice the robot stroked so in other words we have picked out from the input sentence what the object was at the end we've promoted that to the front then we've left the subject out the next piece after that and the verb comes last two fairy dust robot stroke go on ask me another one shawn let's see if it works well let's go for a very clear simple one the dog bit the man the dog bit the man happy with the analysis looks slightly different to last time but it is still subject verb object yoda would say the man the dog a bit i think that works don't you sean you do you've always got to say well even in that reordering is it clear who's getting bitten yeah we're very clear that that is a subject it is the dog biting the man still yes because this grammar has this one cute phrase of stroke two furry dies i've fred i've called the whole grammar furry but this is yoderized furry speak now so maybe we need people to contribute to this and expand its vocabulary we're putting out a zip file full of all of the lex and yak files that make this up some of you could try out and re re-run the whole thing if you've got linux systems basically even for those of you that haven't i'm also including the intermediate and complete c program file that those preprocessors generate so you could always come in the middle try compiling the c file it will probably be okay don't get frustrated by missing libraries if you're on unix or linux you should be okay if you follow the instructions for those of you brave souls running c on either windows or macintosh i've been out on the web and looked up and you can get it to work but what happens is people translate the tools but forget about the libraries but never mind let's see where we get to and i hope you all have a lot of fun with us i've even included the binaries for 64-bit intel based linux here some of you may even be able to just execute those just i don't know but many of you might want to recompile the c and hopefully if the libraries are there you know you may be able to get the whole thing working again once you've succeeded in getting the basic thing going you may want to have a lot of fun making yoda's vocabulary much more star wars related i've come off the furry grammar that i was already doing just as a bit of a silly very elementary exercise but now you could you could fill up your vocab strings with jedi lightsaber death star all this kind of stuff sean has just pointed out to me they're not called robots in star wars they're called droids is that right so you can translate the word robot into droid or you could even come backwards you know if you to speak you give we want it back as svo subject verb object so back from yoda ordering back into english ordering will be another thing to do translator a translator yeah if i go from london and then subtract england and then add i don't know japan we'd hope for tokyo we'd hope for tokyo and we get tokyo we get tokyo twice weirdly
