before i go into documentary filmmaking full-time i was a professional photojournalist if i'm being totally honest i love the intimacy of shooting stills in a way that's pretty hard to replicate with all the gear and technical challenges that come from shooting video but even though i love photography and still do i saw both the creative and financial opportunities and video that i wanted to explore so i made the transition and i haven't looked back but even though photography is still in my opinion some of the best possible training for filmmakers the two things aren't quite the same so in this video i'm going to get into six of the tips and tricks that help me wrap my head around the move from stills to motion a little easier at the end i'll go over the two camera accessories i'd add to your kit right away that most photographers don't usually own and that took me years to figure out on my own so hopefully it saves you some time let's get into it foreign hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing make sure to transition that subscribe button because i've got new videos like it coming out every week okay so before i get right into these tips i want to start with some words of encouragement if you're a still shooter who wants to do more video work but the whole thing feels overwhelming don't worry about it i was exactly the same for me when i started and i made it work if you've been taking photos for a while you already have a massive advantage over other people starting from scratch and you probably have way more skills than you think you do right now in fact i'd go so far as to say that the photographers already have a handle on the hardest skills you need to be a good documentary filmmaker and that learning all the technical stuff is actually the easy part photographers have a sense of framing and composition they understand light they know how a camera works and can set a good exposure they understand the idea of visual storytelling and most importantly they know how to interact with people in front of their camera because at the end end of the day documentary filmmaking is really just about taking pictures of people you don't know to tell the story and you can learn most of the technical stuff over time using youtube and some practice so don't stress you've got this and by remembering these simple tips next time you're shooting video you'll be comfortable with it in no time the first thing i'd say is that the biggest difference between photo and video is the idea of moments versus sequences in photography the aim is to tell the best story possible all within one frame it's all about capturing the decisive moment when something amazing happens then freezing that moment in time video by comparison tells stories through sequences of shot stitched together it's a wide variety of shots from wides mediums and tights and when i started shooting video that was one of the hardest things to get the hang of my tendency was always to find that one incredible frame and then hold it there for a long time or maybe count to 10 seconds and then cut then look for the next great frame this makes things tough in the edit where what you really want are options to choose from you want the wide shot of the whole room and then the medium over the shoulder shot of the conversation in dialogue then maybe a tight on the character's fidgeting hands you have to think about building out the whole mood of a scene through through different shots each of which tell us a little bit about what's happening rather than looking for that one banger of a shot where the light is just perfect get those shots too but make sure you're shooting for coverage and you'll be much happier in the edit quick tip here when you're just learning you might try not cutting between each shot and instead just sort of flow with the action i shoot this way now and for my photographer's brain it helps me remember that i'm covering a dynamic moment rather than looking for frames and sometimes the best stuff happens in those transitionary moments where you're going from someone's hands to their face or another moment of transition and that's a good lead into the second tip i'd give you which is to think about embracing movement rather than freezing it video is all about motion obviously but that might not make sense if you're used to stills it's almost like there's an extra dimension or plane to be thinking about because the way the camera moves can also add a lot to your scene push in my show that something important is happening or a pull out might be the end of a scene or talk about loneliness and a rack focus can draw our attention between things and even the way we pan and tilt and follow moving subjects all influence our story video cameras are totally free to move through the world in any direction and the faster you can stop thinking of how to freeze the moment and move with it instead the easier your transition will be i'm going to link to a video in the description from the guys over at film riot that goes into some of the most common camera moves and what they're used for so check that out for more ideas on how to move the camera with intent after movement one of the concepts i found made a big difference in my video shooting was the role that details shots plan telling a story since photography is usually more focused on decisive moments rather than sequences a lot of the storytelling instills is done in wide and medium shots because we learned so much from the environment around our subjects very exceptions obviously like portraits and macro but we're talking about making documentaries here so i'm guessing that's probably not you and so the third tip for today is details details details details and close-ups of the environment can be so useful in the edit can reveal a lot about a character in just a few seconds i've used this example on the channel before but when i was filming a doc in mexico about a pair of female assassins i noticed a mother's day card on the bookshelf in the room that said i love you mama this makes our characters so much more immediately full of depth and humanity even if we don't agree with what they do and it conveys all that in about three seconds so when you're filming your first documentary don't get so locked into your medium shot that you stop looking around the room keep your eyes out for details in the environment that speak to the larger story and get some cutaways of them whoever is doing the editing will love you for it the fourth tip today is still the one i struggle with the most as a filmmaker coming from a photojournalism background and also mainly working as a cinematographer on big budget documentaries most of my professional life has been about making images but in documentary video it's audio that's the real king of storytelling and there's just no way around it if you want to tell a story about people getting good audio isn't optional i'm sorry to say yes it adds another layer of complex do the whole process but that's just the way it is and we all have to accept it the audio will form the narrative backbone of your story and it will also cover all your cuts and posts to keep the story flowing so when you get ready to start working on your first look i'd highly suggest making sure you add a decent shotgun and some sort of wireless lavalier system to your list of essential gear all the gimbals and drones and sweet prime lenses in the world won't help you without audio so always make it a priority the good news is that audio gear doesn't go out of date nearly as fast as camera gear does so if you get some decent stuff you'll be able to use it for a long time i made a whole video about audio tools for small film crews and i'll link to that in the description too alright so now you're shooting in scenes and you've got good audio to keep the story rolling through the cuts but now you need to figure out how to transition between each of these scenes in the edit and for that you need to be shooting like an editor which means thinking about in and out points for every sequence again photo is about freezing moments and while good photo editors have a real sense of artistry when they choose which pictures to display next to each other in video you need to be moving between different environments much more fluidly that means that as you're shooting you should be constantly thinking about how you're going to get yourself out of the scene you're working on and into the next one that could be a wide shot of the outside of the building that the characters are in or a slow pullback with a drone or on a gimbal or maybe a moving character clears the frame so you have a natural cutting point there are a lot of ways to do this but remember that every scene in a movie or documentary has a beginning a middle and an end most beginners get so fixated on the middle part that they forget the other two and so shooting with them in mind is going to pay huge dividends when you start to edit the last tip for today is sort of a weird one and i know i spent the whole intro to this video talking about how as photographers you already knew cameras so you were way ahead and all of that but i sort of lied you're a liar you're a liar because even though the principles of photography which i mean the shutter aperture and iso triangle are the same between photo and video cameras the truth is that you need to forget most of what you know when you shoot video i don't want to get bogged down in technical details here so i'm going to keep it simple in general all you should set your shutter and iso at the start of a shoot and then probably not change them again no matter what the light does in photography i would adjust these settings independently all the time for specific looks and purposes but in video it's really only the aperture that sees much use your shutter speed should stay fixed at double the frame rate you're shooting in meaning that if you're shooting in 24 frames a second you'd want to set your shutter speed to 148th or 150th of a second and leave it there going into detail about why this is would totally derail this video so i'll just find a good explanation on youtube somewhere and link to it in the description but for now let's just accept that this is true for most shooting situations next most cameras have a native iso unless you really need to i generally wouldn't recommend changing it while you can push the iso pretty hard in stills and still get clean results video files are much less flexible and tend to fall apart fast when pushed past what they were designed for of course you can go a stop or two up but it's not like it's going to ruin your story but video gets grainy and ugly very quickly when boosted and i would suggest that if all possible you figure out what the native iso is and leave it there for best results my sony fx3 camera has a dual native iso of 640 and 12 800 and in the last year of shooting it full time i've never purposely shot on anything but those two numbers when i shoot stills i change the iso all the time so it's actually pretty different in that sense all this means that your main exposure tool is your aperture but then how can you get those cinematic shallow depth of field images you always see in movies if you have to shoot at f11 to compensate for the sun well the answer to that is a perfect segue into talking about some of the gear i'd suggest adding to your kit as soon as possible [music] the good news is that most stills cameras already have amazing video options these days but how do we get around the fact that we have just too much light coming into our sensor at lowestofts the answer is one of these a variable nd filter i know that filters are not exclusive to video and lots of photographers use polarizers and nd especially the landscape people but in a doc video a variable nd pretty much lives on my camera at all times and in the case of my main professional camera the sony fx9 there's actually one built on top of the sensor internally in the camera the variable nd basically just allows you to lower exposure without any noticeable effects or color tints to the picture because our shutter speed and iso are pretty much locked whenever we want to shoot at f2a in the middle of the day we need something to help cut the light think of them like sunglasses for your camera and they're really the only way you can have a shallow depth of field and bright conditions the next thing i'd recommend is a major quality of life booster and that is a top handle there are a lot of options out there but a top handle is great both for making the camera more versatile in terms of shooting positions but also because it can make your footage a lot more stable holding your camera like a stills camera can lead to all sorts of micro jitters and shaking that is usually way less noticeable if you're holding the camera by the top handle i suggest taking a look at a company like tilta or small rig for these and i'll link to some of those in the description the one i'm using is from wooden camera and i absolutely love it it's built like a tank but it's also crazy expensive and i'm guessing most people aren't going to want that i'll link to it in the description too but tilt and small rig are usually much more affordable and most of the way they are in terms of quality even with just these basic two things the top handle and a variable nd filter you're already going to make your stills camera so much more functional when it comes to shooting video they'll open up a bunch of different shooting positions and help you nail your exposure while still keeping a cinematic depth of field and luckily neither of these things are too expensive when compared with new lenses or bodies and the sooner you accept how much more gear you're going to have to carry around now that you've chosen to get into video the bed so kiss your mobility your lower back and your carry-on luggage only days goodbye you're a filmmaker now that's it six tips i wish i knew when i was just making the jump from photo to video and some of the tools that will help make it a bit easier even though shooting stills is one of my favorite things in the world even now making the switch from photo to video is one of the best professional moves i ever made if you're willing to go through the learning process and stick with it it's going to open up a whole new world of creative possibilities and job opportunities so stick with it hope you found that one helpful and if you did think about liking the video or subscribing to the channel for more like it every week it really does help me or maybe think about checking out this other video i made about six pieces of affordable gear that are super useful for documentary filmmakers see ya for me [music] [music]
