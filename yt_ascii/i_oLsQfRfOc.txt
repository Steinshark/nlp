come on twitch give me 4k already 20 bucks for premium are you kidding me netflix [music] minus jeez don't do it rtx vsr upscale look wow this is amazing put away your wallets friends because with a free driver update nvidia rtx 30 and 40 series gpus can use ai to upscale any video you play back in a web browser to 4k even this message from our sponsor zoho1 zoho one brings together sales marketing finance analytics and support in a single unified platform to run your entire business try zoho one today for 30 days using the link below nvidia's latest driver update version 531.18 showed up with a pretty cool and free feature called rtx video super resolution or vsr which is not to be confused with amd's virtual super resolution aka vsr using a 30 or 40 series graphics card and a chromium-based browser so it's chrome and edge for now with plugins expected for others down the line you can take streamed content with resolutions as low as 3 6 60p and upscale them in real time all the way to 4k now obviously we can't just take nvidia's word for this so we collected a library of screen capture from a variety of genres and sent it to mark our editor and resident upscaling nerd to see if he could spot the differences and while we wait i am going to try it for myself we've got not one not two but three displays hooked up to our rtx 3050 graphics card we chose the 3050 because it's the least expensive card with support for the new feature for now it could conceivably come to 20 series in the future since they also have the tensor cores that vsr relies on but i wouldn't hold my breath for my test i'll be watching the same youtube video on my three identical screens but one is going to be youtube's 1080p just blown up to full screen and firefox which if you recall doesn't currently support vsr one is going to be youtube's 1080p upscaled to 4k with vsr and the last one will play at youtube's native 4k i did it again i'm back i'm ready but we did skip something important setting it up once you've got the right gpu and the latest driver you simply enable it in the nvidia control panel under adjust video image settings you're going to want to set rtx video enhancement to on and then quality level 1 is low with quality level 4 being the highest the community consensus is that one kind of sucks two and three suck less than one and four is pretty good so we've gone with four this is a pretty recent video i can already tell that this is crap hold on no i think i was wrong i think that's crap hey be nice this is way harder than it should be this is almost certainly native 4k that's bad that's upscaled 4k 1080p upscale yeah the truth is though the only reason i can tell is that i noticed the artifacts because i'm looking for them if i wasn't looking for them holy crap yeah the one on the right is it's it's just less sharp but like wow even text it's just sharper everything is sharper what's most surprising to me is how well it handles things that are supposed to be out of focus anything that's blurred in the background with this bokeh kind of softness still is that big gray wall there's nothing you can do about low bit rate weight i actually like the ai version better than the native 4k one come check this out quick quick quick quick oh i meant ploof but yeah it's okay david i thought he met you too you can see kind of a smeariness it's better than the banding you're right it actually looks better wait wait till after look at this look at this though it goes along the wall i noticed it here yeah on the plug yeah yeah yeah i would probably want to apply this filter to native 4k content just low bit rate content you could well no you can that's the thing and you actually can't even check whether it's running or not kind of cam and you kind of can in the meantime let's try something a little bit more challenging 1080p looks fine enough it doesn't really need to be upscaled ncix number 20. yeah you look so cold i noticed that he didn't say cool it's because you don't have a beard yet yeah not biased at all look how much sharper that license plate is that's pretty cool obviously it's not making this text readable but whether i can read it or not it's not as noticeably just a blurry mess actually is it more readable holy crap it is this guy is good he's got a promising career ahead of him i don't think it's working right now you don't think so no we can check i'm 99 sure it's not working oh so it's the 3050 so we're not going to see a power spike so we actually need to go to gpu usage well we should see some power it like barely change it almost doesn't change on the 3050. the 3070 and the 3080 were hitting like 90 usage right oh it's using the 3d barely though but it's also wait it looks better now see this license plate is actually like clarity-ized now the skin smoothing yeah is not always natural especially with more challenging source material like this but the box this cable look at the rubber grommets definitely cleaned up no it's working look at the keyboard too way sharper oh yeah the mouse this looks like a blurry blob that looks like an actual mouse yeah i noticed it mostly on the license plate and then on the looks way cleaner right you're right the headlights too yeah it's definitely working on the 3050. yeah i just i thought are we gonna get a bunch of videos then all right we're gonna get eight but we're not gonna get nine yeah i don't think that was realistic yeah script review went a little long we were playing around with vsr too much that was work it was work exactly exactly it's that cool it's really cool what about non-youtube though right theoretically this should work on anything streaming through a chromium web browser but that raises a lot of questions what about plex what about drm protected content like netflix i i don't know i have premium so i had to create a new netflix account in order to test this but once i did and i was streaming at 720p the difference is well in seinfeld not that noticeable because david yes as you pointed out when we were talking off camera it's already been digitally enhanced so what we found is that it doesn't really seem to do anything you know i'm noticing it more now ploof the film grain is kind of like coming in and out of existence that's that's what was happening with malcolm in the middle yeah that's really unfortunate it just doesn't know how to handle it because it thinks it's i'm pretty sure it thinks it's an object and it's like oh i gotta sharpen that object yeah but no it's film grain you should be trying to denoise or i could think that it's blocking and it's trying to smooth it sure yeah quite undesirable but if we take something relatively new that's just running at a lower resolution holy crap 720p up to 4k this looks incredible if you told me this was 720p i would tell you to piss off you can see it though when the van was just going past there there was a bunch of smearing on the very tail end of the winnebago i wouldn't notice it if i was just watching the video though especially from a little oh and the grass there it's it was getting confused with the smoke and the grass in front but yeah when i'm looking for it man i can see it yeah obviously if we pause it we're gonna find problems but in motion look at the calculator watch just all the tree branches it's sharp stuff oh yikes that wobble there on the badge it does look sharper than it should but it's clearly getting confused yeah look at smithers wobbling around here some of the lines also get a little too thin or thick on the cell shading because it doesn't know what to do with it yeah i think anyway it doesn't know what to do even look look at the money the money flickering and we can we can a b test this easily by just opening up the control panel and then turning it off and hitting apply there's still some wobble it might just be the animation when like the frames because it's all on moving stuff right and so they're actually doing the frame and everything you just have really no that's that's in the original video yeah oh i don't think it does much for simpsons i think it's too simple of a cartoon it's really you know solid colors and blocks right people were reporting that older animes were looking a lot sharper and cleaner but i haven't checked anything out yet i'm going down to 480p i just want to see this this movie has such a unique animation style i want to see how it handles it honestly though i would take this over not upscaled back this back wall here and stuff okay okay now we go back 20 seconds it's still kind of bad it's pretty bad it's better but we're pushing the absolute limits of what it can do this is an extremely challenging scenario just because of the way the shading is done in this movie the way the textures kind of naturally look blocky in a lot of cases i would definitely just have this on all the time if i watch stuff like this you think so yeah even with your 4k monitor with your high internet bandwidth and no no well yeah but sometimes it's down to what content is available if you're watching older shows that are simply not available in 4k or even 1080. yep i'd want it on there's definitely some artifacting particularly around edges or in between and around fast moving objects in text but it works and it does so in real time shockingly well so how does it work i mentioned rtx tensor course before these are machine learning specialized hardware blocks they're actually the same ones that nvidia uses for their dlss game upscaling technology but instead of making your game look sharper they're using them to remove blocky compression artifacts while upscaling video content like dlss each frame gets analyzed and then checked against nvidia's deep learning network which has been trained on a wide variety of content then rendered the way the machine thinks it should be unlike dlss this is solely using the lower resolution video frame as its input data and it only works on video content so there's no motion vectors or depth buffers to work with no game engine data nothing and they want to make it very clear that vsr is using a completely different algorithm really it's a lot more like video enhanced ai from topaz labs an upscaler that we've used before except instead of selecting from a bunch of presets and change values depending on how aggressive you want the upscaler to be you're left with a simple on off switch and then an opaque quality drop down video upscaling typically works by using an interpolation algorithm to make up the empty space that would be left if we upscaled a 1080p frame which is roughly 2 million pixels to a 4k frame which is over 8 million those extra pixels they don't just automatically get filled in whether it's the display your computer or a media playback device like a blu-ray player or the nvidia shield it's something needs to first analyze the signal source resolution then hopefully apply noise reduction followed by edge and texture sharpening to produce a clearer image the way deep learning changes this approach involves using algorithms that analyze video qualities like line light and color it is constantly learning and improving the more that it's used to create a more correct final frame with fewer mistakes and artifacts so it will look at an image and detect blurry objects then try to guess what the objects are and if they're supposed to be blurry or not and fill in the missing pixels we saw this firsthand with dlss 1.0 it worked but it looked pretty awful in scenarios that had lots of little lines close together like chain link fences since then dlss has massively improved and i am hoping that we will see something similar here just like i'm hoping to see some of our new desk pads hitting your desks the next time we inevitably roast your setups lttstore.com this tech is exciting for the reasons we've shown you already like saving money on a 4k netflix subscription but also for some less obvious ones twitch for example does not offer any way to broadcast or view in 4k but we found that vsr does an amazing job of sharpening up the image whether it's just great technology or nvidia's gaming heritage showing here we're not sure but the bottom line is that it works really well even those ads looked better there's other use cases too what about rural users who might even have a library of premium high resolution content but are concerned about bandwidth use older content is another area where vsr shines or doesn't broadly speaking the community is loving the effect on streams of older standard deaf anime but we fired up some malcolm in the middle which looks like it was shot on 16 millimeter film and nvidia's current upscaling solution doesn't seem to play nicely with all the film grain it's shockingly bad even though our source is 1080p it manages to look worse when we upscale to 4k similarly when we were upscaling the simpsons it seems to get a little confused by the cell shading and i would say at best results in no real improvement so what's the drawback nothing's ever free right well while our rtx 3050 seems content with upscaling at a similar wattage to what it uses while just playing back video the rtx 3080 in my workstation that we used when we were reviewing the script was a completely different story obscaling 720p netflix i saw anywhere from 80 to 120 watts of power usage but upscaling 1080p 60fps twitch like this saw my power settle in at over 300 watts on the gpu alone that was without an obvious difference in upscaling quality compared to this 3050. unfortunately for many people around the world then that's a trade-off they might not be willing to make not everyone seems to be seeing the same high power consumption but we can only report on what we observe and that means that if you have the same kind of power consumption we do and you have a high-end gaming pc if you watch just four hours a day of upscaled content that could cost you two hundred thirty dollars a year in the uk the eu average is just 25 cents per kilowatt hour right now which will cut that number in half but some countries like germany are right alongside the uk i mean at that point you might as well just pay for the premium subscription it's nearly as energy intensive as mining except this time there's no cash reward to offset the power usage when we monitor the gpu usage of the card though we can see why it's happening rather than taxing the gpu's video decoding block it's actually hitting the 3d rendering hardware that means that if you're a multi-tasker and you like to have a twitch stream up on your second monitor while you are gaming vsr is going to have a significant impact on your actual gaming performance the good news is that depending on the resolution of your secondary monitor vsr is unlikely to be active at all times nvidia can detect both the quality of the source file and the window size of the player what that means is vsr is only turned on where it's warranted and you can see this with our gpu usage as i go from windowed mode to full screen mode it's not perfect at the moment it works about as well as if you upscale the video file with the artemis preset in video enhanced ai but that's not real time and it's something that you have to premeditate right so this is pretty sick but you can expect a lot of blur around boxes of text people can look a little too soft or too plasticky and trying to upskill from lower resolutions is still like trying to squeeze blood from a stone but for our first try technically second if you count the nvidia shield pro it does a pretty good job and i am thoroughly impressed impressed by this segue to our sponsor
