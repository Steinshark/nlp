[music] hey what is up guys mtv hd here happy thanksgiving and welcome to q&a number 22 aka number 11 of 12 for this year 2017 we've done it every month it's november one more after this and then we'll see where it goes so i asked you guys on twitter as i usually do what you wanted to know and side note if you aren't already following on twitter you're definitely gonna want to do that in the next couple days i don't want to say too much but that's about all giveaway i'll link it below so andris wants to know thoughts on net neutrality situation so honestly i have a lot of thoughts on this whole net neutrality thing first of all okay if that bothered you even a little bit then you should brush up on the whole net neutrality vote that's happening yet again it's almost unbelievable that we continue to have this debate but at the same time it is kind of believable so it's happening again i'll link below the beste guide or information portal that i can find to explain everything but bottom line it sucks shen asks what are your top games in the past month that you've played on that bad ass omen that's a great question i think the most common like the most amount of playtime i've actually put into a game is actually probably that vr game super hot the omen is set up right now as our htc vive set up and in that little area over there we've played a game called super hot which is basically a game of like dodging bullets but time only moves when you move so you can choose when to dodge things it's really exciting and fun to play i also played a game called project cars we got a wheel for it we got a pedal it's paddle shifting it's the whole deal it's pretty fun but that high refresh rate monitor over there is killing it with the omen a lot of fun black friday question mark question mark or cyber monday question mark yeah i'm gonna go with cyber monday on this one and again i don't want to say too much but you're probably gonna want to follow on twitter wink wink on your razor video you had rocket league wallpaper do you enjoy playing the game what's your rank if any i didn't know there was ranks or was it just a coincidence for the yeah i've played rocket league a little bit now the catch is i actually play it most often on my ps4 pro on the wallpaper tv so i play the console version but that's what i'm familiar with the controls with now and i think i've gotten pretty good at it it's mostly my defense that has earned me a rep i don't score very much i don't know my rank but that is a fun game and they can it look like i have tons of time for games now i really still don't i don't game that much like i've played pub g twice ever haven't won yet i'm just saying my instagram feed three days ago three day this guy's made a very good use of the extra character as you get on twitter now but i agree with you dude i actually hate that instagram moves things out of chronological order that's one of the reasons i like twitter and hate the stock twitter app is because things get shuffled i want to make sure i see everything and the only way to do that is to go in order from top to bottom or bottom to top i wish there was an option instagram i could turn that off but there isn't i hate it this guy said why should i ask a question to be in the vid i see what you did there despite all the positivity surrounding the roadster - what's one thing you aren't a fan of that's a good question there's a lot of hype surrounding that car of course i think the one thing most people will point to is the interior it's so not like any other supercar i don't know if you've ever seen the inside of a lamborghini aventador or a mclaren or pretty much any high-end supercar like that definitely way different the tesla has more of a spaceship vibe gone with it but that still doesn't speak to every car person but my one complaint would actually be i wish shows a little more a little more carbon-fiber a little more actual carbon fiber parts but that's just me muhammad says why don't you shoot an' by 9 dude i've thought about it a lot i don't know if you've seen i'll link jon's tld today his his iphone 10 review was shot in two by one and he doesn't even shooting two by one that much but he did and there were so many shots in it that made me go now i want to shooted two by one that looks like fun and the conversation around content is well if all of our phones if all of our screens in our pockets are gonna be two by one now then we might as well start making these two by one aspect ratio videos which look really cool but i still think the majority of people will watch it on computers will watch it on tvs and of course phones are very popular but i don't think there's gonna be any problem with shooting 16 by 9 at least for the time being armando says would you ever go on to the h3 podcast if you were invited no i would never go of course i would go on the h3 podcast bas 3m says how many terabytes did you record slash upload this month while i only upload the final version which is 5 6 gigs tops per video but how many terabytes that i record this i would actually have to go back and check which i'll do that but my guests before i go back and check would be i would i'm gonna go with about five terabytes let's go with five [music] can you put us on to some of your favorite ultimate tech gear are there any high tech frisbees you know what i actually tend to be like the opposite of a tech person when i'm playing ultimate a lot of people wear like a wearable to keep track of like their heart rate and their steps i don't like wearing that stuff when i play cuz it feels like in the way and clunky so i don't have any wearable tech i don't really like have my phone on me obviously when i'm playing the closest thing i can think of is like the cameras and the footage that people use to record ultimate which is like the super sweet slow-mo clips but yeah there's there's really not that much tech as far as ultimate goes that i really know of hey but if you want to watch a bunch of really sweet super slow-motion ultimate basically highlight reels where it's really good quality ultimate and really good quality footage this channel that i'll link below is an amazing combination of that if you can go check it out that would be awesome prepare to have your mind blown out of your face well says are you getting the imac pro yeah the thing is like i've thought about this more they apple when they announced imac pro they said december i'm pretty sure for this year but then they said the new modular mac pro that they're also gonna make was 2018 so next year and when i saw that i kind of figured like oh well you know that's just december and then january we'll get that right afterward but that's probably not what's gonna happen 2018 probably means like november december of next year so i think i'm at pro wolff for me be the workhorse for that time and i probably will end up moving to the mac pro but i'm gonna give the on mac pro a shot rumors are already circulating of course about the next iphone and its name what do you think apple will call it and what would you like to see in the next iphone also how do you think apple will design it i kind of think we'll see like a similar iphone 10 to this year but i do want to see an iphone 10 plus but what do they call it is it just iphone 11 there been rumors that they'll stick with an ips iphone and an oled iphone again side by side so like iphone 9 and iphone 11 but that what happens when the ips one moves to ten do you do that they don't that's a good point that is a good point yeah it's not the move well we always have these questions of apples naming schemes but they always seem to pull it off so i guess we'll just wait and see the detroit borg says every year seems to have a trend and he's right 2017 was the year of no bezels what will define 2018 phones and i know look i can't tell the future so i'm just really speculating if i guess but there's something i really liked about this phone the razor phone and that is our 120 hertz displays i would love for every phone next year to have an hundred twenty hertz ola if that's even possible i'd love it but what i really honestly think we'll start to define phones of next year is artificial intelligence adding features via software there were low key a lot of things in this past year that became possible because of machine learning and ai that weren't in previous phones the portrait mode from the front-facing camera the incredible single lens rear facing portrait mode from the pixel to the dot projector from the iphone 10 and face id all that stuff even though an emoji seemed really dumb again a lot of this stuff was only possible through machine learning sap says your top 5 social media platforms in order i'm assuming you're talking about like my favorites favorite ones in which case it would be twitter i guess would be number one instagram wait does eat is a youtube a social network can i i probably put yeah youtube's a social network so youtube number one twitter number two instagram number three and then i guess i got to go facebook number for google+ number five sorry snapchat i put it away that's where i'm gonna end it thank you for your questions and thank you for watching this q&a video one more for this year and again if you're not already following on twitter i don't know what you're doing open a new tab hit that okay that's about it thanks talk to you in the next one peace [music]
