hey charles what are you doing drilling holes why you drilling a hole charles cu of jason hello everyone and welcome thank you for that fantastic introduction charles from hub mechanic.com that's my favorite thing to do so in this video we're going to be talking about four reasons why the vr6 engine is on its way out it's not actually totally dead volkswagen still used vr6 in a few of their models yeah right so we volkswagen still has it in the new atlas has it in the pat and the tag and then there is al a porsche model that uses it as well cayenne cayenne cayenne all right well i think a more appropriate thing to be talking about engines dying would be volkswagen's diesel engines i would agree heartly legitimately dead in the us now portions of them they're sort of in this weird hiatus state hanging out in random dealer lots random dealers and and stadiums sequestered to stadiums we'll say yeah just abandoned stadiums with abandoned cars so anyways we're going to talk about vr6 engines gasoline engin and why these have kind of been phased out what the latest and greatest replacement is and i think it's also important to note that the newest generation vr is actually a little bit different from this one this is a 15degrees angle the newer ones are 10.6 i think there's also some 12 degree angle so it is similar but not exactly same and this is a 2.8 and the new ones are 36 correct but that's why i have this guys as usual a white board i'm going to go over okay here come this way i i'll hold it up so here we have a comparison the new 2018 atlas offers a 2.0 l turbocharged inline 4cylinder thank you for the beautiful hands van white or a 3.6 l vr6 engine so here on the left this is the base engine that it comes with the 2 l i4 and one of the things that's cool about it is you can see this nice flat torque curve versus on the right looking at the vr6 engine's torque curve which is naturally aspirated you have a peak and so there's really one point where that engines at its most efficient and producing maximum torque versus turbocharged engines you can tune the w gate and the amount of boost that you have so that you have a perfectly flat torque curve gives you a nice linear you know throttle application you know exactly what maximum torque is for a set rpm it's the same thing going across gives the driver control and so there's a benefit there to that and you can see that it reaches that peak torque earlier on now there the vr6 does produce more power 3.6 l versus the 2 l but you're getting peak torque earlier with the 2 l four cylinder and so you know earlier on in that much more usable range this is a family what would you call it suv i don't know yeah this is a seven passenger suv seven passenger suv so it's not like you're ringing that engine out to you know with your family in the car you probably want some good mid-range torque right this is not a gti that we're we're putting the tires and burning up rubber this is a family car so if you need all-wheel drive the vr6 is the only one that offers it but if you're going with front-wheel drive version you can get the vr6 or the inline 4 i think the inline four makes more sense because of that nice beautiful torque curve now the second reason i want to talk about and of course we're going to talk about efficiency is efficiency yes and so you know clearly there are fuel economy regulations there are reasons why you want to be efficient there's reasons why you want to reduce emissions so good gas mileage is a great thing to have and that is one of the benefits of you know a smaller turbocharged engine versus a larger naturally aspirated engine so as an example going from the 2005 gt to the 2006 gti where it previously had the 2.8 l vr6 and then went to a 2 l inline fourth there's also' yes so the8 was also in 05 and then 06 the only option for the gti was the 2 l bpy that's going to be a timing belt driven direct injection 2 l turbo now we know now we know and so both of those engines 2005 vr6 2006 2 l turbocharged engine 200 horsepower the turbocharged one does hit that peak horsepower sooner and as you would imagine it hits peak torque way sooner so at 1,00 rpm you're getting 207 lb feet with the 2006 turbocharge in line 4 versus the 2005 vr6 you're getting 195 lb feet at 3200 rpm so more torque earlier with a turbo the car weighs 300 lounds more that's kind of i was surprised they added a lot of weight in 2006 to the gti it was it was a huge redesign design fattened it up it's a pig but regardless better fuel economy i didn't write the numbers on my sheet i'm gna go find those numbers i'm gonna sit here awkwardly and not talk to you and just do this to this vr6 and he's back all right so what's interesting about you know the car weighs 300 about 300 lounds more in 2006 versus 2005 with this engine here and yet it's able to achieve better fuel economy 21 in the city 29 on the highway versus is 19 in the city 27 on the highway now that's only a 2 mile per gon difference so combine 22 versus 24 but that's actually a 9% difference and when you're considering that the car is a little over you know a little under 300 lb heavier and it still has a 9% improvement in fuel economy and more torque i mean that's a pretty huge difference and i don't think it was really uncommon for people to see low 30 mile per gallon on the highway rather than that 29 that it was rated for again fuel economy depends so heavy on how how we drive it yes absolutely so number three is actually size now we're not talking the difference between a w12 and an inline 4 the vr6 footprint is actually not that much bigger than the four-cylinder that's actually one of the really awesome things about the vr is that it's only what did we measure 2 in two inches longer and an inch or so wider than a footprint of a 4 cylinder but you are also not having the enormous size of a v6 or you know width or an inline six length right so from a naturally aspirated standpoint you know you're getting a lot more power in a much smaller footprint but regardless an inline four-cylinder is smaller and yes you're adding in that turbocharger and that takes up space but space is critical when i used to be a real engineer before just doodling on whiteboards one of the tasks i had to do was design a cooling system and i was told jason here's your little box make a cooling system work in this box and so the the size of my radiator was completely restricted because i only had this much space to work with so engineers love to have extra space it gives them flexibility you know it can change your suspension geometry it can change how much steering angle you can have with those front tires if you have more space to turn them in so you know a lot of things can change based on the size of an engine it gives you a lot of flexibility you could make it nice for mechanics to work it does help it does help with technicians working on vehicles and making main doing maintenance and repairs or you could just shrink the size of the car so the mechanic has no more room to work with which let's be honest that's what the overall goal is anyway but regardless size is a benefit to the smaller four-cylinder engine which gives all kinds of benefits out there and can overall help you know if you can reduce the size of the car you can also pull out some weight and there are of course tons of benefits of removing some weight right i think by the time you get the vr6 fully constructed and then all the components to the turbocharger fully constructed the weight is not huge but even saving 50 lbs on the front end can really change the driving experience of a vehicle absolutely now the fourth thing we're going to talk about is consolidation because it's very beneficial for a company to offer less overall options it's cheaper for them to produce a larger quantity of you know one thing than five different things of that same overall quantity and so i think you can probably talk a little bit about you know the engine right options in the volkswagen world and you can actually take and do more thorough engineering a better job that's why certain car companies that may only have one option or two engine options across their entire line don't have to worry about seven different oil filters and six different air filters they have one oil filter one air filter that fits everything but when it comes to the vw engine the vws and the vr sixs as they move more towards the mqb platform which shares components exactly across the brand it does make it a lot easier to just have one engine option or two engine options across the board instead of having a eight turbo a 4-cylinder a vr6 a diesel option and all that it it it makes the car more affordable and you can really focus on that one engine and make it of better quality it drops the parts of maintenance prices because the parts for maintenance are more affordable i mean even doing maintenance speaking of maintenance doing maintenance on a four-cylinder right you lose two spark plugs so two pistons two spark plugs two pistons less oil in the crank case so everything comes down quite a bit other cool thing you know with a with a two l turbocharged engine you can put that in a gti then you can slap a bigger turbo on adjust play with your boost a little bit and put it in the golf r and you can have you know a significantly more powerful much more thrilling engine that's you know based on the same platform not a huge differentiator between like going from a 2 l turbo and then to a vr6 where you've got two completely different worlds and back in the days where this was a really common highline option you know a tune or a chip might net you 30 horsepower and 40 pound feet of torque where now when you're tuning a 2 l for 600 bucks you're getting 50 horsepower and 80 pound feet of torque and it completely changes the driving experience of the vehicle in a better way every single way possible you know as a vw enthusiast as a vr6 enthusiast my heart will always belong to the markv r32 right it is the pure r32 model in my opinion fast forward to the golf r in 2017 other than the nostalgia that i have for that markv that car is a far superior car in every way the new golf far is amazing is an amazing vehicle or you know take that into the audi line with the s4 and even audi has dropped the vr6 from their their platforms now and their highline stuff they're doing five-cylinder turbos or they're simply running modified two turbos porsche really was never huge in the vr6 world i think only the cayenne was the one that had that option that's mostly because it's essentially a tag so four good reasons there for the manufacturer and also a couple good reasons maintenance and tunability you know for those who are buying it because you know they're going to want something that they can play with for less money over all and still have some amazing improvements from ab as an enthusiast i can do more for less money on a tune as your average driver it the lifetime overall is going to be cheaper to maintain in most instances yep so i think that concludes charles is actually going to be building up this engine on his channel and putting it into his 98 gti 98 gt last year of the mark iii gti the white w the white hookie white hook white hookie okay rhymes with cookie yes and so you should subscribe to his channel i'll put a circle on his face put a circle on my face wait i think my face has to be a little lower quit moving the circle this where the circle has to be though cu they have that box where i'll put it right there and you should click on that and i'll maybe put some other videos we've done cuz we've done a good number of videos this like our 10th video i think yeah we've done you think 10 let's lay wager i think 10 okay
