ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the feed a chz grand swiss this is a monster tournament being held at the isle of man and the two top finishers make it to the candidates tournament and in case you haven't been watching any of the previous rounds the candidates tournament is the tournament where the winner emerges to play against the world champion so a lot at stake fabiano carana hikara nakamura hans nean ali resa f just to name a couple of players playing this is the round seven and8 recap and we are going to get into all the action and get a standings update as we approach the last three rounds of the tournament a couple of very quick things number one yes i look weird okay i am wearing makeup today i was at a 9h hour video shoot from 900 in the morning until like 6:00 p.m. so i haven't taking off the makeup i just came home and i'm recording this recap for you number two the book is officially a new york times bestseller it just came out yesterday in case you missed it i posted it on socials you made this possible officially recognized as a new york times bestseller along with some other advice and self-help books and that is incredible thank you all so so much in case you've gotten it and in case you haven't it's okay you got christmas it's coming up one very quick last thing if you watch this video in the first day that it's out all my courses are 25% off to celebrate the launch of the recent tactics master class the tactics master class is a course for people who are really good at puzzle solving and can't find tactics in their own games and still make blunders so check it out and that's that's all i have to say you're going to get a recap where i have a face covered in makeup so this is not going to become a consistent thing unless you tell me the comments that you like it and then i'll wear makeup every video no i won't so hans demon hans demon in round number seven was paired against sha rodrig lemu and the incredible thing about this tournament remember the top two finishers go to the candidates and sean's a 2488 rated i am which is wild right like so he might go to the candidates if he wins this whole thing hans had a setback he lost the game i believe a round or two ago it was to to vd it but then he bounced back but in this game hans channeled his inner magnus all right e4 i don't know if he still a fan of magnus after everything that happened i know he was a fan of magnus i really wonder who is hans neeman's favorite chess player besides himself c6 d4 d5 e5 so we have a caro khan and sha rodrig lemu plays bishop f5 one of the most principled lines now here at amateur level the move h4 is is extremely good first of all a lot of people just lose their bishop because they don't know what they're doing but also it's just a fun line to play you get very aggressive lines but knight f3 is the principled approach it is the main line it is the move that is played more often and then here generally black will just maneuver black will play knight d7 knight d7 black will play you know like a lot of improving moves that no sean just goes c5 c5 is the critical approach it's always been considered the main line and there's a line here which goes bishop e3 cd knight d4 targeting the bishop knight e7 defending the bishop c4 knight bc6 and then like white can you know castle put some pressure there but recently what white has been doing is just like just just castling and and not actually entering any of that forcing territory allows black to defend black to develop it basically says look you wasted time let's not forget you played a caro khan so you claimed the pawn was good here and then a few moves later he said well actually i want put on c5 like that's you can't have everything right if you're playing with black can't have everything you can play bishop f5 and c5 at the same time so castles knight c6 c3 my desk is so creaky you can't hear this but it's like i've been gone all day i'm pressing on my desk and it's just going c takes c takes knight e7 and shawn plays this move bishop e4 bishop e4 is putting pressure on this knight so he could play knight to f5 clearing up that square and put pressure here and a lot of players lose this position with white even at decent level below han's level but i'm saying like you know 22 21100 they they lose a lot because it's very difficult for white to figure out what to do with this pawn black will go there and you know hans here plays knight d2 and then here plays bishop b5 so he spends 20 minutes on that move and he has to he has to pin because it's actually kind of hard to defend this pawn for example if hans plays knight b3 black could play a5 to try to play a4 then if white plays a4 to stop a4 the bishop lives on b4 forever it's going to be impossible to get rid of you have to trade and you know maybe maybe then i'll take it anyway my point is bishop b5 is what hans chooses queen b4 and really nice move here from shawn bishop c2 deflecting the queen away from the defense of this bishop hans doesn't like that so he plays b3 he takes on c6 and then he plays bishop a3 and a couple moves later we go into an end game okay now white has to play this position right so he plays rook fc1 and then the bishop goes back to e4 now position is equal in terms of material two pieces two pieces two rooks now how is white going to win well if white even wastes one move very simple move by black you will trade and play king to d7 once the white rook cannot infiltrate on the only open file the next move for white is rook c8 white will play or sorry for black has rook c8 and white will never get anywhere the only open file is completely shut down and there is nothing there so anticipating that hans plays rook c7 and then he brings the rook and all he has to do is dominate this file hans is going to try to channel his inner magnus and win a magnesian style endgame now the reason hans doesn't play g4 here trying to remove the knight is because probably i imagine some sort of knight e7 and then you will try to get a trade or maybe rook f7 and try to trade the computer still likes the position here after a very long forcing sequ sequence of moves but hans chooses to not rush plays rook c1 plays rook b7 just wants to put both rooks look at that that's going to be a really big nightmare to deal with black cannot play rook c8 actually not because of rook e7 because then this but because of takes takes and the discovery the pin on the knight to the pawn so king f7 from shawn here comes hans b4 transferring the knight to these two squares bishop takes knight takes all right now hans drops back rook c5 look at that move now if black takes you're going to infiltrate here with a pawn rook b8 rook d7 no trade now at this point sea actually fought back chan did a nice job fighting back and hans had to trade off one of the two rooks so the position is all of a sudden maybe getting closer to equal and sha sees that he can't guard his pawn so he takes the file hans grabs the pawn rook c1 check the king is deflected but here comes rook c2 now which pawn is it better to part with hans chooses the pawn near the king because that will leave him with a b pawn now hans five pawns versus five pawns but he's got a b pawn to run so he plays rook b7 squeezing water from a stone can he pull this off this is like this would be really school of magnesian school of chess rook b2 hans invites the knight into the position but suddenly white has one small winning chance and it's rook b8 check king f7 and b7 and the point is that even though white can't move it's a little bit tough for black to move too if you take i just get my knight in you go king e7 i have rook g8 i'll zip right out of there so knight f5 black comes out but now g4 the only winning try takes takes and hans plays g5 securing the control of these squares anywhere the pawn moves the knight gets to the e5 square and now h4 using literally all his resources this really is the way magnus would play this position pawn takes he grabs the pawn now h hans has an h hands my god i said that like a southerner you see that boy hands nean that's my that's my that's my arkansas accent sorry arkansas people if that's not how you sound i don't know i've never been to arkansas i don't even think it's a real place i'm going to offend all 17 of my little rock arkansas viewers king g7 and i was just getting it done h6 nothing you can do little force field little red carpet here king g2 he runs his king up the board and knight h7 check king f7 rook g7 deflects hans wins a very nice game and that allows me to get hans and magnus in the title right because hans won a completely equal thank you hans i mean if hans just won this game 25 moves i don't know what i would say i would say i would say hans wins like a machine no can't say that all right next one cind adov versus vidit this is a very big game e4 knight f3 knight c6 bishop c4 bishop c5 d3 d6 c3 bishop b6 a4 a5 takes takes and we have an e4 e5 we have an italian we also have an usc and an indian guy and they're playing at the aisle of man isn't chess just a beautiful global game knight h4 white has double center pawns white has the active file here the the open f file and vidit strikes in the center to put a knight there to put pressure on e3 java here plays queen f3 knight f6 and oh just look at this position for white i mean what a what what an awesome looking position he's going to double he's going to put his knight on c4 hitting the queen he's going to play h3 he's going to put his knight on five it's going to be really nice look at this h3 look at java here to go what a what a knight he's going to play knight f1 knight e3 boom boom nice attacking game right he's he's he calling the shots against vidit vid defending himself and then here java here just says you know what take my pawn vidit i don't want my pawn i don't need it i'm going to checkmate you vit says okay where's okay i'll take the pawn javak here says h4 vid's like what what about these pawns now here plays knight takes e but vidit like what about the two pieces i got both knights you know they say two pieces for a rook usually better for the two pieces but java here plays h5 look the bishop is trapped but come on you know vidit watches gotham so in this position vidit had to play rook takes d3 it's not even a sacrifice i don't even have to yell it it's not a sacrifice because if rook takes d3 bishop takes e4 my point is vid has seen not actually not bishop takes e4 i guess queen takes takes c4 would be better or even knight take ah it's it wouldn't be bishop takes c4 be why actually i'm kind of confused why can't the knight wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa now i don't understand oh well that's why i'm commentating the games right and not yeah not actually it's been a long day i'm yeah so the idea of rook takes d3 if if you take is actually not this you take because if this that's a fork so that's how you get the full rook because if takes then this okay terrific terrific yes yes there you go guys so plays rook takes d3 java here plays bishop takes f7 he's trying to deflect the bishop from the defense of the rook vd just cool common collected and uhoh vid's just in a better end game not only is vid in a better end game he's got two pieces and he's got a whole lot of pawns right he's got these two pawns that are ready to come down the board this really does not feel like much of a pa i mean that pawn's that doesn't really count so he's got all of this to work with my friends eight or nine times out of 10 two pieces are going to beat a rook and this is no exception yes java here plays very well with what he has but he doesn't have enough black has two pieces so you know what black is going to do black is going to bring those two pieces forward he's just going to make sure that nothing gets blundered over here you cannot take because of knight f5 look at that and now he just goes b5 king f4 look at that everything defends everything else he pushes the pawn gets to b2 java here one squore away as well but vidit check c6 defending everything rook takes b2 is possible but even though you can take this pawn you will have to lose that one you cannot defend it because of the bishop and in this position javaher sarov just resigned the game he resigned the game because the pawn guards the bishop and the bishop escorts that pawn there is nothing to be done nothing except except crack my neck oh i've been sitting all day vidd gui now leads the fed grand swiss he lost the first round and since then he has been on a monster run he defeated hans nean he defeated jair defeated a ton of play vi krati from india that would be a sleeper pick for the candidates that' be huge because prague and ges and those guys right prague already made it to the candidates because of the performance at the world cup gesh might because there's a a calendar long fay circuit i don't know what they do i'll tell you guys about that when it when it but vidit he's very close and vidit then drew in the eighth round against hikaru so hikaru made a couple of draws in these in these rounds but then there was some shakeups on the leader board this game this game and this game all has a leader emerging after eight rounds here we go oh and at the end an update about raman janov your new favorite chess player so fabiano carana etan bakro eighth round f gr swiss we have a tyman of sicilian we have black playing a very quick queen side expansion knight c6 queen c6 bishop e2 castles knight e7 and whoa what a move by backro you cannot take because you're going to get checkmated fabby plays bishop f4 fabby has not spent any time all of this clearly seems to be some form of preparation until now now he's on his own he trades the dark squared bishops hitting the knight but the knight retreats rook d4 and rook d1 beautiful position for fabby who is putting pressure on this pawn which can't really be saved unless you play very passively so that rook can't move now that rook really can't move either fabby plays a4 expanding on the queen side b takes what a move from fabbi putting pressure on both of these pawns but eden right there but fab's got so much to work with here a4 a6 d5 look at fabiano's position all five pieces point at the d5 pawn queen f6 fabby wins this pawn he's not relieving at the end of the of the pawn just yet he can win the pawn but for now look at fabby just effortless if pawn if if pawn takes you can take with the rook and then you infiltrate along the back rank there's actually some really really brutal stuff there for example takes takes takes rook f8 king f8 check mate like can do a lingo queen b6 rook b4 fabby just applying the pressure but eten fighting back he's slightly worse but he's completely he's not he's not losing knight c6 and fab's being pushed backwards now look at this queen c6 stabilizing knight f5 they're they're dancing they're shuffling we make it to 40th move fabiano's been 01 advantage literally the entire game eten now expanding on the on the king side look at fab's i mean fab's like doing his best but there's nothing he can do rook c1 is eten going to take over this game king g8 i mean look aten he's just like shoveling pieces back and forth he's like guy can't do anything to me rook e one queen f6 fabby goes b4 he's got to go for it creates a pawn passer right four squares away from queening but stopped rook f4 now aten offers a queen trade so now the queens are off it's just rooks and knights and some pawns knight g4 look at that move creative by fabbi p pawn takes and here king f8 but now fabbi zips in making eten create weaknesses f5 pushing too many pawns maybe look at eten go but etan's still doing fine knight c6 but takes takes and now rook to a5 this is such a highlevel move everything is equal but that one trade will create outside pass pawn winning chances for white the pawn is literally the worst possible pawn to deal with for black and he plays rook c5 and the move that he probably had to play was something like king f7 and the computer really likes this just giving up the material you're going to get cut off but you'll play rook a6 and stop the pawn but still there is rook here and you are probably going to lose you're going to lose because of the outside pass pawn eten probably should have not pushed this pawn so quickly maybe he didn't need to trade the queens but more than anything else this is the move that likely cost him the game he tried to trade off this night but instead just something like rook b3 but i think he was a little bit concerned but in end games you have to think about i'm not coaching aen i'm coaching you using a tian's game you have to think about what the fallout of every trade is going to be and unfortunately for aen he can't stop the pawn well he can if he plays something like rook c8 but fab's just going to play a7 and bring his king and try to win from this position now at this point the game ends so either eten lost on time but i don't think that happened he played this and then maybe he just resigned after this maybe he just but i i don't actually i don't know i'm actually not sure but it seems the game ended the broadcast let me double check that it just came home today so but it does seem like fabiana won after rook c8 that is mildly disturbing but i don't know if there's something i'm missing i went to check social media and my social media is down okay no problem that's great terrific okay well that's all i okay well i well fby time for first that's what i know and you'll fill me in in the comments and i was not at my computer the entire day i was unable to unfortunately gather all the information fobby won next game andre eseno here i know what happened i was actually following this particular game the entire day kn f3 from yeno night f six he plays in a catalan type of way d4 so kimer plays in a way where he shoves the pawn to d4 and he prevents andre from playing an actual catalan you know he could have played bishop b7 he could have allowed d4 but he plays d4 it's like a catalan declined all right he's like nope castles knight c6 pawn 2 e3 pawn 2 e5 okay great pawn takes now e4 all right a nice central strike trying to put some pressure d5 what kimer wanted was something like knight h4 well actually knight h4 would be really nice because you might actually lose your knight but something like knight e1 but instead of just d5 andre is like listen you giving me a pawn i'm not giving it back okay i'm going to attack your knight pawn takes and now instead of taking the knight because he would lose the bishop he takes the queen he takes with the queen so andre sacrifices his knight what does he do it for for the resistance rook e1 pins the knight to the king this counter pins now queen d1 and f3 now look at vincent's time management and look at yeno queen a4 check he is not thinking if you take then black actually goes here which is a fork and you can't take the knight because queen takes rook so actually this is all part of andre's prep then he plays d4 andre has not thought vincent is the one spending all of the time rook takes e5 queen to d7 he trades and then he takes the bishop and when the dust settles andre is up 36 minutes on the clock he spent no time andre knew all of this andre was prepared for the game he knew all of these moves and with d settles in this position now kimer plays f6 he spends another 13 minutes playing a very very natural move andre responds in 5 minutes trying to remember his notes and now white just has a beautiful potential five pawn chain and a pawn that's very close to promotion pawn to c6 the bishop centralizes to f4 knight c3 rook d1 pawn to d6 look at this two pass pawns three and two squares away from queening and andre brings the pieces forward he got a wonderful wonderful position to work with now it's about whether he can convert it or not now if kimer goes to e7 pawn to d6 and we're going to get a very similar end game that we got in the vidit game v it's it's kn and bishop versus rook kn and bishop will beat a rook they just will they're so good together so rook d3 check and white just advances oh my goodness the pawns are looking too good he's he threatens a draw but he doesn't go for a draw kimer fights back but bishop e3 and the pawns are just too close you take on a7 vincent has to sacrifice his rook but we're going to an end game bishop c5 rook c1 look at how many pawns yes hieno has it feels like he's up two or three but he's only up one bishop d4 a nice move hitting the bishop trying to get the rook as active as possible bishop f6 and he's going to win the pawn here as well two pawns up maybe stockfish could try to defend this with black against the hum but let me tell you something right now black is not stockfish black is vincent kimer and despite being able to fight back a little bit loses all his pawns and andre yeno wins after a dazzling display of opening preparation a really nice way to convert the middle game and end game and he's tied for first as well and here's another person who's tied for first the winner of this game between bogdan daniel deak and radosav vasak from poland this was also an italian this was a little bit different than the vidit game you'll remember in the vidit game vidit sarov there was a bishop here and then upon there and a rook on that file these guys played it in a slightly different way and this one opened up quickly big trade and we go deep into an end game as the players only have rooks knights and bishop and white has the most microscopic advantage possible like literally .001 with a little bit more space potential for b5 maybe maybe a bishop trade just slow and steady improvement and you know he's going to try but vasik is just is just calmly you know fighting back look at this controlling the center advancing over here advancing on the queen side theak is really the one calling the shots all right he's like hitting the ball to the different corners in tennis and his opponent is hitting him back but he's getting tired f5 g4 look at this i mean listen if vachik survives this it's going to be nothing short of a defensive miracle h4 bishop d2 and i mean every piece is doing something this has been a miserable 4h hour game it's been like a two-minute recap but it's like a 4h hour game just gring defending defending it looks like finally vasik is through the worst of it bishop look at that move look at this if you take that allows in the rook so he plays rook a5 and then he plays knight d3 and says all right you can take my pawn on h4 or go back bishop b6 attacks the rook the rook goes back and we move on and vasha decided after 41 moves of just solid defending this bozo just lost the and that's chess sometimes the naughty voices creep in you just spent 40 moves you just spent four hours in my case nine hours covered in makeup i don't think vasik was raring you just spent four hours defending and you tried to stand up to your bully and sometimes that's just the wrong idea that's sometimes you got to just seek help from other sources because in comes knight c5 which was never possible with a bishop on b6 it was never possible with the bishop on b6 because let's say something like this and like knight d i guess knight d7 i don't know let's just say you know knight c5 was played here you would just take it and this pawn is just a sitting duck right but now now it is possible and now rook a7 and now i actually do take your bishop that was the whole point i couldn't take your bishop but now i do you know why cuz my knight is a god look at knight e6 and he's going to lose the pawn on g7 but more importantly he's going to lose the rest of his pieces rook b7 knight c5 he just resigns he resigns because after this let's say rook a7 you can't move a piece look at black's pieces they are completely stuck and the way white you know how you're going to lose this game with black let's say you go king d8 here let's say you go king c8 here let's you go king d8 my friends do you see where this is going my king is going to walk in and he is going to feast he's going to feast and if you get your king to you know over here like by some sort of miracle i'll play knight6 then i'll win that then that then that then that and then i'm going to promote five nights and checkmate you and bogdon daniel deak is tied for first out of nowhere the young 2700 grandmaster from romania and now we will end today's recap with an update about your favorite chess player of all time ramazan jal mahan of 20-year-old international master with one grandmaster norm from kazakhstan finally has a profile photo as a player on chess.com undefeated in this event this is his seventh round game against vladimir fetv and my friends this man is unbelievable first of all f say if he's a gotham knights team team member he was a champion of the proess league last year with the gotham knights but but ramadan is unbelievable we go some 20 moves deep in this game and ramadan is completely equal against another 2700 i will remind you of raman's results up until this point win over 2650 and 2680 drew fua and anish giri 2770 2760 drew sean who's rated 26 98 or 2682 and drew sana who's the other one 2698 or 2682 this guy's undefeated this is round number seven he's playing 2691 fv he's trading all the pieces we're in a we're in a we're in a end game he's got knights and bishops on the boards complet equal position this unbelievable stuff i mean now fed of you know is going to try to win obviously because he's 2700 but he can't beat raman nobody can beat raman but just like in the previous game the day out game only one guy can win you look at this position only one guy can win only one guy is calling the shots one guy is defending but but if fetv at some point is able to break through and just create a little bit of problems for black something good might happen for him but he can't ramazan is defending spectacularly look at this knight g1 fetv is jumping around he's just trying to at this point fetv is just showing his opponent he knows how the horse moves like look at he's not even he's got no plan right no plan at all h5 h6 let's say it's a deadlock position there's nothing you can do or is there or is there and we're just missing it uh-oh uhoh better say have found an idea you know what the idea is that pawn in end games there is a deceiving concept of a fortress when one side has a massive space advantage but the position is locked you got to be very careful with the base of your pawn chain why because that pawn defending this pawn is a bit of an illusion what am i talking about you're going to get to a situation the threat is actually to take the pawn and when your opponent can sneak in you're going to lose so it looks locked but when the base of your pawn chain is so close to the promotion square suddenly here comes fv he has opened up the position for some attacking possibilities in comes his king and you're just not going to stop his knights and i got bad news for you but i will very quickly follow it up with good news ramazan jal mahan has been defeated he has been defeated and is under defeated streak sadly comes to an end but in round eight he drew sam shankland he followed up this result with a victory excuse me a draw over another 2690 rated player so the raman story continues my friends your update after eight rounds of the grand swiss is as follows andre eseno vid gti fabiano carana bogdan daniel deak i showed you all
