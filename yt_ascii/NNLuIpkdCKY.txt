oh so we've just gotten our first look at the playstation 5 as well as the playstation 5 digital edition and that is how you do a launch event with millions of people watching the live event across youtube and twitch we got not only details about a ton of new games but also on the playstation 5 itself we finally know what this console looks like and i gotta say it's it looks like to me it looks like one of those concepts that we've seen forever with all the white plastic and sort of that interesting shape especially when you look at the digital edition compared to the standard ps 5 we're in a car that tapered shape where you don't have the disk drive super interesting though and especially when you see it's side-by-side with that dual sense controller obviously this is going to be a much much smaller and realistically better looking consoles in the series x it does look like an alienware computer now obviously games were first and foremost today at the event although of course we did only see them at 1080p 30 which is fine but not really showing off the best of the console however it was very clear the lot of these games were a cut above anything that you could see on the ps4 so things like ray-tracing we're in almost every single game we saw i'm assuming a lot of these games are also going to be taking advantage of some higher frame rates but the thing that really jumped out to me is that unlike the xbox event from last month sony came out swinging there were i might count probably almost 20 different games that they showed and a lot of them are from very big franchises we got good range for his mo 7 we got a brand new resident evil game we got a ton of newer ips which is always nice to see at the beginning of a console generation there was just so much for pretty much anyone on this one we got to see the console finally to fire two that's the place some games like ratchet and clank ripped apart did a very good job of showing off several new aspects of the ps 5 now of course did you see rate racing with the excellent looking lighting but they also showed off the speed of the ssd by taking advantage of that rift mechanic which allow you to kind of warp around and obviously that would be something that would be possible on someone like the ps4 something else that looks great is keena bridges spirits which when i first thought strip looked like a pixar movie from just a few years ago it was impressive about all of these games is that they are running on real ps 5 hardware now mind you there's still development kits so there's some rooms some wiggle room i guess but what i really appreciate here is that we didn't just see a lot of trailers we saw a few trailers but pretty much everything was running an engine on the consoles and a lot of what we saw today was actual real gameplay which i think votes well so they did show up a fair few accessories including a new 3d camera but i think it's very interesting to think that sony this time around are really going for first and foremost with a digital edition at the ps 5 obviously the xbox has been doing this for a little while with the xbox 1s all digital which was the lower end xbox one that didn't have the disk drive it was a little bit cheaper that was a little bit of a weird console but this time around it seems like sony's very much focusing on having what i assume is at least a $50 cheaper playstation 5 digital edition if you're not going to be using the discs and let's be sort of real here how many people are actually going to buy ps 5 discs especially considering that these games are like 100 gigabytes right are you actually gonna buy the discs really no of course there are advantages to that disk drive beyond just the pure games we do finally have support for 4k blu-ray but realistically i feel like the disc list version is probably going to be the more popular one but it does depend on how much cheaper it is are we looking at a $550 playstation 5 and a $500 ps 5 we still don't know italy is people on twitter very much seen to be on board with the ps 5 i am pretty firmly in the camp of i like it it looks different it looks unique but it does definitely move forward from the ps4 which i was never really big fan of the particular design of and while the series dex is obviously a very powerful console with a lot of sort of hardware specs ultimately it's a big black box so you know yeah but don't stack things in your console throughout the entire event sony were teasing little bits and pieces of the ps 5 experience and we did get a little bit of a look at the startup animation but that being said there are a lot of things we still have not seen with the ps 5 obviously i'm very excited we finally got to see what this thing really looks like but ultimately there's a lot of questions and there's still a lot of things that we still need to find out about what this ps 5 is really capable of of course we've already seen some playstation 5 gameplay thanks to the unreal engine 5 tech demo now as it's a tech demo you always have to take this stuff with a grain of salt this is meant to show off everything in the best possible light pun intended but it's not always necessarily representative of what the final gameplay will look like that being said though it is clear that these new consoles have a lot of very fun toys to play with the lighting particularly looks really impressive with the ray tracing and obviously those ridiculous textures that ue5 supports why they will absolutely destroy your 825 gigabyte little ps 5 ssd are really really cool to see the only downside here is that this really was framed as a ps 5 thing and while yes this demo is running in real time on ps 5 dev hardware there is absolutely nothing to say that this cannot and would not run on the xbox series x so the specs have been known for a couple of months now and if you're a pc gamer you will be very familiar so just like with the playstation 4 soniya is taking advantage of a full amd architecture this time around it means that they are taking advantage of eight xen 2 cpu cores which on the rise inside really has shaken up the gaming pc industry so it's very nice to see this come over to the console performance wise we're expecting a major jump here and it will enable a lot of new things so the current generation consoles had good graphics but the processors were incredibly weak which really sort of hamstrung sort of certain things would look really good but then when you look at other aspects of a game such as the simulation such as the physics such as the size of the sheer world and everything in it it really was limited i mean you could look at games like what rockstar was able to take advantage of on the ps3 and 360 with gta 5 compared to gta 5 on the ps4 and the xbox one realistically they didn't have that much of better worlds it was much more a graphic upgrade however this time around because of this better cpu we're going to see much much more detailed world and a lot more in that sort of simulation space because it's straight up has the same level of cpu horsepower as a high end gaming pc now of course we can't talk about brand-new consoles without talking about the graphics in this case both the ps 5 as well as series x or taking advantage of amd's rdna 2.0 graphics this is pretty cutting-edge stuff it's not even out in the pc space although will likely be coming out around the time these consoles launch later this year but there are a few major improvements first of all is the fact that is a new architecture with better clock for clock performance so you can look at all like the teraflop numbers and stuff but that's not directly equivalent to last generation consoles on top of that it does have a lot of built in new features such as of course ray tracing which will really i think become a much more standard thing going into the next few years with the consoles having it with pcs pretty much having it across the board and sony spend a lot of time working on their audio engine which is of course built into the gpu but beyond that what my sort of real takeaway here is is that while yes we will have games that look better right we will have games that have better lighting which will be a major advantage we'll have more detailed textures all that kind of stuff right that stuff that is coming in this generation full-stop but instead my thought is that they're going to focus on the actual fidelity of the experience so the xbox was it series x as well as the playstation 5 both support 8k we could see higher resolution stuff i don't think that's going to happen instead my thought is a lot of developers are going to focus much more on the framerate of their games so you look at this generation which is very much overwhelmed with 30 fps idols that's fine if you're playing some simple story based game that's okay but when you get your controller in your hand you have like a 120 hertz panel in front of you and you're playing that new call of duty that's a real upgrade in the experience right i mean this is something that the pc space has been pioneering for quite a while so i wouldn't be surprised one bit to see all this extra graphics horsepower all the new cpu all the new sort of technology that's going into these consoles focusing less on resolution and more on frame rate i can see plenty of games taking advantage of 1080p or 1440p for the resolution but cranking out 420 fps especially in their multiplayer modes and when i think about what's gonna sell these new consoles what really makes this sort of worth upgrading over your xbox one or your ps4 or your wii u or your switch or whatever the case is it's going to be these experiences that we haven't previously been able to see are you gonna want to play your 30fps game when you're friend with the ps 5 is playing in 120 fps i don't think so well your friends bragging about his framerate though you probably something so we know that the playstation 5 has what is known as a variable clock speed for both its cpu and its graphics now this is not a new concept right especially when you look at mobile devices that is completely standard right your phone your laptop whatever the case is will almost definitely boost to a really high clock speed however it will do that by taking up a lot of power and then once either the power or the thermals catch up it will then start to slow down just a little bit based on if you're really cranking it for a very long period of time for a mobile device that makes perfect sense you're opening up a webpage you boost up to a hundred you have a really high clock speed the webpage is done loading and it comes back down right that makes complete sense however what doesn't make sense is when you take advantage of that same principle at least in theory mind you i haven't spent time with a ps5 yet which is sort of firm rumors but generally speaking i don't think that makes quite as much sense on a game console which is generally speaking running very close to 100% at all times so there have been a fair few rumors from developers that it is difficult to develop for the playstation 5 because it does have a variable right now this is not even something new for the pc space some graphics cards will be able to boost a little bit higher generally speaking it will boost to a pretty consistent level of performance and obviously console games are hyper optimized to take the absolute best advantage of the hardware that they have but what i see happening here is that while sony has taken advantage of things like smart shift which is andy's technology to allow the cpu and gpu to work together it gives some additional ability for the console to give you more performance but what it really seems like to me is that microsoft probably spent more money to get a bigger soc which can just sit at a high clock speed period pretty much no matter what whereas sony has a little bit of a smaller chip likely is going to have a smaller console which is an advantage but to get to that point to really push everything they cut out of the chip they're having to really crank it up to 11 and you're definitely gonna be some limits where it's gonna be like obviously you're gonna have just make the noise i actually made the noise i was like dude - two - two - do i make noises a lot even with today's event we still don't know a lot about the playstation 5 so something like the price i think is something that sony microsoft they're gonna play chicken to see who can reveal last who knows if there's even some wiggle room on what they're actually going to price these things that that's something i think we're going to see a little bit later we know that the ps 5 will support some number of ps4 games this makes sense it's going from an amd x86 architecture to a upgraded version of that same architecture there's no reason why playstation 4 games won't work short of obviously making sure that they've been tested and there's the back compatible sort of layer available what we don't know is what that actually looks like they seem to say that most of the most popular games will be optimized first is there going to be a point where all ps4 games are playable on the ps 5 these are going to be some way to node you have to google it or do you put your ps4 desk in and find out that i'm very curious to see as well as what the process looks like if the playstation 5 needs to download a patch if need to wait for os updates to sort of better support more games i'm really curious about that i'm also curious if there's any older backwards compatibility that sony may add either now or later in the future another thing i'm very curious about with gps 5 is what the software looks like so sony has done a great job with software since ps3 i love the ps3 owner face even to this day i still feel like it's super intuitive even though towards the end it got a little long and complicated ps4 i think is also a pretty clean os but sort of my bigger question is not necessarily just what the design will be but more so what sony's plan for the ps 5 really is so with the ps3 it sort of struck this nice balance between obviously it was a very serious gaming machine there are a lot of other very nice features right obviously had the blu-ray drive you later on the regeneration of netflix and all this sort of the streaming video i mean you had a freaking compact flash card slot on the on the first fat ps3 right i mean there's a lot of stuff that they were doing big game it was very much the focus for the kiss [ __ ] especially when you contrast' that with the xbox one it was a gaming console first and foremost right yes you could still watch youtube and netflix yes you could still watch a blu-ray but with the playstation 5 in considering that this is going to be the generation it's going to be living in our living rooms for the next potentially decade i'm curious to see are they going to push more of the entertainment aspect i mean i expect all the usual suspects of disney plus in hbo now and all those kind of stuff will be on the ps4 what are they going to do anything else beyond just cater to the hardcore gamers it's only going to take advantage of their massive libraries to try to make this more of an computer or make it more capable of being like your all-in-one entertainment system or are they going to stick with what they know what they feel comfortable with which is making a games console first and everything else second i don't know i would guess that's probably the answer but there's still a lot of things that we really do not know about the ps 5 until sony decides to drop five more events on us or just release the thing i mean i prefer they released the thing but you know i'll make as many videos as i need to he trickle out of formation
