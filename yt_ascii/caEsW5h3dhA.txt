rare earth elements are the vitamins of the economy we don't need a lot of them but we die if we lose them there are' rare earths the 15 lanthanides plus the atrium scandium and luteum i also hear 17 but whatever their single biggest use case are for magnets namely the powerful permanent magnets for items like electric motors and generators but as i mentioned these elements randomly pop up in whole smorgasbord of different industries could one of those industries be the semiconductor industry i've been curious about this one for a while does silicon have a rare earth's problem in this video we are going to look at semiconductors and the rare earths but first i want to remind you about the newsletter sign up to the newsletter to read the full video scripts hear about podcasts i am making or to just keep up with me the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show i did a video about this topic a while ago in it i mentioned that rare earths are not actually that rare for instance the most common rare earth element cerium is more common than copper and three times more common than lead the big issue is less about actual rarity as it is refinement they're never found by themselves in nature and so have to be extracted and produced using expensive toxic processes the united states pioneered the use of these rare earths and still runs a mine out there but today china dominates the space not only in extraction but more critically in refinement if you want to learn about all that i highly recommend watching the other video done with review let's get into the first rare earth's application now to start with lasers semiconductor manufacturing is highly dependent on lasers a laser has a few components we have a gas or element used to create the laser light the laser medium or gain medium as it is called we stimulate the medium's atoms into producing laser light using an energy source like krypton lamp or led the medium releases light in all directions so we use mirrors to amplify and focus that light to create the laser we can use a wide range of materials to produce laser light but rare earth elements particularly the lanthanides are particularly ideal because they emit a very precise wavelength of light the most widespread laser is the neodymium doped yetrium aluminum garnet laser or jag lasers as i'll call them we use this solid state laser a lot for medical applications laser eye treatment or dentistry but it is commonly used in semiconductors lasers help reduce the uv light for our advanced lithography machines we initially use nd yag lasers to research the uv light generation mechanism but later asml switched to carbon dioxide lasers for debris reasons though that does not mean we are now free of the rare earth curse during operations the carbon dioxide in the carbon dioxide laser turns into carbon monoxide which poisons both us and the laser so we use a rare earth oxide lanthanum strontium cobalt oxide to catalyze the carbon monoxide back into carbon dioxide and maintain the laser's operation this is just one example of the small but critical role that rare earths play in modern technology another prominent laser use case is for the dry cleaning of wafers metallic contaminants and foreign particles are common recall that washing makes up 30 to 40 percent of the steps in the semiconductor fabrication process we frequently use water and chemicals like hydrochloric acid for this something known as wet cleaning but as particles get smaller we have to overcome new very powerful forces a particle less than a few microns wide adheres to the wafer using van der waal forces a force which grows in proportion to the particle's diameter or d these forces must be overcome by the force the clean in order for that clean to dislodge the particle but the clean's force can only be proportional to the square or cube of the particle's diameter depending on which force you're talking about gravity removal or drag it is like a grip we have a better grip on large things than small things so anyway if we turn this into a math equation the ratio between the adhesion ratio d and the removal force d squared or d cubed we can simplify this to 1 to d or one to d squared this ratio gets bigger as the d shrinks implying that we need much more force to remove the particle things can indeed get very difficult for those dealing with small d's but lasers can help there are several principles behind laser wafer cleaning depending on how you do it in one method we directly blast the substrate underneath the particle with a laser this transfers thermal energy from the laser into the substrate causing the substrate to very rapidly expand for a brief period this pushes up the particle enough to overcome the van der waal forces spraying it upwards a second methodology follows a similar principle you deposit liquid onto the substrate and then very quickly blast that liquid with the laser the liquid evaporates and that pushes the particle up off the substrate the benefits of laser cleaning is that it is effective and efficient at the same time we limit our use of toxic and potentially dangerous chemicals like acids it is likely used in fabs and represents a significant use case of rare earth minerals permanent magnets are most critically used in the new energy space but they have significant applications within semiconductor manufacturing too for instance there are some interesting precision motion systems based on magnetic levitation for photolithography machines but the one very significant use case for magnetics via permanent magnets or electromagnets is in the world of plasma material processing a plasma is a highly ionized gas produced by exposing gas to electric or magnetic fields which accelerate their electrons plasma material processing is the science of manipulating plasma which feels like a power an x-men should have the industry most prominently uses plasmas for thin film growth and patterning within it we can evenly deposit a high quality film of material usually a metal like aluminum but also silicon dioxide onto the wafer for etching later tokyo electron and applied materials both provide a version of this plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system to uniformly control the plasma and keep it effective we deploy a powerful magnetic field across the wafer the primary system for doing so is almost always an electromagnet but auxiliary magnets might use rare earth permanent magnets one of the smaller but ever-present uses for rare earths is for coatings and abrasives tracking down these things are supply chain nightmares we use a yitrium oxide based coating for plasma etch chambers where they help cut down on maintenance and cleaning costs i have seen semiconductor companies in china use cerium dioxide abrasives as part of the chemical mechanical polishing or planarization process shortened down to cmp cmp is for polishing the wafer down to an extremely flat surface making it more suitable for photo lithography it is called chemical mechanical because it has both a chemical aspect a slurry with the aforementioned abrasive as well as a mechanical aspect a polishing pad so rare earth elements are often used within the semiconductor equipment but how about the transistor itself i have maybe one use case one of the big challenges with the shrinking size of the transistor is how to prevent electrons from leaking through the gate as they pass from the source to the drain such a thing causes power drain for the user in 2007 intel introduced the new gate the high k metal gate the high k in the name refers to the fact that the insulating element underneath the gate has a dielectric constant higher than silicon dioxide the traditional gate material this cuts down on electron leakage intel's original high k gate back in 2007 was made from hafnium oxide which has a dielectric constant of 20 to 25 as opposed to silicon dioxides 3.9 but there are two major problems with the hafnium oxide first its dielectric constant still could be higher to quote an hbo series 20 is not great not terrible second and more significantly hafnium oxide has manufacturability issues we cannot easily deposit it onto the substrate as it has problems bonding with the silicon and it crystallizes at low temperatures about 400 to 500 degrees celsius so when we try to deposit it onto the substrate the resulting hafnium oxide layer is uneven not quite crystalline and somewhat defect prone so haphonym itself is not a rare earth element but they are similar so this triggered a lot of research into the rare earth space for an alternative material rare earth oxides can bond better with silicon and present an intriguing alternative i am aware continued research of high k rare earth oxides in china as recently as 2020 perhaps searching for a game-breaking rare earth advantage in semiconductors however with the advent of 3d transistor structures like the finfet the rest of the semiconductor industry intel included has largely moved on from high k dielectric gates rare earth ions are widely used in lasers because of their luminescent properties these properties give them a lot of importance in the world of opto electronics namely white color leds today one of the major ways we produce that white light is through the use of color converting phosphors we need these phosphorus because leds emit light in a certain range or color white light on the other hand is made up of all the colors phosphors are preferred because of their luminescence efficiency heat resistance and chemical stability here is how it works we have a blue led emitting blue light also within the led package we have these phosphors usually as a coating they absorb the blue light and in turn emit yellow green or red light depending on whatever they're made from that all combines to create white light those color-converting phosphors include rare earth elements for instance the yellow phosphorus made from cerium doped yetrium aluminum garnet micro powder other used elements include europium and terpium this is a pretty big global market worth about 76 billion usd in 2020 white leds are increasingly being used everywhere we have artificial lighting including display devices imaging systems monitors therapeutics and so on losing access to these rare earth materials can be damaging to the led supply chain cerium is pretty common and commonly used in industry so we can still source it from elsewhere but we don't have much atrium it represents just 0.12 percent of the rare earth elements in america's only rare earth mine california's mountain pass mine 47 of the world's atrium production is used for white light leds it is a significant component in these leds too we use 300 milligrams of it for your typical 12 watt white light led alternatives are difficult we haven't yet found something with the combination of chemical stability thermal stability and light efficiency furthermore many compelling alternatives like nano crystal quantum dots are made from toxic materials adjacent to the world of optoelectronics is the world of silicon photonics silicon photonics is being studied as a way to transmit information create better lidar or even replace the interconnects of a neural network chip i did a video about the topic earlier however one of the big issues with the silicon in silicon photonics is that silicon cannot emit light by itself generally this has forced us to produce our light from outside of the chip or use a different material like gallium nitride but silicon can emit light if we dope it with erbium a rare earth element primarily found in china we can achieve this doping via a process called ion implantation or by layering it on using an atomic method like epitaxy erbium-based silicon light sources are an interesting technology because they may be more compatible with traditional cmos manufacturing processes such a thing has the potential to bring us the dream of a monolithic silicon photonics chip though right now the market remains a niche in the larger semiconductor space before i move on to the conclusion something that struck me as i researched this was how rare earth seem arguably more valuable to advanced medicine than for semiconductors i previously did a video about scintillator crystals for pet scans these crystals inside the scanners received the positrons emitted by an injected radioactive tracer and turned them into visible light for processing the latest most advanced crystals for today's pet scanners are lutidium oxyorthosilicate doped with cerium and luteum eutrium orthosilicate dope with cerium cerium luteum and yttrium are all rare earth elements virtually anything related to bioimaging and light is going to have some involvement with a rare earth element contrast agents for ct and mri scans imaging solutions for diagnosing and tracking cancers the list goes on and on ultimately my evaluation is that rare earths are not significantly present in semiconductor manufacturing as in we are not directly using them in computing chips themselves like as we are for neodymium cerium and samarium permanent magnets however rare earth elements like neodymium are significantly present in equipment used for the semiconductor production process most notably the lasers and plasma material handling there are also significant adjacent areas like opto electronics and silicon photonics which are very dependent on rare earth elements i am especially worried about atrium and the white light led i am also concerned about not being able to dig deep into these companies supply chains for rare earth reliance it is possible we might not ever know of these reliances until we lose them who could have known that we use lanthium strontium cobalt oxide for cleaning carbon dioxide lasers america and europe are willing to throw 100 billion dollars into the domestic production of semiconductors perhaps they can spare maybe 10 billion dollars into something arguably just as vital to the supply chain some food for thought all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys
