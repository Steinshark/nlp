hello i thought i quickly talked you through next week's top fair it's the first event in 2022 and last year we already had four of them they were very successful and so we're going to continue that in this year making one each quarter so if you're looking for a job next week is a big event where you can find your dreams plus job and these are the six companies which are sponsoring this event this whole plot flow traders lumix sound out to kdab and mongodb and then of course we have four more companies which are just having a free table and in total that is 10 companies which are at the event you can join us via these meetup events if i click on one you'll go down here and you see yeah there's some description and there also will be the event to the link the link to the event on next week when you want to join the event okay that's how you join if you cannot make it to the event there is a link to the cv upload form if i click on that that will now load a different version which is meant for the companies because this form kind of recognizes if it's a company which is taking part in the event or if it's someone else who wants to upload it their cv but this looks similar to for you you just have to select your continents or kind of you know where you go or where you're from and then simply select which things you like on c plus or what what you kind of you created a small profile which is like the first thing to look on also helps us to get some data on the candidates and in which different fields you have worked and then this is basically going to the to the next page where you can share your resume and select the companies you want to share it with and then basically you send that form and these six companies are reachable through that form plus two companies which are in the employer listing that is bloomberg and imagely and kdab when i'm looking at this right now kdib is in both so that we'll just send it to them too of course but that form only will send the resume to the companies you select so that's up to you it's not like a general pot so we match like exactly on what candidate wants to be at what company okay and yeah that is next week's event it's on wednesday and yeah unless it's in the evening and on tuesday it's in the afternoon for europe so if you're in the americas maybe the wednesday event is a bit better for you if you're in asia the tuesday event is a bit better for you if you're in europe it probably depends if you're like if you're at work and you don't want to like say hey boss i this afternoon need to attend the the job fair then maybe you you know you prefer to come in the evening and both times are pretty good if you're a company and you're interested in this there might be still a chance to give you a seat on on this but also we plan to have the next version of this in may and early may so if you want to come around for that in early may that also be fine just feel free to reach out to me and that's about that i hope to see many of you next week at the mini supervisor online job fair and until then bye
