today's event has a title are you hiring for c plus plus okay so this talk is about the hiring offers which leading c plus plus has a bit about the data which we have through that and i'm generally looking for employers maybe let's let's just start with that get that out of the way yes i'm looking for employers that are hiring people that want to be part of the drop fair event which is at the end of the month and in the meetup group you can find the links to them that's like a screenshot for me for meetup and for the job fairs right now we do not have any employers signed up that does not mean a lot because we are coming out of the holiday season and a lot of the sellers are still on holiday or just getting out of it so i hope to reach some of you deciders and again if you have if you are on the events in hobilo let me quickly bring up the polls and i can show the stream there on whole yeah this is good but i can't stream it to linkedin okay so i don't i don't i can't run a poll on the linked in an event that's that's how it is and let's get continuing here so if if you're hiring that would be nice to you know if you're interested in the event reach out to me on linkedin very easy to you just write me in in my message and on obedo say hello in the chat i've started the year was presenting like the data which we got from last year so if you don't already have some need to read into how the drop fair works and what the results are there's a good article on the blog from last year for them from the beginning of this year about last year and lastly we had over 250 candidates submit and more details on on some of this the last talk i gave in may was featured was featuring skills by region wanted to do something different this time so if you're like interested in that most take away from that was like 30 40 each from europe and asia or candidates and companies most ar from europe and that's also kind of inferencing or distribution on you know like candidates from north america would probably be more if we had more companies join and products driving from that side of the pond the first event in this year had 100 submissions so every you know graph i show you from that event makes all numbers into a percentage kind of nice the last event was in june we didn't get any sponsors and the second quarter events seemed to have always kind of a bit of problem with finding companies willing to hire and hiring this year is not as easy as it used to be for you know it is a lot easier for companies this year if you're looking for a job all right you yeah you might be looking for a job for that exact reason so let's not talk too much about that and move on because the june event always like the second quarter has been troublesome and it's like the takeaway from me that we probably don't have an event on that time of year and c plus plus devs are just hard to find and i've been hearing it for years from a lot of headhunters companies wanting to fill their positions and i wondered why is it the case and for a long time it was that everyone is looking and that has changed there's a lot of companies which have let go parts of the teams and about companies are still hiring and i wanted to see like you know what what's the current situation so i asked her to see the first community last year i didn't ask this this year because it doesn't make so much sense if you're not looking for a job how many headhunters recruiters companies have contacted you for one within the last three months and here on twitter you see that 30 percent have like more than 10 companies or headhunters reaching out to them and more than 45 percent that's like more than five and same question on linkedin similar numbers last year i didn't ask this question so far this year because i don't think it makes so much sense in the current situation but also it's clear that you're on linked and you have more people which are looking for jobs or searching for jobs and more people who's hiring so those numbers on linkedin will always like be a bit more shifting towards that which is which we are again gonna see was this question this year i asked is your employer currently hiring not hiring or letting folks go and this is from april and we see that back then 48 were hiring or working for an employer that is hiring that i should say it's not employers that are having people working for employers that are hiring and then 15.5 is letting folks go in above 36 percent is like you know neither and this has shifted a bit i think the two percent change for hiring it's not a big change so it's not significant the change for mostly happens from you know people who are not working anymore and in a for for an employer which has like teams leave and now they find a new job or are working for someone who's not hiring anymore or who's hiring so we see small shifts here but it's a lot of specific and though it's kind of the question is a bit different the sounds are possibilities so very close so mostly what we can say from that is like less people are being still employed at places which have let people go which makes sense right if you compare that see the change at least on twitter is towards not hiring in this case and still the first result in april was that the question on linkedin had almost the same results if you compare this 48 36 15 and here it's 17 and 35 those minor difference that's not the case this time on linkedin linkedin has shown here that we again are skewed towards hiring in linkedin so this is a change of seven percent that is significant so yes people on linkedin are hiring but it's not like a huge minority okay it's just 55 percent also we see here that there is a decrease in both and not hiring and letting folks go while on twitter this is an increase and not hiring okay not too sure what to make about this is you know take this with a grain of storage but the other thing is that we have run this in the but in the off-season should run this query again in october when maybe some decision makers came up with their decisions on hiring or firing people but to see how those numbers have changed and this is a comparison for linkedin kind of other kind of nicely see that almost like you know oh now like 4 000 people and since april have joined on linkedin so shout out to lincoln and comparing both twitter and linkedin shows yeah what i said small differences but nothing really big so kind of proves what it is had the same polls on mastodon they showed different but similar results but they had a low participation problem and i think they're not significant because less than 100 people voted and so like five to ten more votes would drastically change the result of the vote and so i don't think that's right now that we greet enough people on macedon to be significant and worth throwing in us quickly let me go and read chat i see there's a question let me quickly answer that later and quickly i was looking into will be low there's okay let's see yeah there's more people on obedo now too there's a question on both platforms let's you know get started with a question from linkedin because there's a few more people on linkedin and also the poor result from one third of the people like against three people have voted on so there's one third of people hiring and not hiring as i guess that's one of the problems with the event that we have more people present so someone asks like what is meaning c plus plus and embedded so welcome to our platform meeting c plus plus is the largest or one of the largest c plus conferences in europe and i'm the host yeah sweater running this platform and the next step basically which we want to look at is what we know what we do offer with this for hiring and as you saw on linkedin right now we have x35 almost 35 we're on the way to 35 000 people following us on linkedin and twitter has 30 000 meeting c plus pluses existed for more than 10 years now thank you for your question there's a question about ara coming from obedo quickly want to say about that we we have minimal data on ai i'm going to show that a little bit and probably i'm going to focus on this habit that we have a question about it i think that yes there there's there's work for c plus plus and ai a lot of it will probably be focused on gpu work performance work hpc etc there's connected fields but it's also a field which is growing and which has to be you know watched and seen where it goes and so yeah the majority of what i can see was where people come from is embedded and desktop and there's people working in those industries like ai and hbc too and with that i think i'm going to continue the talk all right let's get back to my sites so coming out of the whole situation was was hiring and people are hard to find and companies are looking for ways to find developers and resurrection also as a pandemic i have an online user group midi superfast online and i thought when when we have the ability to try a different approach with that let's go with that and see what we can do and all of that came the idea to basically run a job fair because we had this mode where everyone would be sitting on tables and then there was a main content which was talks and i was thinking about ways to utilize this break mode for content and to to have a fair event i thought would make sense so this is how this got born it's now in october will be three years ago well basically it's not three years since i had the idea and this is not really a big success and this picture is from the first job fair in 2021 in march and so the meeting superfast online job fair is the next one on september as i showed you and then by end of november i plan to have the last one in this year in the last quarter and originally the plan was to run once a quarter but with the data from two or three years running this now it shows that the second quarter probably is not as popular to do that and last year we had like two events in the second quarter which both were not like you know cannibalizing each other so we're probably gonna skip the this quarter then and the whole idea of the of the thing is to have people meet up online and talk about being employed with c plus plus so let's talk quickly about the job fair concept candidates join tables and they have a conversation about c plus with that employer that hosts this table okay the event times our first day is in the afternoon of europe second day is in the evening it's just to accommodate different time zones and also to accommodate people working and then having time in the evening in europe okay so i'm i'm not based in berlin but my conference is in dolan so i would like to you know put a city in the time zones so people can't know because not everyone like knows where cet or csts and those events run for three hours and those tables then run for three hours there's a cv sharing form which i'm going to talk a lot about and also the kickoff will have like a live stream like you're seeing right now with an intro of the employers which are coming as a sponsor and goal is basically you know to reach into the audience that wants to find jobs and make them available too the platform but also like to make them aware about the event but also to quickly talk through how the event goes and to have a general kickoff that has been like something we've experienced this year and it's really good add-on i do employer branding so if your employer is interested to you know be guest of a live stream be a sponsor of a user group meeting or something like that i can do that also like you know if you have a product which is interesting to c plus plus developers and you want to talk about that if you do something with ai or embedded we can host that on the platform as a sponsoring which brings me to the cv sharing form it's always online and the job fair sponsorship gives you right now six months of listing and so for the next six months if you close the sponsor india you'll be listed on the platform to receive the series which people let me share with you as a company i'm going to explain that in detail a little bit later this is a cv sharing form it allows to share their cv resume from candidates with the sponsors of the event it creates a light profile from country relocation remote c plus plus skills field of work years of experience last year over this form we had 256 candidates submit to the various employers which came as sponsors to the event and until this is 57 countries yeah we always have that a bit like we need more employers to be willing to be part of the event to actually have a bigger audience in some countries i think and this is like the data from the first event and this year germany united states and india are always very popular and then all the other countries which i reached into are also having people summit and of course you got to be looking for a job to submit this and i gotta have to have like an employer you're interested in in the form this form also asks for c plus skills and so we can do and aggregate over that and this kind of lets us know what are the skills which are available for employers in the market and this like being around 250 nicely matches up with roughly 20 40 60 and 80 percent so you can see here c plus 11 14 the next 17 and object orientation are the top five and like really closely and like still making the 60 that's more than c plus plus and c make has been a newcomer last year i think and this year it's very it's more popular this has been expanded in the last year by a lot so that some of those are probably then this year more popular than they have been last year because they were available for some events and this is now for this year for the first event linux 11 14 17 on being in the top five here and i do also ask for where do people ask work and so for last year we see that there is a total of 28 candy dates working for ai oh no it's not 28 that's 25 24 23 i don't know more than 20. okay so i don't have the data on the employers because we don't have as many employers then we have candidates so i can only show it right now where people work hpc interesting is a bit higher of course but similar than ai and here always the top is desktop and then embedded telecommunications server finance top 5 last year and for the first event it's desktop embedded again and then automotive and server and other and finance and science coming behind that and it occurred to me that i do actually have the opportunity to watch the overall c plus plus community this question i cannot run this as a a question on linkedin or something because yeah i'm limited to four answer possibilities and those are far more than we have right so i use the survey tool i have as a data source and since i think june this year this is running roughly 200 answers currently and have in mind that this is like a different data set and tooling in a different context so some people will not use the same answer to both of those surveys or data sources so there's some differences which we'll see and this is like the general overall standing of this question in the survey right now is roughly 200 answers the recent c plus plus standards are very popular modern c plus plus object orientation is not as popular as the other data from last year linux is popular cmakers popular this is not a big surprise here but it's just generally will be interesting when we have more data on this to compare it later top five skills in this kind of this c plus 11 17 14 the next sense you make and the top searches from last year were similar was 11 14 minutes 17 and all pay and i think object orientation is something you probably are more likely to choose when you apply for a job right that's like check mark for for the recruiter so that's not a big surprise that object orientation is more popular with the job searches and then the top five for the first event linux the c plus standards and cmake also very common things and i think scenic really is now becoming the default build system at least for now in c plus very similar as it was the overall question on the industry fields where they where people have worked here we see that ai also is kind of as good and and like in the same ballpark as hpc but hpc is a bit ahead of it interestingly robotics and audio are not very really present we had a lot of companies from audio actually being at events and being sponsored so i would have expected to be a bit more present with audio but the bulk of c plus developers are still working for embedded and germany automotive of course of course being a big employer and that is reflected in here and desktop i i don't know if it's like like a default answer chosen by a lot of people but yeah it's an important part of being a developer right so people choose it comparing the top five right now we see the desktop embedded and gaming is the top three and then automotive industry and more other fields are coming across for the drop fares it's like desktop and embedded is the same and then it depends on the company's present which which candidates from which fields we attract that is i think especially like a big effect on the drop fast which one has to have in mind in here so if you like you know seeing that we don't have a lot of ai developers submitting where we never had a single ai company come and say hey we're employing people so if we had that like for several affairs the numbers would look different and quick word on gaming because the gaming is it's present in the drop fair but not as much not top three not top five i do think looking at the past events there's a lack of employers we have king which has been on the first event this year and that you know we have a lack of employers that's true for most other fields too and so there's a lot of game studios which could be at the event but they choose to be at other events which are more game dev focused which i can understand so the audience is not so much in the job fair for game deaf could be in one of the answers to this is one of the relevant answers i think some people have moved on and don't think it's relevant for their job application if they had a gaming drop 10 years ago they will probably skip that and apply and gaming fox not looking for jobs there's the other thing maybe you know that just maybe you're employed maybe you're doing your own thing as a gaming developer so it's less of a thing to you know to be present in the job fair data than to be present in the overall community data and of course all this can also be a fun funding problem that when the data has more matured we see that this is ironed out again upon i do ask for years of experience and this is very similar always the time we have one third of people roughly which have more than 10 years experience and two-thirds which are starting or you know have completed the decade in the industry or are in between so let's always the candidate that we have is very very very well mixed and very interesting and you see here there's a almost the same graph of course it's a bit different we have more people joining probably in the spring from university but overall it's again this is one third two thirds is holding up and all this data is coming from people submitting their series through the cv sharing form it allows candidates to share their cue with sponsors creates a light profile country relocation remote c plus skills field of work and years of experiences with this basically is consistent of and then gives me the opportunity to do an aggregate and see you know what what actually is available on the job market and what regions what countries etc etc we could run those things in the future at one point when we have multiple years of data and the companies may filter or search on this data too because 40 to 50 candidates is like per event per company in submissions very common and especially like if you're if you're joined early as a sponsor then let us what can be happening and then you probably want to use the search functions the next step for the candidate is to select the companies to share with and then they upload the cv resume and add a general cover letter so these cvs are always going to employers of your choice okay and candidates prevent roughly the median is 60 candidates per event and i still see a long time strategy i think the uptick and the first year in the first event this year where we had 100 deaths submit there's a sign of the times that a lot of people are right now looking so you can expect as an employer which joins the next job fair that we have something probably between 80 and 100 profiles submitting and of course as i already mentioned the the attending companies are always influencing who's showing up and how many people are actually showing up how many employers actually decide that they want to be present there that they want to sponsor those that they have budget for this and that's something which we'll see in the next weeks and i hope that some companies can make the decision to join quickly that i can advertise that and that i can tell the community we actually you know we have like two or three companies which will be guaranteed on site but we'll see i've talked about sponsoring so if you're a sponsor you'll get a sponsored table you are listed in the cvu resume sharing form on the website what's your logo and the link to your job section and generally in the job also in the drop section if you wanna you can publish your drops there and also your logo will be present with a link in the job section there is an introduction in the live stream and access to recruiting tooling and enables advertising for the events to just generally show the community who is coming and of course your feed tech drives and guides the tooling and not everything for the event the free tables are well as a company as an employer you're present at the event you can talk to people and you listed below sponsored tables and it's especially if you want to get a feel for the event format because it is new for many people it's limited to two visits because it's a very popular thing to just take the free option and i you know need to have people actually also paying for my time and it's a smaller table it's half a size and then what a sponsor has and just quickly explaining what the table is the table is a virtual video room with eight four or two seats and usually we have the eight seats for sponsors and the four seats for the three tables everyone is able to join just by clicking on a seat once two folks sits them meeting stars and those meetings are limited by one hour and then folks from the company should reach on the table and so you get to have an conversation with the different employers on the job fair and you have a conversation with them about c plus plus what they do with c plus plus their positions it's not meant to be an interview event is this meant if you like each other that you maybe go for an interview later same day next day next week how companies want to set this up that's up to them meaning c plus is not involved with that and if you're a sponsor you have like an on the website a page where you are able to read the message which has been sent which is then also like you know the graphs you saw you you get as the the candidates which i've submitted to you and you have a listing of those candidates there's a search phone which allows you to search and filter for certain properties larger employers will have multiple positions and different teams and they will have different requirements maybe there's a team using cute and they want to search for people knowing q10 to find those positions and then there may be a position for a team which already is using c plus value though they want to have candidates which either knows if a 17 or 20 and so that's ways to filter maybe like ai topic you want to find people that have experience with ai too like you know have a position in your company with someone doing something with ai you have some ideas there and then you search for that so there's various options to search for that and that's available to you in in the back end the job fair itself is a long time project and it depends largely on if employers are willing to support the format if your employer wants to join the job fairs sign up early it's not successful for two years i think we're pretty much done with the learning process and i think this the next week's probably showing that there will be sign ups from employers so in less than three weeks we will run the event and let me quickly see if there's any questions and read the chats and the events and so you know where more people have joined a new video let me show a new pole on are you looking for a job okay so you ask like are you employing we seem to have a lot of candidates here and there's a question and let me quickly put this on screen so what's the percentage of jobs that can be done remotely compared to on-site jobs i don't know that's something i think we don't have really well data on some companies want like different ways to do that and other companies so i i cannot tell you but there's was a pandemic that has become increasingly popular but remote jobs can mean different things it doesn't always mean like globally remote it means remote or partly remote and i think with the current trend probably we will see that this percentage of jobs that are offering remote is going down again that's my expectation and you see there's also on linkedin a lot of people looking for jobs and positions so there's a question about recording yes this will be on the meetings youtube channel and i'll share it on linkedin the recording will be visible of the event after the event to closes and if you have any questions on linkedin or on please ask them here's a question on from linkedin were candidates with zero or one year of experience tired on the previous job fairs i don't have really good data on the success rate i know that some companies are looking for beginners and are looking for students so like suppose some of them have found jobs but it's also like you know for you a bit of a building new network and finding out what companies are interested in with the event but in total some it's a problem in the industry that some companies don't look for juniors that much as they should and i see a question on popularity or frameworks how popular is the job opening for framework development using like acute methods yeah i don't know a lot about the employer market like what companies are actually searching for that's we don't have enough employers in in this field to to like have actually data on that we have a lot of data on candidates which is interesting to employers but we don't have the other side as you see there's like not a single question from an hr person and here unfortunately so yeah as you saw there's like i think 40 probably which have those like cute knowledge and there's cute jobs on developers and employers finding each other there definitely foreign okay i see the pull for if you're looking for a job it's 40 for unemployed 40 percent for i'm employed but looking at 20 for not looking and yeah see a lot more people are joining on on linkedin and hope you know so welcome the current voting port has 10 votes i would then continue there's a finance question let's go to that what do companies working and trading or finance look for when hiring c plus plus developers i do think companies are looking for people that have experience in modern c plus plus that have a feeling for how fast their code is and maybe even how to measure that that would be a big plus and often it depends on the size of the employer some of those companies are very specialized some are like really big and have various positions some of them even the pro acute to build their own interfaces with and something which then is not like used for trading but they they have jobs for two developers and to have various other tooling things similar in game dev by the way but yeah i i would really love to have some employers come on here and answer those questions but so far we did not have a success to us actually from someone from an hr department wanting to to join the live stream and answer questions i hope that will you know get this one day but right now finding employers is the biggest problem of the job fair in this kind of time of market situation right now too i don't have thoughts on scripting this was unreal engine that's a nice question but i think that's a bit off topic for the stream there's a question on c i'm gonna see what's helped me to be a professional in c plus and what is the time on us in your opinion there are c plus plus shops which are deploying let's see like and see interfaces and there's of course companies employing c developers and c plus developers so that is and on the other hand i can see that c plus plus modern c plus plus is a vastly different than c it's two different languages you will have to read on a lot of things and people hiring for modern c plus plus don't want to see c plus code which is mixed with c okay see another question is on the standards i think c plus plus 17 is probably the most used in the market we see that c plus plus 11 is the most used in candidates or like the most rich is knowledge and we see stupid for 17 and 14 being popular but again i i can't answer like generally market questions what employers are looking for and i think i'll continue now with the talk but let me quickly see if there's something new in obito i will continue then the talk which we'll be looking a bit on how the employer of things work i think let's go with that so you know i quickly like viewing the process on what happens when the candidate submits so the candidate fills out the form selects the employers which naturally creates an application state and employers can find again this through the filter search later which naturally could update this application state i don't have implemented that candidates actually are able to view this because a lot of companies do not use meeting c plus plus as their main hiring which i understand and so there's not a lot of companies using this actually internally so it doesn't mean a lot when your application state in my software never changes because in reality your cv will be laid out to the hr person of the company they will look at the cv and then answer that email to you if they're interested sometimes they also answer if they're not interested but not all employers do this and the cv submission form creates a profile which consists about your skills and c plus plus your field of work you experience where you have worked the region which is continents i also you know want to know where what which country the country the candidate is but this doesn't play such a big role in my experience and the years of experience is of course also important and companies may filter or search on these and as a community i hope that we get better hiring that we get a place where employers naturally meet the community and have conversations about c plus plus to include empires in an inclusive way cross-funding because i love using hubido but it's not a free thing and my time needs to be paid too because meeting c plus plus is my main job running the conference running the platforms what i do and as such i do build a global network for c plus and a platform that's still what i do for over 10 years now of course again have i mentioned that i'm looking for employers so if you're working from employer which has open positions please forward the job fair and the drop fair page maybe the link to the event in linkedin to them they can contact me on linkedin or for email and of course i want to say thanks to the many companies that have joined in the past many many of them have come back and i also expect that we have some companies being at the drop fair again joining for a second third or fourth time in september it's just right now that people are on holiday and decisions take their time and with that thanks for listening if you have any more questions i'll go through them this is how you can reach me in the contacts you i need to forward to your hr folks that your companies can hire c plus developers via the event and i'm happy to like you know be in meetings and discuss the possibilities with your employer in the next week and let's see what the questions are on the various platforms again if you have a question on [music] posted to the chat closer to the q a section and in the chat on linkedin i should be able to show it on screen directly so i'll be doing that there's a standard question on rtos it was very specific and your question is so specific that i cannot answer it so i have a you know kind of remove the over the air because we don't have a signal for standard which you know has anything about over the air so for embedded and this is basically how i can answer this question there is a misra standard and also the autosar standard misra is currently being updated to c plus plus 17 maybe even to 20 and i think autosar is already so this employers moving slowly i expect that most court bases will be following nisra and autosar as standards and then it's a question what standard or which version of the the standard they use and the whole contracted things was like you you work in automotive you don't get to make that up you know you're shipping things to vw they will tell you what to use you're shipping things to to mercedes they will tell you what to do it's a very different and so i think generally employers are looking for people that have more experience than what they need in their daily job which can make it difficult if you like want to use c plus 20 and embedded or c plus 17 wasn't impossible to find that as an employer for yourself but it's definitely probably a welcome knowledge for employers and advantage for you in the market right now is there any chance of finding a mix of c plus plus development devops yeah i do think that [music] if you do anything with steph ops in c plus plus you will probably have a lot of employers which are interested in that it's maybe for them sometimes difficult to make this an official position so maybe you you know have to to mention that but i also know many people that got into the devops sector by basically you know starting this was that work or being the build system person and in your team because you started to look into cmake so that's possible and it's i think a good thing to not only know c plus but also to like bring additional knowledge about tooling security etc with you that will increase your chances to be employed and that's also like one thing i think candidates really need to know about is when you read the job description people list what they need but as a newcomer as someone who is coming from a different background you might bring knowledge to them which they wouldn't put in which is not needed for your extra position or they didn't put it in there but which is interesting to the company because you're bringing in knowledge which isn't in the team like ai devop knowledge embedded knowledge knowledge about u.s standards all those things can be very very interesting and the reason you are hired and for now that this last question and linkedin let me look into hubido and also i'm showing you a link to go to the job fair in hobilo now experience and also yeah so there's an update on the polls and there's yeah thanks for coming see if there's more questions on linkedin if you are interested in the whole thing please forward this to your hr folks or said that and i think we're like closing the official part of this now
