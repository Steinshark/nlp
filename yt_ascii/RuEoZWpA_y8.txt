ladies and gentlemen did you know that the average elo of a person that plays chess is 375 i made that up but about a year ago i did a poll on this youtube channel and over 90% of viewers were rated from zero to about 1,200 and the reason that i'm telling you this is because in today's video the average elo of the opponents is 3,840 and that is because today i am showing you a game that was played between two chess bots in the recently concluded chess.com computer championships this was a rapid game played between torch and leela and this game was ridiculous you see a lot of us like chess ai content we like chess bot content but we don't always like it when it's terrible we prefer to watch it when it is absurdly high level and i am happy to break it down for all of you here we go torches rated 3,857 leela 3822 and this game began with c4 and every single time the bots play against each other i say this time and time again anytime two bots are playing in a chess game they are pre-programmed to play certain moves and the reason for that is two chess bots that are nearly 4,000 would just basically play the exact same openings over and over again to maximize their chances so what they do is they make these bots play pairs of games in the same opening one with white one with black so c4 black played e6 i will tell you when the bots left there they opening this is an english opening this is black playing e6 and probably building toward the center but actually building this way and now it's a dutch defense anytime you respond to c4 d4 or knight f3 with the move f5 it is known as the dutch if you respond to e4 with f5 it is known as the idiot opening it's actually known as the fred for some reason i think this line where you lose all your pawns is known as the fred gambit i don't know what i don't know why anyway knight to f6 white plays g3 bishop g2 this all very normal stuff this is exactly how you want to play in english because your light squired bishop and then your pawn on c4 will fight for the center black plays d5 so this approach chosen by the overlords and ultimately by leela this is kind of a stonewall dutch it's called a stone wall because it looks like a wall of stone there you go white plays b3 not the most common move it is far more common to play castles and then just normally play d4 but this move does two things number one it defends the pawn number two if black was to play a ston wall because there are so many pawns on light squares it is very normal for white to try to trade that bishop that is kind of called the meta strategy of the entire opening and you would play bishop 2 a3 so actually white's approach with b3 could come you know it it could end up coming back to create some you know good things at the same time this type of approach by black would allow black to very quickly attack the center so there's a lot of intricacies none of that matters because leela puts the knight on c6 we have bishop b2 bishop e7 both sides castle and now we have left the opening book so it's taken us a couple of minutes but we're gone we we have we have departed known theory and i just realized that my streaming software that i use recently went through an update and now i can't even tell if this video is recording or not so that's pretty cool i hope it's recording i mean i hope do i exist do do do can you see can you see me fascinating i love when software updates and it's just like a complete disaster anyway white plays d3 so torch in this position doesn't play d4 doesn't you know doesn't block the diagonal and instead is just kind of hanging out in this position and so the very first move that leela makes on her own on its you know le leela strikes me that's a cool name i feel like people are going to name daughters leela this just sounds like a cool maybe there's like some origin or something i don't know it's a cool name though a4 leela plays a4 and the idea of a4 it's actually very normal to sacrifice your h and a pawns when the result would be a damaging of your opponent's pawn structure it's very normal to do stuff like this especially when you haven't castled that way if you have a rook behind your pawn it is a very normal thing to do torch takes in the center and then takes like this and i think torch did that because torch knew black would not take with the queen because that would walk directly into the bishop black also wouldn't take with the pawn because then this knight would not get active so torch kind of like anticipated this would happen and basically says okay leela well i'm up a pawn now i mean you gave me a pawn sure you damaged my structure sure but i'm up a pawn so good luck right queen d6 with the simple idea of at some point walking over here and ultimately winning this pawn queen d6 is a really dumb looking move because it it just walks right into this bishop move but actually black wants to go here and it's really difficult to do something you can't slide your pawn over to c3 pawns don't go laterally and the more you do you know black's going to play c5 black's just going to block that position walk over here take this and suddenly your bishop becomes a target like it wasn't even you know it wasn't even doing anything on that square so instead of that we play a3 torch decides i'm going to play a3 i'm going to prevent anything from going to b4 leela plays rook d8 activates the the rook alongside the the queen the knight is going to move the bishop might go to f6 to trade off for that bishop very complicated game very complicated very tense so at this point anticipating that black is going to try to take some space in the center anticipating that a bishop trade is coming torch plays d4 this move takes away squares from these pieces and also prevents bishop f6 from being an exchange he takes some space torch wants to go knight d2 knight c4 put the knights on e5 and and and go ahead so bishop f6 now you ask me in this position why torch did not play knight bd2 i can't tell you but i think it has something to do with the fact that black would play knight b6 stopping knight c4 and also attacking the pawn i think that's why torge did not play that instead torch played a move rook e one which i can't really explain to you i don't really think that it wants to put its rook in the center of the board and also destabilize its center but what do i know now leela kind of runs out of ideas and k plays a move that stockfish doesn't like i like this it's like leela stock fish and torch all debating different things stockfish thinks it's time to play knight b6 it thinks it's time to go for this pawn leela for some reason plays h6 so clearly it did not like making any committal decisions yet so it plays h six queen c2 all right looking for knight d2 looking for knight c4 knight c e7 that's a weird why are we but why what's the plan why are we playing 97 well the plan is actually to trade the queen that's the plan is that leela despite being a pawned down is like well if we trade nobody can protect the pawn on a4 the pawn that i gave as an investment a couple of moves ago these engines they make these positional decisions right so torch puts its queen on b1 they make these like really obscure retreating moves patiently awaiting the next phase of the game and the thing with these computers is you you just you you never know when they're going to when they're going to make a pawn break and and by the way that pawn is now completely unprotected completely and finally leela what why did it play rook f8 stockfish thinks rook f8 is also the best move what why why why why are we playing rook f8 can so i what i can't explain it i think leela knows that if it takes white is going to play for e4 and after pawn takes knight takes it prefers to take this with the rook but in this version white doesn't actually have to take the bishop and could do something else so instead of that it's like i can take this anytime and i'm going to play rook f8 because i anticipate that this is the only move which it is by the way torch completely agrees with that so they completely see the future together and it immediately puts this here and even here it doesn't take the pawn on a4 why is it not taking the pawn on a for i don't know i don't know i i can't explain some of these things i i don't quite get it myself now this idea to come back and come back for the you know and come back and take the bishop both computers are completely in agreeance this is the right thing to do for both sides so the incredible thing about chess at beginner level and even intermediate level even advanced level you think you're playing in a way that your opponent won't see isn't that incredible like you think you're going to find ideas your opponent doesn't see engines see everything how can there be a winner and a loser if both sides see everything evaluation not all computers agree with each other all right and so in this position torch plays a move i can't even fathom i don't even like if i ask you what is the most natural move in this position y'all are all going to say knight e5 because you're going to lose this pawn anyway so you might as well activate tonight and activate the bishop i would play knight e5 if you thought knight e5 you and i are the same chest strength and i've been playing 20 years and i'm an international master so knight e5 is yeah that's a pretty good move yeah yeah torch plays a5 it just decided that losing this pawn was better on its own terms it prefers that black either moves the rook to that square for some reason or black does this now incredible thing is if if black splits these pawns apart the evaluation goes from 0.5 to 0.9 why isn't that incredible half nearly half a pawn more if the pawns are split if that doesn't teach you a mini lesson in the importance of pawn structure keeping your pawns together right not creating these isolated pawn weaknesses of which black would have three that there's nothing that can teach you right so it gives up the pawn like this now we play knight a knight knight to e5 now the queen moves to a4 and now the bods begin to dance sometimes in a position among two chess computers there is no clear path forward there's no clear path now for us humans we make our own path and it's a flawed path i mean we you know we trample in the woods we burn down the trees like we we try to build a path when there's no path to build computers don't do that they're very precise like ai right it's like exactly what it is so now torch goes here leela puts this the other knight on f5 everything in leela's position that's important is protected everything is the bishop's not protected but it can't be attacked so we play rook c1 targeting the pawn but it's protected bishop b7 now you may look at this and go well this is easy i take this and then i take the yeah okay try that so bishop takes right okay bishop takes now rook takes c7 terrific that looks completely accurate except torch doesn't want to lose its bishop it evaluates in relative terms this is not a three-point bishop and that is not a three-point kn it thinks this bishop is worth maybe four points and it does not want to land in a position with so many weaknesses again as a human you know maybe bishop a8 i'm not saying i'm not saying that's the best move that's why it's plus two but i'm just saying what might happen is queen d5 and all of a sudden as a human you are going to get mated that's what's going to i'm just just putting out just showing you what what what it thinks which is why it plays bishop f3 i guess okay bishop f3 bishop d1 maybe that way what i don't know queen b5 offering a queen trade offering a queen trade okay no queen trade okay queen goes back to e2 queen e2 queen e8 queen e2 knight back to d6 and now torch attacks on the same side it takes a little bit of space all right it restricts its opponent it decides okay pawn is good on h4 it's not really weakening my king black plays rook b5 black is rock solid now officially every piece in black's position is protected literally every single piece has protection bishop g2 back you know when you're going bishop g2 back you don't have a plan okay rook b3 taking a little space away bishop f1 what it what are we doing we we setting up for the all right so we're going to put that there we're going to put that there we're just setting up for the next game rook goes back to b5 that's basically offering a draw queen c2 okay rook back to a5 i mean we're basically playing snake it's like boop boop boop boop right rook a5 bishop d3 okay it seems like that was the idea all right but there's no target so i don't really know what we're trying to do the rook goes back to a7 i can't explain that move the kn goes to g4 okay that make we attack the rook i okay all right i get it we're trying to double up we're trying to attack the pawn makes a lot of sense bishop just defends all right well now dab doubling the pawn doesn't do anything so now we put the knight back into the middle well you know we put the knight back into the middle rook rook goes back to f6 knight goes to g4 rook goes to f8 we repeat moves one more time now we put the knight back to e5 basically torch at this point because it has a limited amount of time to play the game it's playing a rapid game which is 10 minute it is trying to set up the optimal setup it's trying to put its pieces on the optimal squares to ultimately go and create a threat and it will find a way through rook up 6 knight g4 it's not going to repeat puts the rook out it's going to try to sacrifice it maybe okay queen is going to c1 i'm looking at stuff over here that looks very appetizing queen f7 nice idea if you sacrifice now i'm not going to take you get a dynamite strike directly to the jaw king h1 and now the absolutely brutal o i accidentally selcted with the right click bishop b7 look at that and that the knight is about to move and you will perish so queen f7 it goes back to play defense now black gets a little bit more active now the knight goes back to the middle now the rook comes back because the knight left now we go queen c2 queen back to e8 and now the key idea the key idea is shown right now bishop c1 now this is the optimal setup the bishops play like this and at this point stockfish decides you got to trade pieces stockfish wants a trade of bishops to relieve some of that pressure but here stockfish thinks that white can still create an attack with those pawns if you can launch pawns like this in front of your king successfully for an attack it's really bad news for the opponent but none of that happens because here leela plays queen a4 it tries to trade the queens and queen d2 knight g4 this is a very bad sign one two three pieces pointed all over there i think you know what's coming and in this position torch sacrifices the knight ripping open the black position whenever computers sacrifice material you know bad things are about to happen pawn takes h6 queen takes h6 what wait a minute so torch sacrifices a knight and a bishop the bishop is completely sacrificed it's completely hanging wait a minute though wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute not quite not quite cuz there's queen g6 check and then you would win the no wait it absolutely is you're about to find out in this position black can also play rook f7 but that's a lame move rook takes d3 queen g6 king h8 yeah and now you can take the rook but there's one problem if you take the rook you will lose one back you will you will lose lo a rook back you're going to lose one of the pieces of the attack now there is queen g6 and apparently white can still attack but black also doesn't have to play bishop a6 black can get back with the queen and start playing defense so the idea of white was not just to sacrifice the knight and not just to give away the bishop it was also to give away the rook so torch sacrifices the knight the bishop and doesn't take the rook back and gives away its own rook torch's now down three points of material it's got a few pawns it's got three pawns but it's about to lose the rook as well bishop takes e6 rook takes e not even a check not even a check you not even taking with to make the king move instead of that i guess knight f7 was possible rook e6 and the threat in this position the threat like let's say black las b5 is to slide over and deliver a latter checkmate in either order so you got to act now queen to d1 the counterattack begins king h2 and now as a display of counterplay leela finds the only way to defend itself and that also is to sacrifice the rook rook takes g3 is the only move everything else is like plus seven this is plus5 and that stops rook g6 but more importantly it either opens the king on the second rank to checks or you walk into a fork and the engines are not going to do that they're not going to lose their queen so rook takes g3 stops everything and not just stops everything that's checkmate so black sacrifices the rook to open up white's king threatens a checkmate forces his pawn takes and now you cannot take the bishop because it's protected but you can give a check and by giving a check you will force the king to be defended bishop to d2 the craziest thing about this position is that rook is now in the crosshairs as long as this king gets out of the way so black's king walks courageously up to f7 queen g6 is covered rook e7 taken rook f6 defended so there is actually no way that white can coordinate these pieces a lot of human beings here would lose the game they would because they have no attack they've just gone fully down a knight rook to e2 you can get more reinforcements with rook f2 but it seems like there's just going to be a belligerent attack coming back your way queen f5 and the attack looks over you can't play rook e5 you get hit with queen f2 you can't do anything but you can by the way you stepped out of the way and you're sacrificing the other rook so black is ready to sacrifice both rooks to survive the attack both rooks gone for a pawn and a bishop that's a six-point turnaround right you got a bishop back and you got a pawn back you sacrifice a rook for a pawn you sacrifice a rook for a bishop that's four for 10 but at least you don't get mated and at least you make it into an end game and that kind of happens in this game because torch goes here trying to deflect the queen off the file right and deflect the queen off this diagonal to give a check give another check and trade the queens and the apocalypse is over and we are in this end game this is fascinating stuff so now we have two knights pawn pawn versus rook and three pawns what the heck is going on how did all the pieces fall off the board where are the pieces right well white is going to try to win this game by using what we call the outside pass pawns all of that happened black sacrific both rooks white sacrifice knight rook and bishop exploding the position and now we go here remember how a long time ago i told you in this position splitting the pawns is very bad well fast forward to the end game oops fast forward to the end game look we have that same split pawn structure if black did not have to take the bishop like let's say it was this it was i'm going to just make let's say knight b7 rook d2 knight takes a5 look at the evaluation it zeros but because black has to take the pawn like that with the pawn like this this is losable and torch here closes its eyes and sees 4 million 92,000 possibilities or whatever doctor strange said in that movie because i can't remember rook to e5 and this is the major problem the pawn if you play c6 you weaken that you make it even worse for yourself so knight f4 rook takes a5 and now these knights are going to have to make a defensive blockade knight to f5 is securing a pawn you're going to win one of the pawns back white plays a4 the closer that pawn gets to promotion the better it's going to be for white to play this end game now let's remember in every single end game it's like fractions you remember fractions in school some of you are still studying fractions in school cuz you're like seven simplification if we get rook versus knight it's a draw if we get rook and pawn versus knight it's winning if we get rook and pawn versus knight and pawn it depends where the pawns are rook has really good winning chances but you could accidentally draw the game so it's all going to come down to whether the pawns survive and now white only has two remaining rook g5 check from torch making the king make a decision but more importantly winning the tempo in chess it's all about winning the tempo playing the game on your your terms rook to g4 is a very important move now you do two things number one you cut off the king from the rest of the board number two you force the knights to tie their shoes together i don't know why horses are wearing shoes king to g3 that's a winning threat the threat is to take the threat is to get rid of both knights this pawn can't be stopped this pawn can be stopped so black goes knight h5 the white king walks closer to the center of the board it's really bad news knight f6 rook goes here cutting off this knight's access a5 a6 a7 a8 is on the way black has to scamper back to to defend knight d7 knight d7 is a really tough move by the way it's never too late to blunder a fork in an end game which is why we slide back now black is in a tough spot white right now is threatening rook c6 so for example king g6 you would play a5 rook c6 black can't move any pieces and then you would play h5 you can't it's the worst two pawns to play defense against especially if you have a knight so c5 rook e4 targeting the knight where's the knight gonna go is this knight gonna play passive defense you then you can't stop the pawn so the knight tries to be active now you go a5 now the pawn is three squares away from queening black's time is running out knight goes back to b8 black is looking for a defensive fortress with the knight on c6 but the rook targets the pawn the pawn can't be protected you can't defend the pawn both knights and the a pawn c4 that is so important you could have tried to play rook c5 in this position then i would have went c3 and i would have used the tactical defense with this fork to save my pawn and if you try to walk in now the pawn is too close to queening now the rook has to defend the pawn the rook cannot go and target the other knight if i go rook c8 threatening this oops oops which is why in this position after c4 you have to attack the knight first you have to make the knight make a decision do you go back to defend the pawn in the knight do you come forward what are you going to do you go back now i play a6 now you can't take because rook d6 is a fork you also cannot protect the c pawn anymore the knight goes back to a7 and now i play rook c5 and the worst part about this is that i am not actually threatening the pawn i am actually threatening if knight a6 this that is the dagger the fact that you needed to defend yourself stacking on the a file my threat is on the pawn but the bigger threat is on your knights king g 6 and this will literally be decided by one pawn rook c4 the knight has to go here now white goes rook c5 and it's just a matter of which way will the king commit will the king go to the h pawn will the king go to the a pawn and white cannot win this game without the true hero of the moment which is the king so the truth is if if white was told right now you you can't touch the king white it can't win cuz it's a it's a blockade it's a complete blockade you're not going to get these pieces out of there which is why the winning idea here would be to play something like king but rook d7 is a flex rook d7 is just mean the idea of rook d7 is to give away the pawn like torch has a sense of humor it's like take my pawn leaving me with one pawn and then king f4 king g6 king e4 king f6 king d5 you can't get any closer the king is blocked out can't get any closer you can't move anything can't move the night because i take that knight can't move this knight because i take that you can give me a check king c4 he can't give me another check if this rook a7 knight b8 the knight is trapped if it goes here or here rook b i mean how brutal is that that you get this close but now your knight cannot escape the edge of the board brutal which is why king g5 h7 and the game is over i make a queen and the fastest way to checkmate swarm the king with checks and rook d7 is the delivery of the checkmate what a game what a fast a battle between these two bots where white shuffled looked for the optimal setup to crack the black position and ultimately lined up the pieces in a menacing formation sacrifice the knight sacrifice the the bishop sacrifice the rook and then how about can we give some props to leela as well sacrificing its own rook to play defense and a little bit later sacrificing another rook to extinguish the attack but unfortunately it was too little too late as the rook managed to win win the only pawn weakness and utilize the outside pass pawns to to win the game and and and i just wonder like at what point the bots knew that those pawns would play a pivotal role in this game i i really just that's what blows my mind that's what fascinates me and i don't know i have absolutely no idea and i find that totally fascinating so that's all i have for you today get out of here
