so hello everybody i am here with vin armani also known as cyprian who is a bitcoin developer quite known in the bitcoin community he's also recently been received into the orthodox church and so there's quite a lot to talk about with cyprian he's been following my work for a while we've been engaging on twitter we've also you know we planned to talk a bit earlier before and it just didn't work out so this is actually a good time since he has been received into the church to figure out what is the connection between bitcoin and his journey into the church and all the things that he's discovering so i'm pretty excited about this conversation today this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so cyprian thank you for for joining me today oh it's a pleasure and an honor i've as you said i've been following you for for years now so i've appreciated the work that you've done and and then when you were started to become interested in talking about bitcoin i was like okay well if if this can happen it can happen and i think that now is definitely we had spoken about it you know some months ago but i think now is definitely the time to have this conversation and it's interesting because you know you probably follow this that i'm i'm a little suspicious about the coins of bitcoin good just in terms of what they are and what they're doing and everything but it's funny there's a personal connection now that's coming in which is my son who's 16. he said he said dad i really like to start investing in in these cryptos and i thought okay you're 16 like he wanted to put almost all the money he made like in his job into this and so i said okay well let's do it together so we put in we both put in a certain amount and and so we're like we're trying to figure it out together so it's like it's actually a funny time because i'm doing this for him but at the same time i guess i have to figure it out you know i have to kind of solve my problems with bitcoin so tell me a little bit how you got involved into into bitcoin i was so i have a very sort of interesting history i've i've led a pretty interesting life and in 2012 i was in las vegas i was in basically an all-cash business and i had a lot of cash and my background is as a software developer so that's my professional background since since my youth it's kind of in the confluence of let's say entertainment and media and art and technology and so i've been those are my two sort of life interests and so they've i found a way to combine them throughout my career and i was looking at different options of what can i do with this money like i started out with money in my safe at home and then i had to get a better safe and then i spent all my days after i would leave my home thinking about the money that was in my home and that wasn't very nice and so las vegas is actually a great town for cash as you could probably imagine i imagine i've never been to las vegas but i meant yes it's a great town for cash and so you could do a lot of things in cash much more than really i've been able to do anywhere except for maybe here in saipan and you know i tried some things anonymous private vaults and some other kind of cool and fun things and then i recalled that i had you know heard about this thing bitcoin and i think maybe i had seen some either some article or some developer friend reached out to me in in 2012 and i said ah let me check it out and found somebody that i could just do hand-to-hand transactions with and did a few of those in late 2012 the price was 15 per bitcoin 2012 man yeah so so i you know spent a few thousand dollars doing that and and ended up giving a lot away to people and telling people and like oh hey check this out it's cool the wallets had just come out at that time the first exchange mount gox was sort of firing up and then there were some other interesting things like this site that was on the dark web called silk road and i started to see oh these are this is kind of interesting but i didn't really think much of it and i was like i don't know this doesn't really seem like where i should be putting my money now it doesn't seem like there's a lot going on here and but it's interesting and i sort of didn't pay attention to it and fast forward to fall of 2013 so let's say around thanksgiving time and here's this news like bitcoin to one thousand dollars like it was the first time that it had ever gone to a thousand dollars so i was like a thousand dollars and immediately i'm scrambling like where oh this is where i forgot calling friends and everything like remember those bitcoins i gave you in all of this so some was lost for sure but i recovered enough let's just say i had a very good christmas and it was very nice everybody was very happy with the gifts they got and i pampered myself for my my good investment and you know took some great vacations and everything but i also said this is insane there's no because i was looking at it and i said there's no reason there's no fundamentals behind this to why it would have gone to a thousand and that's actually very important it's actually very important and i think that you know i heard the previous interview that you did and you began saying you know that you had some suspicions or you were a little bit suspicious about bitcoin and i think that's an appropriate feeling to have so i was also quite suspicious but interested and then in 2014 i started just developing on the side as doing some hobby things some little projects and whatnot and in 2016 i sort of dropped my previous life and came out as like a libertarian like which i couldn't do i was on a tv show and so like having a libertarian political event publicly is not necessarily something that you want to do while you're taking a paycheck from a major network right to be a star of a tv show so i was you know i kept quiet at that time and but then i came out and started you know talking and podcasting and whatnot and really getting into the cryptocurrency side as it was starting to make its next sort of build up and then started developing more and from 2017 i founded a company called cointext that's we we just recently sold off assets to that it's like an sms wallet basically so anybody with the phone through sms could do this and so i founded that company and and was the lead developer of that and since that time bitcoin has been my full time it's been what i've focused on exclusively with my professional career and i've really i've just really enjoyed delving deep into it and since last year i've been doing the school bitcoin mystery school which we can talk about how that came about because it's directly tied into my journey to orthodoxy and you know at this point we've got hundreds of students who are in there it takes place every month there's now a continuing education course and i wrote a book finish the book that i had been writing called render unto caesar that is that is tying in these philosophical elements of bitcoin and i think that there's a really important conversation to be had the questions that i've heard you have about bitcoin about trust about authority about sovereignty about value these are the questions no one is having but it's when you realize how bitcoin addresses those things when you realize what bitcoin has to say about who we are as human beings and the nature of reality then then you really see the power of it and then the idea that oh it could go from fifteen to a thousand starts to not you start to see what the fundamentals really are so so right now i mean my you know my time is spent doing really more research and development types of things and educating my students and training up new developers basically that's now what's going on in the continuing education of my school so it's it's full-time it's 100 full-time bitcoin for me all right so what i mean i guess that begs the question so what is to you the philosophical underpinning of or what is the metaphysical or whatever cosmological underpinning of bitcoin what is it in a nutshell the project the bitcoin project as described by its inventor satoshi nakamoto is to be able to allow any two parties to transact value to transfer value with one another over a communications channel which in this case we're talking really about the internet without the need for an intermediary a trusted third party really a financial institution and he in the introduction to the white paper he says what is needed is a a payment a financial payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust and it's an interesting idea and when you delve into what is cryptographic proof really what i believe and and what it has turned out and made sense to me that he's saying is what is needed is a system based on faith instead of trust and it's the it's the difference between faith and trust trust being that which we have interpersonally between people which is heavily based on reputation and faith being that that sort of foundational framework with which we we predict what is going to happen in reality so it's not that we like trust that one plus one equals two our relationship with one plus one equaling two is faith our it's not that we trust that the sun is going to come up tomorrow of course it might not right there's always the chance that something happens an asteroid hits the sun blood who knows but we trust that it's going to come up and that or or our relationship with the sun coming up tomorrow is not trust in the same way that it's like hey are you gonna pay me back that money that i loaned you right these are two these are two different things and so it's the system that we have now is a trust-based system it's a reputation-based system it's the only way that we can move funds from one person to another and exchange values so as we move into this digital realm we have a system based on trust and i think very soon very very soon and canada may be one of the places that it starts people are going to start being cut off from that system as they're being cut off from other aspects of life and that trust can be revoked but you can't revoke the sun rising tomorrow you can't revoke one plus one equals two and so this is this is what satoshi is delivering this is what bitcoin has the capability of delivering okay and so it's a very different you know it's also like nails on a chalkboard to me when people talk about bitcoin is money and then go on to tell you what all the things about money bitcoin is definitely not money i've been saying that for years now it's something completely different from money or at least so i'll give you an example i'm sitting here on my deck i'll tell you how it how bitcoin is money i'm sitting here on my deck there's things that fly by in the daytime i see birds i see their silhouette but i also see butterflies and at a certain distance they look really similar and then at night sometimes i'll see bats right but it's it's like somebody somebody's saying bitcoin has money is this is like somebody saying oh see that butterfly that's a bird now let me tell you all about birds and it's like well no maybe we need to take a little closer look at this thing and a little closer look at this other one like yeah they make this flapping motion and they move through the air and maybe we could talk about flight and aerodynamics and all of these things but it it is so different that we we need to take a deeper look and we need to not be categorizing it as something that has come before because it really isn't and so i think that what i what i'm getting from you is that bitcoin because of the way it works because it is somehow an impersonal process it's a natural you could call it like a natural process to be generous like it's a natural process and so something like its blessing falls on whoever participates in the process it's not and it actually doesn't it doesn't have to do with human intermediary authority which is like you said what we're seeing right now is especially with with this with the pandemic and the way it's playing out is that we're seeing methods and ways in which people can be excluded from systems radically and kind of in a surprising way people even you can see we've been seeing people get their bank accounts removed and paypal accounts dropped and all this kind of happens so i guess i understand that but i also wonder because bitcoin is dependent on systems that are related to these systems of power including the internet no connectivity and also traceability there's a certain amount of traceability just by the fact that you even though people will say that it's anonymous and that the the the coin is not lit related to you the trace right of you whatever wherever you are right doing these transactions is something which can be can be traced and then will is ultimately linked to these systems of power so i mean that's my impression unless there's maybe there's ways around it for people that are super tech savvy and are the dark web and all this stuff but it seems like it's at least like for most most people they'll have to also have to use all these intermediary intermediary organizations like exchanges and wallets and all of this stuff you know and then to get the money you get it if you need to use this money you have to have some form of bank account like there's the system the way that you're talking about it i kind of get it but it seems like it's far it's still far from doing exactly what you're saying or am i wrong well interestingly you are you are right for one story of bitcoin so bitcoin actually has two parallel narratives that are happening and it's it actually comes from the very start and the way that satoshi put it into place so there's bitcoin the concept the concept of bitcoin and with this concept of bitcoin that it really actually isn't dependent on the internet per se any way that any digital means of attaching to machines you would be able to do it the cryptography and all of that the consensus rules all of these you can make your own networks and this is kind of the idea of the concept so this is what i'm primarily focused on and this is where the let's say this is the lifeboat the lifeboat is in the concept but you are absolutely right in terms of this other thing and how bitcoin has manifested itself and the reason it's manifested itself is because satoshi added in as as these things always are like the traditional mythological structure in order for him to build this thing he had to add in this seed of corruption if you will and the seed of corruption was basically as he was building this he built the system and he's like okay the system works great but why would anybody when this thing has no price it's not worth anything why would anybody utilize their computer to keep this running which was something he needed a critical mass of people to do why would anybody do this and so if people go to the white paper there is a small little section that's called the incentive section it's only nine sentences and basically what he came up with was this idea and he said okay here's what i'll do i will incentivize people to keep their computers up and running because if they'll keep them up and running and running the software every 10 minutes somebody based upon their percentage of computer power that they're giving to the network is going to get some of these coins and i will also make the amount that is going to be given total on this particular network this particular game because each bitcoin network is really a game that's taking place so the reason why would someone play this game because a chance to win some money and so in the beginning it wasn't worth anything and everybody that was doing this yeah there was some idea that they would get some money but it wasn't why they were doing it they were interested in what could this bring to society or what could this do in the future they tech heads early adopters whatever as it started to get a price and the main reason that it got a price was as i said these these dark web markets so as it started to get a price one cent and then one dollar and all of this you started to get this inkling of people wanting to just run their computers to generate the coins to them before everybody who had a wallet everybody who was on the network was also a minor there were very few people on yeah right so everybody was a miner if you were on the network you were a miner then you started to get into this situation where of course people were like well i can trade it there's a place to trade it people will buy it so let me just run machines and then we start to get into this mining industry and what inevitably happened is that some people had coins they want those they want that value to go up and there's a certain segment it's the largest segment of people involved in bitcoin it's almost everyone who's a bitcoin thought leader they are dedicated and they even say they call it ngu technology they are dedicated to the number go up mythos and ideology they are dedicated to the price go up idea and the only way to get the price to go up is you've got to get more people to play the game basically to buy in like you and your son are doing more people to want bitcoin basically yes and the way that you do that the way that they do it is it's basically the final corruption of satoshi of what satoshi because what was he playing with it's a bit cynical he's playing with greed right he was leveraging greed yeah now if he doesn't do that because he didn't have to he could have just said either one it's not it's unlimited supply or two he could have said well i'll just dump them all onto the network to start and then i'll just give them to my friends the network would have worked exactly the same what makes bitcoin bitcoin would have been exactly the same but he added in this incentive to start out to get people to bootstrap it to get people to use it and so now what we have is we have that incentive run amok and so when people see bitcoin so you look at bitcoin and you say well there's all these intermediaries what are you talking about it's a it's something to eliminate intermediaries yeah all of the intermediaries are based around the price going up all of this is around the price going up and if bitcoin is going to be killed and the btc network is going to be killed in this process so people who are buying into the btc network the price may go up but no one will be using the network because they buy it on coinbase they buy it on paypal they buy it from some exchange they leave it on the exchange they put put their us dollars or canadian dollars up and then they don't move it on the network and as the price goes up they sell it and they take us and canadian dollars back this is not bitcoin because bitcoin's whole purpose is to remove the banks to remove the financial institutions and everybody that uses a financial institution to enter into the game is not doing bitcoin they're doing the this other story this number go up thing right which is a part of bitcoin right but it's like a again it's the seed of corruption that's always planted at the beginning right this is the typical mythological pattern and so i kind of i mean i kind of get it but for example like so the idea would be that satoshi put in limited amount in order to create rarity and that rarity would then create desire and that desire then would would incentivize people to mine the coin let's say it's the appearance the appearance of rarity and the appearance of scarcity right so these same individuals will say oh it's the first digitally scarce asset which is just absurd it's an absurd statement to make because the digits in digital are ones and zeros the number one and the number zero cannot be scarce and also the idea that anything digital would be scarce i mean this video could be viewed how many times on how many machines by how many people because it's digital the whole idea of the digital revolution is that it's nothing is scares right right so to say this is the first digitally scarce asset you're that's a game that's being played on you that's that's someone who is playing the game of oh as we say buy my bags right so he gave but he gave the appearance if people read the incentive section it's very clear it's very cynical actually like he's he gives he says i'm going to give this appearance because i need to do something to get people and you know what if it's good enough that they're like ah it's kind of like okay it kind of feels like scarcity maybe it will be value valuable someday he's putting the the pieces the pattern of what makes something valuable so that people will play the game but it still is just a game so but i think i don't totally follow you are you saying that bitcoin is not scarce like there is absolutely not there's no limit of bitcoin no no and i can and i can prove that to you so so bitcoin btc has been forked many times now so what happens when there's a fork is the some set of nodes decide that they're not going to accept the same transaction rules so the same rules of the game and they continue on with a new ledger new history basically it's a schism okay so like it's like 10 54. so bitcoin has had a 1054 and it split into bitcoin and bitcoin cash now similar with the church split they share the same saints before right they have all the same history before but now what you have is you have two sets of saints that come off of here two sets of traditions two sets of histories that come off and you can split that five ways from sunday and every time you split it you get a new 21 million coins so that first that first split created 42 million and then two years later or one year later one of the splits bch split into two again bsv and bch and then just last year bch split again into bitcoin abc which is now called ecash and bch on this side so even just between those on which by the way satoshi nakamoto could come back and spend his coins because he he's a he's the first saint right right so the the the coins that he mined he can spend them on every single one of those chains so you already don't have 21 million coins you already don't every time there's a split satoshi's coins double the number of coins double so anybody can split his coins double two yeah everybody everybody who was holding coins at the time of the split they double they double so it's not so there is a sense there's a sense in which the scarcity is somewhat preserved because whoever already has coins has the same ratio compared to the all the coins that are possible let's say sure but sure but there is no limit to how many times it can be it can be split so there are split up i mean those are just a few that i'm mentioning there's bitcoin gold there's bitcoin private there's bitcoin candy all of these are traded on exchanges now they don't trade for very much yeah right but the idea here is about scarcity and so this is just provably that well it's not scarce because i can i can if i've got somebody who's willing to bind it i can fork a coin tomorrow it's very easy i just pull the code down change one consensus rule let it run on on mining rigs and boom we're done so there's no there's no barrier to entry for someone to inflate the currency now they can't inflate it necessarily in the exact same game but that almost that almost doesn't matter because what we see is that to compare it to something like gold where that's this is the face versus trust thing right like when we talk about gold being scarce it's like well yeah the number of atoms within the earth like the earth sphere is there's a finite number but in this case there truly is no finite number so it's it's quite different and it's but but you can make people perceive it and that's the important part it's the perception and that's what's giving it that's what's giving it the value in the market there's no doubt that it has it all right so what role do you see it playing then like let's say in the world because if it if it if it can be split in indefinitely and you know it's not based on on trust of the people let's say that that are instigating these how do you see it working and what do you see its purpose the purpose is well we're about to see the purpose so the purpose of of bitcoin is to be the parallel economy to be the lifeboat to give the capability for the i mean just to be quite frank to to give those individuals who do not want to take the mark you know to give them the opportunity to actually have a society and a financial system because this is this is what is coming and this is the this is sort of the the the end the end piece but yes bitcoin outside of number go up bitcoin is not very valuable while everybody still has access to the financial networks so if everybody still has access to the financial networks there's not a lot of utility in bitcoin besides the gambling and the number going up so so you're saying that if once once people start get really cut off from the financial system then then all of a sudden the reason for bitcoin and the value bitcoin is going to become it's going to be apparent and it's going to be come more useful let's say for people yes but it won't but the price of bitcoin in that case is going to not matter as much because it's really the concept it's the idea that you can pop up a bitcoin network whenever and wherever you want to using this so it's not that we're going to see one network it's that we might see you know for every one of these communities that's around we might see an individual network within that community and so it's actually the knowledge of how do you constitute a bitcoin network what it what are the principles being used the cryptographic principles the proof of work this is the important part because if you have that and and some ability to to manifest that in code then you can pop these things up so so yes it's in some ways i'm very glad that the number go up is happening because were the number go up not and i'm not poo pooing it for that reason like thank god it's there because if it wasn't there this idea may never ha have even reached the minds it would have just like died on the vine and it would have been some apocryphal thing and nobody would have even seen the white paper in the code right but because that was there because people are actually looking at it there will be the capability when this happens in the i think not too far future for certain individuals to be able to reconstitute themselves and to have an ability to not have to do the things that are going to be necessary to remain within the within the system right and so then how do you i mean how do you solve the how do you solve the i guess would you would have like closed networks like you would you could bait you would basically set up closed networks that wouldn't be connected to the big ones like connected to the big ones that have authority and then run run it on that is i guess that's the only final solution to this yeah and that's where the real it's not and i won't call it even innovation but the real revelation of bitcoin comes in and the real revelation of bitcoin is called proof of work and it's a unique it's the first time that humans have ever had this capability and basically what it it's it's an it's an epistemological tool it's not a technological tool because what it allows is it allows two people or more an unlimited number of people who have no interaction with each other or who might even have an adversarial relationship one another with one another to come to consensus on events having happened in the real world and that that event being that some amount of measurable work was done some amount of measurable labor took place somewhere by someone and this is this is the this is the mining this is yes so mining so we call it mining and the the term mining actually comes from that little incentive section and it's the again it's the poison pill if you will because satoshi has a sort of a side remark or maybe perhaps to wet people's whistle a bit and to to to get at the greed he says you know this system the way that i've put it together this pattern of the limited supply and it being sort of trickled out and emitted out he said it's like gold miners mining gold that it gets more expensive the more you pull out of the ground so he said i've put this in here he put it there yeah and it was it was debate right so the even the idea of mining is it sort of obfuscates proof of work was before mining proof of work had been around for for at that point over a decade so proof of proof of work was being used and really what it is is it is it is a way of leveraging the laws of nature so mathematical laws that again we have faith in and in my school bitcoin mystery school the first day of our sort of novice initiation class the students actually do this proof of work by hand and it's by it's doing and watching it that they actually develop the faith as well because you see that oh yeah i can predict the future and we can make this more or less difficult and we can tell mathematically how long it's going to take somebody to complete this task so i can give you a task jonathan and know that on average it's going to take you two minutes to do it or i could give you a new task and know on average it's going to take you five minutes to do it or 10 minutes so i can actually charge you right i can charge you in your time charge you in your work and anyone in the world seeing that what you build from out of this work which is basically a number that you generate can verify and validate whether they knew us whether they saw what was going on they can just look at the information and say if they're in a bunker they could look at it and say oh yeah this guy did 10 minutes worth of work okay so that is so i guess what i'm starting to understand is that is where the value yes comes from the value comes from provable time energy that is spent so these numbers don't come out of a out of a box you have to spend so much energy and time in order to generate a coin and therefore that is the value it's like a sweat equity type value where you know that somebody okay that's that's useful for me to think about it that way all of a sudden it's not it's not so much just a magical thing like a completely random random process yeah and it's important for everybody to think about it that way and it's why it's so frustrating to me when i see people who are bitcoin thought leaders who spend zero time on explaining proof of work they say oh it's a proof-of-work thing and then they just go right past it but proof of work is everything in bitcoin all of the other stuff had been done the there's also public key cryptography which is doing something similar and that it's utilizing the laws of nature it's utilizing things that we can have faith will be the same and are verifiable by everyone because it's utilizing math and and basically in that way it's proving not ownership but actually it's it's very interesting it's proving that you know a number that is fundamentally unguessable so it's not ownership it's actually knowledge and this is why i tell people that this is not a technology this is an epistemology because really what it's about is it's about knowledge and the verification that someone knows something without knowing you without seeing you you can present me some set of data and i can say oh this guy knows a specific number and that's that this is your private key this is how you're able to spend your bitcoins and that by the same token you can present me some other data and i can say oh this guy has done x amount of work so x number of what's called hashes so what's interesting is that right now it's actually this proof of work which is being attacked that is the media the the let's say the official channels are are attacking proof of work as the reason why bitcoin is bad why it's a problem because it's environmentally unsound it's using up all our resources et cetera et cetera so how how do you see that strange situation oh it's not strange so when satoshi released the the first version of the software he released it onto a mailing list a cryptography mailing list called the mets down cryptography mailing list now this was a mailing list with basically professional cryptographers mathematicians an industry list and there were criticisms there was only one cryptographer one old school cryptographer called hal finney who was a big supporter on the list now i've written a lot and i believe how finney actually was satoshi nakamoto and that he had basically given himself a double identity so that he could support himself there's also some other things that hal had been through the cryptography that's involved years before that was considered a munition by the government and there's a one of the first programs called pretty good privacy that was developed by a gentleman named phil zimmerman he was actually investigated for an arms control violation by the department of state he was potentially going to be held up as the same that you would for like selling a nuclear weapon that's yes that's right i don't understand why would that why would that why would that be the case this is yeah good good so cryptography the history of cryptography this type of cryptography mathematical cryptography dates back to world war ii and this is what was going on with at bletchley park with the enigma machine and you know cracking the german the german codes that was where the first computer was actually made the first digital computer colossus the the reason for the existence of the computers that we have was this was cryptography was codes and these were considered to be basically state secrets they were completely in control in under the control of the nsa i'll read you i found an interesting quote lately that i said i'm going to i'm going to read this to so in in 1976 when this when this technology was basically dropped by there's there's six guys that are involved one one of them is a guy by the name of whitfield diffy and his quote he said after they released their paper he said the national security agency's crypto monopoly was effectively terminated and this is what he says he said every company every citizen now had routine access to the sorts of cryptographic technology that not many years ago ranked alongside the atomic bomb as a source of power that's how valuable the cryptography that's used in bitcoin was viewed let's say from world war ii through the the 70s and 80s that what's being used is munitions grade cryptography if you send a message using this no government can decrypt it so these were states were holding these things as secrets so the idea to think that it's like these are this is a weapon of incredible power incredible power and people don't know that that's the case right so this is one of the things this is why i do my school the second day we spend it all on cryptography and t and showing people that like yeah right in your bitcoin wallet is the capability for you to do this type of cryptography and send these types of messages most people have no idea right this is not part of the number go up narrative right so the for when going back to to satoshi releasing this when he released it the president or one of the founders of the electronic frontier foundation as a matter of fact happened to be on that list and his criticism at that time this is 2009 this is a day after it's released no one is even mining it it's running on like three people's laptops he's saying i just wish that we we don't have more computers running this you know spewing carbon into the atmosphere so okay that's hilarious yes and this is and this is 100 percent true the ma the emails are there you can go and look so this is a purely ideological attack against something that is a threat to something else and that's what people should understand bitcoin does not use very much electricity whatsoever and especially if you've got one of these secondary networks you know there's bitcoin like btc that's using i don't know 90 of the electricity and the reason it's using that much electricity is because the price is so high because as we're talking about like the value is correlated to how much work is being done so if it costs me ten thousand dollars to generate one bitcoin i obviously can't sell that bitcoin for less than ten thousand dollars right and if bitcoin is going for 50 000 i've got to do 50 000 worth of work well that 50 000 translates to more electricity right so but the price is apropos of nothing jonathan that's the point it's the price is only related to how many people are coming on to in into the into the number go up cult but there is a way in which that proof of work is is going to stabilize the price like it's going to it is going to limit it going back to 15 let's say because if that happens then the whole system stops everybody stops mining if it goes down to a certain level it just stops no you don't think so no no people people would keep mining they would just it would use a lot less electricity the issue the issue and the number go up cult will will you know present this and to a certain degree it's correct the issue is that the way to disrupt the network is to acquire 51 of the total amount of work that's being done at any given time right so this is a 51 if you do that you can control the consensus this is built in this is the threat and so the more it's worth the more it's work is being done to like to outperform the others yes and the number go up cult calls this security they say the the higher the price the more secure the network is this is not really true because there's only a limited number of things that you can do with that 51 percent and you can always cut that if if you are you know if you have a community that's relatively small and some attacker comes on it's relatively easy to switch out the software and to cut them out of the loop and this has actually been done in bitcoin forks in what are what have been called hash wars so this is like not theoretical what i'm saying this is actually been done on multi-billion dollar networks where you you have a few miners who have a lot of the hash power and they've sent secret versions of software to one another to cut out an attacker who's been there so there's a lot of ways to mitigate it there are there are bitcoin coins that have traded for fifty dollars like i say there was a time when bitcoin was trading for fifteen dollars and it was just as safe and secure then as it is now in terms of the actual attacks or anything that happened to it so it's it's really you know if there's one network yes it's a problem if it's just btc but if if i'm like i don't need that network i've got my community that i'm trading with we'll just fire up our own and we'll just make it so that only we can utilize the network no problem so so this is why i say there's two stories and one story takes you down one particular path and the other story takes you down a completely different path where you realize it's a tool that anybody can use that's open permissionless and anyone can fire up a network so one of the i guess one of the the suspicions or one of the things that is strange about bitcoin is the fact that it was created by an anonymous person and so this of course opens up the thought that there's something else going on that there that it's actually being released by some kind of state actor or something more nefarious what do you think is the reason why it's it's been released by an anonymous person like why do you think this was was it that maybe the danger this cryptographic danger of being suspect by a government or something like that yeah well like i say i believe that it was this gentleman hal finney so he was the first person to support bitcoin on this mailing list he was the first person besides satoshi nakamoto to mine he was the first person to receive a bitcoin transaction he received the first bitcoin transaction he was also the first person to ever tweet the word bitcoin so his his twitter handle is still there at hal finn and you could go down to january january 9 2009 and there's a tweet that says run in bitcoin and it's interesting because it's kind of a pilgrimage site for bitcoiners you know you'll see throughout the years people have gone and they leave little it's like going to a tomb because he he he died of als actually okay so he became paralyzed he died in 2014 and his disappearance and becoming paralyzed coincided with satoshi's disappearance but hal finney was the second developer also on this pgp project so he actually witnessed his friend phil zimmerman he was actually working for pgp until he died he witnessed his friend phil zimmerman be investigated and almost be and go through the whole thing am i it's a crazy story mit ended up sort of stepping in and printing the code in a book and they said it's freedom of the freedom of the press and all it was it's really cool and it started the whole free software open source movement hal finney was involved so having gone through that it would have made a lot of sense for him knowing that there was a possibility that this would happen to create an anonymous identity and to put it out the good thing about bitcoin is that the the concepts that bitcoin uses are they're all they all precede bitcoin so these are all concepts that had been tested for decades and the the cryptography the the hashing all of that is you use it every day so we actually couldn't do commerce on the internet without it when you see that little lock up on on your browser bar when you go to an ecommerce site and you see that lock click on that go into the certificate right you'll see words like sha-256 that's the hashing algorithm that's used in bitcoin you'll see rsa that's the public key cryptography system so these are all used so and the code is open source so it's been gone over with the fine-tooth comb since that time there's nothing hidden this is known technology it works it can be reconstituted from scratch so you know yeah i think i think the state actor thing is mostly not the not bitcoin itself but rather create how can i say this to create a threat which is strong enough so that it will justify the government creating its own digital currency which will have many strings attached it seems like this is happening now i saw an article recently about creating programmable digital currency in england for example where where in the code of the currency you can decide what it can be spent on you could decide that the money will lose its value after a certain time they can only be used by certain people like this is something which is live happening right now in terms of and it seems to be in some way a reaction to the crypto world saying okay well we need to now create our government you know because this is all dangerous this is this is dark web this is all this illegal stuff we need to create our own digital currency to compete with that and people will just accept it because the rest is dangerous like the other stuff is dangerous yeah well let's go down that rabbit hole for a minute because it's actually it's actually much crazier and i think your audience will appreciate this and i urge them to go down this rabbit hole themselves so what you're talking about is a central bank digital currency that's also called the cbdc and there is a cbdc that was created by the federal reserve that is ready to be released the federal reserve had actually announced that they were going to release a what they called a discussion paper it's basically a white paper they said that was going to happen in july it hasn't there's some legislation that's in this latest bill in congress that is probably what they were waiting for but what's interesting about this is it was created this central bank digital currency was created by the boston fed and the mit media labs digital currency initiative now what's interesting about this digital currency so people can go look it up this is not secret you go look up the digital currency initiative at mit that's who created it you can go and look up federal reserve and and that google it the cbdc this is this is known what's interesting about this digital currency initiative is in 2016 mit media lab reached out and hired the three basically top btc bitcoin developers the guys who held the keys what we call commit access the keys to the code the people who were deciding what goes into the code and what doesn't go into the code so this is gavin andreessen who basically had the keys handed to him by satoshi nakamoto he was like let's say the heir of satoshi nakamoto now disgraced within the bitcoin community corey fields and vladimir vanderland vladimir vanderlian is com is particularly important because he's considered fundamentally the lead developer he's the guy with the most he's the bishop right with the most power to be able to determine what goes into the code or not so they hired them in 2016 because there was no these guys were working in an open source world and they had no income so they had no direct bitcoin income and so along comes mit and says ah come and work on this research project just you can just do bitcoin research and all of that now if people go back what's great is to go back on the way back machine and go and look at the digital currency initiative site in 2016 and you scroll down and you see that indeed from the very start they were working on federal reserve central bank digital currencies from the very start when like two months before it wasn't that the federal reserve was going to announce that yes this had been created for them by mit vladimir vanderland who was the last one left basically quit at the digital media lab quit quit at the digital currency initiative and went si he and went basically silent he's basically as much silent really so what we come down to is the lead developers of bitcoin of btc of bitcoin core the main software are the ones who built the exact currency that you're talking about for the federal reserve they're the ones who built it because again money at the end of the day it was about well i gotta feed my kids like how long is that you know this is we're seeing that this is the narrative right the i gotta feed my kids narrative is leading to everything now one additional tidbit that's very interesting the head of mit media lab is gentleman by the name of joy ito right around the time that the epstein scandal broke he was forced to quit he was forced to quit why was he forced to quit because it was found out that around the exact same time that they started the digital currency initiative jeffrey epstein was donating a ton of money and there's emails some of it even in the name of another individual that we've seen quite a bit who used to run a tech giant and is now sort of retired from out of that in his name an email saying this is coming from that gentleman but please mark it down as coming from epstein okay now i'm not saying what that was going to fund but when you understand that the federal reserve was secretly funding their centralized version of bitcoin using the using the exact characters who were at the same time working on bitcoin core people can go people can go down that rabbit hole themselves but it's just like all of this is real right so joy ito he was disgraced he had to resign it was a big you could go look at new york times all of that because epstein was giving money under the table to them and he was hiding it yeah so it's coming no so jonathan again like that's coming that's here it was built by the same people that built bitcoin and it's not that it's a reaction to big it's it's not that it's a reaction to bitcoin because bitcoin's bad it's that it's a reaction to bitcoin because bitcoin is powerful so they were like no we need to have our own bitcoin but no proof of work none of this stuff we control yeah we control it centralized but all the rest the cryptography and everything because bitcoin works so it'll continue to be a kind of fiat currency but but it will be digital and it will be traceable and it will have all the let's say the cryptog cryptographic power of yep and programmable as well which means you can get money in your account and then if you write the wrong thing on twitter the numbers can vanish yes yeah or or just be locked yeah and and it yeah it doesn't matter if it vanishes because they can also create as many as they want right because the proof of work is what's controlling the emission schedule but when they want to print new money no problem yeah they just pre they just press a button still don't believe me they're not going to give themselves a 21 billion limit okay like that's not what's gonna happen with the central bank but it's mostly the idea of being able to to lock people out of the economy in this days that we haven't seen yet this is i mean that is the key it's and it's not just lock people out i think actually one of the most nefarious and frightening scenarios is expirable money yep that's right so they send you the funds and they're like if you don't spend this in 30 days it's gone you know money self-destruct a soft communism you know you get your allowance and you also can only spend it on certain things and then it then it then it disappears yeah so this is this is here yeah it's ready to be it's ready to be released i can't imagine that it's not going to be tied to all of these other things yeah and that same digital currency initiative built for japan for china for there there were a few there's like seven or eight countries that they built for for uk so it's all coming from the same place it's all coming from the same place and it's all based around the fundamentals of bitcoin all right so i guess like now that we're at the end of this very dark scenario i do want to hear about i do want to hear about in and of course i'll laugh when i say that i do want to hear about how this how this whole process kind of led you to orthodoxy because it to me it seems like a strange just a yeah a strange thing how how these things can be related it is it is very strange actually so you know as i said i've been working in this space for since since 2017 full blast and i've gotten a chance to work you know with some of the biggest companies on really great projects but i've also been lucky that i've been able to work with individuals who i was ideologically aligned with so it hasn't been these sorts of exchanges and the coin bases and whatnot it's been you know companies like bitcoin.com and others who are more focused around this vision of sovereignty of financial sovereignty and people having that and bitcoin being able to deliver it and when the all of this goofiness started in 2020 i was living with my family in southern california and i knew this is not the place to be so i saw in march when the things started happening i was like i know this pattern like i know exactly where this is going and we had been planning to to move to saipan but it got it got very much moved up and we we found ourselves here april 5th okay so this is recent i thought you had been in saipan for a while no no we came here because of that so we we came here fundamentally as refugees and i i've had a strong spiritual spiritual bent and i've been involved in a lot of different very powerful things so i had a very long relationship that many people know many years with ayahuasca and plant medicine and those types of things so i had a you know i had a i've always had a strong understanding of the mystical like the realness of the mystical in other words like no question that like there are spirits there is a spirit world like they interact with us you can speak to them and i think people have had the experiences that i've had you walk away like oh it's real right like real shamanist shamanism type experiences but in about in 2019 2018 i started delving into back into christianity and it was through i had seen a christopher hitchens speech around the time that he was you know dying of cancer and where he said that he was reading dharma mccullough's book christianity a history of christianity the first three thousand years i still know this is very interesting that this avowed atheist would be like crowing about how excellent this book was and so i got it on audiobook and it was sort of over the course of the year when i would do yard work on sundays it was like okay let me just dig into this right hadn't been to church since i was a kid you know had been exploring all of these other things and it it really i was really struck getting back into the ancient church about how little i didn't know what in terms of that history and then started into a a practice of prayer of course i don't know what i'm doing and fasting and i started to get some and i was working on bitcoin and some very difficult problems at the time and through the fasting and through this what i what i now understand was was developing a system of prayer through that i actually started getting solving all of these problems like i would be in the middle of a fast and i was getting and i was like okay this is so kind of very mercenary you know what i mean where i was like okay i'm getting so much insights from the past yeah yes exactly and so when i when i came to saipan i said well i'm going to actually take up and and where i had gotten the fasting stuff was it was mainly a lot of pentecostal that i was consuming pentecostal stuff and and i was like oh this is very interesting and it was resonating with me like i said oh there's a spirit thing and so when we got here we ended up we had this beautiful house right on the beach that was that we lucked into and i just started morning and evening a practice of prayer and and i don't know i don't know how it was that that i started doing the jesus prayer right so i don't know how i ran across it maybe it was from a pentecostal thing but i said i'm gonna do this and i'm just gonna this is where i'm gonna go and i'm gonna start with this and it was actually in it was coming back off the beach that i had this flash that said you're going to do this school it's going to be called bitcoin mystery school you're going to teach these things you've been working on these things you're going to teach these things and i was like nobody wants to what this doesn't even make any sense but i said okay i'm going to follow it right because i just i was writing my book i was getting a lot of insights from my book from this practice of prayer and i just announced hey i'm going to do this thing put a thing up and somebody who i had spoken to in the past reached out to me and said cool guy and he said hey there's some guys in my parish i'm orthodox i knew he was orthodox like there's these guys in my parish we would like to all do this like as a group we've been talking about like things that may be needed in the future we think bitcoin's important we'd like to do this as a group i said oh awesome you guys can be like my guinea pigs i'll do a private course you guys will be the very first course and it was in that course that one of the participants in the course was the priest of the parish okay and it was in it was so it was in that time and sort of some i don't know there was something going on with those guys it was really awesome and him in particular i was like he's a really unique guy and i was like and i said i wonder if he's got any youtube videos or anything like that and i just started that night in between the first and second i just started watching all these videos of him there weren't that many but things that he had done and it just really spoke to me and and sort of at the end of the class i said hey father you know i don't know if you're open to this but could we talk about maybe you helping me with my prayer like i would like to be more effective with my prayer and and so it was over the course of several months of him and i just having a a what's become a very deep relationship that obviously my prayer got much better and he you know sent me the orthodox prayer book and started talking about if you want to do this little did i know that i was becoming a catechumen and you know then then things just things got really really potent and powerful and honestly to a point that was beyond like i was going really far in terms of my prayer i had like i say i had previous this previous shamanistic experience so i was like oh i'm gonna try to approach it like that and things just got actually really serious to a point where i was like oh this is too much like this is i can't do this and so it was funny like the next time i said i need to talk with you the next time we had a conversation and like what i was wanting to say to him was i need to be at the church like because i would like to continue this practice but i can't do this outside of a framework of the church i realize that now right like i'm going to hurt myself mentally even physically right so i was like and it was and it was through that that he said okay then let's let's formally start your catechism and so we did that and then just through i mean it was very providential the way everything fell into place that he and a reader from his parish you know we arranged brought them out here to saipan they you know yeah we set up a little chapel it was beautiful they did the first orthodox services that had ever been done here baptized me in the ocean actually happened to be crazily enough i'm married to a russian orthodox woman and my kids are baptized yes and my and my children are baptized russian orthodox this is for how long have you been married i've i have six years i have a five-year-old yeah i have a five-year-old and i have a she's almost three three-year-old two and a half year old that those were the only times i had ever been in a orthodox church where the baptism isn't my children that's right but it's so interesting like she never pushed it on me yeah right but it's so obviously it really fell into place and then so they came came here did my baptism sanctified our marriage in the church which is beautiful so we got to have a church wedding here and and yeah since since that time it's been it's it's actually crazy things have happened to happen you know after they left a few weeks later randomly we're out on the beach fourth of july is fourth of july as a matter of fact we're out on the beach i take my daughter into the water i turn around sitting in the seat where i had been sitting is a priest orthodox priest in saipan exactly and i'm like what and all of our all like all of our we were out there celebrating so all of our friends were there and their mouths are like wide open he's in a full black cossack big silver pectoral cross my wife is crying and it's like he's a mission priest he's got a a parish in taiwan he answers he's like got this i forget what it i forget what it's called it's kind of it's like the equivalent of like an embassy sort of thing that the russian church does so he answers directly to the patriarch and so he said you know what no russian priests have been here for 200 years we have the records but i just decided that i was going to come here and guam and you people are the first people that i've ran into and you didn't know you were orthodox that's hilarious my wife saw him walking yeah with his cossack and everything wait she calls him in russian yeah and he's like comes over and sits down and then i walk up and i'm like what else this is this is incredible and so so then we got we had more you know more services here and actually some of the the people who are here kind of there's a little crypto community two of the brothers after experiencing that decided that they were going to become catechumens as well so it was like it was pretty great they were because it's been it's been incredible the things that have happened here and so so i'm you know part of the part of what was happening with with bitcoin was that the patterns and the reflection that i was that i was seeing and a lot of this is in is in the book that i wrote render into caesar was that it really is a reflection of the trinity the things that are happening in bitcoin so the way that bitcoin lays itself out the the pattern that's there is it's like it's a very much an echo of the way that the trinity is is laid out in the tradition and so these were the types of things that were happening and so for me you know i tell people like it's because bitcoin brought me to orthodoxy and so it's just the series of events that happened i mean because it makes no sense right like the way that this whole thing happened it makes no sense the way that it's laid itself out makes zero sense but but yet here i am yeah here you are that's for sure so can you explain i like can you give us a hint of why bitcoin what it has how it manifests the trinity because maybe it's too complicated but i when you said that i was like okay i would like to know that sure sure sure so so bitcoin is so bitcoin is basically the interaction as is as are so many things of some set of foundational and fundamental rules randomness and consciousness right so so this sort of potential potential and randomness this is what's happening in the proof of work so what proof of work is proof of work relies upon basically the law of random numbers and so that's what we're we're utilizing when you do proof of work what's happening is that you are you're basically let's say rolling gigantic dice and every single time you do this is called a hash and what comes back is a number and you're fundamentally trying to roll below a certain number that's like astronomically hard to do so if you tried to do this by chance i mean to give you an example like we're we're talking about exa hashes that are being done on these bitcoin networks so it's a million million million of these roles so that's a one with' zeros that you have to do every second in order that every 10 minutes you would come up with this number so it's like it's actually that it's it's your it's less likely so there's a lower probability of finding a bitcoin block like on a per-hash basis than a virgin birth would be so it's like they would say well a virgin birth is like technically possible right even like a materialist like they'd be like okay yeah there's some and if we had this confluence of events and you could lay it out that it would be like oh it's a one in a quintillion quadrillion chance that it would happen right well finding a bitcoin block is literally less than that less probable than that that's why you got to do so many roles right so you have this entire sphere of potential this is so it's basically yeah so a bunch of dies being rolled and then you have something which recognizes the right number let's yes so so some set of fixed rules so these would be like the consensus rules but that are also related to these mathematical truths right so they're built on top of the one plus one equals two right so we have these truths we have a we have a a box an arena whatever you want to call it we have some framework inside every in which everything is working and this is the framework of nature and then you have this very real probability that's going on and then you have the interaction of logos so it's that the logos actually is interacting with the so the consciousness of individuals can change some aspects of the rules the consciousness of the individuals is actually needed in order for somebody to turn on their machine and actually get it going right like it can't work by itself right so there's so there's this three way so you have this reality you have the system that's working it also has it also needs like something to care yes or do i need you need a you need an agent to care about this or else like it's not going to happen yes exactly exactly and so this is the very much to me in in contemplation in prayer in in in moving through this and again i go into it relatively deeply in my book that it's this very much to me is an echo of the the sort of the the trifurcation if you will of the one god into the three persons into the the eternal everlasting creator that is all everything into the potential of the holy spirit where it where everything is and into the the logos of the sun into into the care as you say into the human element right and that it's the interaction of all three of those that makes the system yeah and so i'm not sure about very much that for sure i'm not sure about the trinitarian but what i do see for certain is like the creation narrative in genesis like the sure the idea of heaven earth and then man or you know the the perceiver the the the agent which is able to act as a joining of the two together so you have this like crazy potential that's bubbling that's bubbling up all this stuff you know you have a pattern above and then you have something in the middle which is able to perceive that which is valuable out of what is coming up is able to say oh with that one that number is the one i care about all those other numbers they can just fall away that's the one that matters and then that is what kind of makes the system work let's say yeah i think that's i think that's very accurate and it is also that the the numbers themselves i mean as you just articulated it's not the numbers themselves that are valuable because getting the same number on a future block is not there's nothing there it doesn't mean anything so it's not just that you're looking for that number right it's it's you that you have to have a very specific number that's tied to a very specific history right so and that's the that's the as you say that's the awareness that's the consciousness that's looking at it and so it when when the system is is looked at as it is it's very different than and and it's very unfortunate to me that how it's perceived by the public when they talk about bitcoin and why you're absolutely right to have suspicions about that story is that oh this is something that i buy and then the number goes up and then i sell it after the number has gone up and here i am and it's like no it's really a lot deeper than that there's a lot more going on and it's brand new all right listen we've been going for quite a while so i think this you've definitely brought me at least along in understanding the manner in which it generates value and at least you know how we can understand it as a kind of this cosmic pattern of how something has meaning let's say and so it's helpful i still need to definitely need to think about it and interestingly enough i guess i'm being dragged into this right now and so i will i will start to to kind of experiment it in participation with my with my son and see you know i don't at least for now it's not i also i don't how can i say i'm not attached to it and so sure like for me you know we put it in put in a bit of money and we're just kind of watching it it's like it's like it's like an experiment for me so i'm just trying to figure out what what it is and so yeah so i will continue on thanks for your thanks for your time and absolutely well what i would say what i would say jonathan with that is pull it off the exchange and put it in a put it in a wallet and send it between your son send it to people use it right because i understand like you you've put in the bit of money and you're watching it go up but it's like if you want if you do want to feel it if you do want to explore it like you're going to need to use it right so you're going to see like there's ways like the idea that you could use it it only works if you exist within a network of people that are like you would i would need to be like let's say in your network of crypto users where we all recognize this and so we can use it to exchange between like amongst each other right but right now that's i'm not i'm not in that like i don't have a world around me where i can say oh you know you know like the guy the guy who comes and i don't know i a guy comes from my lawn and so i like send him some crypt i send him some bitcoin as a as like a payment for it let's say but that doesn't like at least now it does at least in my world that doesn't exist well maybe maybe what we could do is maybe for you for your you know your carving class or one of those things start accepting cryptocurrency and if you want some help with that yes and then you can be in the community i will pro i will promote that to my community and tell them go get into jonathan's class and pay with crypto i sell all my books for crypto i sell my classes for for crypto so it's like that will give you the opportunity there's nothing that allows you to feel the power more than actually not buying it and waiting for it to go up but to actually sell goods and services and your labor and to get it in exchange to use it i would love to help you all right yes i would love to help you do that all right i will i will definitely keep that in mind because i okay i think please do that i agree with you that it's the only way that i can really understand what it is and so so we'll see what happens everybody we'll sure slowly down this path so thanks thanks for everything supreme and and i'm for sure we'll talk very soon thank you brother
