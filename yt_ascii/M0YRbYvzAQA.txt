it's a it's an xbox with a screen so you can put a screen on your it's an x screen it's a x-green box but actually why would you want this we'll find out after our sponsor are you training deep learning models lambda can help many top tech companies rely on lambda's workstations servers and cloud services and you can visit lambda labs dot com linus to find out more [music] this is the x screen it asks hey why can't i use my xbox series s here or here or even here after raising a hundred thousand dollars on kickstarter australian gaming accessory startup upspec gaming proudly proclaims you can uprooting the console and thrusting it into the nomadic tribe of laptops with a simple click screw screw open hello and man is this ever a slick little package this completely cables combo is more leisurely luggable than anything you pelican case toting small form factor kings are used to once attached to the xbox the whole thing takes up just 4.1 liters and some interesting design decisions had to be made to achieve that for starters the x screen must fit a very specific form factor the xbox series s this forced upspec gaming to use a relatively uncommon 11.6 inch display which massively limited what kinds of features they could include while the console can technically handle 1440p and 120fps this panel is just 1080p and 60hz which frankly is fine by me you don't see many games targeting 120fps on the series s and 1080p is plenty sharp at this screen size now you might be thinking they could have got a slightly bigger display on here if the bezels were a little less chunky but the xbox only supports a 16x9 aspect ratio and being a small startup they couldn't just request manufacturers to make a custom panel to their exact specifications hdr or at least a higher peak brightness would be nice but the display has to run off the measly 4.5 watt output by the usb 3.0 sorry the usb 3.2 gen 1 port so a brighter display just wasn't possible speaking of usb-c we're still charging ahead with our cable testing and usbc you're next in line get subscribed so you don't get ripped off despite the power limitations at 350 nits i was still able to play games comfortably in direct sunlight in all but the darkest scenes thanks to the matte coating on the plastic screen its only major weakness the black levels this display just can't get very dark so low light scenes lack detail and are difficult to interpret the panel has an adequate 95 coverage of the srgb gamut and low display latency of about six milliseconds out of the box color accuracy was pretty okay with an average delta e of 5.7 the whole display was far too blue not bad for a gaming focus panel but after changing just a single parameter on our display we were able to get the delta e to an excellent 2.2 okay pixel response times were sufficient for the 60hz refresh rate so ghosting was never noticeable though 60fps just ain't as nice if you've acclimated to high refresh rate displays as i have and it also ain't as nice as the rose taupe color on our new women's sweatsuits at lttstore.com now something i never realized until this review was just how efficient the series s is when playing games on the xbox the whole package never pulled more than 75 watts from the wall meaning with the x screen you could play on some airplanes or if you have an inverter you could plug into the auxiliary power outlet in your car cyberpunk 2077 in your car no tesla required eat your heart out elon now as exciting as those prospects are unfortunately now we have to talk about compromise while the design allows for easy access to the power in and the storage expansion slot it blocks off all the other ports leaving you with just the lone front usb port no easier enough for you not until you eat your vegetables now in a perfect world you could leave the x screen attached so switching the xbox into a portable state would be just as easy as unplugging from the tv but that's not really practical considering that you'd have to make an hdmi passthrough to the tv and you would still have to have the x screen propped open anyway because it blocks off the console's exhaust when closed so the whole thing takes up way more space none of it is ideal another disappointment is the speakers they're loud but shouty like that guy at the party when you can get such good sound out of a macbook air it's hard to give these guys a pass especially since they have so much more room to work with frustratingly the volume is not evenly stepped on the quiet end of the volume bar every step is a leap in perceived loudness but then from like 10 to 80 it feels like there's almost no difference in volume and with the slow display menu and no mute shortcut you better not forget to turn the volume down before you turn on your xbox especially if you are working in say a quiet office new guy keep it down i don't know why i can't but here is my biggest qualm the build quality firstly the white plastic of the x screen isn't properly color matched with the series s it's got a slight yellow tone against the cool eggshell of the xbox secondly the display housing is flimsy you can make the back of the display cave in with very little effort so i worry the display could be damaged from something being dropped on the closed screen or even a bit too much pressure in an overstuffed backpack if you're lugging this thing around in your arm you can hear the plastic display bow inwards which is a recipe for scratches it's so weak that i can press the osd buttons through the back of the display while it's closed here look can you hear that what the hinges are also feeble and could easily be snapped by a fall from a table or a lap there are just so many little issues that make it feel like a prototype that's just a couple of revisions away from being production ready and at a price of 250 u.s just 50 less than buying a whole nother xbox this just feels cheap and i don't want to have to spring for the 60 carrying case and speaking of accessories these feet they are 25 bucks for these come on guys this should have been a pack in adding on the feet and the case brings this already expensive display to an eye-watering 335 dollars that's just too much especially when you consider that you could get a bigger and more versatile portable monitor for a similar price and with microsoft driving forward with xbox game pass and bringing their first party titles to both pc and console i wonder if it might be too little too late for this solution and that's a shame because i really do love this thing it's a slick little package that brings a laptop-like experience to a typically tethered device with a display that looks great in the majority of scenarios adam who wrote the script was happy to finally return the favor to his switch-faring partner and say oh no you can use the tv this time honey i'll play on the x screen chivalry isn't dead my friends good job adam and now that so many games have ditched local multiplayer this gives you the ability to easily place so many more titles in person without needing a whole mess of cables and screens and space it's a sweet product for a niche audience of traveling xbox gamers but if you can stomach the boutique price and poor build quality this combo of convenience and competent display tech makes me excited to see what upspec gaming will make next almost as excited as i am to tell you about our sponsor nordpass it can be really hard to keep track of all the passwords you use on a
