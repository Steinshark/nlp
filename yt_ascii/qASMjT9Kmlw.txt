[music] hey harry don't freak out but i know we've been working on part three for several days now but we have to throw it in the trash are you serious yeah we got to start over i just got off the phone with the nelk boys there's so much to this story it's convoluted competing interests it's we gotta scrap it and start over this is the video you are going to see about nelk private bet and wiza but we've learned new evidence which has changed our perspective on this not necessarily making anyone look better more like complicating the story and making it more interesting so this is us starting over and trying to make sense of a bunch of competing voices me stephen dude llc and the knelt boys enterprises bro like no one else bro we're not going to take millions of dollars to our fans ever bro we won't take any sponsorship money nothing bro like hey guys in the studio at night here just had to scrap the third video and restart i mean look it's gonna happen when you're doing something like this sometimes the truth isn't what you expect then other times the truth is confusing or conflicting because some of y'all i just say it have lied to me and let me say stop get some help no but the point is is that everyone in this story honestly it seems like they're trying to make themselves look as good as possible and it's hard to know who's telling the truth like it's almost like my job is a real life game of among us who is the imposter telling me lies but we'll get to that and we will catch those people for now i just want to catch up to speed and last thing if you enjoy these videos please pump the stock zilla by subscribing it's free might pay monthly dividends who knows you know one could say it's a gamble either way let's go to the board and catch you up to speed all right ladies and gentlemen in the last video we explained how these deals work with rhubarb these influencers get paid millions of dollars to stream themselves gambling but they're not actually playing with real money they're gambling with fake money coming from a sponsor that they all call howie we just lost 15 racks all right well let's call howie that was a test you might need to call how you might even really call harley off-screen because that was well let's see what howie's going to do they just lost 15 racks if you look at their bitcoin wallet here they're sitting at a toasty zero dollars okay god damn don't worry guys how he comes in clutch look at that bitcoin wallet up top their back to plane crash same exact stream that we were watching god damn they're constantly asking this guy for more money because they don't want to gamble a dime of their own money we literally trace the bitcoin deposit wallets of these guys they haven't ever put anything in dude aiden ross didn't put a dime of his money into that bitcoin wallet address how much money does aiden ross have in the account 300 000 dollars ladies and gentlemen where did he put the money in and of course not only are they no stakes gambling while pretending to high stakes gamble remember because they're making millions of dollars on these deals these influencers lives are basically controlled by ruben howie says jump these influencers say how high literally a kangaroo bro why do you want me to do that howie you're weird bro what are the eggs for this time what's it hot bro if howie says fly to mexico you better fly to mexico we're gonna be happy we're going to mexico hello we're at this lavish luxurious villa this other country i can tell you why we got it why we got the jet why we did it why why why we have officially partnered with reubet it's actually quite bizarre to watch all these cool influencers dancing like puppets for rupet like a weird version of squid game do a strange task for lots of money apparently howie has a challenge for us no he's gonna make you do an angry sound i'd bet you i'm out of this one i that sounded like a kangaroo to me all i got to say the money must be very good for these guys to be doing that but of course we know all that glitters is not gold sometimes these deals fall apart and it turns out this was the case with the nelk boys and reubet and wizza see many people noticed when the nilk boys suddenly went from streaming every day on reubet and being influencers on whizza their giveaway sister company to suddenly being wiped off the website with no warning none of the nel guys except for stephen dewitt remain remember our boy allen is supposedly the number one fan of full scent these are the number one fans of full sentence well it all started falling apart with the giveaway of a ferrari sponsored by whizza that seemed too good to be true i think it just seems like a scam because it's too it's it's it's too epic yeah it's too good to be true but it is true famous last words huh i don't know how to say this delicately but this thing was a disaster part four will explain a little bit more but this thing looked completely rigged and all of this caused an entire subreddit to be born called r slash full scam and this subreddit became devoted to cataloging nelk's missteps in the meticulous and obsessive way that only reddit really can now this is where the story diverges actually a little bit between what knox has happened and what reddit says happened the full scam page for the most part thinks that nelk and wizza were in on the ferrari giveaway disaster nelk denies this though they said they had no control and were working on it as part of a standard promotion saying that afterwards they immediately cut ties with whizza because they suspected something was up i of course asked for proof they sent me this this is from the full sin team on june 30th apparently they were mad because wizard had charged their international fans for raffle tickets for this ferrari even though there was no chance of anyone outside of the us winning they said quote nelk has received numerous complaints that its fans paid to enter for a drawing on wiza even though they were actually ineligible which resulted in them feeling scammed nelk's lawyers have advised that this was likely non-compliant with applicable law and accordingly nelk would prefer that everyone be promptly reimbursed and then a little bit later the breakup text so nelk will not be able to proceed negotiating the wizard or reuben agreements further given the relationship between wizard and rubet and the recent developments wow according to nelk they cut ties early with wizard and ruben and honestly that was probably a smart move although it looks like not everyone was on the same page because obviously stephen dewitt didn't leave wiz and rubet we also know lucas here also continued streaming on twitch with ruben so it seems like there are definitely some outside deals going on which will become interesting a little bit later now the other interesting thing we learned here is that when nelk backed out of wizard they were also out of rubet nelk told me this is because rubet and wizza were package deals for them which if you ask me is weird why is a giveaway company and a offshore gambling site tying their promotions together i mean yes they're owned by the same people but it doesn't exactly mix it'd be like a weapons dealer buying their firearms to also having to volunteer at the homeless shelter or a smoking company making you adopt the kitten for every pack you pick up i mean it's a little weird right if what nelk is saying is true i did talk to another few influencers who said their deals worked a little bit different and were separate but either way it raises a few eyebrows about where the money might be coming from for all these extravagant giveaways i mean listen this might be the time for the tinfoil hat here but go with me what better way to get money for a mclaren that you're gonna raffle off to your fans than from a lucrative thriving and maybe even offshore business you're running not accusing anyone here i just want to say that if it were me that would make sense right but it's important to say wizard denies the possibility of this completely they said quote wizard and rubet do not package their expenses the two companies are separate entities and pay their own expenses no one is concealing the overlap on the marketing team and the relationships they bring to the table so there you go take it for what it is i just thought it was weird that for nelk the deals were tied together and speaking of nelk people were still upset about the ferrari regardless of what was happening and people quickly found out looking behind the scenes that it wasn't the first time they tried to give away a car yes is that yours how are you going to lambo we teamed up with this company called moose and they just approached us they're like yo we got a full send lambo we want to team up with you guys what's the company that like how do you just get a lambo they just hit us up moose a charity company they bought the lambo and then they we push through our fans and then they buy entries and then so it's like one dollar entries you can buy as many as you want yeah basically the exact same thing fans paid money for tickets to a raffle and nobody really knows if the drawing was fair or in this case if it even happened no one knows what happened to the full sinned lambo it looks like the company moose gives was just a fly-by-night company that folded up and nobody got the car now once again i asked nelk about this and they responded quote we basically got left over in almost the same sense as we did here with whizza this is a lesson to never partner with a company to give away anything ever again they then talk a little bit about the agency they were working with at a time and ultimately say the same as this wizard we really know as much as the fans if this giveaway was done legitimately or not shortly after we fired wme for obvious reasons and then they finally say quote we've done barely any brand deals and it always comes with the same type of bs lesson learned for good this time so that's their statement oh and they also say that they were only paid 15k apparently for this deal as well and if that's the case i think they should have just come forward and addressed this stuff sooner but speaking frankly this kind of thing this giveaway thing is kind of like a full me once full me twice situation you know what they say about that don't you you better not fool me a third time but of course it gets worse yeah because right after this disastrous promotion with wizza and rubet they literally start promoting another gambling casino private bet has a pretty sweet deal for you guys right now they actually have an 100 deposit bonus guarantee up to 500 all you have to do is use my code kyle make an account on privatebet.com and dm him your username and we're gonna give away 250 250 dollars to a hundred people so all you guys on privatebet.com 250 each privatebet.com we'll be doing this real we'll do this a lot now this is totally weird for a lot of reasons first of all and obviously nobody's heard of this website like when you look it up it looks a little bit like like brand new and that's basically because it is it's offshore parent company xyz entertainment as it's called was created may 25th 2021. this thing's like a little baby so why promote it i mean why is a company like nelk not going with an established casino instead of just like a brand new one like this and this immediately got people thinking there's got to be more to this story and this got even more damning when some social media accounts called at blackjack were found being used for private bat here they are right here these have been since privated and the reason they were private is because they were tied back by a youtuber named harrison two people from nelk apparently nelk's president the president of full send apparently owns those social media accounts the obvious implication here being of course that private bet was owned or tied to nelk more than previously known which would obviously make sense of the reason that they're promoting this brand new casino this was further confirmed on the blackjack facebook page which was previously known as private bet and before that known as blackjack ventures and before that known as fulsond blackjack now i would show you some of harrison's video uncovering all of this but unfortunately surprise surprise it was copyright striked by none other than elk now i contacted milk about this because of course this seemed extremely fishy and they told me hey there's been a misunderstanding they don't own private bet at all but they know who does but refused to say but apparently they were working out a marketing deal with private bet and a social media deal that's the reason their socials were connected was because apparently nelk owned some gambling social media accounts at blackjack and they were going to let them use them in exchange for a lucrative deal so private bet was going to use at blackjack which was owned by full send and fulson was also going to promote them as a casino this was the story that i was told but they insisted that they never owned any part of private now of course i asked to see this marketing deal that was done and they told me they'd love to show it to me but it doesn't exist they never actually finished the deal which i found a little bit hard to believe nelk's story is essentially they promoted a gambling company offshore without owning it and without a deal talking terms and this is right after getting burned by another company that they didn't own does anybody else think this is kind of a weird story i mean knock would tell you that they only promoted it for a few days before pulling out of the deal and they say they're not going to do this any longer but i know a lot of influencers and almost none of them would promote a brand or product without any kind of deal first in writing especially not a brand as big as nelk you're gonna promote something without even a deal sketched out on a napkin i don't know i just don't buy it and i told the guys at nilk that i thought that there was something i wasn't being told because what doesn't make sense here is that milk keeps saying they've learned their lesson and need to stop promoting stuff they don't control right like that was the lesson with whizza they didn't control it and they got burned that was the lesson with moose gives they didn't control it they got burned and then their story with private bet is that they don't control it now when i told nelk that basically i wasn't buying it they said look we just didn't want to jeopardize a more lucrative casino deal in the future with an actual us casino that's regulated but that's the story you can make up your mind for what you want to believe i just want to present all the facts we have here i just personally the story doesn't make sense to me but around this time i was finding nelk a little hard to believe something even more unbelievable happened a supposed nelk whistleblower suddenly appeared on reddit on full scam promising to expose them the post is entitled my experience formerly working for steve will do it and nelk hosted by this guy zesty close the two giant claims i want to draw your attention to is one that private bet is owned by kyle and the shahidi brothers and two that the giveaway with the ferrari was rigged for a stunt i mean wow this could be big and of course i instantly reached out to this person i said are you willing to talk and quote what proof do you have that the ferrari is rigged he said hello i would love to help but i just received an email from the full sin team with a breach of contract luckily they have not determined who has written the reddit form as i worked in the full send and steve's accounting and another worker had left the day before me and at this point it looked like maybe this guy's the real deal but he can't talk because he's under nda so the question is how do we get him to talk and as you guys know meanwhile i'm in contact with milk so i start to hatch an idea of maybe how we can do this so my plan was i went to nelk and i said hey obviously there's this guy on reddit you guys probably have seen it who says he used to work for you he's exposing you guys is he telling the truth they say no i say prove it and of course they said how so i tell him look if he's not a real employee release him from his nda if he's just a fake employee he's just using this nda as an excuse not to prove he is who he says he is right and at this point i got to tell you guys there's a pause on the call as i'm basically asking them to waive their rights to an nda they discussed and they said all right done any nda on this whistleblower of nelk is null and void perfect so i go back to our boy zesty close and i say hey i just got off the phone with the nuke boys they say you're actually completely in the clear to talk with me so no breach of contract to tell me everything you know if you are who you say or you have no fear of backlash john and kyle have cleared you to tell me what you know and this is when our guy our supposed whistleblower zesty close it's his turn to get quiet he doesn't respond and suddenly his post which was highly upvoted is deleted i asked why hello why'd you delete your post he responded hey sorry these last days have been really busy for me sorry if i take a while to respond and i didn't it got deleted by someone else don't know who though hmm yeah i'm getting starting to get a little suspicious here so i followed up set for several days and the guy just ghosted right this supposed whistleblower turned out to be completely fake and i gotta say partially in defense of the nilk boys here like look get mad at him for the wizard stuff moose gives or the private bet story of theirs but don't make up stuff pretending to be an ex-employee like if you're that desperate to expose someone that you fabricate working with them aren't you worse than the people you're exposing i don't know i just wanted to say that but despite this being cleared up i'm still not done with nelk here because believe it or not we still have one final piece of the puzzle and it comes from lucas one of the nelq boyce also known as gaspo show on twitch and by the way this guy the second we mentioned we were doing a story on rubet all his videos on youtube and twitch were deleted i wonder why same with steve will do it by the way but anyways remember we said earlier that lucas and steve continued to stream on reubet well after june 30th when supposedly nelk broke off the contract and apparently it was because they had their own deal well lucas apparently was up to some sketchy stuff according to a former moderator who provided extensive evidence and accused lucas of rigging stream giveaways with rubet that's right if you don't know one of rubet's big things is all the streamers apparently give away a portion of what they won at the end of their stream it's the reason that rubet streamers are always talking about how much money they're giving away as lucas explains all you have to do is create an account with rubit and you too can win make sure you guys are using promo code lucas up here l-u-c-a-s collect that  make a new account do what you got to do helps you guys out for the giveaways a whole lot so if you guys want free money man all you got to do is that free money that's right these guys if you use their code they're going to give you free money but apparently that's false because allegedly lucas was scamming people by not giving away money randomly to his viewers but instead giving it away to himself and his moderators here's how it apparently worked moderators would create a series of shell rubed accounts brand new accounts like this accounts like rix and morty icy drops merch buyer several accounts just like these would be created all in the same day would be fresh accounts and then would happen to win the giveaways of lucas but they were really controlled by his moderators who were feeding him names the way it worked was allegedly one of the moderators nate would send lucas names ahead of time and lucas would select the names that he knew his guys controlled according to a statement from the whistleblower quote nate had set a certain type of order in lucas's streams he became the main guy controlling things like lucas's tick tock account and making sure staff were paid things stayed like this for three weeks nate would message us asking us for our ruben names and making sure we would be paid and at first i didn't bat an eye or anything and this guy went so far as to actually send me the blockchain wallet where these accounts were winning on july 30th for example when all these shell accounts were created as you can see here are some winnings on july 30th coming from the rubid hot wallet itself and allegedly lucas not only paid his twitch mods with this he would also get a cut of the supposed giveaways he was doing now of course i confronted lucas on this wanting of course to give him the chance to comment he refused and instead i just heard that he no longer wants to stream gambling anymore not about figures now what does all this mean right i'm throwing a lot of facts at you guys let's put it together for a second please as we found out there's a lot going on right contracts being broken faking da's fake whistleblowers no story about private bet which sounds fake to me and of course lucas's fake giveaways i think the common thread here is kind of clear but more than that i really think what we're seeing is a group who can't decide what their ethical line in the sand is on the one hand some of nelk says they're done with wizard after they suspect them of scamming their international fans while at the same time other members of nelk are still their number one promoter you see one part of milk say they're done with reubet while the other part of nelk is busy running a giveaway scam on rwbet you have one part of milk saying they're done with sketchy brand partners they don't control and then they go out and promote this supposedly another brand they don't control because they never had a deal worked out i think it's honestly sad because without all this sketchy stuff i think nell could probably ride this full sin brand into the sunset making millions of dollars off merch and happy dad dollars but instead it seems like they can't keep their members from reaching their hands in the cookie jar and if they keep doing that the name full scam is eventually gonna stick so what will they choose i don't know but i think what milk does next will determine a lot now coffee now is there a way where it's like to just make this like right [music] you
