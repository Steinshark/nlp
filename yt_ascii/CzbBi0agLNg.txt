i uncovered a fraud worth 4 billion dollars there is an fbi investigation lawsuits and a lot of influencers i still have unfortunately the worst coin that ever existed safe mode this is the story of safe moon a crypto coin that millions of people hold and some believe is here to change the world it's more than just talking about a store of value which wasn't the focus it's more about building the future and building a safe future and bringing it now but what if they're wrong i've been working with a small team to investigate safeman for almost a year now and what we've uncovered is shocking secret payments i believe you got to pay off and went away deleted evidence it's a true fbi operation here redacted everything and hundreds of millions of dollars that appears to have been stolen provably on the blockchain welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffeezilla let's get into it are you sure this is smart i mean this isn't the small fries you used to go after yeah i know this is a billion dollar company i i know you're accusing some of these people of actual crimes look i know do you do you know there's risks to messing with money like this this isn't a game anymore okay fine if you really think it's so irresponsible of me how about we flip for it heads i go through with the video tails i don't this is a story of greed bad financial decisions and somehow gambian wind farms the creators of safe moon are now being sued and investigated by the fbi but before we get to that we have to discuss how did this all start who creates coins like safe moon was it a crypto mastermind like soulja boy or garyvee no it turns out it was a guy who believes in q yes that cue his name is kyle and very little is known about him other than he distrust the government and thinks they're a bunch of criminals which i don't know fair enough i guess but kyle's not gonna complain about it like most people and i think he decided at some point if you can't beat him you might as well join him and he decides getting into crypto is the perfect way to start redistributing some of that wealth back to himself and that's when he starts making a bunch of points coins like give me your money token really classy stuff you know but for some reason this really wasn't working out for him until kyle found something called b token now when kyle invested in b token he liked that it had a special property to it a five percent tax on every transaction which was then split into two parts three percent was added back to the liquidity pool and two percent was distributed to all the holders of b which just encouraged people not to sell you just held and made money and kyle liked this idea a lot which is why soon after he copied the code and launched it himself but with a few changes he raised the tax to ten percent and he changed the name to something a lot more catchy he called it safe moon and he promised everyone from the beginning no rug is possible join us on our journey safely to the moon now just so you understand in the world of meme coins safe moon basically translates to easy money safe money it's like setting the world's most delicious cheese on the world's most obvious trap which is why of course everyone fell for it look i appreciate your concern but somebody has to do this there are literally millions of people who are invested in safe and those millions are gonna hate you for it you think anyone who is in safe moon is going to be grateful for your story they're gonna be pissed coffee and not at the people who lie to them but at you for telling them the truth and the probability of you coming out ahead is unlikely that's all i'm saying yeah you're probably right but you're gonna do it anyways yeah humans are so confusing sabrin immediately went viral because of the promise of safe easy money and kyle pretty clearly wasn't ready for it people who knew him say kyle kind of didn't think this stupid plan would actually work hi i'm james i was a senior moderator for safe moon kyle told me that he had no idea safely was going to explode like it did his expectation was that he would be in and out that's right he was expecting to be in and out and i only can imagine how he probably thought to himself how can people be falling for this but clearly they were and kyle decided he may need to hire some people at this point to help him out but when it did take off he wasn't prepared he had to bring in people really fast and he did kyle hired a bunch of people almost as unqualified as himself there's a guy thomas smith who became the lead developer he's a grown man who insists everyone call him papa i'm your papa i'm the lead dev here now after papa a guy named john caroni is brought on as the ceo of safe moon and he turns out to be the guy in the group project that sort of everyone ends up hating their argument had always been oh we brought john on in you know the heat of the moment because we needed to it was an emergency we're so sorry for bringing him in and he ruined the project there's also a bunch of people hired at this time that you're not going to need to know till later so we're just going to ignore them for now but here they are on screen this was just all thrown together in the heat of the moment call it what you want the incompetent avengers the league of extraordinarily stupid gentlemen either way it kind of worked in their favor for the following reason it is hard to tell when safe moon is malicious and when it is stupid there just is a problem with that and there's reasons for that which we can get into later you see that's bootsy one of the researchers i worked with and you can tell he's sort of been hit by this smoke screen of stupidity that safe moon has created like here's a guy who's been researching safe moon for 11 months alongside strider and myself and we're all still baffled people just can't figure out how something this dumb made this much money so we have a valuation of around three to four billion dollars and we did this all in nine months so i almost helped them in a way how dumb it was and people were buying like crazy because who doesn't want easy safe money and you know who actually loves easy save money more than anyone influencers this is all in april 2021 that's when safeman really exploded in popularity they had billboards across the nation they had the biggest influencers talking about them not that it was free of criticism unfortunately this is a giant ponzi scheme those are just the haters that needed to be destroyed by the safe moon army that by the way is the name safe mooners gave themselves and they declared war on the haters here's one of many of these safe moon soldiers we are the safe moon army and i am safe moon soldier i didn't get this tattoo for no damn reason nobody will ever silence me with threats or threaten my money you know it's almost embarrassing to watch a grown man defend a token that was designed to rob him of his money but maybe it's time to talk about just that how safe moon was designed we're going to talk about how safe moon was supposed to be so safe because that's really the point of all this isn't it your money is supposed to be safe and that idea came from this claim about a locked liquidity pool but what does that mean in defy the way you trade tokens is with something called an lp liquidity pool ever every pool basically has two different currencies and the point of it is to provide buyers and sellers a way to trade without regular market makers like wall street has in a liquidity pool the way it works is the ratio of your two assets determines the price for example one liquidity pool might hold 5 000 safe moon and a thousand bmb paired together and the price is just the ratio of these assets so five to one in this case and i can trade on either side of it i can sell safe moon by putting safe moon into the pool and getting bnb out at that ratio or i can buy safe moon by putting bmb into it and as people buy and sell this ratio shifts and the price changes automatically now the more liquidity you have the bigger the pool is the better because price stabilizes and i can feel you all collectively yawning at this point so we're gonna move on before we put anyone to sleep but just know the key innovation of safeman was this idea that every time someone trades you just take five percent of it as a tax and and put it into the liquidity pool and lock that money up so safe moon the company can't touch it that way you know as an investor you can always trade safe moon for a fair price this is how you avoid the scam of how tokens commonly get rug pulled where suddenly the price or liquidity pool of a project would collapse which happened all the time in d5 with cases like this so the market cap is 2.168 trillion dollars and now the mark oh oh we went to zero yeah yeah the whole pitch of safe moon is basically look rug pulls like that that's impossible with safe mode because the money's locked up it's right there in the read meets automatically locked up or wait was it auto locking because i kind of read that too oh that's probably the same thing unless it wasn't locked at all oh this is confusing safe moon appears to be contradicting itself maybe we should go to the ceo of safe moon so he can explain it once and for all so the lp lock is automated not automatic automated and automatic are not the same thing hmm that didn't help well maybe maybe we go to the source code that they copied from b token and figure out what's really going on here surely b token wasn't a rug pull so we have this b token code and b was kind of a smaller rug pull oh well that's that's even worse how are we getting out of this one fellas our big difference you're gonna find that we're never gonna rug oh i think we're looking at a pinky promise protocol here fellas but if b token could rug pool that means the funds and safe moon are also not locked up and are also not really safe so that was kind of a huge lie but surely this guy has the best of intentions and won't have any skeletons come out of his closet later and incriminate him i said knowing that i'm about to play a clip let's not pretend why we're here call this ideal ideological like let's let's save the rockets thing this is about money oh we're in a bit of trouble here aren't we look guys i'm not against money right i'm i'm american so as i like money as much as the next guy as long as the next guy is in jake paul but you know this just doesn't seem like a good deal at this point especially when the founder created a token called give me your money but i get it look that's just my opinion right we need evidence now and so that's when i started looking at the blockchain i started collecting all of safe moon's wallets and identify them and when i did i found that kyle had already been rug pulling safe moon since it started just more slowly than the b token guys see on march 5th this shows up on the blockchain as the function remove liquidity which of course they said was impossible and the first time they took from the cookie jar it wasn't for much only fourteen thousand dollars was taken but it added up over time and i worked with a blockchain researcher to find out just how much kyle took the total amount of safer that came into kyle's wallet was over 164 trillion tokens fast forward to mid-september to mid-december this grows them just under 10.3 million wow that's a lot of money for a token that was never going to rug pull and maybe that's why the fudge just seemed like it wasn't stopping safe moon may have been booming from influencers but they're suffering from a major pr problem known as evidence and this is when a twitter account called war on rugs first appeared who started warning people that quote the likelihood of losing all funds was absolute with safe mode now this was a pretty epic ownage of facts and logic from war on drugs here and it seemed like safe moon was on the ropes right up until warren rugs decided to scam people himself with his own rug pull to which yeah that only response is like how the guy calling out scams decided to scam people himself which as you guys know i would never do to you pump the stock zilla and basically safe moon was like aha well that guy's a scammer so are we cool now everyone and everyone was kind of like i i guess we'll forget about it all he both seemed to have pointed something out pretty important about safe moon but then he also turned out to be a real piece and after war on rugs the safe moon army just really kind of rallied against anti-scammers and they made it their mission to expose the exposures with people like this this channel will be dedicated to exposing opportunists and schillers of fud fud for those that are new to the term stands for fear and certainty and doubt my mission is to analyze and expose those that use fud to manipulate you for their own personal gain now i know what you're thinking with rambo over here going seal team six and all the haters safe moon must be doing pretty well and it's true they decided it was a good time to clear up all the fud once and for all with a smart contract audit today the safe moon audit just dropped on our heads so that happened except the auditors were like yeah your code kind of sucks and there are major vulnerabilities my favorite quote is that they said mishandling it can have devastating consequences to the project to which safe moon was like oh well you don't have to worry about that because if we took your money we'd get sued and go to jail now of course within a year of that they would be sued and investigated by the fbi but we're getting ahead of ourselves safe moon even for all its hype just really still had problems internally like people are leaving the company everything is kind of a mess and maybe that's why at some point the ownership of safe moon was transferred over to papa and just so you guys understand the safe moon community like worshiped this guy here's an example this guy says papa's literally a genius xrp offered him 2 million to work with them and he denied it any blockchain project would die to have pop on their team and papa says like truth now later the xrp team would reply that they had no idea who papa was and had never heard of them but the point is the safe moon people thought papa was the reincarnation of satoshi nakamoto and that he was gonna usher safe moon into a golden age of prosperity and now did that happen no in reality papa just stole more money like kyle did except he was a bit craftier about it i guess like when kyle stole money he just kind of took from the liquidity pool but papa was different he had a story about it he justified himself by saying he wasn't rug pulling liquidity he was moving the funds in a fund migration from a version one liquidity pool tweet version two and as they told it it was for the people's benefit in fact every time pop-up migrated these funds he would send the same memes every time boom but behind all the boomer memes not all the money made its way over and you might not be surprised to find out that some of it found its way into papa's pockets we first find a hint of this on may 12th when he says i migrated the lp in a way i figured everyone would love but here's what actually happened i'm gonna visualize what papa should have done versus what he actually did what was supposed to happen in a migration is that he would move the bnb safe moon pair from v1 to v2 simple right instead papa did something different he took the bmb pair from v1 but kept the safe moon and he only put the bmb into the v2 pool with a purchase of safe moon meaning papa got more safe moon from the v2 contract as well now on the surface this appeared to cause the price to spike because a huge purchase order was just made but in reality papa was keeping gigantic amounts of safe moon that he could later sell for a personal profit and the value of safe moon overall was falling once again me and some researchers calculated how much in dollars papa took and here's what we found so thomas's true liquidity' different times he actually held on to 143 million dollars worth of liquidity the sum of outgoing safe mode transactions was about a hundred million dollars of the 100 million 58.99 million dollars went to bitmart and 8.1 million dollars went to other undisclosed wallets i feel like i need to remind everyone this is the same guy who also said this our big difference you're gonna find that we're never gonna rug so i guess turns out that was a big lie and the money wasn't safe after all but as with all things safe moon things are about to get much worse you have to understand safe moon at this point was under a lot of stress and the team was kind of a fracturing internally caroni in particular was the most hated on the team people didn't like how he wanted to run things and here's one of safe moon's own developers hank wyatt blaming him for a lot of safe moon's problems that was an organized thought attack that was only a small small amount of why the red candles were happening john wouldn't let us lock up a quarter of a billion dollars in liquidity that's why all the fun of it and when we asked him hey we don't need this money we shouldn't touch it and he said oh no but we can still do some of it and he wanted to run from the lp yeah he can lick my whole balls now i know what you're thinking i probably could have cut that last part of the call and you still would have gotten the gist it could lick my whole balls but you know i really think you have to hear these people describe john caroni in its full glory to understand just how hated this guy was there's like no substance of a human there anymore he's just dick he's just john's a monster and does not care about his employees whatsoever this is gonna sound really up and i apologize in advance the only time i like john is when he's depressed see now you get the picture basic no one liked coroni and this rift only escalated with operation phoenix first signs of this was when john started talking about project phoenix which he then changed to project phoenix because he spelled it wrong and refused to admit that he just made a spelling error and i have no idea why but it will haunt me to the end of my life because he literally could have just switched it and instead he is running with it to this day we're fast approaching our full unveil of operation phoenix but he starts talking about project phoenix the rest of the team doesn't talk about it at all which didn't seem like much of the time until later on when we get the leaked audio can you explain what the operation phoenix is nobody can explain what operation phoenix is including john operation phoenix is is a little bit of a journey but it's mainly a bunch of different complex things coming together to create an evolution he has a lot of claims of what it can be or what it could be it started out as banking the unbanked in africa the most overused phrase by anyone who has a lot of money in the crypto space talked about how it was going to be utilized as a currency in the gambia then it became about windmills and clean energy then it became about burning tokens with those windmills somehow the phrase every turn a burn became a thing for a while nano technology was used at one point according to them i can't go any farther than that truly i'll just keep rambling about it it's a gobbledygook it makes no sense so to summarize john is off doing whatever project phoenix is and he wants to use the safe moon war chest to fund it meanwhile the core team kind of hates jon they resent him but they can't kick him out because he's the ceo so instead they decide to start a new project they call it piggy bank token so the idea of piggy appeared to just be their next attempt to do whatever it is the team wanted to do without john that was another example of the rift that seemed to have been created now piggy would turn out to be a big failure in the months ahead but the anti-coroni team decided they weren't going to leave safe moon quietly many of them wanted their cut of the pie hank wyatt for instance wanted a three million dollar severance package his best interest is to give me my three million dollar severance package his big plan was to use his ownership over safe moon's various social platforms as leverage when the forcing his hand on that one because i also own the twitter but this bad attempt at blackmail sort of backfired on hank when this audio call leaked and hank was basically just kicked out immediately the whole team would eventually be replaced as well as coroni realized what had happened with piggy but i started to wonder was it just hank looking for a payout do you think thomas kyle these guys basically got paid off to not become like permanent enemies of safe moon i believe that kyle we had a discussion or in legal discussions with their lawyers about suing safe moon to regain control thomas said that he'll honor whatever i'll agrees to one of the things that they were going to ask for was to be paid could go away essentially i'll sue you for all this fraud and all these things and you will very possibly have criminal charges and then he gets a payoff i believe he got a payoff and went away because it just disappeared it never said a word to us about what what happened [music] well those are quite the allegations but in order to understand whether they're credible we need to start talking about john caroni all right so hey i'm john i'm the ceo of safe moon we already know most people didn't like him but we're gonna take our own look at him and decide for ourselves caroni's past is mostly military he worked for the department of defense and his parents are both former cia and it's clear from the beginning that he wanted to run a much different safe moon than the other guys he saw himself as something of a tech visionary and he saw safe moon as the vehicle for that he said safe moon was a technology company where a nine-month-old blockchain innovation company a tech company they were gonna build products like a crypto wallet and yes gambian wind farms and it wasn't until september 2nd that crony would truly get his chance to fulfill this vision he was already ceo but a lot of people were struggling with him for power and for influence but after the piggy bank token disaster caroni really got the chance to clean house he was about to get his chance in the driver's seat now when most people talk about visionaries you think of elon musk or steve jobs but everyone forgets that 99 of visionaries are just all talk first they think you're crazy then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world and coroni basically fits this second model he talks a big game but he kind of lacks the track record let's start with the gambian wind farm remember that this is that project phoenix thing we heard so much about welcome safe moon army and the wider tech audience to your operation phoenix revealed let's start with wind we've given you a lot of teasers regarding the wind turbines but here are the details the use of wind power has proven viable and just as small plane wings have evolved over the years so can the physical designs of turbine now wait a second i know what you're thinking that wind turbine it looks pretty good actually and that's because it's someone else's wind turbine a company called simtiv made it here's the actual ceo these is family and a small scale wind turbine to generate simple affordable and reliable wind energy now i don't know about you but the fact that safe moon didn't build the technology in their tech demo seems like a bit of an issue but here at safe moon an issue is just an excuse to innovate so what was that innovation well if you can get past phd level word salad basically they put little dots on the windmill and claim to make it more efficient which gonna need to see some evidence for that one fellas and safe moon's other technologies aren't much better safe moon launched their own crypto wallet which was supposed to replace the popular trust wallet app the only issue is seems to be a one-to-one copy of the trust wallet but now it has the safe moon logo on it and has the safe moon colors and all this is right in line with safe moon's business practices from the very beginning when they took b token renamed it and called it a big innovation or sorry they called it an evolution safe mode is the evolution safe moon is the evolution rate in solution you have to be willing to evolve we've talked about safe moon's contributions to technology we need to talk about the one thing they did that does seem original and that's the v2 contract of safe moon see safe moon was still getting flack for being the clone of a rug pull so they decided they were going to upgrade it now mind you this is different from like the v2 liquidity pool we talked about papa migrating to this is an actual upgrade of the token itself unsurprisingly this upgrade would turn out to be a total disaster the big difference is for version 2 were really the changed fees instead of a 10 tax split two ways there were now four different uses of the fees as well as a switch to a proxy contract but the big question became how do you get everyone to switch over to this v2 token they didn't want to split their community so they decided to force people to switch using a hundred percent tax what could go wrong the big one is regarding the 100 tax yeah so basically we had to we were shutting down v1 so yes they raised their tax of safe moon from 10 percent to a hundred percent in an attempt to make the v1 token useless and force everyone to migrate their tokens over to v2 where it's actually usable the problem of course is that a lot of people who invest in safe moon aren't tech savvy and when you send money on safe moon with this 100 tax which you can do you get completely wiped out essentially if you try to do anything but migrate your tokens to v2 you would lose all of your tokens where'd it go hey news flash safe moon and anybody else out there it shouldn't be that complicated now it turns out you can actually calculate how much people lost in this safe moon v100 tax thing and here's what we found so the 100 tax was implemented on december 29th after summing up the incoming safe mode in bnb and its historical value the total loss is added up to 102 million dollars wow a hundred million dollars and that money it didn't go nowhere these lost tokens they went to the liquidity pool and we know who controls that john caroni now it's worth saying that some in safe moon said that they were going to pay people back for these losses this guy the fud hound who you saw earlier real name ryan he said that they were gonna refund people affected by v1 taxes two weeks later ryan would resign or get fired depending on who you believed ryan said he felt forced to follow his code of ethics caroni said he was fired for breaching confidentiality maybe he just said a little too much but i'm sure losing one of your community figureheads isn't that ominous i'm sure everything's fine guys right honestly this is where safe moon really goes from like kind of a disaster to full on everything's falling apart so it's gonna feel like we're jumping around at times and i apologize for that in fact i actually forgot to to mention we kind of skipped by the fact that at this point the fbi had actually started investigating safe moon so you know there's that hank was visited by the fbi at one point asked about all of us i guess it says something when an fbi investigation is a side item that you're like oh yeah did i mention that and not only that things got worse of course because calls leaked of former safe moon members talking about deleting evidence in case of an fbi investigation you also got to be careful because if they believed that you delete it out of consent to you know i'd evidence yeah if you're deleting it before being subpoenaed you're not deleting any evidence of anything you're just deleting your messages it's a true fbi operation here redacted everything the strategy seemed to be you know delete evidence before they tell us not to delete evidence which we'll see how that works out for them although we may not have to wait that long because soon after this a class action lawsuit was filed against safe moon the creators of safe moon and all the influencers who promoted it were all accused of pumping and dumping the coin and frankly when you look at the 97 pages of evidence it does seem pretty overwhelming like i said at this point things were just falling apart and while crony would usually use this time to pivot to some new hair brain scheme he had cooked up his interview started to go a little differently there were a group of people who accused safe moon of false and misleading statements and not having the liquidity behind the currency are you talking to your community are you just hoping they all go away yikes that's probably not how he thought that was gonna go now coroni gives the stock response of course again we won't comment on an ongoing case but safe moon will continue mission we'll continue moving forward but you have to wonder what their play is here safe moon is down 90 percent and almost everyone has abandoned ship i still have unfortunately the worst coin that ever existed safe moon i came on this show i i bought forty thousand dollars of it and i now have two thousand left so and at this point john crony is really sort of the last one standing he's the last one left and i'm sure the most relevant question many people have at this point is like this okay look kyle took money we get it papa took money fine the v2 robbed people of millions of dollars okay maybe they'll one day pay that back coroni sucks as a boss fine they're getting sued okay actually none of this is okay but the question is is caroni actively profiting from safe moon the way kyle and papa did is he misappropriating the lp as i'm writing this this is still the sentiment in safe moon's discord these people still believe the great john caroni would never do anything sketchy quote i can't imagine him doing anything unethical with the pool of money so now we're gonna shift gears and take a look at that is coroni the hero who kicked out all the bad apples is he an out of touch visionary who bites off more than he can chew or is he something else as i started my investigation the first thing i realized with coroni is that he behaves differently than kyle and papa he doesn't move liquidity around as much but it's clear he's getting the money from somewhere after all he claims safe moon had 90 employees so where did the money come from to pay for all these people naturally i asked around they're paid to be on the park all right according to ginger bitmart is the source of new funds allegedly bitmart by the way is an exchange like coinbase and they were one of the first to list safe moon on their exchange but the answer you just heard that safe moon is being paid to list on bitmart didn't sound right to me so i asked bitmart via email and they replied that they weren't paying safe moon it was the other way around quote safe moon paid bitmart to be listed so then the question is how is safe moon making millions from bitmer because we know they are recently an employee came forward anonymously and told me that after safe moon signed the bitmart deal quote john said to us that he was going to put us all in a new tax bracket although this person says they never saw any of that money so again the question is not if safe moon was making tons of money but how they were doing it since they weren't being paid to be listed i had to dig in deeper so i started to look at the way things worked on bitmart because it was a little bit different see bitmart artificially implemented tokenomics the way safe moon always had with a 10 tax however the way bitmart did it was slightly different normally five percent of each transaction would go directly to the liquidity pool but bitmart did it slightly differently quote five percent will be returned to the developers to be added back to the liquidity pool for safe moon tokens so instead of sending the fees directly to the lp they sent it to safe moon's developers to do it but go with me here what if the money never made it there what if bitmart sent those fees to safeboon to put in the lp and they just kept it that would be pretty damning wouldn't it but the question is how do we find out for sure if this theory is correct and this is when i realized i needed coroni's wallets to figure out if he was getting large payments from bitmart and what he was doing with them because bear in mind crony was not a rich man before safe mode so if he's getting millions of dollars from bitmart we know why the problem is coroni was the most clever of all of these guys at hiding his wallets coroni is like a ghost i didn't have anything on him so to figure this out i knew i'd have to dig deeper than i ever had before i started by trying to talk to people who had worked for safely i knew one of them would have seen coroni's wallets right like or have been paid by it and i just kind of had to convince them to tell me what it was now obviously most of the people i talked to said well i can't talk maybe they felt threatened or they felt like they were under nda or they just didn't want to be part of a piece fair enough but eventually i found the right person he said quote there's a lot of information surrounding safe moon yes i do have an nda regarding internal things but a lot of things i witnessed aren't covered under that now this person asked to remain anonymous for obvious reasons because they felt threatened before by some of the members of safe moon and they wish to not repeat that chapter of their lives but when i got on the phone with this person they were a gold mine they had direct links to several of the team members and provided two really important wallets in particular the most notable were a kyle wallet who's the creator of safe moon and john caroni's secret wallet that they had both been hiding and they tell us a lot we're to start with john caroni's alleged wallet which is this the first thing we find is that he was is receiving massive payments of tether totaling up to 15 million dollars and where did these payments come from from bitmart he also had 4 million in safe boon this would all seem to confirm the theory that the fees from bitmart that were supposed to go to the lp may have been used by coroni after all he said the bitmart deal would put them in a new tax rack but in addition to that i also saw something else which is millions of dollars flowing from coroni's wallet to a familiar address not the liquidity pool but kyle the creator of safe moon the one we had been told had been paid off by coroni and this all corroborates the information that the ginger gave me earlier i believe you got to pay off and went away because it just disappeared you never said a word to us about what what happened not that this case is fully settled we still have many questions like what exactly was this three million dollar payment to kyle for where did the rest of the month money from bitmart go i reached out to john caroni about this regarding this investigation for over a month to see if he had any way of explaining these problems he declined to comment my opinion it may just be that there is no good explanation for this and crony just wants to stay quiet but the question is where does that leave us the story of safe moon may not be over but the winners and losers are basically decided the winners are kyle papa and caroni who all made millions of dollars off this thing not to mention the several safe moon insiders who didn't even have time to talk about today they also got a cut and the influencers they also got a cut basically everyone except for the real believers in safe moon one the real losers were the people who held on to hope held on to the belief that maybe if they just trusted this this new fancy crypto thing they could escape their dead-end job maybe they felt stepped on by the system like kyle used to feel only for them this time they were were just stepped on again just in a new way in a new system created not by governments or laws but by unregulated financial markets the only real hope for justice here is that regulators do what they've been failing to do for so long in the crypto space which is protect consumers from fraud and ultimately i do believe that's what's happened here fraud i think you can get lost in semantics in the stupidity smoke screen that safe moon kicks up you know you can get lost talking about the gambian wind farms but ultimately the real story is that safe moon said the funds were automatically locked up your money is safe and it wasn't they took the money at the expense of the investors and that's the story nope it's not enough oh come on look at all the evidence i'm telling you coffee evidence does not matter you're exposing things people don't want exposed yeah maybe either way i'm just kind of glad it's all over well now that that's over let's give the people what they really want i just got a hot lead on will smith wait hold that thought maxwell i just got a text from papa he wants to talk i'm not really considering this are you of course i am he could be the final piece to all of this no he's not i'm telling you they don't want to know well i do and i'm taking this call next time on coffeezilla this feels like fraud this is fraud i mean how could it not be you guys are millionaires your investors are down 90 and you guys are million millionaires directly from a representation that was false do you feel bad for all the safe moon investors have watched this coin that they loved like plummet ninety percent yeah they do as as you should by the way did you ever suspect coronia fraud yes i didn't i i never got a payout that big never i'm sure we'll see this on netflix someday
