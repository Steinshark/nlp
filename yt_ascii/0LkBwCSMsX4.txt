so brady i don't know if you remember but just before christmas you you told me to look at apocalyptic numbers it resulted in me spending a whole day earlier in this week just thinking about the apocalypse my my daughter came over she said what are you doing i was like i'm just just thinking about the end of the world and she's like okay that's normal and then sort of walked off but so this is your fault so okay so this this all stems from a guy called cliff pickover who's a very much a popularizer of of mathematics he seems to have a little bit of obsession in some of his things with the number 666 which you know many of us will know i mean i grew up a catholic and 666 is the number of the beast it's there in the book of revelations and it sort of marks the you know the coming of the antichrist and the end of the world one way to write nero caesar in hebrew 66 six some people say it's actually a misinterpretation it should be 616 i know and actually well we potentially we could change some of these numbers i'm going to talk about for 616 i'm already a step ahead of you on that one ry anyway yeah so so so for those that don't know about i mean there's a number file video on this of course right there's the film the omen as well where you know he shaves daman's head and you see 666 so you don't have to be a catholic or more generally a christian to know about this but 666 is this number that's associated with in some sense the end of the world the apocalypse cliff pickover seems to like him and in particular he likes to think think about numbers that have got some relation to 666 or there's 666 in them and one of these is the apocalyptic powers so what are these well an apocalyptic power is a number of the form 2 to the n okay where n is some positive integer and it will contain somewhere in this number it'll contain the digits six six six so you can imagine writing out this number in full you work out it decimal expansion and then somewhere in that expansion is going to be 666 so 666 isn't in the n it's in the the whole thing the whole thing these are called apocalyptic powers first one that you get two to the 157 yeah so it's a big number it's not crazy big but anyway it's a big number and you can see just there just in the middle of it there's the 666 okay and that makes this an apocalyptic power an apocalyptic power or maybe an apocalyptic number i've also seen it referred to as that but yeah let's call them apocalyptic powers so that's the first one the next one is 2 to the 192 and then you can carry on finding these you know you write your computer program it starts finding them 2 to the 218 to the next one okay now you can carry on trying to look for these guys right and there are loads actually there there really are loads here's a cool one 2 to the 666 that's an apocalyptic power which is reallyy good that one feels significant right yeah another significant one i think is are these two actually 2 to the 2 210 and 2 to the 2 212 now why are these sort of significant they they they're kind of next to each other in some sense they're both apocalyptic poers so they contain the digits 666 they're also apocalypse numbers so what's an apocalypse number an apocalypse number is a number which has 666 digits so these two bad boys they're not only apocalyptic in that they contain 66 there are actually 666 digits in these numbers in both these two okay so they feel significant as well surely there are an infinite number of apocalyptic powers okay can we come back to that okay it's a very good question okay i think the answer is pretty much certainly yes but there's actually a bit of significant math there that we can talk about later but i want to come back to that in a bit another significant one you might talk about is the 666th of these guys to to the 2 454 that's the 666th apocalyptic power and you could go on right there are those and i think probably an infinite number okay so we got all these numbers but what are we going to do with them well this is supposed to be about the apocalypse right okay so am i supposed to infer something about the the apocalypse from this about the the timing of the apocalypse or something like that i don't know right so maybe these are somehow times i should think of these as some multiple of time so is this 2 to the 157 seconds well i don't like using seconds because seconds are a bit man-made and this is supposed to be the apocalypse like that should be independent of whether it's you know humans are involved or not right so so maybe we should use years again i don't like that because years are a bit earthly and i want to think of this on cosmic scale right so you know other years are available on other planets right so so let's let's not do years let's do something fundamental something that's universal across the universe and i think the obvious thing to use is a plank time which is the the shortest time you can think of you try to consider smaller times you would break the fabric of space and time literally time space and time would be overwhelmed by quantum effects by quantum gravity so the smallest time you can think about really is a plank time which is about 5.39 * 10 the- 44 seconds it's very short time shorter times do not exist without breaking space time so this feels fundamental this feels like universally something important in nature so we can ask what is two to the7 plank times how long is that and could that be the time of the apocalypse right okay now two to the 157 plank times is not a very big time it's about if i change the units it's about 9,846 seconds right that's that one but do that in plank time that many plank times is 9,846 seconds how long's that that's it's few hours right okay so i mean what are we doing this are we measuring times since the big bang and the big bang you the apocalypse did not happen a few hours after the big bang it just didn't so forget this one okay this one's not interesting okay so let's go to the next one maybe this one is about 10 million years that's a bit of a jump between a bit of a jump yeah but it's you know there a lot of there's a lot of extra powers here yeah the universe at the end 10 10 10 million years after the big bang no it's about 13.8 billion years old so forget this one okay okay let's do the next one 2 to the 218 plank times is about 7 * 104 years now this one got me kind of curious actually right i'll tell you why because between about 10 to the 14 years and 10 to the 15 years stuff does sort of happen okay so around 10 to 14 years normal star formation will stop in our universe now why why is that it's because basically you know the amount of free hydrogen that you have floating around the universe there's just not enough of it at that point that normal normal star formation would will use that but by about 10 to the 14 years there just won't be enough of it around and so normal star formation will end the only way you can create new stars might be by smashing together some brown dwarfs or something like that this just not going to be many new stars created it's going to become quite a dark universe at this point at around 10 to the 15 years is the point at which planets will start will have all have been kicked out of their star system so you get stellar collisions happen right you know you two star systems collide when that happens you tend to kick the planets out of the out of that system and by about 10 to the 15 years all planets pretty much would have been kicked out of their star systems just roaming on their own through so that that isn't a good good place for life so this might be the time that the last creature dies two to the 218 plank times yeah after the big bang who knows it could be or maybe this has just got nothing to do with any of this that's also possible that's also possible because why would it be the third one that is significant the holy trinity maybe you never know you can you can always do anything with this so what about this guy what what would have that given us two to the 2210 plank times well that's actually a huge time scale that's about 3 * 10 to the 614 years wow huge time you know at some point we're going to enter a phase where everything is just collapsed into black holes and then after about a google years all those black holes will have decayed and we just enter we just have a universe which is just filled with with radiation that was emitted by black holes it's and that's after about google years right and this is way bigger than a google years there's even even at around 10 to 161 years you know the the there's a likelihood that the universe is going to it's its vacuum will collapse right because of the higs the higs becomes unstable and the vacuum of the universe collapses so there's so many bad things that are going to happen before you get into this point that this this just seems too big okay too big all right okay do you like thinking about what the universe would be like when it's like this like what it would look like or sound like or smell like or i love it i love it i love thinking about the far future of the universe and this i mean these time scales are just i mean it's just unimaginable right because you know the universe is 13.8 billion years old and actually when you think about these crazy time scales that are possible that he can even conceive of to think that the universe is only 13.8 billion years old it's nothing the universe is a baby so right so that's a bit of crazy pseudo physics stroke so whatever you want to call it there is a little bit of mass in these though that's that i think is quite interesting as there's a puzzle there's something there's a conjecture which is which is not known if to be true or not but but may be true now at some point you get to this number 2 to the 2 9 7 84 okay now this number is not apocalyptic that's amazing to me because it must have a lot of digits so so this yes does have a lot of digits but 666 is not in there so this is not apocalyptic but this is the last known non aocp power of two every single one above it as far as we know well we don't we haven't we haven't checked them all obviously but you know you can run computer programs try to check a lot of them they're all apocalypse the next one the one with a five at the end apocalyptic the next one apocalyptic so all it seems there's this conjecture that all of the ones beyond this are indeed apocalyptic but it's not proven so it's a bit of a puzzle out there you know is this the last non- aocp power of two don't know it does seem to be likely that at some point that they will you know the the you will just have going to be apocalyptic forever right because there's so many digits because there's so many digits it does seem likely but there's no proof of of this and there's no proof of the fact that this is the this is the last one imagine if it is like that could be like a really holy number yeah yeah it's the last last last moment of purity in the universe and with this time scale i don't i mean don't even go there this is going to be huge right and we start trying to convert it but yeah so well that would be that would be a perfect time for the like the return of the savior yeah do you want me to check what it is in it's going to be something crazy let's do it let's do it let's do it do it wow okay that's right this okay we want this in plank timeses is about 1.3 * 10 to the [music] 8915 years that's a lot of years that's a lot of years that is a lot of years it's a long way that is a long i i don't think there's i think this is way beyond anything significant well there the panker recurrences and all that sort of stuff but but they come much later but this is this is this is way beyond like you know sort of the the sort of heat death of the universe if you like this is this is very far future 666 is a very arbitrary number is there any point to doing this besides fun like does doing this you know create mathematical thinking and new methods or is this purely like just like a game i mean at some level it's a game but but it's it's also you could obviously generalize these questions right you could you you're right you don't have to think about 666 you can say what about you know what what is like these statements like at some point am i definitely going to get you could say what powers of some prime number doesn't have to be two right you could say some what powers of some prime number and and you could consider obviously different number combinations and and ask do they appear in them there a sort of number beyond which they're always going to be there these are mathematical questions you could ask and there could be structure in there whether that structure has application elsewhere i have no idea but who cares right this is math right we do math to try to unpick the sort of the the fabric of of the number systems and try to understand them and then invariably nature comes along and says oh yeah this has got something to do with me by the way and really and so so i never worry about whether it's going to have some application at some point it's just fun to do and yes you could absolutely start generalizing these questions to different types of numbers and but with the same sorts of underlying principles coming back to the puzzle you set us where you said is this the last number where there's no 666 in the expansion surely in an infinite universe where n where our power goes to infinity can be any number will there not be a number where they're all fours or where the where the expansion is all four or like will it like like how pi possibly has every you know combin like is not everything possible is it not possible that eventually there'll be a two to the something that not not only will give us no 666 it will give us no sixes at all so i think i think this depends on on the underlying sort of seed the underlying so for example let's suppose i changed that and i consider the powers of 10 none of them are going to have 666 in them easy very easy i can i can throw it so so so it depends on how you pose it so it's not always as simple as you know if you go big enough then everything can happen it depends how you do it so using two as our seed it seems like that doesn't have a nature whereby we'll get a a freak aberration where they're all fours or yeah yeah yes exactly well it seems to be it seems to be allowing that at some stage you you are going to get these but these 666s but maybe it's you know there's something related to the fact of 666 and how this relates to two in some way that that controls this and and there is i don't think it's a branch of mathematics been as explored as far as i'm aware but but it would be interesting to do it i think well this is what i'm saying this could lead to new mathematics absolutely i think so i think that's fair i think that's fair so actually since you're talking about different numbers that you could look for this brings me on to goliath this conversation continues and there's plenty more to come see links in the usual places for tony talking about the so-called goliath numbers and some other whoppers plus we'll go back to the apocalypse numbers and delve into the world of 600 166 digit long primes and fibonacci numbers tony's written a really great book about really big numbers and their intersections with physics i'll also link to that in the description and here on the screen at the moment well these are some of our patreon supporters i normally list only a limited number of them but today you're seeing 666 of them because well you should know whyi now [music] e
