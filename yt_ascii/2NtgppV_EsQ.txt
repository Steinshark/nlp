guys this is the real voice of elizabeth holmes who had been faking a deep baritone while falling silicon valley to the tune of 10 billion dollars which we're talking about today check it out no it hasn't well if i use traditional words oh the two octave switch baby no it hasn't well if i use traditional words no it hasn't well if i choose it guys that's the level of sociopath we're dealing with in silicon valley and she's not the only one but we're going to learn from her today we're gonna take some big old lessons in a new series i'm calling silicon valley scammers ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today of course we're taking a look at elizabeth holmes you know her you probably have heard of her she's one of the most famous examples of how hey us normal people not in silicon valley we're not the only dum-dums listen there's dumb money everywhere it's a fact of life right it's not just you know people in lower economic circumstances there's dumb money everywhere and it comes from different places some you know a lot of people we talk about the fake gurus they're preying on desperate dumb money but there's also a type of dumb money which is different it's where you have like affluent people in silicon valley and it's i call it greedy dumb money right you can get done many a lot of ways but those are the two primary you have desks for dumb money and greedy dumb money i feel a little less bad for this one but it's still funny and worth checking out but it's important to say listen there's a lot of smart investors in silicon valley but the problem is y'all are a little cocky in silicon valley and sometimes you think hey we're just gonna apply like revolutionize the industry to every industry they think like they got a little cocky because they got us with the computer right they got us with airbnb you know admittingly you have had a few successes so you're getting cocky over there and then you're like hey let's what i don't know what do i have on my desk recognize the thin mint right like ai thin mints how do we revolutionize the mug how do we everything has to be revolutionized so this was taken to blood testing right and there was a young woman named elizabeth holmes who took the silicon valley world by storm when she came out and she said hey i've got the new solution i'm the next steve jobs and you can even see it in the way she dresses listen a lot of these people they worship they have altars to steve jobs in their home and they all dress like him but that's not the point of this video the point is elizabeth holmes comes unseen she's a 19 year old dropout from stanford chemical engineering i think which is yeah i mean you can't trust the chemical engineer as far as you can throw them trust me guys okay and so she comes on and she you know what she did right because i mean this video is more about the psychology of how people got skipped she played into all the prejudices of silicon valley like the crazy backstory of a dropout who's gonna revolutionize the world with her little tech idea or his tech idea that's a total silicon valley thing that they just fawn over right and then the ted talk or like the wannabe ted talk this is ted med silicon valley just like you show a ted talk i mean they they write an empty chat like how much do you want we'll give you whatever you want and and then the cadence oh i love this stuff look at this look at the way she talks i believe the individual is the answer dude like pregnant posits every sentence there's like 12 commas in between every phrase she has i believe [music] the individual comma comma comma is the answer and it's not like that all the way through to the challenges of health care but we can't engage the individual in changing what is this cadence of speech silicon valley you've gone too far you gave this woman a 12 billion or 10 billion dollar valuation how and it's not like they've learned their lesson look you look at nicola right now dude you know they at one point were worth more than ford and they never sold a single car i mean like nothing's changed it's not like oh we found out she's a fraud oh so we don't invest in frauds anymore dude silicon valley so much dumb money going around over there and it's all because you guys keep falling for con people who you know they have vision right they like they're like envisioning the future the problem is it doesn't exist like they go to their engineers and they're like hey can we make i had this great idea like like you know it's like something you'd think about when you're stoned i had this great idea like let's just take a tiny pinprick of blood and do 12 000 tests on it the engineer goes yeah we can't do that and they think to themselves i'm steve jobs so i'll just throw them in a room and just like let them figure it out no yeah whoa and you'll be caught being a fraud years later i mean i really think that this like this con started with the same way a lot of silic real silicon valley seeing start which is like an idea and then you kind of fake it till you make it but in this case what she was talking about wasn't currently possible with any technology so it just was faking it until you're faking it and that's called fraud taking on investors when you're faking your technology is called fraud but make no mistake this happens a lot in silicon valley have access oh to the information they need to do so [music] you could make a whole speech in the posies of her speech there's so much space in here what she does have going forward too is she's got that long vision i mean isn't this a great idea health care where you don't have big pin pricks of and like 12 vials of blood drawn yeah it's a great idea doesn't work all the blood scientists apparently i was reading they were like yeah we knew that this was a fraud but nobody really asked us like silicon valley was just pumping money into this startup no one bothered to ask the scientists like whether this thing was possible and listen if you think don't think i'm serious about like all you need to be a successful fraud in silicon valley it's just like a backstory that silicon valley believes in check out what she named the machine that she was running these tests on right so she takes these like pin pricks of blood right they take this tiny little pin prick and then they ran it in a machine let's see if we can find this it's called the edison guys if you don't stop investing in garbage ideas with clever little names i'm gonna lose my mind i mean honestly dude look do you think the market cap of nicola would have been what it was if it wasn't named nicola like literally that's the only reason that's the only reason you just give silicon valley people a clever name of some guy that they freaking worship they lose their mind it's like hey i'm calling this machine the edison every silicon valley investor i give you all my money what it's the edison does that that must mean it's as innovative as edison ah i'm constantly ragging on this like because it's it's such a problem this is how people get scammed people start saying they throw buzzwords around like ai or you know what honestly when elon musk dies somebody's gonna create a company called musk and then everyone's gonna buy into it or they're gonna call it like elon and everyone's gonna buy into it just because we lionize these people and then someone takes their name and just goes yeah i'm calling my thing that now and everyone throws money at it it's it's bizarre of course they later realized that a lot of these systems weren't actually doing the testing they said they were like they were doing testing the old-fashioned way so they were they were committing fraud throughout but i really do believe it's just a case of you know having a concept never having proof of concept but ultimately the investors not caring they just throw money at you because they like i don't know silicon valley has this disease where they think oh there's no such thing as like real problems with technology i i don't know it just blows my mind how could 10 billion dollars have been thrown at something where nothing existed it's all made up it was all a fraud this is the part that i don't understand like again it's not like we've learned from this the company nicola without selling a truck became worth more than ford the company nikola without selling a truck had a market cap over ford how guys look at that markle cap is worth more than four it's because there's so much dumb money that doesn't ever question is does this thing actually exist i mean this is like gofundme garbage honestly just at a higher level it's it's the same crap that like indiegogo people fall for gofundme falls for where they have a proof of concept that sounds great doesn't exist or sounds great but isn't what they're saying it is it's just given to investors and like that's the amazing thing is you'd think oh these people are so sophisticated whatever but no in fact they can get just as greedy they can get just as blindsided by just clever marketing really that's what it ultimately comes down to and this lady totally took advantage of that she took advantage of the founder narrative that like every every you know revolutionary thinker is going to be a 19 year old which we have to get rid of by the way side note sorry about this can we stop with the idea that 19 year olds are gonna save us please can we stop with the idea that hey hey you know who's gonna save the world 19 year old dropouts no i don't actually think they are does nobody remember what it's like to be 19 like you're an idiot at that point and i myself i include myself in that category i'm still an idiot right i wouldn't trust myself to change the world i would not trust especially some dumb 19 year old right they don't know anything how are we trusting these guys how or girls or anybody like don't we know that people get smarter as they age they learn more they get wiser we don't care about that we think and again it just goes back to like we just have a few examples that have totally changed the perception of what a founder is now because you have your mark zuckerbergs you have your jack dorseys like all these basically young kids coming in creating these tech companies that blow up to be giants now we think that's the norm now we think oh well of course if medicine's gonna get revolutionized it's going to be some 19 year old who fakes her own voice like why i'm telling you guys this this really heats me up if you can't tell and look it's not just dumb silicon valley people it's also just everybody was kind of taken in and it's a good lesson for don't buy the hype if you see somebody surrounded by famous people but you've never kind of heard of them you don't know what they do it doesn't mean you should just blindly trust them and think oh just because they're around you know bill clinton and jack ma they must be legit no actually anyone can be fooled because it's just sort of a ladder of fooling because obviously bill clinton didn't do his due diligence jack martin dude his due diligence they just kind of looked and they go oh this lady like seems to be respected by a lot of important people and those people probably trusted her because they thought she was respected nobody actually took their time to figure out wait is this actually real but yeah he bought into both of these guys buy into the same thing check this out for a factor than i want to call and jackson you founded this company 12 years ago right tell them how old you were i was 19. yeah so don't worry about the future we're in good hands yikes yikes that didn't age well get it buddy didn't age too well at all don't worry about the future guys we've lionized the con man we've given 10 billion dollars to a cod man or con woman excuse me excuse me okay excuse we don't have enough women on the shot we're gonna bring more equality and representation starting with elizabeth holmes to the coffee zilla fraud universe again you see the lionization of like you're young and you're changing the world oh yeah young people young people are the future yeah that's by definition true but are they the future at 19 yeah they're not just wait i got myself twisted up in this analogy my point is they're not the solution at 19 i guess is what i'm saying and you got to be clear when you're investing in anything this is just a great lesson for everybody because if silicon valley people fell for this you could fall for this too the thing is don't buy into the hype just because it's hyped up don't buy into this like future promises just because it sounds like it's the future figure out is the technology there it's either there or it's not it's a like it's a binary instead people looked at the clever marketing they looked at this person who checked all the boxes of like this is the future steve jobs and she even tried to dress like steve jobs instead of looking does the technology exist nobody checked and because of that so many people lost a lot of money they basically just lost their shirts on therados now she's basically facing trial on several charges criminal charges as well as she had a bunch of civil ones as well and she awaits trial so that's where we stand but i think it's an interesting retrospective on one of the all-time great cons in the silica silicon valley universe now there's a lot more and we'll be covering them so let me know what you think but i think this is a good primer because you're going to see a lot of recurring themes silicon valley people they tend to fall for the same stuff over and over again and we're going to talk about it so give it a like subscribe if you like this kind of stuff and i'll see you next time coffee [music]
