so on a darker topic you've expressed serious concern about existential threats of ai it's perhaps one of the greatest challenges our civilization faces but since i would say we're kind of an optimistic descendants of apes perhaps we can find several paths of escaping the harm of ai so if i can give you three options maybe you can comment which do you think is the most promising so one is scaling up efforts on ai safety and beneficial high research in hope of finding an algorithmic or maybe a policy solution two is becoming a multiplanetary species as quickly as possible and three is merging with ai and riding the wave of that increasing intelligence as it continuously improves what do you think is most promising most interesting as a civilization that we should invest in i think this this a lot that respond to investment going on in ai where there's a lack of investment is in ai safety and there should be in my view a cup of agency that oversees anything related to ai to confirm that it is does not represent a public safety risk just as there is a regulatory authority for this like the food and drug administration is that's the for automotive safety there's the fa for aircraft safety which generally comes a conclusion that it is important to have a government referee or a referee that is serving the public interest in ensuring that things are safe when when there's a potential danger to the public i would argue that ai is unequivocally something that has potential to be dangerous to the public and therefore should have a regulatory agency just as other things that are dangerous to the public have a regulatory agency but let me tell you problems with this is that the government moves very slowly and the rate of the rate the usually way a regulatory agency comes into being is that something terrible happens a huge public outcry and years after that there's a regulatory agency were all put in place take something like like seatbelts it was known for on a decade or more that seatbelts would have a massive impact on safety and and save so many lives in serious injuries and the car industry fought the requirements put seatbelts in tooth and nail that's crazy yeah and and honor hundreds of thousands of people probably died because of that and they said people wouldn't buy cars if their seatbelts which is obviously absurd you know or look at the back tobacco industry and how long they fought any good thing about smoking that's part of why i helped make that movie thank you for smoking you can sort of see just how pernicious it can be when you have these companies effectively achieve regulatory capture of government the bad people in the ag community refer to the advent of digital superintelligence as a singularity that that is not to say that it is good or bad but it that it is very difficult to predict what will happen after that point and and then there's some probability it will be bad some probably will be it will be good or if they want you to defect that probability and have it be more good than bad you
