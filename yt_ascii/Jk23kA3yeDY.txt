ladies and gentlemen i hate to be the bearer of bear news but this might be the scariest chart you'll ever see and i'll explain why welcome back to the 10 million dollar studio boys i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking once again about tether if you haven't seen sort of the big summary video of what the whole situation is with them we'll link it below tether is one of the biggest sorry it is the biggest stable coin one of the main ways crypto markets get liquidity and if you're excited about how the crypto markets are just going straight up you might want to see this for a second here now as we know a lot of people have suspected for a long time that tether is not backed by you know really anything people have said it's not backed by us dollars eventually they admitted that was true it's backed by a basket of receivables mostly commercial paper we have come to find out but i want to show you their market cap just to illustrate create something that's what i think is a pretty scary chart if you're heavily invested in crypto and guys again i'm not saying this isn't to make you panic it's not to make you go sell everything it's to educate you some people are going to tell you be bullish at all times you know just be a bull don't ever think about anything like this some people are going to tell you that the sky is falling look i don't really subscribe to either of those i do invest a little bit in crypto i don't talk about what i invest in because i don't want to steer you guys towards my stupid way of thinking but my point is i'm not just some some blind hater but at the same time you guys have to be educated with what your what your risks are and right now not a lot of people are talking about this so this chart is tether's market cap basically because tether's worth a dollar whatever their market cap is is how many tethers are in existence actually it's pretty easy way to track how much they've been printing and people call tether sort of the the central bank of crypto because they seem like they can just print whenever they want now if you guys remember the new york attorney general investigated them and found that tether lied when they said that they were always backed one to one and that from 2017 to like late 2018 like november-ish they were unbacked right and then in 2019 they changed their disclosure to say yeah we're actually not backed one to one we've been lying to you guys pretty much for our entire existence but don't pay attention to that but what i want to try your attention to do guys is okay so this chart that i have in front of me is tether's market cap during the time that the new york attorney general says they were unbacked right the new york attorney general says for sure we know at this point they were lying to people we know that they were not telling the truth okay so look at this chart and i'm gonna slowly take it so this is the end of 2018 beginning 2019 here this is when they change their disclosure what i'm gonna do is i'm going to slide this over and you're going to see how tether has progressed and printed money after being found to have lied to people because the big question is is what are they not telling us what are they telling us so watch this watch this this is tether's activity since the new york attorney general determined they lied this is the state of affairs with crypto guys the people we think who might be falsely inflating the market this is where we knew they were lying to us this is now the state of affairs tether is now worth more than bernie madoff's ponzi scheme at its height tether is now worth 72 billion dollars and they've gone completely mad with how much they're printing and again we know this is not usd backed tethering themselves will tell you that they're backed mostly by commercial paper ask them who who's whose commercial paper do you hold they won't tell you in fact they'll block your foyer request to find out as we talked about in this video over here i mean if you look at just even just the past seven days you can see that the printer rooney is going crazy they're just printing the dollary dues dude look at this they went from what like 70 billion market cap to a 72.5 that's 2.5 billion dollars in seven days ladies and gentlemen let's give it up for them dude crypto's becoming what they sought to fight with fiat like fiat everybody thought oh that's clearly you know a scam the way they're printing money over there inflation's gonna kill us all and then you go over to crypto you think you've diversified tether tether's printing tether the central bank is sprinting and almost as fast as jay powell quite wild quite insane and if you're watching the markets you're just concerned about hedging your risk just bear in mind this no pun intended when thinking about your crypto investments it's fine to be bullish on the technology of crypto i also am too but you have to be smart about it guys you have to know that there are a lot of grifters a lot of scammers in this game and this stuff is linked to all sorts of things like bitcoin ethereum price like i don't know so whatever happens when it all comes crashing down i'm i'm pretty well convinced that something bad is going to eventually happen with heather when it does what exactly happens is anyone's guess i don't think the market's gonna go to zero i've never said that but i do worry that people may underestimate what this is actually going to do so guys just keep that in mind when you are out there trying to trying to invest in the market but anyway guys that's just what i wanted to show you we knew they were lying here this is what's happened since do with that what you will thanks for watching i'll see you in the next one okay [music] but things will be different if i was falling
