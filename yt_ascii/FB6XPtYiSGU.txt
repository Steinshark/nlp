on july 28 2023 tsmc held a ceremony to inaugurate its newest r d center out in chinchu taiwan the whole thing made the news here in taiwan so i thought that i should do a short video about it tsmc's newest fab tsmc calls the new building the global r d center and is their version of bell labs it will be where the company experiments with the various processes and operations for its coming leading edge nodes n2 n 1.4 and so on once the r d fab masters the recipe they rolled out to one of the big wafer fab centers in taizong or tainan n2's big rollout will be in shinchu and taichong i think n 1.4 is planned for long tan tower yen they're calling this building the global r d center i mean that is what's on the sign but semiconductor factories are built over phases so i've seen this building also be referred to as fab 12 phase 8. fab 12 being the previous r d fab tsmc's current plan is to add seven more factories around the r d center all of them leading edge the first will be the upcoming n2 fab fab 20. i actually visited the construction site in july 2023 right now it's just a steel shell but it is scheduled to go high volume sometime in 2025. tsmc will continue building out the r d fab it doesn't look like everyone has moved in yet and crews have not yet finished the work of moving in all the equipment the new manufacturing zone will cover the area of bausan bausan is a hilly suburb adjacent to the main shinchu area is a township covering 10 villages the land used to host the century-old haka village dachi village formerly home to about 2 000 residents and a temple tsmc started acquiring the land in 2019 this acquisition required the company to relocate all the villagers the temple and a local cemetery many of the villagers protested demanding a higher price for their land and it took some time to get that all sorted out they did not break ground on the fab until 2020 but it would not open until three years later due to pandemic delays and the difficulty of the construction as you can see the design is very striking it is reminiscent of the design of their big nanjing gigafab and also kind of like a spaceship the bausan land is very hilly in order to make the land suitable for a fab tsmc basically leveled the mountains and hills near the construction sites you can see huge piles of dirt from that work right now the infrastructure and the roads are still being built out they'll need to expand the roads to prevent big traffic issues but people are already starting to make their area their home i can see expensive looking houses on the distant hills morris town tsmc's legendary 92 year old founder and long time chairman showed up to the commencement event according to taiwanese media it was the first company affiliated event he has attended since his retirement in 2018. though i have heard that he still sometimes goes into the company offices side note i heard that morris dung recently announced at his birthday party that he had completed the second volume of his autobiography i'm looking forward to reading it anyway has he started his speech some women standing on the balcony cried out grandpa i love you i thought that was cute morris is really loved here in taiwan tang's speech hit on a few key points first he thanked the tsmc r d team for their contributions to the semiconductor industry he also noted that their contributions have put tsmc into the thoughts of many military planners he then dryly mused aloud whether that part actually deserved a thanks second he emphasized that tsmc continued to internally and independently produce its own techniques and technologies zhang recalled that back in the early days phillips tsmc's big co-investor asked tsmc to adopt their cmos technologies tsmc licensed those for five to ten years as a patent umbrella but insisted on developing their own it took 30 years for tsmc to turn that technological independence into technological leadership marked by their seven nanometer node his remarks on this also reminded me of the early 2000s when a legendary six-man r d team at tsmc worked to produce the company's own variant of copper interconnect technology this eventually allowed tsmc to be the first in the industry to ship a working 130 nanometer process node third zhang emphasized that r d and manufacturing needed to work closely together it is not enough that a team produces innovations scale is what matters which company will be the first to bring their innovations to high volume production and finally he cautioned the company to never slack in in its efforts he told a story from his texas instruments days about how the british navy was once seen throughout the 19th century as the world's most powerful then in the 20th century the navy inaugurated a massive new building the admiralty extension little did they know it but the building marked the navy's historical high point so with this in mind tang said don't be like the british navy starting to decline once they got a big building in 2022 tsmc spent about 5.5 billion dollars in r d investment this represents a little over seven percent of the company's 2022 revenues it sounds like a lot but it greatly lags the r d spend of the big tech companies in america like alphabet which spent 34 billion dollars or apple 23.5 billion or amazon a staggering 46.5 billion and just in case you are curious in 2022 intel spent about 17.5 billion for r d compared to those guys tsmc doesn't spend all that much but they do seem to be quite productive with that smaller spend statista finds that in 2022 tsmc received 3024 u.s patents third most after samsung and ibm intel had about 2 418 patents it makes me wonder a few things like whether r d spend as reported by these big american tech companies is comparable to the r d spend reported by tsmc it's probably not i wonder maybe because of tax incentives i wonder how much of tsmc's technological advantages are rooted in taiwan's lower costs of living and just paying those r d workers less it's what everyone in the west and youtube thinks about first but personally i think that though that factor is significant it is probably not overwhelming instead there seems to be other things that work here like automation scale fast cycle time or accumulated unspoken knowledge and finally i wonder just how resilient tsmc's independent approach can remain in the face of the intense economic technological and geopolitical competitions that lie ahead in the semiconductor industry's future that question remains open all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching short video tonight subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
