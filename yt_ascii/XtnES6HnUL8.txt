today i thought we'd go over cpm the very first operating system for micro computers quite a significant thing history wise but why don't we use it today is it a bit like dos it is it is a lot like dos i would use the analogy of its beat of x whereas dots is vhs for our younger viewers vhs and betamax are types of videotape sometimes not necessarily the best thing technically wins out yes yeah i mean the market forces ended up choosing the cheaper option that's that's often how things work you can't talk about cpm without talking about gary kildel he's the guy that votes cpm by all accounts he's one of the nicest most genuine federally helpful guys in the computing world ever isn't necessarily the best businessman though he studied to be a maths teacher and he was a math teacher but it near near enough to silicon valley that he got hold of one of the until 4004 micro processors when they first come out is oh this this is great for maths we could do things on it obviously a four bit processor is relatively limited but once he was able to get hold of the 8w08 he messed about with it done some things and said oh we could have a programming language for this intel said well no this is just going to go in you know control things like washing machines and stuff like that why would you want a programming language for it he developed plm programming language for microcomputers on the 8008 he thought well if i could write a programming language for it i could use that language and write an operating system which is which is where cpm came from the significant thing there really is that for micro computers there was no operating system this was back in the wild west days where if you if you built your own computer you ran your own software that was very much your only machine you couldn't just swap files with someone else i want to run my code on your machine or whatever yeah it wasn't like today you rare hey i've got a linux machine i could copy these files here's some jpegs you can have a look at now you've got none of that every every machine was completely unique what gary managed to do with cpm was to standardize on the whole operating system except for the very very hardware specific bios stuff kind of beyond polti stuff it's not just a case of rewriting the software to work on this machine or that machine it's a case of this some software written for cpm will run on any machine that runs cpm the the only thing that's got to be unique is the the bios the the basic input output system so effectively cpm is made up of three three separate layers you got the bios which talks direct to the hardware that's the thing that actually interfaces directly to the chips to the video controller to the disk controller or whatever you they've got the bdos which is the basic disk operating system that talks to the bios and that that allows it to read the right to the disks and do do whatever it needs to do then you've got the the ccp the command control processor so that that takes the instructions that you put into it that talks to the bdos the bdos then interfaces with the hardware and once one your program does whatever it needs to do but apart apart from the bios everything else is standard so it will run on on any any machine that runs cpm which in its heyday there's up to about 3000 different types of machine ran cpm the first thing to say with regard to dos is cpm came out before dos that was already well established that was the market leader when ibm decided to join in the game and they they wanted to build out their own microcomputer they approached microsoft and bill gates obviously he's got microsoft basics so he said yes we could supply that he also said yes they can supply the the the operating system as well which microsoft at the time didn't have ibm also approached digital research i.e gary kildel now this is the stuff of legend you will quite often hear the phrase that gary kildore is the guy that was offline when ibm came knocking there's a few different versions of the story i don't think anyone knows 100 exactly what happened there but effectively what it sounds like you know going from a few different sources he was a qualified pilot he used to fly off to his customers delivering software and stuff like that he was actually out flying that day and his wife answered the phone and ibm said oh yeah we'd we'd like you to sign this non-disclosure agreement we need to talk to you about this that the other and she said well no you need to talk to gary he's out flying can you come back another day so in the meantime yes they talk to microsoft microsoft say yeah we can we can supply this for you so it was looking like digital research was going to lose the chance to quote for supplying their operating system what what microsoft then had to do was find an operating system because they didn't have one and there was this this guy that kind of got something up and running that that looked that looked good enough so microsoft made him an offer he had bought bought his his operating system for fifty thousand dollars because microsoft hadn't told you they was reselling it to ibm so they then got in touch with ibm said yeah here we go we've got this operating system so ibm yeah great we'll call that pc dos because we're making a pc this is gonna be pc dos when digital research looked at it they said well thank god there might be some copyrighted features there it looks like you've copied what we have already had on the market for years there were those threats of lawsuit and stuff like that in the end ibm turned around and said well we don't really want to last so it could get all messy what about we offer both options so digital research was okay yeah we could live without yeah we you know going up in a fair fight we know we've got a better product so yes yeah yeah we were more than happy to drop the lawsuits and you can supply both operators or the option of both operating systems the only thing that ibm hadn't told digital research is that they was effectively giving away microsoft ms-dos i think those charges something like 40 or if you wanted cpm you could pay 250 but it was down to the public to decide so yeah the public could go with whatever option they wanted yeah does the public want to pay an extra 200 odd dollars well the fact that we've yeah most machines nowadays are windows-based kind of kind of answers that these effectively are your minimal cpm applications although there's a video recently which mentioned the ed word processor or the ed word processor i should i should say yes it's it's definitely the ed processor so that's that runs under cpm so if you're familiar with you using your word processors one line at a time that's that's a fantastic option to use it was probably about the best that there was back in the day i've tried it i could follow instructions but it's not not the easiest thing to use it really isn't what i'm actually using is a compact flash as the disk storage so cpm could recognize up to 16 individual discs so the compact flash has been segregated into 16 different partitions in there so hence we can see drive abc etc we've got a pageable rom we've got the cpu 64k of ram clock module serial input output and then i'm generating the video through a little raspberry pi that's just pumping out hdmi for me whether dos was a copy of cpm was actually decided in the courts in 2002 i believe when it was found that yes there is there is some code that's taken directly from the source code of cpm the guy that done that he he was very clever he changed a few bits so instead of having a routine called right disc you know he'd have a routine called disc right and one or two others little tiny tiny changes there but they at the time claimed that was different but yeah in the lot in the courts in 2002 that was all settled and yeah it was proven that cpm was was the original so effectively today any computer that runs dos is running cp and there's still some some of that code in there gary kildore wasn't too pleased about the fact that he'd been taken to the cleaners effectively he was i think i think it's fair to say he was quite bitter about this for for the rest of his life which unfortunately wasn't all that much longer after various incidents his marriage broke up he became a drinker and ended up dying in 1992 i believe is this the sort of keyboard that people are going to get all excited about possibly they will it is an original cherry keyboard from the the late 80s mid to late 80s cherry keyboard f or something like that there was an append command that simply said add some more text and you could add a bunch of lines
