building a youtube channel 14 million subscribers not easy takes hard work intelligence and most importantly a little help here catch a lot of help sometimes the help needs help which is why a youtuber namely this one needs 80 people on staff 80. build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc completely on your own so head to build redox dot com linus and start your new build today [music] everyone had ample warning that we were doing this today so you're gonna see two things why a youtuber could possibly need nearly 100 people on staff and some oscar-worthy performances in the category of looking busy while my boss is standing over me watching why don't we start with james boss wow you're doing a great job entering that pin you almost found the number pad james what would you say you do here enable the other writers to do their best wow and that after all the rehearsal you obviously did do you see how concise that is good that was good it's good writing in all seriousness though i'm gonna need you to explain what you do because i can't even remember it anymore i know you manage the writing team which is like a dozen people now i help unblock them i review some scripts because remember it's not just ltt it's also mac address and channel super fun i make sure that their shoots happen on time and when they do i get ice cream sandwiches for everyone and when they don't ah man is everyone else here are you on probation still no no you're not what do you mean you're like six months but yes this is november you've been here that long yeah like ten months okay what would you say you do adam i'm a writer and i make videos wow that's fantastic a computer anyway this one's coming along great you just wait he's actually the one organizing this very video so he had to leap over here in his ltt shorts nice by the way love him and pretend to write where the hell is everybody we've got a probationary employee alex isn't at his desk anthony's not at his desk jake's not even here we're gonna have to find some of these guys at some point but in total we have eight writers for ltt 12 writers total and we do a total of how many videos a week like 15. 15. i don't think that's right we do six ltts one win show that's seven two tech quickies that's nine three short circuits that's 12 a mac address theoretically a channel super fun theoretically and don't forget about tech link that's another three a week don't forget about their just moving and dad the they're just movies podcast ploof what do you focus on i write things oh my god but what display stuff and other things that we cover i do all the random stuff would you believe he hosts too oh yeah yeah he's really good yeah do the sc that's fun you're writing about a water block right now yeah i was gonna do other things on screen for a jet for a joke but yeah maybe something you actually did because i wrote most of that keep up the good work you're going to walk right past me okay where are we going now this is completely off the rails at this point go talk to worst or something fine let's go find some flow no where's the flow what are you doing okay we've got our channel managers for mac address as well as channel super fun dennis used to be an editor but now he's like why are you boring so close to me okay i can't hold it it's like being put on the spot yeah that's closer than i was holding it i'll hold it okay why are you moving away why are you just yeah so you do mac address i do mac address hello yeah i can do it i am prefer i like to think of myself as someone who tries to show everyone here why apple does the things they do right now i haven't actually watched it yet but i love the title of the most recent video i am going to watch it soon am i becoming a hater do you think that being around all of us has made you see apple in a different light i've always been a hater i've always been cynical all right that's fair enough now dennis okay you used to be an editor here and now what on earth do you do i go and mostly i spend my time i still have a lot of time at your house and watching you naked three times total i wouldn't describe it as super fun but is it at least a little fun it's not it's not fun it's not fun so arthur what do you do here i make memes i mean that is an actual position that we actually have but in all seriousness these guys have been absolutely crushing it we've got floatplane exclusives that have been just off the freaking rails awesome lately whether it's cutting room floor or original content these guys have been doing a great job of i mean yeah making memes yeah i guess that really is like a big part of it among us if you want to learn more about some of the people that we have here you can check out the meet the team series over where are you going i'm going downstairs if you want to learn more about some of the people here the meet the team series over on float plane is awesome they're exclusive kind of behind the scenes content that arthur and his helper put together where am i supposed to go next to me up in the labs i'm informed that i'm supposed to talk to the business team next we'll start with the one and only colton potter who surprisingly has not actually been fired yet yeah i'm i'm head of business development i do business with this why are you holding it like that hey i'mma let you finish but just i do business stuff marketing sales events we're doing an event right now yeah lan party it's gonna be awesome by the time you see this it'll be over so don't try and sign up yeah cool that's it that's it well you said you were gonna ask me something yeah i don't ask this on cam now for the rest of the business team where the hell is everyone vacation helping blurred okay well fine go all right hey sean sales supervisor here oversee our accounts team essentially we work with all of our different partners from like the intel's amd's the samsungs now how many customers would you say that each of our sales people works with oh i'd say at any given time probably 30 to 40. wow we're not going to get there we're not going to get any applications anymore ever because that's a lot of clients to have to work with the business team also handles procurement but neither of those guys appear to be here either oh they moved we used to manage the relationship with all the brands ourselves but now we have matt and his helper who is on probation and what is it that you would say you do i would say that we talk to all the brands ahead of time so that we know what's coming out next when it's coming out whether or not he can get his hands on it and whether or not it's drop proof that's always pretty oh my god enough thanks matt over here we've got the accounting department some of which is still on probation it used to be just my wife and now it's my wife is gone okay she's gone and jake's gone what is going on here oh this is this office is probably full of confidential stuff blur everything also in this office is other yvonne and then another probationary employee wow other yvonne has some really cool lego flowers are these cool or what they're right once we've procured the stuff yeah where does it go it goes to your mama no okay logistics logistics let's go welcome to the hold this is the logistics department where serge jamie nicholas dan alex dick all do their oh my god it is a mess in here dan give dan the mic are you kidding me right now no why these guys do everything from inventorying and stickering things that come in to rearranging sets to right now building up the computers for our whale ticket holders at the whale land that's right how does it feel to be working on something so pointless given that four out of the five whale ticket holders told us they already have better computers anyway that's a good use of my time better than sweeping up you know hq too in this heat yeah yeah that's fair is that where everyone else is yeah oh you should show the other cool thing you did recently with the mock-up with the thing with the panels oh yeah sure here is your mock-up check this out that's the theater room at my house and those are the exact dimensions of our ltt acoustic panel frames that we're working on so we are going to absolutely deck this room out with them how many did you say i would need of the of the little modular connectors so yeah it looks like we need 1700. cool yeah all right let me tell you something i know about surge all right fire away when something needs to be picked up at my house serge is the guy so oh is that the only thing i do around here no but darn it you are so fast at it well if you're wondering what else i do i also handle your intro trust border stuff that comes across so camino server you name it like the emc thing testing chamber i was dealing with that as well little import things yeah i also deal with customers in brokerage and read all the trade laws so you don't have to that's actually pretty critical nicholas i would say is our specialist when it comes to cooling component repair stuff like that like super geeky stuff 3d printing that kind of thing alex d is the manager of the team here so he coordinates i mean really the higher level things that logistics does so kitting out a new building for example is going to fall on mostly alex and dan and then the rest of them are going to make sure that it actually happens and then they do a lot of the making sure it actually happens we have five people in logistics now i mean if you look around though there is a lot to keep organized so here's incoming items to be inventoried here's things to be returned to inventory i brought this back from my house by the way so that yeah that was me i just dropped it there this morning picking up after me is a lot of work and not everything they do is logistic stuff the set design and actually the production setup over here particularly the audio was handled by the logistics department everything from design to fabrication to building out the set to actually running all of these cables and making sure that the wan show and and they're just movies podcast sound and look awesome where is everybody i know i know you're there but like andy's not here and david's not here i'm kidding david i'm kidding i'm kidding brandon i think many of our viewers probably aren't familiar with you so i've never i haven't worked here for very long yeah not very definitely fresh meat what do i do here yeah well if it has anything to do with lighting or pointing a camera at something and it's on one of our channels i'm one of the shooters so one of the people who is doing exactly what's happening to me right now very good in all seriousness though a massive shout out to those of you who actually notice and care about what these guys do i actually forwarded you guys some comments and some emails that i got recently where people are just like yeah you know i don't really notice the production values on ltt until i go to other channels honestly speaking i'd say that is the highest praise that you can give to a team like this where they just make it look kind of effortless really yeah i promise you it's not effortless very it's very high stuff is like actually heavy that's something all of our camera guys have in common is like they're not stick things they actually have to like move stuff a lot andy here is our sort of supervisor for the camera department so what do you do that's different from just operating a camera merge photo and i sometimes like help writing feedback for new shooters i do a little bit like chinese thing procurement oh that's right yeah andy's our guy if there's some like super weird thing we need from china this guy has connections yeah yeah it's kind of weird actually naturally once we shoot the videos somebody's got to edit them let's see if my production manager is here ah yes one of the original gangsters enzo yago does this actually work like is that yeah advantage is our editing team which is now a total of holy crap you have like 15 people did you count yourself well 13. did you count the camera guys 15 15. who said 15. me okay yeah you're right are you going to tell them what you do or do you want me to tell them what you do ed's camera shy you should see his first video that he hosted way back in the day we tried him out as an on camera host and he was he was so sweaty i had to run back and forth between the camera and prompter what do i do here that's really good question really good question i am going to pack my things because i knew this was gonna come ed does scheduling he also does hiring for the editing department and lately he's actually been doing a ton of r d including coordinating with youtube as well as adobe on hdr content name deleted here is finally a dedicated thumbnail artist we should have had one freaking ages ago there are youtube channels literally a tenth our size that have a dedicated thumbnail artist she also does a ton of the merch photos now including both the photography and the photoshopping of them the delightful one with the dog pulling down my pants that was her work and then we've also got scott what a dick that's got sorry what would you say you do here i document line this drop tips everything you drop i gotta show the puppy thank you that was bound to happen all right we've also got emily who is an editor plus plus yes i help out a little bit yeah when ed and nicole are not here then i make sure that these guys do their job good job emily and she even knows that she does it which is excellent also in here we've got the one and only the meme kingiest alex putnam hi you're gonna give me nothing no when he edits this video he's gonna make it so that his segment is like the bombest segment out of the whole video and he's gonna do it purely in editing that's really his superpower oh wow the whole microphone was a lie this is just a rode wireless go-to oh yeah what's up you're relatively new i forget your name i'm sorry andrew see you don't have a name like scott where i can just be like that's scott what a deck yeah well i'm happy about that yeah it worked out great yeah yeah yeah what do i do i edit and i shoot some stuff as well all right fantastic we have a lot to shoot and a lot to edit robert hello i'm robert i'm one of the editors you know you're robert you're standing in the editing deck you know you're an editor come on man help me out here basically my job is i make him look good that's a tough job hi nicole hi hi everybody knew i was coming come on people i help schedule videos i help ed with a lot of other things as well i assign people to videos and i heard that alex is now assigned to this video oh hi mark hi how are you i mean i did not hit her that was that's that's the line okay mark's one of our editors resident hoarder resident mac user why is this still here do you know how many times i've tried to give this thing away this weird nzxt helmet i took it it was great i can see that but you know the problem that you have is not going to get any better by taking more random crap it's not data what oh no you've seen oh you're talking about my cause yeah i'm talking about your other hoarding yeah yeah i have okay yeah fair enough throw it away but it's at work it's not supposed to be at work i'll throw it away thank you hi marcus what are you working on i'm working on tech quickie so i just stare at whoever is hosting eight hours a day okay cool james knows he has a little something right in the crotch area there right yeah i should i should crop it out there thanks that's a lot better yeah that's everyone down here yep that's good probably yeah except your coc i think we all know what david does david operates the camera and also is on the there this movie's podcast and also contributes to some of our retro gaming content because he's turned into something of an enthusiast lately this is the thing this whole work from home trend you want to make a video you want to take a group picture or something everybody's freaking at home man i was talking to another youtuber who was commiserating with me about like business overhead and they gave me the number for their monthly payroll and they were like yeah man it's like and i was like let me tell you we have customer care agents like adam and nolan who take care of all of the incoming tickets for our merch sales we've got everything from pillows to t-shirts to to plushies to the upcoming backpack we did a video recently showing off a lot of the stuff that's coming down the line at that time this is unfortunate at least some of these guys were in office but today i don't see bridget i don't see matthew i don't see a llama day but the engineering department is here you're not live right no no we're not live act like we are though no so be nice am i not nice no no otherwise why would i say that that hurts kyle's the engineering manager here he's been tasked with a multitude of projects most importantly our ltt screwdriver but he's also worked on like a battery bank like rgb accessory of some sort he helps the other guys out when they run into roadblocks and has actually helped us out a lot when it comes to just general procurement best practices because he actually has experience in it unlike us i also did some of the initial hiring for the labs and kicking that off the ground before gary came along and he has great taste in cars honestly it was so validating for me when our first like actual engineering hire came on staff and drove the exact same car of me i was like now that is a practical car sup tynan oh hi how it goes is there anything you can actually talk about or is everything top secret i mean i guess i kind of i mean almost everything so yeah no i don't have anything new tynan is our resident physical you know therapy guru you can you can see that he's the king when it comes to balance boards and that's not all of the things that's two of the many things look how many things there are i actually designed this thing and own a patent on it really really really so this is a patented balance board and i won't die if i try to use it i would not say that hold on no no no i'm good i'm good i got this i got this all right jacob what's up hello how's it going this is exciting jacob can we show the power bar holder i gave all of my prototypes are you freaking kidding me he's filming a video it is coming spoiler how about the power brick one wait no i showed that one in the last one the power bar one you don't have a single power bar holder how about an early prototype show me a crappy power bar holder so what does he do here i'm doing product design with these guys i'm working on some stuff that involves magnetism and also high volume production so i'll work on quality control and like validating suppliers and things like that yeah so i went ahead and ran off with every single common power bar i could find and ordered more online and stuff the goal here was i wanted to have something that interfaces with as many of these keyhole slots as we could and then make it as i suppose easy to use as possible and not finicky this is an older prototype so it's a little finicky ease see just put it on there and once that's on there if you have a metal strip on the bottom of your desk or a metal surface but on there goes your power bar and most of them are going to have two of them on them obviously so it'll totally hold it in place and this is also much weaker compared to the final one we have final ones that are so strong due to magnetic simulation stuff that you can actually unplug things without it pulling off the the power bar you can see even this one the early one holds as long as it's right above the magnet lloyd designs delightful t-shirts like this one got some new plushies coming all that kind of good stuff i have no idea what these are but they're cute sarah does more graphic design as well as product design for things like our notebooks which you can find on lt oh wait this isn't ours our notebooks that we saw on lttstore.com as well as our toques or beanies and in here we've got the business folks from creator warehouse so bridgette and kyle manage their respective departments and then nick is in charge of the whole shebang he used to be our business development manager for ltt but then moved on to bigger and better things to be replaced temporarily by colton until we find a suitable you know long-term fit for the job then this is natalie she works on just like logistics basically but not like what our logistics department does like like the logistics of like containers of things coming in crap serge you were saying you like drive things i do okay can you drive us yeah we need to go to lab too sure okay after a short ride we've arrived at lab two i mean most of you only see the videos but if it wasn't for the large team that we have behind the scenes there would be no way for me to lose money on a scale like this more space marketing new marketing guy what does the marketing guy do we've hired a lot of people lately everyone we've blurred or covered up started in the last three months it's been insane the marketing guy does marketing for floatplane lmg's channels ltx and that's it ltt store you probably haven't noticed it yet because you just started and also like colton's been guiding him so can we expect so much yeah he's got to be a self self starter you know what i know what i'm saying sup jake okay hi hi this is the jake show hello what's going on okay are you taking us way over to the probationary employee again probation come on come on you can't do making extra work for the owner so linus what what do you do here well i roll in anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes late i get dragged around by james to wherever it is that i'm supposed to be or jake jake's actually been doing more of like a supervisory role for the writing department james was on pat lee for a bit of that guy jake had jake had to cover for him i look pretty [music] for the camera is that a dennis liao exclusive yeah thank you this has been this has been wonderful the cooling alone for this 150 attendee lan party is apparently costing thirteen thousand dollars chase get over here and explain you can't point there did colton approve this thirteen thousand dollars for cooling yeah but you also approved a lan party in the summer so oh so it's my fault chase is our events coordinator he does like lounge night he does this he does kind of large weird sponsored shoots like that pc or no pc thing yeah he was hired to run ltx and then boom pandemic lol jokes thanks for that great job on ltx we found them folks alex d manager of the logistics department who takes my dreams and makes them close to reality yes sometimes they don't turn out the right color the walls in there are supposed to be gray can you explain the dusty brown i don't like a jamie put it the right way it's like a a beverage holder well anyway this was coordinated at the last minute so this was a collaborative effort between logistics and event planning this is the thirteen thousand dollar air conditioner that because it was so last minute we couldn't just buy our own air conditioner and put it up on the roof we're just blowing away money see you later money so that's pretty cool good work yeah well i mean if you want to put ac on there it's at least 150 000. are you serious yeah that's the lowest quote i got you know we're doing that though right oh yeah i know it won't happen until next year though unfortunately holy yeah oh yeah flow plane where the hell's floatplane i know two of our floatplane people are attending the land but
