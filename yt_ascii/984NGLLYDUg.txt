- can 20,000 magnets catch a car mid air? how many lemons does
it take to start a car? hiding expensive items in
the world's largest haystack. climbing a wall with plungers. but we never really uploaded them. this video is going to be
a scrapped video review. so today we're gonna react to these videos because videos have rights too. the first video we scrapped is "can 20,000 magnets
catch a car mid air?" we have a car over
there, a ramp and a ramp. - did it work?
- he never got airborne. and as you could see, the
car never got off the ground. so then we went to a junkyard
and tried to get a really ginormous magnet from the
junkyard and recreate this. - we put the weight on the gas pedal, release the parking brake and
it's gonna go flying forward. - yeah, and then it's gonna go flying into the ramp and we're gonna
see if the magnet catches it. and yeah, that's why
that video was scrapped. the next video we scrapped last year was when we tried to climb
a wall with plungers. no joke, i thought that was a good idea. i'm gonna climb this
wall using only plungers. - all right, go. - here's your piece of boobies. - is this a bra? and the plungers weren't working well, so we moved on to other things. we're gonna see if you can
climb a wall using bras. - give 'em a squeeze for good luck. they feel real?
- yeah. - all right. - ah. - darn, i thought for
sure that would work. - ah! - i swear on paper, it made sense. this next video took a
crazy amount of time. we tried to power a car with lemons. such a shame that we
never got to upload it 'cause we put so much time
and effort into this video. when we started filming the video, it was potatoes but halfway
through, we switched to lemons because there wasn't enough
potatoes in our city, so yeah. as you can see, after the intro, we started using lemons and yeah, we literally bought
every lemon in our city. - literally there was a lady at the store and i'm going to get all the lemons and she was like "can i have
some before you buy 'em all?" and i was like "oh, sure." - no, that's why we didn't have enough. you heard it here, folks,
chandler kills videos. - this literally took-
- so long. - so long.
- i know. it's so annoying that we never
uploaded it, look at that. we had no idea what we were doing. we were just putting
zinc and copper and then connecting them and doing
closed and open circuit things. i don't know, we were
following the internet. and so now they're making sure they're all done right 'cause
just one little mess up would make this whole thing not work. that is true, that was very stressful. if just one half lemon out
of the thousands of them, like the little thing just
slipped off the zinc or copper, it would not work. look at all those lemons and the most we could power with it was
a carbon monoxide alarm. up next, we have "world's
largest haystack." essentially what we did is we made the world's largest haystack
and then i spent $10,000 on items and i hid it in the
haystack and i let the guys have a competition to see who could
find stuff in it the first. like macs and switches and
phones and things like that. all right guys, remove the bed sheet, go. - woo.
- so i hid the playstation 4. gets to keep it. and whoever found it in the world's largest
haystack got to keep it. - doesn't like doing it. - hey! - what?
- you guys took an l. - no. - next we're doing a brand new iphone x. - i was so mad because i could never find anything.
- i just threw it up there. sorry, boys.
- of course. - wait, you didn't win?
- back then, i was losing challenges. - did you not win a single thing? - i did but it took forever. - hey.
- yes! yes! - chandler won something. - i got it.
- no. we're touching it at the same time. - here you go, chandler.
- thank you. - each of these plastic bags have $100. one is a $500 designer belt. next, we're doing another one of these. all right guys, here's the keys. that's the car right there. - it's a beauty.
- yeah, yeah. it's only slightly a piece of trash. i hid keys and let whoever found them keep the car and chris got it. the first thing he did was
ram it into the haystack. - and do donuts.
- what the heck? - how did chris win?
- that looks pretty cool. - it was fun. - and that was the video where we made a huge haystack and put
lots of prizes in it. you enjoyed that video?
- i did. - i didn't. next is "dino cars." we tried to invade a city riding mini cars dressed as dinosaurs
and i'll let you see it. - yeah, the biggest problem was we bought like 20 mini cars and only
like eight of 'em worked. - look at that, we were gonna invade the
city dressed as dinosaurs. - and then we gave up on the dinosaurs and then we gave up on the cars and then went back to dinosaurs. - so our first stop was we
invaded a hotel with mini cars. what is wrong with us? - full rev.
- look at this guy. - dude's just like on the car. - and then the hotel kicked us out. so then we just started driving down the street with mini cars. there's a bunch of dinosaurs. - we got kicked out pretty much
everywhere except the mall. - and then we gave up and started marching around the city with dinosaurs. next video is when we
did coin flips for money. i think the concept was i flip it. if you won, you get
300 and then you can do double or nothing all
the way up to 10 grand. - it's what spawned the
"guess the right cup" video. - yes. - oh, she got it right.
- oh. - all right.
- you did awesome. thank you. - and then we got tired
of flipping a coin. so we start rolling a die
and if they guessed it right, they won money. then she won money.
- oh. - she won money. - that guy looks like idubbbz, oh my god. - he does, wait, wait.
- whoa, that's idubbbz. - little did we know, idubbbz appeared in a video and it didn't
even get uploaded. - i can't believe this.
- oh boy. - this video is the worst
video we've ever done. - so the idea for the
thumbnail was that i fill, actually i don't even want
to give you the clickbait 'cause it's really good clickbait and i might try to do it one day. - cram 'em in a box and
just expect them to be okay. oh right here, take this right. - oh, right?
- ah, no, the goldfish. look at this acting. dude, we have next level acting. you took that way too hard,
the goldfish are probably hurt. - let's see. - oh no, the goldfish. - so we're back at the warehouse. we gotta get these goldfish
out of these tanks. they're running out of water, so we built- we built a giant tank for the fish and we built a literal
zoo in our warehouse. - and we did it on a saturday. - building a zoo for- - heads up, chandler.
- make-believe animals. - my goodness, dude, it
looks better than i thought. - oh my goodness.
- wow. - it's so beautiful.
- wow. - so now we've got
scooby snacks and bears. - yeah. - because they like to hang
out in clumps together. so here's a list of all the
animals we have in our zoo. - yeah, this is our little directory. - we've got some information about 'em. we got some pikachus over there. - so how many calories is a pikachu? - 80.
- a pikachu is 80 calories? - these were bones of dogs.
- really? - and they feed them to children. - all right, so here
we got some alligators. little did we know, alligators
and monkeys are like tight. they're like white on rice.
- bffs. - you're free. - what is this video?
- go do what you want. - we have a lamborghini,
a mini lamborghini, a ferrari, a bugatti and a porsche. guys, the race is three laps. this is the finish line. first place gets $100,000. it'll probably be me. - nope.
- ha ha. - yeah right.
- you think. - second place gets $10,000, which will be one of you four. everyone else gets a high five. - here, i'll go ahead and
give you your high five, chandler 'cause that's
all you're gonna get. - all right guys, this is for 100 grand, although i'll probably win it. so technically 10 grand between you four. go. - what the heck? - that's not fair, i wasn't ready. - good thing you got
three laps, go chandler. so i'm not gonna lie, i've never driven this lamborghini before. i guess i start by putting
the key in the ignition. i guess that's how that goes. i wonder, am i supposed to
put my foot on the brake? ooh. okay, okay. - watch out! - i'm going so slow. i got a bad start, come push me. - i'm gonna cheat really hard. - how's it going for you?
- they're not even ready for this, look at this gap,
you know what i'm saying? - ah. you hit my car. you're gonna make jake win. - the next scrapped video
was "which weighs more, 100 pounds of rocks or a
100 pounds of feathers?" it was a legitimate
question i had and, yeah. we're gonna see if one million feathers- - this is probably one
of my favorite videos. - can destroy this car. guys, are you ready? so why did it never get uploaded? - let's find out.
- three, two, one.
- "my car." my car! - let me show you which one's better. this is the feather. okay. notice, gravity.
- yeah. - this is a rock. - no, this is patrick. - this is 100 pounds of feathers. do you think 100 pounds of feathers weighs more than 100 pounds of rock? drop the 100 pounds of feathers. 100 pounds of feathers
did not smash the plate. this is 100 pounds of rocks. that was 100 pounds of feathers. for some reason, you guys thought 100 pounds of rocks weighed the same as 100 pounds of feathers
but drop the rock. if they weighted the same, why would the rocks smash the
plate but not the feathers? rocks clearly weigh more. and after we debunked
the rock versus feathers, we just started doing a bunch
of weird science experiments. when helicopters spin, they fly. so why don't blenders fly when they spin? - let's find out. - precisely my theory. the new mode for air
transportation is blenders. you're welcome, society. hmm, hmm. oh my goodness. - i think we've been
wrong this whole time. my colleagues, the world isn't flat. - oh my god.
- it is in fact a cube. now i know you might have doubt
but i have undeniable proof. see, this is america, this is asia. all you do is you board a
plane and the government turns the cube and then
flips it like that and boom, you're in asia.
- oh my goodness. - that's what they've done all this time. - it makes so much sense. - and then they just do this,
this, this and throw it. and that's why we thought it was flat 'cause they always do that.
- my life is a lie. - oh! so if the earth is a cube, why don't we just fall off the edges? - that's a great question. the reason we don't fall off the edges is because we're on the top of it and the only people on the
sides are the reptilians like mark zuckle-burg
and the people that live on the bottom are the government and they drastically want to keep
it a secret from us. the government's lying. - well, one more question. what were you doing down there? - for years, the government's been hiding the fact that mark is a lizard. watch, i have undeniable proof. - no way.
- watch. - oh my. - "minecraft" has a height limit. "fortnite" has a height limit. everything has a height limit but earth? that's crap, climb that ladder. you can't go any higher, can you? - i can't.
- yeah. government's been hiding that
from you your whole life. there is an earth height
limit, it's about 20 feet. stay woke, sheep.
- so how do planes fly? - oh, they're just a
myth, they're not real. - [chandler and chris]
scrapped video review. - is over. - and yeah guys, tens of
thousands if not $100,000 later, lots of weeks wasted and tons
of videos never uploaded. hopefully you guys enjoyed. my goal for 2019 is to upload more videos that i filmed because
that's not even all of 'em. we have more videos that got scrapped. don't forget to buy merch. four people that buy merch
in the month of january will get to compete in a competition next month for some crazy prize. subscribe if you're not already and get the out in my house. - wait, wait, wait, wait. floor two, right? - no, actually i'm going to floor four. mom, call the police.
- i'm just gonna walk away.
