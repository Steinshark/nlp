let's say in the way that the people watching this will totally understand you can't completely just act as if god exists yes exactly you know it's gonna yeah it's gonna act so but that's why like i tell people that ultimately the psalms are the good example this is that ultimately worship is the key to this like word it's like it's because worship places you in a mode where you're interacting where you're acknowledging where you're placing yourself in relationship to this this to to god and then and then that is the training right that's the training ground which helps you exit you know not just make it into a mental trick but make it into something that you embody that you participate in no i i think that's absolutely important i think that's that is the kind of real thing ultimately is worship right and this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so hello everyone i am very pleased to be here with michael legaspi who is a professor of the old testament at saint vladimir seminary as you know many of you probably know the same vladimir seminary is one of the main oca seminaries in america it has a very long and profound history all the theological developments of the you know orthodox church in the west this transfer to local languages saint vladimir has been very much involved and so i'm really happy to be able to collaborate with them and with michael so michael thanks for thanks for talking to me no it's a it's a pleasure to be here jonathan thank you for having me on this wonderful show which has been just a wonderful thing for so many of us out here in the you know the the internet sphere i suppose so thank you so much for for having me it's great so so michael had this wonderful idea to go into the psalms and look at this idea that the psalms are in some ways a way for us to experience our own personhood our own subjectivity and a kind of frame for for us to experience that and i thought it was a wonderful idea so maybe michael you can start us off and kind of give give us your main thesis about this this the function that the psalms can play in in this right so i guess just kind of in reflecting in my on my own relationship with scripture i've sort of noticed that there are just kind of ways in which the scriptures make sense to me in ways in which i feel like i'm hindered in my understanding of them and my progress toward them and sort of as i thought about it i i thought a lot of the issues that i was having just as a as a an individual were tied up with kind of my notion of self and how i interact with god and with the world and this sort of brought me to this idea of of subjectivity right so this idea of what it means for me to experience life as as me and what it means for you to experience life as you and sort of all the things that go into that right sort of consciousness emotion perception all of these things influence the way we experience the world the way we interact with others and the way we interact with god and as i was thinking about it like we we tend to like work with like a few options when it comes to subjectivity right so we think of our ourselves our consciousness our interaction with the world is as sort of cognitive right like what do i think and what do i know and that sort of makes me who i am and that kind of orients me toward the world so i have to come up with the right world view i have to come up with the right philosophy so that i can kind of consider my you know have the right relation to what i experience another way of thinking about subjectivity is in our effective way like thinking about emotions and attitudes right so obviously those things affect the way we experience the world so fundamentally what makes me me is it my personality i don't know about you but like i like those personality tests you know and i've taken a lot of them and you know i find that really interesting and maybe that is something that like determines our our subjectivity is like something affective about us or we could go materialist right and we could say that subjectivity is essentially a reflex of kind of our existence as physical beings right like emergent property is what they like to say emergent proper emergent property properties right yeah exactly but i i think that any of those ways of like thinking about subjectivity sort of limit us when it comes to interacting with god reading the scripture and i think it's the psalms in particular that helps us recover i guess what we might call a kind of scriptural subjectivity so by that i mean that we don't like exclude the physical or the cognitive or the effect of like all those things are definitely part of the human experience but i think what psalms show us is that subjectivity human subjectivity is fundamentally relational that what makes us who we are as beings and what kind of is at the core of our interaction with the world is our capacity for relationality specifically for relating to god which i think in the psalms is presented as like the fundamental relationship so and that i mean i just want to mention one thing because if you realize then that when christ says that you know the the let's say all the commandments are gathered in to love god and love your neighbor what's being enunciated there in some ways is not just an ethical command it's not just a the way that you have to act but the way we have to be that it's a it's annunciation of what it means to be a being in itself that a being is has to be in relationship with in relation to others that's how it works right so like how do we move from the kind of domain of the self to something outside the self i guess is a question and do we do it on the basis of again our emotions our cognitive maneuvers or whatever i think the psalms kind of anchor us in in something deeper and kind of a deeper way to make that movement that movement that is you know fundamentally a movement of love and so i was kind of helped in my reflections by this distinction that uh philosopher charles taylor makes right between two models of the self right so he talks about something called the porous self which he associates with you know pre-modern cultures right so where people didn't sort of draw this hard line between themselves and the world outside but saw the boundary as porous and so things that happen in the world essentially can be experienced in this in this sort of direct way there isn't like a a wall so to speak and so this he says goes along with experiencing the world in an enchanted way right so that we we see we're kind of porous to to the spirits we're porous to cosmic forces were pores to god and that in this mode you know along with that is actually a kind of vulnerability right so you have people who are sort of feel vulnerable of spiritual forces and he so one of the things that taylor's interested in is like what it means for us to be modern people right and he says that one of the hallmarks of modernity is a kind of shift from the city of the poorest self where we are kind of feel ourselves as being connected to and vulnerable to that which is outside of us to what he calls the buffered self so when he speaks of the buff itself he's sort of talking about a model of the self in which we have like complete control over the meanings we assign to the world so we can kind of stand back observe things and decide what they mean and we have this sort of buffer then that that insulates us from what happens to us and so not only do we have sort of control over over what we the meanings we assign to things in the world but he says that people you know see in this see this as liberative because it gives them freedom like i can assign whatever meanings i want i can kind of remake myself as i like and i think of richard rorty in connection with this because you know he's the one who sort of celebrated our kind of nichean potential to recreate ourselves and you know he says he has this quote he says there's nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves so it's the kind of buffer itself and behind the buffer is this container that's completely at our disposal yeah so i think this kind of modern view of selfhood and you know i have to say to a great degree is kind of the view that i walk around with you know as a function of you know living when and where i do and it makes it hard to kind of relate to that which is on the other side of the buffer if you know what i mean if you're if you're kind of experiencing yourself in this in this particular way but it's interesting that now because that that way of thinking especially online especially the fact that we're physically separated from each other and we interact through screens we interact it's as if there's an acceleration of this like the a notion of the buffer itself is manifesting itself in the world and accelerating even in the means by which we interact like you and i right now and dragging through this screen and so the consequences of it are more visible right if you think of avatar culture like this idea of people self-creating themselves online through their personas that are extremely that have become very strange and you know like they can even be aliens or furries or whatever like people will self-create themselves in ways that have become so idiosyncratic that it'd be it's almost now impossible not to notice the the side effects of this buffer itself like it's fragmenting and splintering in ways that in some ways i think is opening a call of the heart for of people wanting something more wanting a more connected reality no i i think that's an excellent i i do think that digital stuff and screens sort of are in a way a kind of buffer right like that's just the the version of the buffer that we're kind of working with today and and also the thing about the digital is that it really has this idea of plasticity and kind of infinite potential and i can you can rearrange and reconfigure endlessly and so this idea that the kind of stuff that we work with behind the buffer is infinitely plastic is i think part of the you could just reuse you know use and reuse cultural tropes and memes and you know this bit of song and this image and you can just sort of put it all together and create whatever you want but i i think with the psalms point to when it comes to subjectivity is this idea that it's not infinitely plastic there is actually something there that that is god-given that can only really be at at rest and fulfilled when when when we come back into communion with god so i think rory is is wrong there's there's more than down in there than what we put there namely there is what what god put there and and i think it's the psalms that in in this really unique way kind of tutor us you know they kind of like lead us in this sort of manner of living that reconnects us i think with a notion of the self that's not fragmented as you know to use your word it's but but actually kind of reintegrated so thinking about the psalms i got a lot of help from saint athanasius who wrote this letter which i encourage everyone to read it's called the letter to marcelinus and it's it's a a text all about the psalms and he says some amazing things about the psalms that if you don't mind yeah to share he says in other books of scripture we read or hear the words of holy men as belonging only to those who spoke them not at all as though they were our own and in the same way the doings they are narrated are to us material for wonder and examples to be followed but not in any sense things we have done ourselves with the psalms though except for prophecies about the savior it is as though it were one's own words that one read and anyone who hears them is moved at heart as though they voiced his deepest thoughts so i think we can think of the psalms as sort of given to us to make the depth of the self accessible to us right that it under normal situations it's not fully transparent to us and we fail to understand the movements of the soul i guess is another way of putting it and that the psalms kind of help us to see those movements of the soul in ourselves so i yeah and it's not it's not what's interesting too about the psalms is that it's not only a kind of whitewashing like you could imagine it that way it's like no it's just it's trying it's immoralizing it's trying to make you into the right person it's trying to force you to to think certain ways no like the cries of despair and of anger and of wanting revenge like all of these are part of the experience of reading the psalms it's not at all a a cleansed a cleansed version of human experience it's a very rich and deep and and sometimes very dark version of it i i mean to be honest some of them are difficult to read you know the closely the prayers revenge it's and it's hard to know what to do they're famously difficult for people to work with you know maybe we should just be thinking about the demons as our enemies for example and but i don't know i think some of the psalms are about people but i think that it's if you see it more as something that encompasses the fullness of human experience right and tries to so if you see just the song for vengeance as being isolated on its own then of course it doesn't it doesn't hold but if you understand it as this as a part of a musical symphony where there's this moment of of dark you know and and of anger and of asking god to be your your hand just to get done what you want but then there are other moments where it expands into into a loftier vision of what what is was possible you know no i i like that very much i think and i think that's a good counsel so reading psalms together right it's sort of like you can obviously take an individual one and do whatever you want with it but like taking them together is is i think the right move just you know interpret which is actually for all scripture that's what you need to do because if you just read the book of judges alone you like you'll go crazy but if you read if you read you know the the early books and you read the prophetic books and just call for all you know the the spirit of god to be on all flesh and you get this big story you then all of a sudden even the harsher parts they tend to to look like like little like little movements in a grand symphony you know right right no that's yeah and psalms is a kind of microcosm of scripture right like that's another thing you find in the father there's a lot is this reference to the psalms as being like a mini a mini like bible unto itself and you know it was divided into five books to mirror the five books of the pentateuch because so it's it really it really bears kind of reading in that in that holistic way so so yeah so the so so if that's true of the psalms then like what is our response right and i think that this is where we have this sort of wisdom in the church which is to to read the psalms kind of in bulk because when they're brought down into the heart right and there's a kind of statement in the phila khalia when they're brought down into the heart they take root in the soil of the heart and produce the flowers of the spiritual life right the visions of incorporeal realities the luminosity of corporate of corporeal realities that the judgments of god which are hard to understand so so i think and and i'm saying it's not as like an expert basically in doing this or in spirituality of the songs this is for me kind of like getting my own self-oriented toward the way in which the psalms can can teach a function yeah so you have this this so one of the things you want us to look at which i think is a great idea is that there are certain songs which are read at madden's right and and are gathered together from the book of psalms and to have a that they there's a through line and there's a certain aesthetic to them in which they deal with this idea of darkness and you know falling into the pit and calling up to the heaven so maybe you can guide us a little bit about the practice basically because these would be these would be sung you know if in a monastery they would be sung at matins right at every every mat in service right and so if you if what i mean i've done matins i don't do it very often but when i do then i then i engage in this in in this as well yeah so i i think it's important to sort of like see and benefit and understand the guidance of the church when it comes to the psalms and i think there's like amazing things that are done with the psalms that sort of clue us into how they can be shaping our subjectivity and for me one of the most powerful examples is this group of psalms called the six psalms so for those of you interested in in looking at this this is their psalms 3 38 63 88 103 and 143 or in the greek numbering 3 37 82 87 102 and 142. so they come from across the salter and they're they're chosen out and put together and this group is called the the six psalms so i think the the matins context is important because mountains is the morning prayer service right so if you're thinking about waking up you've just come through the night the new day is beginning and matins is like right on that boundary between the night and the day so symbolically we might say between death and our waking to a life after death so and and in in russian tradition vespers and matins are kind of done together as part of the vigil before like say you know on saturday night say before sunday in which case the six psalms are part of the mountains in our parade like exclusively at night and and so in russian tradition the parish i was a part of they put out all the candles in the church in the six psalms so it was like utterly dark the reader had just one candle and would read the psalms and read them in a low voice and in a very solemn way nobody is moving i actually came across an ancient typicon which specified how the six psalms were to be read and the instructions were really were really interesting right so one one instruction is this is in a monastery context no one may sneeze or spit or leave his place or move or enter from the narthex if someone is bent over because of old age or ravaged by sickness and cannot avoid doing we have just described let him stay outside the church until the end of the hexus almost so there's this atmosphere it's dark it's static and you're just standing at attention and you're listening to the songs and you know having experienced this a number of times my sense is that the psalms the six psalms kind of bring us through an experience of death you know i think like the philosophers talk about memento mori and they talk about thinking about death as a kind of like way to lead the philosophical life but what these psalms do is i think actually bring us through we actually experience death liturgically so the very first of the six psalms is psalm 3 which contains the line i laid me down and i slept i awoke for the lord will help me so what kind of waking is it so again there are a lot of traditions that associate the six psalms with with judgment with this idea that they're kind of preparing us to stand before god in judgment after death and so the first psalm has this image of falling asleep and waking up and we wake into god's presence which is a kind of judgment god's presence is always a judgment right and so from there the psalms take a really dark turn and there's just a ton of imagery there that to me sounds like us as sort of having passed to the other side of death are now looking back on this process of dying you know these images that seem to match like they seem to voice the body being lowered into the grave yeah yeah my heart is troubled my strength has failed me and the light of mine eyes even this is not with me my friends and neighbors drew nigh over against me and stood in my nearest of kin stood afar off i picture people at a funeral standing far off from the body filled with evils is my soul my life unto hades i've drawn nigh i'm counted with them that go down into the pit and become it as a man without help free among the dead like the bodies of the slain that sleep in the grave who now remembers no more and they're cut off from the hand they laid me in the lowest pit in darkness and in the shadow of death against me is thine anger made strong and all thy billows has thou brought upon me that was remove my friends apart from me they've made me an abomination unto themselves i've been delivered up have not come forth my eyes are grown weak from poverty i've cried unto thee oh lord the whole day long i've stretched out my hands into the name for the dead will that work wonders shall physicians raise them up they may give thanks unto thee shall any in the grave tell them thy mercy and of thy truth and that destruction shall thy wonders be known in that darkness or thy righteousness in that land that is forgotten but as for me unto thee o lord have i cried in the morning shall my prayer come before thee so you're kind of lowered into the grave your kin are standing afar off yeah like it's such a deep coherence to the imagery that that is used and it can help you like you said you talked about how the psalms are in some ways a mini version of scripture and i think they are i think that the key to interpreting scripture is often in the song because it's a poem and because what the poet does and you see that in christian poets too like if you read saint ephraim that's what he does the analogies that they create help you to understand what the bible stories are about right and so what you see in this in the psalmist is that there are several things going on one is that he goes down right so imagine you know there's the mountain of god and he's going down the mountain of god and going down the mountain of god has images related to it going underwater right it talks about the ways the billow is going over me it talks about fragmentation right it's like i am far away from those that i love they can't they every everything is broken and and fragmented it talks about the enemies it's like if i'm far away from god then all the things from the outside assault me like i'm assaulted by thing from the outside then it relates it to sleep relates it to darkness but especially it relates it to forgetting this idea that i i have been forgotten by god i have forgotten god and you see that like the image of forgetting you see that in in during the flood when when noah is on the on the waters at some point it says god remembered noah and when god remembers knoweth as if in this darkness and this deep there's this connection you see it in the story of jonah jonah goes down to the bottom then all these same images come right the deep the darkness you know the death and sleep and then and then he says i remembered the lord and he calls up right he calls up to the mountain calls up to the to the high place and these images are all there like all these these songs that is beautiful imagery to help us like understand like how can i say this to help us understand how the story of the flood relates to you like you said this is a key for our own experience like how the story of moses through the desert the the egypt the israelites being slaves in israel and being forgotten by god and then god remembering them and what that means it's like it's just giving us a key to and showing us that scripture is not even in scripture it tells us that the other story that used those images are about your experience right right yes no i think that's that's wonderful and i think right the way they kind of interweave and overlap and then like psalms is sort of like the cherry on top it's sort of like okay nice you've heard jonah do it and and you've heard hezekiah do it and you know you've heard noah do it now it's your turn right so it sort of puts us in the sequence in a way so that we make this this prayer as well and so i i think yes i love this i think you're right i think there's such a commonality between the metaphors that that come with death and like being away from god and all the things you mentioned and yes this land of forgetfulness right so it's a kind of a place right it's it's not just a psychic state i mean there's definitely this idea that it's a it's a place and you know as you said you're far from family you have no strength you have no comfort it's it's just utterly painful and i think the song the six psalms take us right to that point they really just drive us down and then there's this unexpected turn in the six songs right so when you get to the fifth psalm this see it seems to come out of nowhere all of a sudden you have psalm 102 bless the lord on my soul and all it is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul forget not all that he hath done for thee he was gracious unto all thine iniquities who healeth all thine infirmities redeemeth thy life from corruption which is this place we're talking about who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion as for man his days are as the grass as a flower of the field so shall he blossom forth for when the wind has passed over it then it shall be gone and no longer will it know the place thereof but the mercy of the lord is from eternity even unto eternity upon them that fear him so there's like this moment and i think like you mentioned jonah right he too like remembers god and his temple and it's like he's able to to kind of move to ascend in a way even though he's still in the in the belly of the fish and like the the so you you sort of make that ascent by virtue of of remembrance and so there's this like as as dark as it is the six psalms i i just think this moment of like remembering that you are not forgotten is is essential to the movement of the songs and not only that but it helps you understand it just helps you understand so much about what we say like why is it that we talk about memory when we talk about the deceased you know why do we say memory eternal yeah we have this sense in which we understand that in that it is memory like it is god remembering us that makes even our death keeps us connected to god that that that in this memory is how everything holds together you know and so it it's a key to understanding even how in the church we treat the the dead and how we the way in which liturgically we talk about people that have passed wow i never thought about that you're right why we're always talking about memory but no it makes it makes perfect sense and i mean and now now that you mention it you know you have this burst of like praise and the fifth psalm but the sixth psalm you're kind of back down again so it does not end on a high note it ends on a low note but like to your point one of the themes in that in the final psalm of the 6 is memory right oh lord hear my prayer give ear to my supplication hearken unto me enter not into judgment with thy servant for a nice sight shall no man let living be justified the enemy had persecuted my soul it humbled my life down to the pit he sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead my spirit within he's become despite it my heart is troubled and then this like what you're talking about memory i remembered days of old i meditated on all thy works i pondered the patient's life so memory kind of keeps him like from succumbing to the darkness in a way i should put my hands unto thee so he moves he does something my soul thirsteth after the like a waterless land quickly hear me o lord my spirit had fainted away so it's sort of from this dark place we have this sort of flash of like hope this burst of hope but then we kind of come back to this place and realize really all that we have in this place we're utterly kind of helpless it's our capacity to cry to god for mercy and that that comes from i think the soul which is this part of us that is like god-given and it's it's we can ignore it we can suppress it but we can't get rid of it and it's the part that that helps us always to to cry out to god and so even in this forsaken place it's like you still have that capacity to cry out to god for mercy and and so that's this whole image of the morning like this one the morning that's coming and it's cycles it's as if it's not yet the morning it's like i see the morning you know i'll hear you in the morning like i'll see you in the morning you will you know that there'll be there'll be this light that will come and sometimes it's it feels like he's saying that it's now but then he goes back into the darkness but so there's this sense like i know i i trust i hope i know that you know that god will deliver me even though at this moment i might not be i might still be in this this darkness you know wait it's a it's both very realistic but also trusting in this trusting this absolutely knowing that the light the light of god the remembrance of god and god except god's mercy is the thing that will bring me back into the light ultimately now i think that's a great point i think if the six songs ended on this sort of high note and everything sort of you know wraps up nicely then you know that wouldn't quite be what what it's like i mean you call them realistic and i think that's right i think it is this sort of like i'm despondent and and i and i'm in this sort of waterless land but then i have hope but then like oh wait but i have to sustain that hope you know and and it's a struggle right it's always a kind of an argone like a a struggle so i just so that's the way the six psalms end and then the lights come on in the church and then the the deacon goes into a litany and it's like oh hey i'm back in the land of the living i'm praying now for the patriarch and i'm praying for other people and like i'm back but it's it's sort of like you are invited to take this this journey and i mean to to you know we have mountains every day at same vlades which is a huge blessing you really get to see how the psalms can tutor you and so i think this experience of going through death every day by virtue of the six psalms is one that like helps you realize how important it is like you were saying memory like to cultivate memory and remembrance and also to kind of open the self in such a way that it's its main the central feature of its subjectivity is is essentially this kind of relation to god by which we beseech his mercy which is essentially the jesus prayer right like that's what the jesus prayer is doing but i think and then in the i mean in the philocalia the idea of the memory of god like it's so present it's so important to understand that in some ways that is the way that we are connected to god is just it's just through attention and memory like if we if we can live in that in that memory then i mean who like you would you would you even sin like if you could just live in the memory of god like how could you you know always by forgetting it's like it's always by forgetting my connection to this higher to the higher things that i fall into my own idiosyncrasy and i think that i can get away with this or i think that that i'm isolated like this buffer itself and that my thoughts don't matter that my you know my actions don't matter but if i remember god then how can i how can i yeah how can i fall into these into these these other types of patterns yeah no exactly if only right if only exactly i'm saying is it's as if i can do that but it's like whatever moment that i have where i'm able to live in that memory and you know and and with the jesus prayer let's say feeds me and i can it becomes a pattern for me then i then i know that it's it makes everything bright like it just happens that you know this this image of the morning and the light and the things that that have the light of god that shines on them shine on them yeah that's what that's what happens i mean so this possibility of sort of keeping one's attention fixed on god at all times is obviously you know difficult but like i think that is the psalms right it's like you as you were saying it's every situation in life how to fix your attention to god when you're when you're angry when you're just sort of filled with joy in the temple worshiping god i mean there are songs that go there there are psalms that have to do with conflict with other people right and there are psalms that have to do with sitting by a brook and you see a deer come and drink the water and you know it's just every kind of experience there is one in which it is possible to fix one's attention on god so in a way like the psalms bears witness to something that we can do but but but don't unfortunately yeah i know unfortunately yeah but it but it's interesting because at least like because we have the liturgy and because we can at least have these moments where you know in some ways how can i say this not that we're forced to do it but that the the external situation is kind of leading us into it then we can have little glimpses of that of that possibility no i yeah no i think that's you know i think of the i think the liturgy is sort of obviously the primary place where this happens for us but you know we you can always you always got this you can always you know yeah just read read the psalter and kind of go through the psalter like so there's this the feature of the psalms i think that's also interesting is that the word soul comes up a lot and so this is the you know the hebrew word nafesh which has a lot of different meanings netflix can actually refer to your throat or your your neck so when when i think it's psalm 69 the waters have come up to my nephesh probably means the waters have come up to my neck you know they're high but it the word occurs in in a lot of in you know a lot of different places in the psalms and i think in other places you know it has kind of there's something else going on with this word in other words what i'm saying so when the soul is mentioned it's the soul is always interested in doing particular things and the soul above all is always interested in in connecting with god right to you oh lord i lift up my soul as the deer pants for the flowing stream so my pants my soul for you oh god my soul thirsts for god for the living god for god alone my soul waits in silence for him comes my salvation oh god you are my god earnestly i seek you my soul thirst for you which is not the same as saying earnestly i see you know i thirst for you right i wait in silence it's it's you could argue grammatically that maybe some that's basically what it amounts to but i do think the language is important here and one of my former teachers james kugel who's like you know really knows this the the biblical poetry world very well he had this funny term for the soul in the songs he said the psalms is a kind of double agent that in in the psalms the soul is this sort of thing that's in you that belongs to you but god put it there and it belongs to god so it's ultimately loyal to god and it's this part of you that's loyal to god and is only kind of happy let's say when it when when in contact with god right so you can kind of be at odds with yourself in the sense that your soul which belongs to be in contact with god isn't you know the things you're doing it isn't you know what i mean like the things that we do and so you have this sort of paradox where the the part of you that you consider to be like most interior your soul is actually only at rest only at peace only fulfilled when it goes beyond the boundary of the self to to god so we definitely don't want a buffer that's impenetrable right the soul needs to move beyond that but for to god and like the more porous that is the easier it is for the soul to come to to god and back again the more integrated the person right so you also have these other verses in the psalms where the psalmist addresses his soul why are you downcast oh my soul why are you in turmoil within me bless the lord o my soul all that is within me return o my soul to your rest for the lord is dealt bountifully with you and so you have this phenomenon of like talking to your soul not just like speaking but like talking to it you know and i think this is different from when we talk to ourselves you know where we're just kind of verbalizing talking to one's soul is to kind of face up to a part of you like that is you but again like not completely because it belongs to god so you're facing up to a part of you that is that is loyal to god that will not rest until it sees god like just going back to subjectivity for a minute like i think that is something we experience is sort of this being at odds with the self you know being unhappy being fragmented being conflicted let's say and i don't know i think sometimes we don't we kind of misdiagnose it you know we're like oh i'm just bored i'm just unhappy i'm just restless i'm just sort of dissatisfied and it could be that the conflict that's give making you unhappy has to do with with this you know this soul that rests in god and and and all of us who you know sees on various distractions in the world and prevent that from happening so i don't know i know do you think there's a connection between this term and the way that the the say the orthodox fathers talk about the noose for example like yes yeah i do i do so yeah news isn't normally you know a translation of nephesh but i but it's like as i was thinking about it it reminded me a lot about about news language and like the part of us that's that can perceive and apprehend and relate to god and wants to and is continually wanting to so like there's this core feature of the self that you know we in in modern life right in the confines of the buffer itself tend not to even acknowledge and i think this is where a lot of our own kind of unhappiness comes from yeah and there's also a way in which you know this idea of the soul for people or this idea of the way you describe this this category which is like in between in between in the sense that it's the hook between it's a place where god and you connect you could say right the top of the mountain like however you want to describe it you know the holy of holies there are many there are different reflection of that of that place or that reality in scripture from the individual but then also you know when moses goes to the top of the mountain and then in that in that place is where he receives you know the glory of god and the same thing in the tabernacle you know in this whole this place in saint gregor nissa really seems to join all of these together and say basically they're just the images of the same thing at different levels of of reality but it's also i think that for secular people listening to this this is actually a necessary aspect of how reality works that is for things to exist they necessarily have to have an aspect of their existence which transcends it which links it to higher participations right this is this is absolutely necessary for anything to to exist and so you can't you can't find the purpose of things in the thing it's always it's always kind of in between in between the thing itself and it's telos you could say and so the fact that this exists for a cop or for anything is is just that's just how it works and so the the notion that we have that should not surprise people like if you're not surprised people that humans also have an aspect of themselves which has to necessarily transcend their multiplicity like this this this connector for us to be be able to exist with each other but then also for us to be able to exist towards that which is above us and in this case of course we're talking about the very source of reality itself right the god of love so so i i think that it's not a it's something which can be posited almost technically for people you know and that the the imagistic language need not make you think that this is some kind of magical floating you know this is how people sadly imagine the soul like right it's like where is the soul as if it's it's a physical physical thing where this is not what we're talking about here no it's it's it's so i i there's a kind of paradox there right it's sort of you if you if you enclose the object enclose the thing in such a way that it has to kind of be a kind of thing unto itself in who's with with a kind of inherent meaning right not only does he lose the meaning you lose the object right so and yeah and so like i think the psalms kind of with this continual opening of the self is is just it's it's actually not a kind of escape from subjectivity but a kind of fulfillment of it a kind of like joining it with the world adjoining it with god to joining it with reality that makes the self not diminished but like embedded and thereby kind of enhanced and more real and if you understand that it that way then what you talked about at the beginning makes so much sense when you said you know the mo the bet the mode of being the mode of subjectivity is is relationship that is the mo and so for that to happen there has to be an aspect of me which is calling out which is almost like escaping my my closed self in order to be able to connect with god to connect with others this is this is absolutely necessary yes and you know i have to say i've had some influence from you know existentialist thinkers in the past you know who kind of know that this is true actually they know that that this is part of what it means to be like they're good phenomenologists they know that this is how the mind works but like for them it's good enough that you just posit it it doesn't really matter what's on the other side it's like in the act of positing that you can get the same effect but but can you yeah but can you i mean is or do you know that you've posited it in a way that kind of undermines its ability to anchor you and i think the psalmist is always coming up against god in a way that's like god is not manipulable god is not yielding to him you know he's saying listen listen help me out but god is is doing it on god's terms right and so there's a kind of like now we can talk about objectivity in a certain sense like there's a certain you know aspect to to god that is like not you it's other than you and so you cannot fake there's a kind of reality to that the cat it can be like approximated maybe but it can't ultimately be be be reproduced it can you know it can be counterfeited but it can't be you know it can't be reproduced in something yeah let's to say in the ways that the people watching this will totally understand you can't completely just act as if god exists yes exactly exactly as if it's going to like be you know it's gonna yeah it's gonna act out so but that's why like i tell people that ultimately the psalms are the good example this is that ultimately worship is the key to this like we're it's like it's because worship places you in a mode where you're interacting where you're acknowledging where you're placing yourself in relationship to this this to to god and then and then that is the training right that's the training ground which helps you exit you know not just make it into a mental trick but make it into something that you embody that you participate in no i i think that's absolutely important i think that's that is the kind of real thing ultimately is worship right and and you know i i am you know i do i just love how in the church you know it's it's that that kind of worship is so full it's it's how you stand right it's where you're looking it's what you're seeing iconographically it's what you're hearing musically and you know it's it's it's a kind of full bringing of the self into god's presence and i'm learning to stand in god's presence in a way that is it in a way it's sort of like teaching you but in a way it's it's also the thing itself and so there's a completeness to our experience as human beings in worship that isn't available when we're you know being consumers or we're you know distracting ourselves in various ways and and it's not you know i say this not as like not as like some great liturgical athlete like oh i'm super i'm like no i struggle and it's hard for me because of the ways that i've you know grown up in my own kind of mind but but i am grateful that everything is there in place to kind of to prepare us not not to create the religion to prepare us to like experience it fully so i do think liturgy and participation in services is is kind of the main thing but like when you're not you could be reading psalms yeah yeah but just even the jesus prayer like you said the jesus prayers is a form of memory it's a form of of just constant participation and so it's it's always accessible to us even if it's just for 30 seconds like just that moment when you're in between things just that moment when you're distracted when you're nervous when you're anxious it's like it's like the jesus prayer is such an amazing thing we can we can reach out to to kind of put ourselves in that mode of attention you know so i think you know just just talking about the soul and like there being some part of us that is like constantly like trying to go up you know you use the the axial imagery you know and i think that's true the soul is like the part that's trying to go up all the time in the flesh is the part that's trying to like sink down all the time but so if like there is this part of us then a jesus prayer is a kind of like stepping out of like attention to one thing onto attention of the soul to god that's also real i mean i think that i'm just being like thinking about criticism oh the jesus prayer that's just like a nervous tick or like oh that's just something you know you're saying or that's just like something you're saying like therapeutically just to make yourself feel better but no it's not so you are actually it's like there's an electrical current there you know with the soul to god and you're kind of plugging in as long as you can you know and then you know maybe you can't plug in for for a long time but you can plug in for a few minutes and then that that changes you right like there's an energy there yeah but that but it's all once you understand the role of memory and attention and the way in which we exist in relationship to others but also i mean just even in terms of our relationship like memory and attention is how you stay connected to your friends to your family to all the people that that are around you and so this idea that it's that it would be arbitrary that you would have these you would try to have memory and attention in your in your life in your daily life towards god like just like you said just connect even for just 30 seconds one minute you know like waiting waiting outside for someone or whatever to just kind of go into the jesus prayer that's ridiculous it's like it's actually it will create a a basic strata of what you are like it'll create a basic spread of what's most important to you yeah i i was just reminded of something i heard a while ago about how kind of the currency and in the digital economy is attention right like that's what right and and it's it's sort of like when when you kind of realize that and then you kind of pair that with you know i think the truth that you're you're articulating here about attention being kind of what we have it sort of raises the stakes in our daily lives right like we think oh it's an innocent thing that i'm doing this and i'm confusing my attention and here and there but and it's easier than ever to diffuse one's into attention but oh yeah our world is made to scatter us like everything about it is like is made to rip us apart so yeah it's difficult but you know in some ways it's like it's it's weird because it's difficult but at least at this moment we have the capacity to see it because the fact that that we online the cycles of attention are so accelerated and the scattering of attention is so immediate we can realize to what extent attention is the mode it is the mode of connection like that's what it is so you're like wait a minute it's so i think that it in some ways it is opening up the possibility of people to understand that and to re-enter into at least we enter into that space where it's like yeah well yeah where i put my attention is probably one of the most important things that i can decide what i'm doing okay so i think we have to add that to like an unsharing of subjectivity not just cognitive or effective but like it's kind of like yeah yeah so we hear it in the in the liturgy all the time it's like a 10. that's it attend you know stand up attend you know that's and that's that's that's a good start you know yeah i mean and they're kind of timed in a certain way like oh yeah okay right they kind of like bring you back so no that's good i didn't make that connection but no that's i don't know how do we yeah attention yeah i think that's the psalmist is is he he might be like he might be impatient or he might be angry or he might you know he might be any number of things at any given moment or even pretty dark almost despairing but like always attentive right yeah that's the kind of baseline of it is like god i'm looking to you i'm attending to you are you gonna help me and are you gonna you know save me or or thank you so much or i'm going to praise you and i'll page you as long as i live you know but whatever whatever he is on that in his life at the moment that that's certainly what's there yeah michael this has been a great conversation thanks
