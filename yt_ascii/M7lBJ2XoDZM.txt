welcome to something different this is a thermal comparison between the one plus seven pro galaxy s 10 plus and the huawei p 30 pro and i'm actually using a pro grade infrared camera so you can see the exact heat at each point in each phone all right so first things first charging so i've literally just plugged each smartphone into its original adapter that comes in the box and we're gonna see over the first 10 minutes how hot each device gets so you can probably already tell the hallway is getting really hot right now especially in the top left-hand side samsung is by far the coolest vernon and the oneplus is somewhere in the middle with pretty evenly distributed heat if we now accelerate this from the 10 minute mark to the 30 minute mark you'll see the similar trend but exaggerated samsung definitely stays the coolest huawei is definitely the hottest in fact if you take a look at this approximate scale on the left you'll see that the oneplus is hovering at around 40 degrees celsius the galaxy s 10 a little bit cooler at about 37 and the huawei p 30 pro in parts is reaching 45 degrees here's a quick time-lapse of the whole process but the takeaway is that 45 degrees is really hot to the touch you'll almost be a little bit surprised when you pick it up for the first time having said that these three fans charged with three different power levels the oneplus weighed 30 watts galaxy s 10 plus with 15 and the huawei with 40 watts and so with that in mind you can see pretty much direct trade-off between the amount of battery you can charge within 30 minutes and the resulting heat from that charging all right so i've taken the phones out i've cooled them down and right now you can actually see they're cooler than their surroundings but that'll change very quickly so what we can do now is simulate a fairly intensive day-to-day scenario so we're going to start by putting each phone in its high performance mode and then we're gonna load up instagram so we get the application open head to the explore page as we usually do in this test and then see what time does to the temperature of each phone it's quite an interesting results you'll notice the concentration of heat moved from the surroundings to the devices themselves in a matter of minutes so to answer the question yes even instagram heats up your smartphone a couple of things to note about this test i've actually raised each smartphone off the surface it's on just to allow normal air flow around it and we are actually currently in a pretty warm but not super warm room about 23 24 degrees okay so without any kind of set we're going to switch from instagram at to full metal monsters it's a game fairly intensive 3d game we're gonna see what that does to temperatures you can probably already tell though that the huawei is the hottest the poway is now already reaching nearly 40 degrees at some points whereas the galaxy is somewhere around the 3738 mark and the oneplus about 35 again without any break we're gonna head straight into 4k video recording and my hunch is that this is gonna seriously raise that temperature bar this does turn out to be true but what i'd say is more interesting is exactly where the heat is coming from in the phone so if you take a look at the huawei that phone has reached 47 degrees at its hottest point that is seriously warm and that heat is actually concentrated towards the top of the phone where both the phone's storage and the phone's chip are housed so again if we just time-lapse that whole process you'll see that actually even light usage can make these phones rather hot the huawei reach is 35 before we've even started gaming but then video recording really pushes them all to the limit all right final test we're gonna try and push the cpu and the gpu as far as we possibly can as well as hopefully the battery - so i've installed the 3dmark benchmark on each phone and i'm gonna start by running the pretty intensive ice storm extreme at benchmark on all phones about 4 times and once that's done and then going to switch to the even more demanding slingshot extreme and do that another few times so the first thing you probably notice is that samsung actually starts to creep up something is getting pretty hot pretty fast and this is the exynos based samsung by the way so in a way as well as just comparing the models of these phones this is part a comparison of the snapdragon chip on the oneplus versus the exynos on the galaxy vs the kirin on the hallway what is quite interesting is that as soon as we start switching to the more extreme slingshot benchmark oneplus overtakes samsung in terms of heat quite quickly you'll notice that especially towards the top right to the phone it is getting white-hot it is getting pretty much to 50-plus degrees celsius and on the other side huawei in this scenario has actually stayed pretty cool at its hottest point is actually at about 42 degrees so i actually just picked up each fern straight after doing this test and for oneplus the body and the screen were really really hot almost uncomfortable to hold that said the way the ball is curved so that you have these really narrow edges means that the edges don't retain as much heat so they actually feel much more manageable the samsung felt pretty much as hot but the heat was distributed all around the phone the back was hot the screen was hot the sides our heart just all round you can tell it's been working and then the hallway still hot by the way we're talking about a glass and metal sandwich that has been heated to over 40 degrees so still not exactly comfortable to hold but not as bad as the other two if you enjoy this video a sub would be massively appreciated and now that we've got the setup there's a few cool opportunities we could test the thermal performance of smart phones with and without cases we could test potentially smart phones to have much more advanced cooling solutions versus ones that don't how much difference does that make let me know if you'd like to see that my name is erin and this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
