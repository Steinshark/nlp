okay this phone the 1+8 was basically built with the purpose of beating the iphone 11 everything from the cameras to the pricing to the color choice makes it pretty clear what oneplus have their sights set on so let's find out if it does that i've just launched another video alongside this one which is the highest end one plus eight pro versus the best from samsung so after this video do check that one out too also that custom mr. who's the boss poster you can see behind me that's from displayed to sponsored this video but more on that later in terms of the media kit that i received with this won't recede it's more or less the same unboxing experience as for the oneplus 8 pro which i covered in the other video if you want to have a look but i will just reiterate this i love the retail packaging on these new oneplus phones if oneplus are going to raise the prices of their phones from mid-range to almost high-end it's at least good to see that they're presented accordingly the one plus eight is pretty much the most comfortable phone i've ever held the phone has the same curved back and soft touch matte finish as its pro counterpart but it's slimmer it has a smaller camera bump and is noticeably lighter that my friends is quite the combination it feels better than my samsung to holds better than the huawei it feels sure-enough better than the iphone 11 at that said the iphone 11 is hardly a bad feeling phone i like the matte rails all the way around the sides and it's palm friendly size it's almost completely usable with one hand which brings me to the only thing i would say about the 1+8 design it may be the slimmer and lighter phone from the company but it's still not small the display is tall enough that i can still barely reach halfway up with my thumb bunce that display holy moly the difference is just astronomical by every possible metric i could think of oneplus has the better panel it's larger six point five five inches versus six point one it uses a more low tech for deeper contrast than apple's lcd and it's much higher resolution you're looking at a full hd plus panel which gives it about 80% more pixels on its screen than the iphone but the gap gets bigger you've got one plus is slim border and tiny hole punch cutout which makes the iphone look a little bit like a toy in comparison and it's brighter a little brighter if you're looking head-on but because of our lcd screen quality tends to deteriorate from harsh viewing angles oneplus is much brighter when you're looking from anywhere but head on i really can't emphasize this enough from the front these phones quite literally look five years apart this is the high-end bmw 2 this phone's fiat 500 and add to that the 1+8 has a fluid ninety hertz refresh rate versus ethyl 60 so it's more responsive - it's not 120 hertz like the 1 + 8 pro but i think there is a bigger jump between 60 and 90 then there is between 90 and 120 oh yeah and also in the screen of the 1 plus you've got a fingerprint scanner with a scanning area wide enough that you can even miss it slightly and you'll still get in well with the iphone you'll be using secure 3d face and locking which to be fair is probably the most seamless option between the two one plus does her face scanning - but because it's just using a front camera not a proper 3d scanner it could potentially in theory be breached by someone if they really really want to get into your phone anyways well the iphones display doesn't exactly fill you with confidence you can't say this is not a seriously fast phone in terms of performance it's every bit as well spect as the thousand-dollar iphone 11 pro it sings along no matter the task whatever game whatever app you'll struggle to make the phone skip a beat mind you the same thing is true for oneplus it's using the latest snapdragon 865 chip ultra-fast ufs 3.0 storage and up to 12 gigs of ram the only thing it loses versus the 8 pro is that it has slightly older lpddr4 x rammed versus lpddr4 which consumes a little more power and isn't quite as fast between these two the oneplus and the iphone and due to benchmark will tell you one plus is about 20% faster if you wanted to put a number on it but i personally struggle to see a difference what i did notice though with the oneplus whether it's slightly more up to date spec sheet is a couple of more general performance improvements a better wi-fi range for example i could sit in my back garden watching videos on this and 5g for a lot of people this isn't exactly a big deal right now but in two years time when you're still using the same phone it might well be you might want to be able to pop a 5g sim card in it's tricky though because i think given the choice oneplus wouldn't have added 5g to this non-pro 1+8 because it's expensive it's a big part of the reason why this phone costs what it does the problem is that there's just not enough competition in the smartphone chip market if you want the best performance you need to use qualcomm snapdragon 865 chip but then with that qualcomm bundles a mandatory 5g modem as well as a result this phone is probably at least 50 dollars more expensive than one plus would have wanted it to be anyways i mentioned earlier that one plus is clearly targeting the iphone 11 with this and it's kind of obvious i mean everyone wants a piece of apples market share but another telltale sign is specifically what they've done with the cameras both phones have made the decision to have an ultra-wide or skip the telephoto camera which are this kind of upper mid-range slash high-end price is actually quite a rare move so both events have one main camera and one ultra wide and then oneplus also has a third macro camera which to be honest is a bit strange i've got nothing against macro cameras but in my eyes there's a clear hierarchy of importance for smartphone camera systems we've got a high-end main camera you need that then you want an ultra light and then if you've got resources let's have a telephoto and then if you still got resources to spare we'll have a macro camera but in terms of priority it's like you know somewhere down here see a telephoto would have been better but i guess a macro camera is just cheaper maybe the company's still trying to keep three cameras on the phone so it doesn't look like a downgrade from last year's 70 as it stands this macro camera even in ideal lighting conditions is just not very good and has some strange circular lens blur but as far as the two main lenses on the oneplus i'm pretty impressed i was kind of raising my eyebrows during my briefing of the phone because it's actually got the same camera hardware as last year's one plus 70 and very similar to the wampus seven before that and to be very clear i don't like that idea i would almost expect given that this is a new generation phone supposedly from a company as ambitious as oneplus that we'd be getting new generation camera hardware but i tried to go in removing those preconceptions and i actually came away quite impressed the company is making big strides in software processing for the most part i think one plus is daytime photos look crispier than apple's and i prefer the slight extra punch adds two scenes plus well neither has a zoom camera one pluses higher resolution main camera means that zoomed photos do look better they've also improved video on the 8 but here apple is still king the iphone can just draw out more dynamic range oneplus sort of crushes the shadows a little bit also like with the pro variant if you're trying to focus on fine objects wampler seems to just keep slipping in and out of focus well the iphone is bang on consistently apart from these camera nickels though a lot of this comparison is just a case of oneplus doing things better than apple even a lot of the things that have been lacking on paswan plus phones they've kind of been brought up to par here up to typing and interacting with this phone gives you lovely crispy vibration feedback they want to say as a dolby atmos dual speaker setup one on the front and one on the bottom it's very similar to the one on the iphone but what i will give to oneplus is that the vocals are even crisper the two main wom plus emissions here our lack of wireless charging and a lack of an official ip certification for water and dust resistance both of which the iphone has these might be big issues for you for me personally they're small especially against the backdrop of the battery situation while oneplus ships with the powerful 30 watt fast charger the iphone ships would have 5 watt charger that would have made 2011 proud and it takes like 3 hours to fully charge and one plus is battery capacity is also larger with 4300 milliamperes versus apple 3110 but iphones tend to be more efficient with the battery they do have so we'll find out in a detail battery comparison very soon if you could subscribe for that that would be amazing on balance then the only real case to be made for the iphone 11 / the oneplus is software this is an android versus ios situation so if things like facetime and airdrop and being able to make phone calls on your mac if these things are really important to you then you should think carefully about moving to android because you'll lose them but for every other user android users apple users who aren't to invest it and those poor souls still on a blackberry phone this is a one plus victory right out the box almost everything is the way i would want it on my phone it gets a lot of the big things right but also a lot of the small things you've got a slick clean user interface i swipe up anywhere on your screen to bring up your app drawer i swipe down for your quick toggles double tap to switch from back to front camera simple things and also hardware wise that fingerprint-resistant matte finish 128 gigabytes of storage on the base model and the fact that the phone comes pre fitted with a screen protector these are all great user friendly decisions i won't spoil it just yet but i am working on a video of my top current smartphones and this features pretty highly and speaking of things that feature highly displayed think posters for the modern era high end high resolution metal plates with whatever you want printed on them i've got a whole load of them here different styles different sizes some generic some customized and each one has what looks like a handwritten signature and a hologram tag to show authenticity and this is cool you can see i've currently got a future spacey type theme one going on there but you can change it it uses a magnetic mounting system so once you've set one up you can just chop and change it free well you might have noticed actually i changed it partway through filming this video and the benefit of it being metal is that it's not gonna rip it's not gonna crease and it's got this awesome matte lightly textured finish it doesn't look cheap at all the company plants a tree for every display sold and i've got a discount link so if you order one to two through it you get 27 percent off and if you order three or more 35% off so that's all in the description would be amazing if you could check them out but having said this is mr. hughes the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
