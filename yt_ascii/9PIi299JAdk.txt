hello everyone i'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early february and running through june tammy and i an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the us you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information i'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas i've been working on my forthcoming book out november 2024 we who wrestle with god i'm looking forward to this i'm thrilled to be able to do it again and i'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye in my eth year of being in the united states as an illegal i was awarded the order of the red banner the second highest decoration of the soviet union that had to be uh approved by the central committee of the party and you know with that came a monetary award of 10,000 not rubles but dollar so there was an intellectual uh discrepancy there i was being given an award of the in the currency of the country that we were trying to [music] destroy hello everyone i had the privilege today to speak with one jack barski guy about my age born in east germany raised in the depths of the communist catastrophe swallowed the propaganda as young man hookline and sinker and was recruited as while he was pursuing his degree in chemistry recruited by the kgb to act as a spy in the west and he recounted his tale in a book called deep undercover which was published in 2017 and shared all that with me today his double life in the us his eventual abandonment of the communist utopian intellectual project his conversion as it turns out by the as a consequence of the love of his infant daughter his work for the fbi and his current enterprise now serving as a mentor to the young people to young people who might be attracted say by the utopian schemes of the of the intellectual ideologues and so we walk through all of that and that's very interesting welcome aboard mr barski i think what came to my mind as the first mystery when i went through your book was the conditions of your upbringing now one of the things that's very mysterious thankfully to people in the west is how it was that young people in particular were enticed to swallow hook line and sinker the propaganda coming into eastern europe from russia especially because and and i don't know how much of this you knew when you were a child but especially when the m there was such a stark difference between the material conditions in the west and compared to the soviet union in eastern europe and there was some knowledge of that so why don't you start by telling everyone what you experienced as a child and how you saw the world you know up to the point where you entered say entered university first of all the the communism didn't originate in russia as you know it it it was a german invention kl marx right and lenon was the one who actually put this into practice so there there there was still communist thinking residual communist thinking in in in east germany and and and there were a lot of refugees when hitler took over they went went to the soviet union and then came back and sort of took over rather quickly so how did we buy what they were selling there was nothing else on the market there was no there was no free market of ideas it was a massive massive brainwashing from from kindergarten on and you know i tell people then if if you if everybody you know that family teachers friends of friends relatives tell you that the moon is made out of cheese that becomes like part of h you know part of the foundational knowledge of how the world operates there was no god there there was just you know it was just the the idea the romantic idea of communism be becoming the force that will free all the suppressed nations in the world and but by the way that is very easy easy to buy into and i was 100% by the time i left college i was still 100% a communist so so and and a lot of my generation too the what what the the communists in east germany did very well they focused on the next generation us in particular they focused on the ones that had uh really reasonably high level of intellect because we were going to be the leaders the the leaders of for the of the future and one more thing about the wealth of the west well we we we weren't allowed to travel to the west we sort of knew that you know they they had a higher standard of living but this was rationalized very quickly and easily because the you know the nato countries you know imperialist countries were stealing the wealth from the third world like the united states stole stole the bananas from guam mara and so on right okay so so let me let me ask you some more specific questions about that one of the things that you alluded to was that the idea that you were working for freedom of the oppressed was actually a powerful motivator and so i want to unpack that a little bit i mean it's obvious when we look at the world wherever we sit that some people are more favored than others along any dimension of comparison you can possibly imagine now marx made the economic comparison prim primary pointing out that well i suppose that the poor will be with us always so to speak but that and and and it is definitely the case that that difference in in economic security and opportunity exists and is somewhat painful to all observers i mean i suppose there are some successful people who pride themselves on the fact that they have plenty while others have none and are pleased at that status differential but my experience with decent prosperous people is that even and most particularly the decent prosperous people are still unhappy that there is poverty and suffering anywhere in the world that there is even relative privation and and i would say it's part of the moral striving that's part and parcel of the human psychological landscape to want to remediate that and so if the communists are offering some future vision where suffering is a thing of the past then in some ways they're capitalizing on that longing in the human soul for suffering as such to be dispensed with with and you know and so that makes it perfectly understandable the i've been writing about this a little bit the pathological part of it is that it seems to me and i i want to know what you think about this is that as soon as you make the assumption that anybody who's who is more talented or who owns more is more talented or owns more because that's and and that that can only occur as a consequence of injustice and oppression and exploitation then you're setting up a situation where anyone who has any success whatsoever can be hated and and and what would you say persecuted with a good conscience and so i'm wondering you you must have thought about this a fair bit how do you think it's possible for people to separate their moral impulse to aid the oppressed from their immoral impulse to damn the successful all right so you you raised a highly comp issue and i i can only address as as much as i have lived through it through the situation first of all i we i grew up in the country we were all equally poor u so i didn't really understand the concept of poverty as a young child and even even when i went to high school because they there there were no wealthy people around us and with regard to wealth of the west it was just a you know it wasn't tangible so there was there was nobody to hate actually at that point we started hating all of us when the war in vietnam got really bad i mean i would i would have signed up and and and fought on on behalf of the vietnamese but here's here's an interesting an interesting shift so i did really really well in high school and i did so well in in college that i received a national scholarship that was limited to 100 concurrent users holders in the country 100 i i i joined the elite i got it the the scholarship paid me as much as as my my salary when i was a an assistant professor i was a rich student and i was you know it's probably quite understandable that i be was really full of myself and then everybody admired me and so i became intellectually the kind of a person who will help all the people who need help the stupid people you know i would you know this is the condescending attitude that you know the the elite has a lot let's put it this way we have it in this country we have it in western europe you know if if we are up there like we look at down at the little people and said well they can't take care of themselves we you got to do it for them and then and it it it starts with goodwi and then very often degrades into not so good simply because the elite needs to stay where where it is to fulfill its mission there's a rationalization okay and we we live better and we have make more money and all this because we deserve it so so that's i i never had a chance to to hate the capitalist with the vengeance because i i did know him well enough it was more theoretical the exploitation of man well i think your comments on that intellectual presumption are extremely interesting mean i've been trying to work through that dynamic theoretically because there is an association between that intellectual pride and utopian presumption you know when you you just laid out a psychological dynamic you said you were young you were celebrated for your intellectual prowess and you can see that intellectual prowess is valuable personally and socially and so you can understand that it being valued is appropriate but then you pointed to the fact that if it's celebrated inappropriately it tends to produce a kind of intellectual pride and condescension and then that works in sync see it works oddly in sync with the utopian presumptions of communism communism is a very intellectual system and it was designed by someone who had very deep intellectual pretensions marks himself and it it's that that it's that unholy combination of intellectual pride and the proposition that you're acting in that pride on behalf of people who are too foolish or stupid or ignorant or blind or otherwise what in capable of taking care of themselves right and then you could say well you're doing that for all the good reasons but you pointed out right away that there was an element of overweening pride in that that was attractive to you because you were celebrated for your intellect when you were young absolutely and one one other thing if your frame of reference is mankind you you it's very difficult to to not be full of pride if if you get to a point where you realize that there's this big universe that was created by some power whatever you want to call it that then then that that arrogance shrinks very quickly so do you think that it's possible to not suffer from that arrogance especially if you're an intellectual or intelligent if you don't have a reference point outside yourself or outside or even outside of the of mankind as such because you can imag imagine someone trying to make a moral case that the appropriate level of of analysis for a properly morally oriented young person is the good of mankind as such but you could counter that by saying well look what the hell do you know when you're' and you know maybe you should take care of your own local concerns like someone who's properly humble instead of attributing to yourself the ability at such a young age to understand everything that needs to be understood about all the economic and social systems of the world and to bring about with your own efforts and to your own credit this hypothetical utopia h yes but here's the thing i want to just contribute this i'm not necessarily chiming in with what you just brought up when when you are as as well-meaning as you are to help the down trodden and the less gifted you you become a member of the elite and and some people some people will kiss up to you and then you rationalize i remember an c ceo of a company that i worked for he had a chauffer chering him all around all the time and and the rationalization was his time is too valuable that is why elite also needs to have private airplanes right because you know for for and and and this you you get used to this you get used to being adored and you know being celebrated and and it's it's fundamentally impossible to not become full of yourself that there i i bet you there are some people who who are humble by nature but the majority of us are not yeah okay so the pathway there is that as soon as you have pretensions to operating on behalf of something approximating universal salvation brought into being in consequence of your own intellectual efforts and your beliefs is that the probability that you're going to suffer from inflation of ego is virtually certain at that point i i am 100% certain of that it's not just because i went through that you know there's a a lot of my my colleagues and and other gifted people that you know joined the cause the party the government and and and in east germany the government the party was the elite and and as in in you know the way communism is constructed you know the working class is supposed to rule but the working class needs a spokes person or an organization that speaks on its behalf and those people weren't working class they they were the intellectual elite some of them were pretty dumb but a lot of them were at least clever right so so one of the things you're you're pointing to two things there too you're also making the case i would say that even in a society that purports to hope to eradicate the economic elite elites are likely to arise regardless and in the country that you grew up in in east germany the economic elites were rapidly replaced by the intellectually pretentious elites let's say and then that that's like a of the argument you're making but there's something else that's interesting there too because you opened up your argument by in two ways you pointed out that the soviet propaganda was the water communist propaganda was the water in which you swam when you were young and it was everywhere and that there was really no escaping it but then you made a secondary argument which was yeah but at the same time swallowing that propaganda and then operating successfully within in that system was something that appealed to your pride and so that you had a reason a personal reason for buying into it it reminds me know i've been thinking about the doctrines of power like the communist and the postmodern doctrines i've been thinking them in relationship to the story of cain and abel because in the story of cain and abel you have cain who's at least regards himself as downtrodden and unfairly oppressed by abel and by god he goes to complain to god and he attributes his failure to the injustice of the world and god says in response to him that his failure is actually at his feet and that the thing that's tempting and possessing him making him bitter and resentful sat on his door and tempted him but he invited it in right that's a crucial thing is that so there there's a there's a there's a what would you say there's a metaphorical equivalence there that i'm trying to tease out on the one hand you said you were fed a non-stop diet of propaganda and you know i think increasingly that's the case for young people in the west but on the other hand you said well that also redounded to your advantage right because it put you in a position of elite status and appealed to your pride and so would you say is it reasonable to say that it was the combination of those two things ab absolutely allow me to allow me to illustrate when when i was uh asked by the kgb after like' months of them checking me out they asked me so so are you going to join us and i was really torn because you know i knew i was going to have to do take some inordinate risk i knew i would have to say goodbye to my life that i was very comfortable with and and on and on and on i knew that i would have to stop playing basketball it was a passion of mine but the combination of knowing that i was going to be a hero for the cause and that i would be able to part partake of the wealth in the west okay i would be able to travel and i knew i would have a good life as a matter of fact they sold me this way said well you going to live in you're going to live in big house and drive you know f fancy cars my god that combination would that actually made me say yes okay okay so now you're bringing an additional element into the equation so you know i was just rereading gir's faou the other day and fa is intellectually pretentious and also and and sick of life and mephesto the bargain mephesto offers him is a combination of worldly pleasure and intellectual dominance right and so that's why he makes a deal with the devil so to speak and so it it's interesting that you also bring up the fact that you were being offered the the fruit that was forbidden under communism which was that pathway to an elevated an elevated what would you say material life in the west and that and and okay so when so that this this speaks to your you being recruited as university student okay so you're swimming in propag may i may i interrupt you i want to take it one one step further because it gets bizarre i in in my eth year of being in the united states as an illegal i was awarded the order of the red banner the second highest declaration of the soviet union that had to be uh approved by the central commit of the party and you know with that came a monetary award of 10,000 not rubles but dollars so there was an intellectual uh discrepancy there i was being given an award of the in the currency of the country that we were trying to destroy so so the the the entire kgb was sort of uh infused with with that dichotomy well i wanted to ask you about moral conundrums but but let's walk through your recruitment okay so you're a young guy you're smart now you're actually being an offered a pretty interesting combination of adventures a so you you get the material luxury and the excitement of traveling to the west you get the excitement of of acting as a double agent you you're you're you're you can tell yourself and you're being told that you're acting only on behalf of the world's oppressed right and it and you get to join the elite on the intellectual side right that's a pretty headyy offer you know one of the things i do think about in relationship to what young people are being offered in the west is and this is something the radical leftists are really good at is that they have this vision of adventure as one of their offerings you know the the conservatives tend to push back against the utopian presumptions of the left but they don't offer they don't offer as well-developed a vision of let's say romantic adventure and so i think they let the young people languish well you know you're you're making the case that you were being offered something that was pretty heady right i mean you you got to leave your country you got to be an adventurer you got to work for the poor at least you got to tell yourself that and that all redounded to your intellectual advantage and to your status when you were let let's walk through this stages of your recruitment when you were in college and university and i'm also interested were you racked with moral conundrums while you were making the decision to work for the kgb you know you you just told me what they put on offer now had you bought the propagandistic line completely there wouldn't have been any moral conundrum because of course you would have been working for nothing but the good but you already told me that you i don't know if you became aware of this later or at the time that your motives were contaminated by your own pride and also by your own say consumeristic desir so what did you have to wrestle with morally when you were being recruited nothing and i tell you the had i had a girlfriend a steady girlfriend or a wife at the time that would have been that would have been something to really wrestle with i did not wrestle with uh lying to my mother because my mother was a very domineering disciplinarian and i did not grow grow up in a loving family the words the german words i never heard as a child spoken at one adult to another or one adult to me so it was all very tough discipline so i had i had no emotional uh tie to my mother and that would have been the only moral qu i would have stepped into everything where just friendships and relationships so and and that was that was easy to to deal with okay so why why was that easy to deal with why were you willing was the offer that was on at hand clearly attractive enough so that the price you paid in terms of friendships and so forth leaving your your interest in basketball that all ped in comparison to this potential adventure well it didn't pale but i you know when we're talking about a moral quander i didn't betray anybody i mean they had had they known where i'm going they would have cheered me on so i i i i betrayed somebody down the road but at that point that came not into play okay so tell tell me what did you study when you were in university and and i believe it was in university when you joined you decided to join the communist party and it was partly because you also knew at that time like everyone knew that if you didn't become a member of the communist party your career ambitions were going to be severely truncated so walk us through that and then also through your training not severely truncated but limited and i and i i did join the party because that you know that that was like the right thing to do you know pretty much all the smart ambitious individuals join the party by the way the party at university wasn't as dumb as you know the front page of the communist party newspaper you know we we were pretty open with one another and there were people complaining about that our leaders really weren't weren't the right leaders so so there was some openness and some camaraderie that wasn't so bad and there was some tolerance of things that were forbidden such as listening to western radio stations so the party was not a bad thing and but the funny thing is you know i studied chemistry but here's another piece of irony we had one course in in in philosophy it was called scientific marxism leninism and so the thing is we bought into this idea that marxism leninism was a science just like on on par with physics because mark discovered the the the laws that govern the evolution of human society and we were just like helping out to to bring about the end state which is you know the communist paradise on on earth so you know this was this was all very consistent and i had no reason to question because again because of the elite status i had why would i why would i want to just like question the system that did that really treated me very well whether you're feeling str ed anxious or simply seeking a moment of peace and tranquility the hallow app has something for you hallow

the party when you were in college and you were studying sciences and you you accepted the rationale that marxism was a scientific discipline and that it its outcome in some ways was not only desirable but inevitable you were speeding that along you had your moral rationals for that lots of people believed that that was the case and certainly everyone almost everyone at least made that claim in public how did it come that you started to work specifically for the kgb how did they find their potential partners and allies in in eastern germany i i can't i for the life of me i cannot trace back who actually suggested to the kgb or what suggested to the kgb to get in touch with me my guess is that they had access to the files that this kept on every adult in the country and and and if they and and they did the same thing that the cia has been doing for a long time they recruited students at you know and and you know in that were at universities the quality universities so you know you this a targeted search and they come they come up to my record and say wow you know not only is he academically outstanding he also is a part party member he plays basketball and he's a student leader who who leads the the the the the groups of students and playing the guitar so there was there was something there said we got to take a look at this guy and so one day they knocked on the door you could not reply by the way to to you wouldn't i wouldn't even know where where the kgb was situated there was no phone number there was no address so they they they see they they sought out who they would want to talk to and one day that happened that somebody came to visit me in a dorm room i don't want to make the story too long it was a german and i thought it was stazi but it was not because you know after some some talk some he asked me just like one question whether i i would be would imagine could im imagine that one day after i graduate i would work for the government and i and i i read between the lines and i gave him the answer he was looking for i said yeah absolutely but not as a chemist so so so then he invited me to have lunch or you know that's a big meal in germany at the number one restaurant in town and as i'm as i'm i see him sitting there i walk into the restaurant there's another a person at the table and i was a little bit hesitant but he came my first contact came up to me led me to the table and he said oh by the way i'm i would like to introduce herman we are cooperating with our soviet comrades and then he said goodbye and that's how i landed with the kgb because herman was a russian so do you want to tell everybody who's watching and listening the difference between and the similarities between the stasi and the kgb and also why you ended up working specifically for the kgb rather than the stasy well i i think the kgb got first dibs on on candidates that they really wanted kgb and stazi were like big brother and little brother they operated the same way the ktb was more radical with regard to how they dealt with in dissidents i mean you know the gulags there were millions in gulags there were thousands and maybe a couple hundred thousand dissidents and eam in jails but it it wasn't quite as oppressive and and obviously the kgb was much much much bigger in terms of numbers raw numbers the stazi was pretty big but you know as far as when when you when you take into consideration how many people were full-time employees and how many people actually cooperated and and you you're familiar with the lives of other of that movie yes you know where where where you know family members spied them on other family members it was a rotten system it was a rotten society and i never had a hint it didn't happen in my family and i never had a friend who would talk about something like this so i had no reason to reason to question that h well i was actually curious about that because i was wondering we know now that about one in three people in east germany were informing for the stazi and they were often informing on family members and friends and my sense is i can't see how that could possibly be the case without corrupting the culture to a massive degree you mentioned earlier that you had a rather cold relationship with your mother and so i was wondering you know to what degree were family relationships in east germany in general fragmented how much of that had to do with the culture of informing and did and were you unaware of the fact that this culture of informing was so deep and had had a corrupting influence on the culture at large i i was totally unaware i lived in a bubble how do you think it was that that you were that you had been protected from that well i wasn't the only one my best friend uh who who i still have a relationship with he he lived in the same bubble somehow see but i now now something comes to mind we had amongst the student population there were about 80 of us we had a couple of guys that didn't fit in and they weren't they weren't academically that great but they were like they were just like a pain in the neck and and and they were eventually eliminated and nobody would have had a problem reporting on those because they you know they were in the way and they could become animated right so so there's a rationalization going on so there was some i i actually had some exposure to particularly the fate of this one fellow who who was expelled from university but i tell you the the opposite i had a roommate a dorm roommate who was one of the few people that openly confessed that he was a believing catholic and he was a good student and when it when the and i was the leader of the communist the section of the communist party for the section chemistry and when it came to a point where the decision was made who would go on for a doctorate i thought he was a good guy he was a smart guy and asked him one question i said if if you had to take up arms to to defend the eas german democratic republic would you do it and he said yes he has a doctorate so so there were some things you know that that you could move in the right direction you had to be in the right environment and and university was not as stiff and not as uh you know dogmatic with regard to communism so once you had this interview at the cafe and you how first of all h h what was offered to you at the cafe and then how did you start working with the kgb oh no no no oh sorry nothing was offered to me other than let's let's meet so and then i would i meet i would meet herman for like at least 6 months just in his vehicle and we would just talk a little bit and and he you know he he opened the the curtain a little wider a little wider and i understand that now that i have some you know in hindsight he would go back after a meeting and he would take notes because there there was a k kgb archist who saw the files on me there were like several binders big binders so so after six months he must have decided that i was worth pursuing further and so we then met in an apartment okay and that's where he gave me some western literature to to read and that's where we talked a little a little more about about what it would be like to go to west germany as an illegal oh just one thing that that was very important for him to find out and and my my situation in life really made that possible i he became an arsat's father he was about about 10 years older than me and my dad was was a a weak link you know he was do he was six years younger than my mother she was the domineering the smart one and you know he couldn't play with me he had polio and and he we never had a father-son talk and eventually he he got out of that marriage and and disappeared for my life so so i was grateful that i could talk to an older person an older man and i shared everything with them i still remember you know what i said i'm so shy amongst the girls and you know i don't know i just can't talk to the girls he said you keep one thing in mind i still remember that they are looking for men the same way you're looking for a woman it didn't help much at the time but but but you know we had this relationship and eventually he got to a point after' months that he had discussed uh interviewed me enough and studied me enough that he suggested to headquarters to make me an offer that's when it happened it took' months and one other thing you being a psychologist you'd be surprised that i never met a psychologist or somebody who studied people who work for the kgb the only thing with regard to people skills and understanding people that was handed to me one day was the the book by dale carnegie how to make friends and influence people it's ironic isn't it yeah yeah that's for sure yeah so do you do you think that your relationship with him to what degree was your relationship with him a genuine relationship of caring and mentorship yes it was absolutely if i met only one individual that i interacted with in the kgb who i absolutely didn't like he was was an agent in moscow and he became my liaison for a for a while if if that person was herman or you know was played the role of herman i may have thought about the whole situation twice this guy was a really wonderful guy were you excited about the fact that you were having these clandestine meetings in first of all a car and why in a car and then later in the in the apartment like was that part of the adventure and intrigue that was an attractive element of of what was unfolding no that part wasn't that exciting no you know what what uh what was really good for me that i that i had a secret so i i had a i was even elevated higher than everybody else knew so so the pride increases right but but the what he gave it herman gave me some things to do and they were not necessarily things that i comfortably did such as you know reaching ringing a doorbell and under some pretense talked with the person who answers the bell to find out something about a relative of their in in west germany that was hard but my ambition didn't allow me to fail i'm i pulled it off so but that that was unpleasant it it became much more interesting the first time i uh had the ability to go to west berlin and look around you know this is that so you know the germans have something in their dna it's called wo the the the desire to travel and i that that was a big desire i wanted to see you know rome and paris i had read about these cities and you know west berlin that was my first adventure and then my second adventure was in canada believe it or not it was a test test trip to where i spend a lot of time in montreal all right so you what happened in at' months what kind of offer were you made and how did that tr how was that transformed into this trip to west berlin yeah so that was very interesting herman sent me to berlin he didn't tell me but by the way the kgb almost never gave me any background why they make a decision this that or the other there was nothing there was no schedule no planning nothing they shared with me it was ad hoc they probably knew what they were doing i didn't so he sent me to berlin for some additional training so that's when i had my first clandestine meeting when you when you go that was a little bit of an adventure when when you go to a certain spot meet somebody who you don't know you don't know what they look like and you have you you exchange keywords so you know you're talking to the right person and so he gave me some things to do he gave me western mag west german magazines to read in the the day before my departure back to where i studied he took me to the soviet headquarters and soviet army headquarters in in east berlin and which was also the kgb headquarters and he took me to an office and there was this this small man sitting behind the desk very unimpressive but the moment he opened his mouth and he spoke only russian there was a phenomenal amount of psych psychological energy coming at me you know he did a little bit of small talk about you know how we need to do our best to defeat the evil capitalists and nazis and so so forth and and then he'0 out of out of the blue asked me the question so are you in or not i didn't expect that and i think this was this was deliberately arranged that way so i said well i i don't know if i qualify and you know i don't have any training i i didn't want to give an answer i wasn't ready i hadn't thought about it and and he said you qualify and we will train you but there's one thing there's one requirement that we only work with people who can make big decisions very quickly you have until tomorrow noon to give me an answer uhhuh uhhuh that that that made that made for interesting sleepless night right well that's also an appeal to pride because he's giving you the opportunity to demonstrate that you're one of those decisive people people so yeah the good good point but but you know decision or not i was an academic and and i was was learned i learned how to operate with logic and i tried the logical arguments of this and that and and and it came out 50/50 so so this is when when when it started that in in my my life my subconscious my gut made the decision and i and i said yeah the there was no forcing argument that says i got to go because there was so so much good development ahead of me in staying in east germany unfortunately i would have wound up in the government and i would would have eventually become a miserable old communist so so i'm very glad i made that decision and and that that's when i then i became officially not an employee but a sort of a a cooperating agent so to speak because the employees had to have soviet citizenship

board did you go to west berlin and what did they have you do there apart from these clandestine meetings and what did you think when you got to west berlin yeah let me tell you something first of all i when i thought i was in so you know i packed my bags and w up in in in berlin i wasn't in yet they were still testing me so so i meet my new handler a different guy and i i'm in his car and and i expected that i'm going to have a really really nice apartment because of was the kgb you know you know i i had lived in a dorm for for for the previous seven years and and he we we sit down and nikolai was his name he he turned to me he says i already have a task for you i said what really and then he said you got to find a place to live that is in a place where there was a shortage of of living space and all living space was controlled by the government there was an impossible task all right so that was a test i didn't know it was a test but but you know i i responded the right way i i did i didn't make a face i didn't i didn't make the argument that this is impossible i just went about and found something i found the worst place i've ever lived in is a like a one room in a concrete structure that had running cold water a chair and a bed and i didn't i didn't tell this guy and i think i think that impressed him greatly so if i fa this i'm out at that point when if you're out your career is over too i couldn't have gone back to the university so i had no idea that i was an indent species and and west berlin was the final test and so the they had me go there twice with an easterman passport and the first time they just said you just walk around you know have a beer take this you know look at the stores like just get get a feel for the place and so as i as i show up and you know i i emerg from the subway and i look around and the first impression was oh i i tell people nowadays that to to make it to make it clear what the difference was between the east and the west the west was a movie that was made in color in the east it was all black and white because almost our buildings were brown or gray it was ugly and there were a couple of nice buildings but generally it was ugly so that was very interesting and i i and i looked at through the display windows of the department stores a the beer was better the sausage was better but you know this all yeah on the one hand you rationalize it away on the other hand it says hey that's going to be good life right so i the second visit i had to pass yet another test i had to ring the doorbell in an apart apartment building and make friends out of the people that that answered the the door and i did good and the reason i knew for sure that was another test and that if i failed that test i would have my career would have been at an end before it started i met accidentally a classmate of mine from high school who was going to be an illegal for the stazi and he had to pass the same test and he pooped in his pant and he came back and told him i can't do this and guess what he had a degree in engineering he never worked as an engineer for the rest of his life so endangered species indeed i had no idea more more endanger than the entire time i i operated in the us so why do you think you were wise or canny enough to accept the task of finding an apartment under impossible circumstances and then to accept the apartment you did accept without complaint and with good grace okay triple answer first of all failure was not an option because of the way my my mother raised me you know i would come home with a b and i would tell her there was was the best grade in the entire class she would answer well did they have a's available failure was not an option number one number two it was instinct you know i i found out many years later when i when i when i came to when i uh was confronted with that concept i'm i'm i'm wired to be very stoic so i i i didn't show any emotions when he made made that ridiculous order so so to speak and thirdly i accepted this because i was used to having lived in miserable conditions not not too good you know the the college dorms were pretty crummy it was no privacy and and so it it was worse than the dorm but it wasn't something i couldn't handle okay so so and and you know and again this this was an authority figure even though i i i was anti-authoritarian but i had learned to play with the authority or else because i one at one time when my anti-authoritarian self ran away with myself with me in high school i got very close to being kicked out of high school severe reprimand in front of the student body and i realized you got to play ball and you keep your feelings to yourself right okay okay so how long after that did you end up in montreal and how did you establish yourself in north america and oh yeah that and also i'm curious about you know you you mentioned that you did observe that life in west berlin was in color and of a higher quality but did you depend on that rationalization that all that had been accomplished through oppression and theft essentially or did you just how did you deal with that the the rationalization became part of the my you know what i call foundational knowledge about the world you know i didn't think about this repeatedly i took it in and and i owned it okay so there was no so with regard to the other thing the other question you know i was supposed to go to west germany makes sense right there no culture differences no language differences and so forth but i also was required to study another language and they told me everybody has to and i i picked english and i was really good at it and so one day i had a visitor from from moscow at this point i had an apartment already but when i got a a key to to the apartment i was actually officially in finally it took about six months so so and and he he just wanted to know how i'm doing with english and i showed him a book on a shelf i said i can't read that without the help of a dictionary and then light bulb went on and within a week i had a tape recorder and i was asked to say something in english whatever and once they had to tape within a week later i was on a plane to moscow where i was interviewed by a college professor who taught english or russian and an american citizen who had wound up she fell in love with the russian somehow and wound up living in moscow and they they were asked specifically is he good enough can we teach him english so well that he can pretend to have been born in the united states the russians said the russians said no the americans said yeah i can teach him you know american optimism and so i spent two years in moscow where i worked with her and did a lot of phonetic exercises i worked like a maniac and point you're remarkably accent free i i hear my own accent when i listen to listen to tapes but certainly i i don't talk like arnold schwarzer right right right so you know i had this rare talent to acquire another language without a strong accent in my adulthood okay so so and it at one point it was determined that i was ready to go and that's when they sent me to canada to do two things you know just figure out what it's like to live in the united states we thought you know the canada was like a a mini version of the us not quite true but they didn't know they didn't know any better and and i was supposed to get a a birth certificate of an individual of a young man who passed away at an early age in the us and that was an interesting situation you know i i can i can talk all day and i want to be careful not to go too far because i want to make sure that we cover all the topics that uh that are important to you so bottom line is i failed to get that birth certificate and interestingly enough you know he is a he is a dead person who is asking through the mail to get his birth certificate i should have been captured right then and there got lucky and so after close to a year a a diplomat a kgb diplomat in in in washington dc found the burth at no the grave stone of jack barski who died at an early age at the age of 11 and he was able to procure the birth certificate and at that point i was ready to go and that was in 1978 1978 okay so i was in montreal not long after that i moved there in 198 84 it was a wonderful place to live i thought i really enjoyed montreal what was it like for you in canada there in montreal and how did you set up your your north american life you got your id obviously that was necessary and what did the kgb have have you do at this point i mean they were setting you up so you had a life in north america and that was working successfully well that that that you know just to answer the what it was like in in canada you know i mostly i was a tourist and i had a bar that i visited a lot so i could talk with people and i made some friends a couple of friends i had a a french canadian girlfriend and one thing i i got to tell you i was at the forum when gila flur broke the record of most goal scored in a in a home game in at the forum in one season and and the forum broke out and spontaneous applause there was like 15 minutes there was no game anymore so that was great and especially since i had learn learned to appreciate ice hockey while i lived in moscow but anyway uh i i came to the united states in in the fall of 78 and my primary task was to take that birth certificate that i had to par and parley that into bonafide american documentation primarily a driver's license and a social security card so you could live and work like a born american i had a backstory that was y long that had me live on a farm for a long time and then eventually come to new york it took close to a year for me to get these documents because the instructions that i got from the kgb did not work they didn't have a clue how to do this but you know the the reason that they picked somebody like me i you know i was creative i was able to improvise don't want to get too much into details because it gets too long and so then and then since i couldn't take my resume with me and i and my backstory had me like grow up you know work on a farm for many years the best job i could find was bike messenger i spent four years riding a bike and carrying packages in in manhattan well that must have been exciting you know it wasn't that bad yeah yeah yeah well by biking in manhattan that's no that's no trivial operation i'm sure you got to know the city real well i got to know the city like the palm of my hand and that that's i also became a street urchin you know i you know i knocked the ice cream cones out of pedestrians that were in my way and and you know i interacted with a lot of like very ordinary americans that gave me an opportunity to to actually become an american because theoretically learning the language and talking to somebody who had lived in the united states doesn't make you an american you have to watch them you have to you know what they talk about you what's important and and and facial expressions uh and you know body language and all that without that messenger job i probably would have been busted too it was i was lucky it was not by it was by accident and and and interestingly enough i made enough money because i was not an employee i didn't get minimum wage as a bike messenger i got got commission and i had i made enough money to go get an apartment and you know hang out with people and so forth and and then without getting into detail i was supposed to get a passport and then go back to europe and create establish a company and the k b was going to she knew how they knew how to do this move money into that company so that within 2 three years i would go back to the united states with a few million dollars and repatriate that money and immediately become upper middle class and and then become a really really dangerous agent okay so what were they that well so there's a lot of investment of time that you're putting into this i mean obviously and and the kgb is actually showing possibly a certain degree of patience what exactly were they setting you up to accomplish you said they were going to put you in an upper middle class position now that you' established yourself as american what were they hoping that you could do for the for the soviet union and they told me that my fin finally my my task was to operate in the realm of foreign policy getting to know people who make foreign policy or at least influence foreign polic policy that was only the partial truth i found out much later there was because there were the heads of the illegals two of them after the kgb was disbanded gave interviews and the number one value that the kgb ascribed to my being in the us was my being in the us and i tell you why that makes sense towards the end of uh the cold war there there was this this battle between the cia and the agb and it was constantly and and all the agents were except for us the illegals were diplomats so and diplomats were expelled and then there was retaliation and they were worried that at one point diplomatic relations would be completely interrupted and the only ones left behind enemy lines would have been us illegals and guess what who would have run aldri jes and and um forgot his first name hansen the the most dangerous molds in the history of the united states and the most successful spies for the for the kgb so they never told me any of that but so i knew it was like i was going to you know get to know member of conservative members of the conservative think tanks and you know the trilateral commission i don't know what they what why they were so obsessed with the trial commission and and they were very much obsessed with vness binski and the colombia institute for foreign relations or whatever this called as a bike messenger and student and junior computer programmer i had no i had no ability to befriend people like that but i would have had that ability if i had been able to rise into the upper middle class very quickly right and so they were willing to spend the time and put in the energy to give you that very well-developed backstory in the hope that you would be positioned maybe in a decade or something it was long-term game yeah they they were not impatient they actually were very very appreciative of the fact that i improvised a lot and and overcame obstacles and you know you don't get the order of the red banner if you weren't doing really well right right so they okay so they were regarding all your maneuvering and your problem solving in north america as exactly what you should be doing now you said thank god that those plans didn't materialize now so so how did your career develop after that and why and why are you pleased that it that the goal that was in mind for you didn't make itself manifest because because i'm able to talk to one dr jordan peterson today my life my life changed so radically for the best god forbid i'm i'm a successful kgb ag and the wall comes down i'm say what's going on here and then the soviet union falls apart now i'm stuck i i would not have notified the fbi of my existence i would have gone back to russia and i would now live a very miserable life in russia because i never served russia i served not even the soviet union i served the communist cause so and you know and i learned the truth and as i say the truth shall set you free i'm i'm a free sii citizen to the extent you still have all the freedoms that we supposed to have right right okay so so let's let's now let's jump ahead now you start working as a coder if i remember correctly yes sir i did okay and at some point you come to the attention of the fbi how does that how do you start that new new career and and how do you come to the attention of the fbi well i came to the attention of the fbi because of a betrayal and this is an another situation where i would if the person was still alive i would thank him on my knees for his betrayal it's he was an archist by his the name of vasil moken he was an archist in in the kgb and he had access to all the records because he managed the records and he started reading those records and he found out like what an evil organization the kgb was so he he developed a severe hatred of the soviet system and the kgb and he figured out the only way to do damage is to copy some information and over many years he took handwritten small pieces of paper with handwritten notes on them in his underwear and in his shoes and his socks and then transcribed them and and piled it all up in buried the material in the datra and in 1992 he wound up in estonia at at one of the british embassy at the british embassy and told mi6 what he had and they were able to dig dig this stuff up and took it to england and eventually shared some of the information it took a while with with the fbi and amongst that enormous amount of data there was a couple of sentences there's a fellow named jack barski who is an illegal kgb undercover agent he lives in the northeast of the united states and it didn't take the fbi very long to find me because you know they looked at social security data and there was only one jack barsky they found who got his social security card at the age of like 35 or something right okay so you when did you what year did you move to manhattan i arrived in new york in 78 and i was in manhattan in 78 i stayed one year in a hotel okay so you were you were you were successfully undercover for at least 15 years and so you spent a bunch of oh successfully undercover not detected was 19 years in the service in the service of the kgb only 10 years i resigned after for 10 years oh okay so how okay so so how did the resignation come about and why so and you will you will understand that i i i i'm given to understand that you have a great relationship with your daughter so this is what happened i had a girlfriend in the us who i married without getting again too much into detail and she decided to become pregnant and and i watched this little girl grow up and when she turned' months i knew i was in love with this girl and it was i i i was so much in love with her that i could not imagine leaving her and i i tell people this this is when when the arrogant uh adventurer joined the human race oh yeah because because this this was a an attack of unconditional love and at at that time the kgb got spooked and they thought i was about to be arrested by by the fbi and they they that we had an emergency procedure there was we both know knew what to do if there's an emergency and they activated that procedure with a with a signal on on a at a signal spot and and i and and i walk by that spot every day and all of a sudden one day i see this red dot and that said danger get out of here immediately and the i'm sorry for that bad word but the the only i have to say it because this what popped into my head oh what do i do now i want to take care i had no idea how to how to take care of this child and and i knew that if i leave her she would grow up and in poverty because her mother had only four years of schooling okay and so i went back and forth back and forth i uh i played for a time but it got to a point where they were checking on me say what's going on and they found me and there's a a man came up to me i was waiting for a subway train and he sidled up to me and he whispered with a clear russian accent he said you got to come home or else you're dead dead now the point was that they knew that i knew that they knew because before that they could i could have been in a hospital my my radio could have been broken a lot of things could have been happening to me and i was not able to comply well so now i had to make a decision the the do you know what a dead drw operation is no it's it's an operation where you hand over not information but something that has weight and dimensions such as a passport money and so forth okay and you put it in you put it in a container and you drop it someplace where somebody else would pick it up so they through a shortwave radio they have told me to go to a dent drop operation this one day and at that point i went because i knew there would be money and a passport so i at at minimum i would just pocket the money right i had not made a decision and it was really interesting because when i went the dead drop operation has couple of signals involved so the first signal is the person who deposits the container says i go and get it okay i put it there so i saw the signal and i went to the place and that place was impossible to to miss because i had found it myself it was a tree with a hollow bottom and there was no container there was no crushed oil can and i just i did a double take i walked around walked around wasn't there i walk out of that out of the park and my subconscious again made a decision and it said i'm staying that was that was an irrational decision because everything i knew at the time that was good for me was over over there in the east i would have gone back as a conquering hero i i was married in germany too and and even if i manage to stay and the fbi doesn't arrest me if they do arrest me i'm no good for this child either so i should have rationalized and i got to go i have no choice my subconscious overrode any of that logical thinking and it obviously it was a tremendous risk but i i had no choice it was it's the power of unconditional love yeah well that's that's a very interesting issue so it sounds to me and correct me if i'm wrong that what you're relating is that the love that you developed for your daughter so i would i i would hazard to guess that that was perhaps the first genuine love that you had in your life and that that was enough to break the grip of your intellectual hubris it's something like that is that correct 100% correct because there was a there was a point when this girl she was about 5 years old and she she was she couldn't she wasn't admitted to kindergarten because she was behind in her ability to speak and i told my i told my colleagues i said i think my daughter's a little dummy but i love her anyway so so intellect to me was not important anymore so you're right about that and uh yeah the the other times i was in love there was it was passion and there was obviously sex involved there's no sex involved and unconditional means you can't get anything back but a smile so how did you actually manage to get out i mean that must have been with its i mean i can't i can't understand why they let you out and then well and then let's let's discuss how you ended up working for the fbi so yeah they uh they hired themselves a brilliant guy with a with a brilliant subconscious and it popped into my head and said oh wait a minute i just tell him i can't come because i have hiv aids and since i knew to be have been brutally honest with everything and since they didn't know that i had a child i was certain of that they couldn't think of a reason why i was lying to them it worked okay okay and so how do you how did you come to the eventual attention of the fbi and what did it mean that you worked for them okay so you know first of all i i spent another nine years working on my version of the american dream you know i moved to the suburbs we had another child i moved to another house and eventually wound up in a in a mcmansion so yeah i had checked out of out of the political thinking philosophical thinking i was more into consumerism and and doing good things for the family and that was disrupted when one day an fbi agent showed up and again i'm i'm shortening this and told told him you know fbi we want to have a chat with you i had forgotten at that point i had put this in the way back in in memory never to be accessed again that i once was an agent h so that no that came right back bam so you had fall right into life as an american at that point and to this new identity oh yeah absolutely yeah and i knew i would never go see germany again i would never apply for a passport again i would i didn't want to risk that so i would you know live a decent life have a great great career i was making more and more money and and retire play golf right so you joined the upper middle class in any case yes i did and so the fbi how did the fbi find you and then what did what did they want from you well what they wanted from me it wasn't quite clear initially but they they knew that they couldn't wait a minute did they know that i was already declared de i can't but i in in our first interview i told them that i don't exist in in in germany anymore so they couldn't turn me okay that would have been a great but and they also no they now i remember they found out after observing me for two years that i wasn't active anymore so i was not i was not a target to be turned but i was a target to be debriefed in the greatest of detail we i spent hours and hours talking with the the agent who interviewed me about every single detail in my life and apparently that is very useful because even you know the successors of the of the kgb you know who who were they trained by kgb agent you know there's a dna that organizational dna that's handed down it was the information that i gave them was considered very very useful and one other thing at the time when they caught up with me hansen and ames were still operational no they had been caught i'm sorry but there were concerns that there were other molds and that i might be running one of them so sometimes finding out a negative is is actually a really good thing the fact of the ma fact of the matter the fbi leadership was so impressed with what the the the the fbi team did that my the the lead agent got a commendation by the fb by the head of the fbi so it is what it is you know i i'm not making that up you ask them they will tell you it was that was really good information that i was able to give them so what do you think it was that you provided to them that they found so useful what what what makes foreign illegal what kinds of people the uh the the kgb was recruiting turns out that cia is recruiting the same type of people right right well that makes sense i i have i have friends in the cia and and it's almost identical you know there's a list of character traits that you know things that you're born with rather than you acquire not skills yeah that the kgb was looking for and i shared that list with a with a retired cia agent and he said well that's that we had the same list but you know this confirmation is is important for for counter intelligence and to what to what extent you know that that is specifically useful you know as far as the psychology is concerned i don't know that i don't i don't i i don't know the details i was also given a a a test by two eminent psychologists in on a contract with the fbi they gave me two two days of test and i what the lady who gave me the war shock test claim to fame was that she also analyzed the unibomber and when she was done she said when she was done she said i have never interviewed somebody who had that many stories to tell about these damn ink blots right so it's creativity right i i had to be creative to to to be successful when you when you look back over your career i've got two questions for you i want to know when you look a back over your the course of your life what do you regret and what are you thankful for and i'm also interested now you you had immersed yourself in this value and belief system that characterized communism you obviously abandoned your allegiance to that in favor of at least in part in favor of the relationship with your daughter but you also make illusions in your book to starting to study other philosophical matters and religious matters and so first question is what when you look back on your life and your career how do you evaluate what you did and where you ended up ethically and morally and second how did you when you abandoned your allegiance to the utopian vision of the communists and you started inquiring philosophically and theologically into other domains what did you conclude no good very good question the the one thing i regret is that uh the woman i loved in germany when i when when i decided not to go back to my german family it was because of the love for a child but i abandoned that woman and i loved her and i broke my promise that that i that can't be undone and and that's really what the most regret i have i don't regret anything that i did as a as an illegal agent simply because i was never told whether let's say some of the people that i pointed to for possible recruits were recruited what happened to them i have i have no knowledge of what i should regret if there was was something else so what there's no specific guilts that you carry for the things that you because partly because you don't know what the consequences of the more yes they they they ne they never once congrat ulated me on a on a tip that i gave them i never got any feedback period okay that that that's one of the weaknesses of the kgb by the way because if you have to make uh decisions on on your own all the time and you don't have a proper frame of reference you wind up making bad decisions right right right without the broad yeah well that's the problem with not informing people right is you have no context to guide you when you're making decisions yeah and and and that secrecy was rooted in in in the revolutionary background of the of the kgb you know the cell structure you know you okay so what i'm grateful for first of all i'm grateful for living in the greatest country that ever existed on this earth particularly the country as it was constructed by the by the founders simply because i i i'm a student of history and i am convinced that one one of the one of the biggest flaws that that left-wing thinking has is the idea that man is fundamentally good and all we have to do is and that communism was the same thing we have to take the shackles away from them it's the circumstances and i know for a fact when you look at history and and you just there's so much anecdotal evidence that man we all have the seed of evil in us many of us and the majority of us deal with it very well but it turns out in history the the the ruling people were mostly evil you know and so and so the constitution is constructed in such a way to to manage that evil not eradicated it manage it by you know the separation of powers and and the whole idea that all men created are created evil and have these inali inable rights that appeals to to me to to my appeals to my anti authorism and and my absolute discust with collectivism we are not getting the rights from the buff we are not getting the rights from from the law the the law actually can take rights away from us some of them are necessary to be taken away such as you know you know to get the funds to to defend the country and so forth but most the laws that we have in this country are taking rights away from us so it is what it is but how did you come to the conclusion or what convinced you of the validity and utility of the doctrine of inalienable rights is that certainly that's certainly not a hypothesis associated with communist utopianism for example wh why did you come to that conclusion that's that's a good leading question be because i became a christian and the it was a pretty slow progress i became a deist first because i after i started thinking about and and getting exposed to like thinkers like theus lewis i re i realized when my atheism was an idiotic belief system you know to to to just believe that the universe just exploded out of nothing and then ordered itself and in a way that we have all this complexity that that makes perfectly no sense and let's let's assume even it it was already there you know it it it violates the the third law of thermodynamics when a closed system which the universe is ultimately a closed system will tend towards this order so where where does the order come from so there was a logic behind me becoming a deist and then the love word came into play again i was evangelized by a woman that i hired but i didn't become a christian because i wanted to marry her she she she opened my eyes to the bible and we and i started the first time she quoted me something out of the bible i saidit wait a minute this is the most i knew that the most widely read book in in the history of mankind with no close second and i don't know anything about it so we did some bible study and then she invited me to church and at that time the love word came came back into play i was in a really really bad divorce with the the the woman that i had married and that had had the daughter that i was in love with she she went mentally ill and it was a lengthy divorce and i was the only time in my life i was actually depressed and u this young lady who i secretly courted i was i was in love with her she didn't know that she invited me to the church and as it happens so often when you go to church and the you listen to the pastor you know he was talking to you because he was talking about the love of god so why why do you think okay so what do you make of love then you know you said that the first time it really transformed you was a consequence of whatever manifested itself to you and your daughter and this the the effect of love on your life was what would you say it was outside of the domain of mere rationality and so what do you make of the transforming power of that love and how do you how does that fit into your intellectual apprehension love to me is the strongest emotion that that humans can have and we are ultimately emotional beings so when they say love conquers all i i have proof and and and as i'm as i embrac the faith and as i realized what what god did for us i i've become a real loving person loving even the ones that you that you don't like because the love is something that says something about yourself if you can love the unlikable that that makes you whole so to speak and and you and and you know the love of the the life of jesus is so so phenomenal the way i would like to like be living and be seen at least i'm trying to get to that point and i think i've i've traveled a long way and and one of the things that uh made a huge difference in in my life the last year coming to texas and being being around a lot of loving wonderful people and great churches that are not afraid to talk about what's going on in society these days not cowardly like many others that that i've visited so let me let me i'm going to talk for everybody watching and listening i'm i'm i'm going to talk for another half an hour with jack on the daily wire side and i think we'll probably go deeper into this issue of faith because we've covered a fair bit of his autobiography which is what i often do and so maybe we'll close with this i mean as you know the power of left-wing utopianism has made itself manifest once again in the west i mean i spent a lot of time traveling in eastern europe in the last few years and one of the questions that i was constantly bombarded with in eastern europe was how is it that the west could come under the sway of the ideas that were so destructive to us for so long and and what could we do about it what i would like to ask you is for the people who are watching and listening like you out led in some detail what you found attractive about the utopianism that was being offered to you as a purpose for life what message would you have to young people who were now attracted by that vision of helping the world's oppressed and poor identifying the oppressors and and having the adventure that goes along with that pathway to redemption i mean that was offered to you you followed it for a long time you eventually rejected it you found a religious calling instead you but you understand why that vision was so attractive so what what what can you say that's that might be of some utility to young people who are attracted by those utopian ideas well if i would say if you respect yourself you don't want to be a fool do you i'm talking to a young person now you don't want to be a fool so you are being fooled all the time i tell you that you need to go check out the truth and not just take it in as it's being presented to you the same way i took it in but the difference is we didn't have a marketplace of opportunities there there is a marketplace of opportunities you can find out the undeniable truth you're being lied to all the time and that makes you a puppet and that that takes your the individual individuality out of you who you are you think that's going to make for a happy fulfilled life you're meant to be an individual and not a member of a crowd so what what is it that you how old are you now and first let's start with that how i'm 73 and what do you what do you occupy your time with now oh you you know i i am so lucky that i don't have to use the phrase thank god it's friday anymore i get to create i write i do public speaking and i just uh developed a master class that i call applied spyology that is primarily going to be talking to young people mostly men i think and i i think the you know another voice like like that that is sort of side by side next to you is probably not not competition i think it's a it's a good thing to have and uh with regard to that i am i'm offering the the audience some something extra i'm i'm assuming there's going to be question and and we we have a we developed a website where we can where people can get to the website and ask the questions and i will answer every one of them personally the website is called kgb spicy.com and we'll have a little bonus there's a there's a document that i can share as a freebie that uh points out how the how the kgb uh operated in in the realm of persuasion that is not necessarily evil right because when you look at what dale carnegie taught it can be used for good and for evil so so so that's where i'm at and this is this is my i i have a i have a dual mission in life mission number one is taking care of my 13-year-old i have a young daughter and and mission number to is to do what i'm planning to do is work with with whoever wants to listen to me but primarily young people to help them ev evade a a destiny that when they become useful idiots that will the useful idiots will be thrown away as you know yeah yes i'm aware of that yeah yeah so what do you think that the people that you're trying to reach will learn as a consequence of taking your course and and and and you you're you're making illusions to psychology what are you trying to persuade them of convince them of teach them about yeah so so this this is going to be more or less infotainment you know i'm going to share some things that that are not necessarily in the book you know had to do with my operating as a spy and then draw some conclusions where i say well this is what helped me get out of this mess and know by the way you can acquire some of these skills yourself such as for instance like develop your subconscious you know i studied people all my life i i can read people like this right now and it's it's it's it's coming from my subconscious i'm not you know and and there's a few other things and also you know i wasn't taught people skills but i acquired them and again i i can talk about those and and coming from me with the with the with the background i have and the fact that i'm still talking to you and i managed to get through all this nonsense that i was in i think it it may add value um you know i absolutely respect you as an academician i have admired you since i found you you you you know having a scientific background it's it's great to you know have all almost synergy with you know with what i'm coming up up with instinctively with what you come up with through science so yeah well it sounds to me like you're trying to offer at least to the degree that that can be done in a virtual environment some of the mentorship even that you found know yes sir mhm yeah well young people you you need you need you know you even referred to this with regards to the first contact you had at the kgb the fact that he offered himself as a mentor filled a void in your life and and that is absolutely necessary is people need an apprenticeship and a mentor definitely especially if they don't have it at home and and the other thing that they need is uh accountability partners if they if they want to make changes happen they need to have an accountability partner right right right right yeah yeah all right well good is there is there anything else that you'd like to bring to the attention of this this audience in particular this more general audience before we go to the other interview just just let me let me just tell you tell you one thing and and i'm going out on a limb here when i got the the email from your producer i got emotional i'm not going to go any further this this was this was so important to me to be able to talk to you and i'm i'm i'm so so glad that it happened well thank you very much sir i appreciate also the opportunity to have heard your story and to have the privilege too of bringing to the attention of all the people that'll be watching and listening i'm going to talk to jack barsky for another half an hour on the daily wire side i think we'll delve into the philosophical and theological in some more detail on that in that half an hour and i'd like to thank you sir very much for your forthright comments today and for walking us through the strange transformations of your life and for shedding some light on well how one person was pulled into this terrible ideological battle that's been going on for while the greater part of the last century and and i'd like to thank everybody watching and listening for their time and attention and for the daily wire plus folks for making this conversation possible thank you very much sir you're most welcome thank [music] you
