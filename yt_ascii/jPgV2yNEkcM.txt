because people will disappoint you your church will disappoint you your your spouse will disappointed your kids will disappoint you everybody will disappoint you and then you'll find out that you'll disappoint yourself so what are you gonna do right you could just live in that despair or you can die right you can choose to die and if you choose to die then then there's a surprise right there's actually a surprise which is you could call it the resurrection a little one little resurrection is that all of a sudden some of those things start to shine be fuller than what you thought when you were trying to hold on to them this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] i love not talking first because because every time i get all these ideas that are different from what i was going to say in the first place because the fall was just bringing us at all these powerful images so first of all it's great to be back with some of you and to meet some of you all these faces a lot of people that i've been you know even met them on youtube or been met them on zoom calls and all of that so it's just wonderful to see people in real life and thanks for thanks for coming so i'm gonna give the most anti-symbolic talk that i've ever given i think it's what i'm gonna do today you know when the title when the title came the quest for a spiritual home the the image that right away came up for me was that that's it's impossible right there's there's an impossibility in the finding of a spiritual home and i don't know why that's the first image that came to me but i came to formulate it this way maybe it's gonna actually be a bit of a technical question that is that that in order for the world to exist we cannot own a home that's maybe one of the best ways to formulate that and there seems to be something in the way that we formulate our stories the way that the big story is formulated the one that paul brought us on you know from the fall to the eschaton that is captured in the christian story that seems to be hinting at this all the way through so what is why do i say it's going to be an anti-symbolic talk it's that i the most of the time what i tend to do is to point people to the beauty right to the fullness to the fact that the world is full of light that the world is full of the grace of god that the world is full of these patterns that that point us to their meaning and our and shine and i think that that's absolutely true but there's also another aspect to the way the world exists which is that we always have to be disappointed in the things that we find along the way and that's actually that's actually a necessity it actually has to be that way there's no way around it and it actually and it has to be that way for the you know when i talk about this hierarchy of of reality right these layers of how the world exists as this fractal structure of things embedded into each other well it seems like one of the corollaries to that or one of the things that makes that possible is that everything while being full is also always insufficient all the time it always has to be and that seems to be a big part of the story that you find in scripture like the whole big narrative and the crucifixion is the surprising part of that it's one of the most surprising ways that the story tries to deal with that that problem so we see it right away in the beginning in the story of the garden which is that god places adam and eve in this beautiful space and paul is absolutely right that it is definitely related to the temple or we could say i like to see it the other way around honestly i like to see it that the temple all the imagery of the temple that we find in scripture the tabernacle you know even ezekiel's kind of prophetic temple is a memory say call it a memory of the garden that we are made in a way that we have a nostalgia in us we're built with this nostalgia we have a sense in which we should find something like that we we want it we desire it we we're looking for it in everything and when we hear the story of the garden you know it's a it's a it's a mythological description we recognize in that story something which is true not only in a in a kind of historical like let's say historical way where we have this idea that there were people that lived in a garden before but that it is in some ways the the structure of our our everyday experience right we know the when we engage in something when we see it shine and we move towards it is because we see it as a as a breadcrumb leading towards paradise because if we try to find rest in any of those breadcrumbs right right away we realize that it's not enough that that that breadcrumb is not enough and the story of ulysses that paul had brought up this morning i hadn't thought about that as an example but it's a it's a very powerful example where you know ulysses has this massive adventure trying to find to go back to his image of paradise to his garden to his wife you know even the imagery in the the the text is very similar by the way to genesis because his bed is made out of a you know it's like it's like it's like embedded into the a tree that was planted there and it's like it's like embedded into to his own his bed is like built out of a tree that is there and so it really is this powerful image of this central tree right this tree that we see in the garden of eden and his wife as the his home as the space in which he finds rest and it's powerful it's the perfect imagery it's a perfect imagery you know when paul brought up the image of the heavenly jerusalem that is how home is described that is how the heavenly jerusalem is described as a bridal chamber as the place where you know the man and the woman meet where they find rest in each other you know where they find we could call it productive rest where life is born all of that it's it's it's exactly what that is but it is it's something like an eschatological memory we can put it in the past we can put it back in the mythical times we can put it back before the flood in history or we can project it into the future as the ultimate goal as the ultimate destination but that's how it appears necessarily because in some ways it sustains it sustains the world when that image lands when it happens there's an aspect of it which is bright and there's an aspect of it which is death that's how we encounter it we encounter it as a coming into something real and then ultimately having to give that up and if we don't then it becomes a becomes an idol right that's the whole story of idolatry in in scripture is has something to do with that all these things that are good we try to grasp them then they immediately they die you know they they so we we have to give them up on purpose we have to let's say let them die willfully so that we're not caught with this frozen dead thing in our hand and right that's right there in the in the story of genesis that's what happens you know there are many traditions which say that the the fruit that god had forbidden adam and eve was going to be given to them it's there in jewish tradition we find it in the church fathers you know you've heard me if you've listened to any of my videos you've heard me talk about saying that from the syrian senate from the syrian says that explicitly but in order for it to be real they couldn't grab it for themselves it was the grabbing for themselves that transformed it into death that god was to give it to them they had to receive it as a as a gift from heaven is the best way to to describe that so i want to give a you know i always give the same examples but you can kind of understand it in anything that you experience and when i say that this is true for the world to exist i really mean it technically i mean it in any anything that you can imagine anything that you can participate in it always has to give itself towards a higher participation always right walking you always you're when you're walking you're walking for a purpose and that whatever that purpose is it's somehow embedded in another one and another one and another one and there's a sense in which if you're properly aligned then all of that gets filled with with light you know if you if you work and you make money that's great if you try to grasp it and you do just that for its own sake then all of a sudden it becomes becomes idle and that's true about anything it's true about anything that is even religious and that's why it's so difficult because people think that you know and i'm orthodox i really believe that like i believe that icons are holy i believe that you know i believe in the sacraments i believe in all of that to be absolutely real but there's a way in which we always always have to be careful and understand that this always has to be a breadcrumb towards more because if we think that we're going to find our spiritual home in this world we are you're going to be disappointed if you think you're going to find a rest like a kind of rest where you can just kind of stop yeah you're going to be very disappointed and that's and i say that it's important because you know in some ways i'm telling people go to church right i say it all the time you know if you go to church you should go to church i'm just you know you should participate you should participate but it's important to understand that you will be disappointed yeah you're gonna run up right up against the wall you're gonna go like orthodox people catholic people you're one day you're going to go to confession and you're going to say it you're going to talk to the priest and the priest is going to say something absolutely crazy to you like completely insane you're like you're gonna go you're gonna go to church and you're gonna find out that you know oh this guy's cheating on his wife and this and that all of that is gonna happen to you there's no way around it you will be severely disappointed in the world but like i said there's a manner in which that has to be true right i'm not making excuses for anybody right christ has a great saying one of my favorite sayings of christ which is that scandal must happen right but woe to those by who's it ha by who it happens right horrible things are disappointment breakdown people not living up to what they should is absolutely necessary it doesn't excuse their behavior it doesn't excuse what they're doing but is absolutely necessary so that you are able to to not hold on to it that you're able to let go of it as a as an idol or as something that you think is going to bring you ultimate satisfaction and so we live in that tension always that strange tension and once you understand that tension it can help you actually understand many of the images and of the way that the bible talks about all of these questions because in the in the story of the bible and also in the story of christ you will see that tension always played out and it happens like i said right away in the story of genesis adam and eve grab the tree and because of that they lose their home they try to grab it they lose it and then cain after he kills his brother tries to build a home and it's like a it's like a weird scandal right he's like he's trying to make a home for himself and you know is that good is that bad should we do that should we build try to build homes should we try to construct them is that our job is that our role and the answer is yes and no it's it's both it's both at the same time and so we see an image of cain building that civilizational thing building that city leads to the flood we see an image of that in babylon as well and in bible you really see what the what the image is in some ways babel is the opposite of the heavenly jerusalem if you want to have a good image of how that functions you see that in the story in babel humans try to make a name for themselves you can understand that exactly as this taking the apple for oneself they tried to name it's great because we actually in a time in the world where everybody is trying to name themselves they're trying to self name they're trying to grab on to even hold on to themselves as their identity as being full as being full and because of that they they necessarily lose it there's no way around that and like i said it's a technical it's a technical thing anytime anything you're doing that has multiple parts of it anything if you're driving a car and all of a sudden you just get really hypnotized by the turn single signal and you just like get you i don't know you're obsessed with the turn signal you're gonna crash your car right anything that you do that you try to grab on to the parts of it it will collapse the the whole thing that's that that's how it is and so the tower of babel shows you that it's a powerful image because it tries to take one human name one human identity and raise it up into heaven and make it the home for all right make it the universal home for everyone we're gonna solve everyone's problems we're going to create a system that's perfect we're gonna we're gonna settle this you know and that that doesn't work and the heavenly jerusalem is is exactly the opposite that it's a beautiful image of this fractality and it actually it actually helps you see how it is possible to have homes how how can we live it how can we find consolation in the things that we participate in without without making them into little tyrannies and the image of the heavenly jerusalem is first of all at the center of the of the city is is the garden but also the lamb we'll get to that why the lamb is at the middle there but you it says that the kings and the nations give up their glory bring their glory into the city and that's like that's exactly that's an image that's the one of the most powerful images of reality i think that has been described is that in order in order for us to be able to find joy and some consolation in the world we have to always be giving it up towards a higher participation and as soon as we try to grab it as soon as we try to rest in it then it becomes then it breaks down there's no way around it and that is the the best image of civilization that's it that's the best image of civilization you've got is the idea that we all have our identities we all have our families we all have our nations our languages you know the things that we care about and the only way for those to hold together is for them to always be kind of given up and and offered up and that's why in some ways there it's always a dime there's always an aspect of reality which is something like willful dying you know doing dying on purpose so that you're not surprised by death giving up some of that control so that you're not surprised when the ground falls from under your feet foreign so in scripture you'll see that the homes and the rituals and the kings and all the structures are often represented as concessions god is conceding this stuff to humans it says if god is saying i'm your home you know but god is in heaven like you can't live in heaven i mean and so but he's like this is where you you know you i'm trying to bring you up the mountain right i'm trying to make you come like all the way to the top where you will come into contact with the infinite where you will find you know joy in the highest good but you know god knows that that's not going to happen and so god is always kind of giving concessions and that's why it's represented that way and sometimes it can be a little alarming because you know even if you read the book of exodus you'll see it's it's kind of always god is always kind of conceding you know that god tries to give the law himself you know writes it on the tablet with his own finger ah that doesn't land it's too high so god's like okay moses you you right you write the law rights you do it and so now moses writes the law and then that us it's lower and it kind of lands but then you know okay so moses is moses says i need help i need help so you know god adds aaron and then adds all these all these other other things and you i had this weird sense like it's a concession and you see the same in the story of king of the king you know everybody loves to point out that the king is a concession in in scripture you know the people ask for a king and then god tells the you know samuel tells the people that if you have a king the king is going to take things he's gonna he's gonna act like a raptor right you're gonna have something above you like a almost like a like a raptor bird that's gonna come and take things from you and he's totally right but then weirdly there's another image in the bible in the book of judges especially where everything's really chaotic and it says the reason why it's chaotic is because there was no king in israel so you think how do we have those two things together how can we have on the one hand all of civilization everything that makes us human be a kind of concession and something that in some ways isn't good enough but at the same time it becomes an actual image of the way that god reveals himself into the world ah and i think that that like i told you that in some ways that tension between those two sides that's actually the key to understanding how the world works and in some ways that's the key to living your life you kind of always have to navigate between those two things you know it's like you fall in love with someone and and you know it's it's amazing and that person is your home and you you're like this is it i found it you know and then you then you get married and then you realize that was not the case like that this person is not gonna fulfill all your desires not going to fulfill all your aspirations just not it's just not going to happen and i'm sorry if there's anybody who still who's in a new relationship and thinks that that's gonna happen it's just not gonna happen i don't know what to tell you uh so get ready for that but but that's that's the the thing is that once you realize that that's actually how the world works then then maybe it's not that big a deal and actually not only it's not that big a deal but in some ways maybe that's actually the path towards your own betterment it's actually the path towards your own salvation is that finding the places where reality disappoints you is an opportunity to make that next jump you know i i heard through through a friend of mine who was a nun she was saying that her abyss she she would always say that you know that the heart breaks make the best nuns like those women that were heartbroken make the best nuns because in that disappointment right in trying to find satisfaction in a man to find their home in a man in that break it became an opportunity for them to move further to move up from that and so i'm saying that obviously it's it's hard it's impossible right it's really impossible to do that but in some ways it's the only way to do it there's no other way because life will disappoint you because people will disappoint you your church will disappoint you your your spouse will disappointed your kids will disappoint you everybody will disappoint you and then you'll find out that you'll disappoint yourself so what are you gonna do right so so you could just live in that despair or you can die right you can choose to die and if you choose to die then then there's a surprise right there's actually a surprise which is you could call it the resurrection a little one little resurrection is that all of a sudden some of those things start to take to shine and they actually start to be fuller than what you thought when you were trying to hold on to them right it was it was chesterton that said that before he was a he was a christian he would chase after liquor and cigars and women and then when he he became a christian he realized that he could finally enjoy cigars alcohol and and a woman but it's because he wasn't running after it anymore like he wasn't that wasn't his purpose he had turned his eyes towards something higher and then all of a sudden the simple the joys of the world became consolations when they were there but they weren't that which we expected of reality we didn't expect it we don't think that it was owed to us like i'm owed this i'm owed this this home if i can't find it i'm going to live in like bitter disappointment for the rest of my life and this is it's important for us to see it especially today because you know we have a consumer culture obviously and we're promised that all these things are going to bring us satisfaction and some of us we think we think that we're not materialists and we're not affected by that but the same problem happens in the in the church in the churches or in our spiritual communities is that you know there's a reason why the the modern world has so much hopping you know from church to church or from this to that is because in some ways we're looking for the perfect home i'm not saying you should just settle for anything obviously i made that move you know i moved from one camp to the other and i i joined the the orthodox tradition and then i was severely disappointed right and then i was disappointed luckily there's like you know it's funny the reality is made in a beautiful way like god is made in a beautiful way and that's also why we fall in love i think is it's good that at first we're kind of drawn and we we don't see the death part of it we just see the light and it's great because it it's it's like it is like that crumb that brings you closer so it's good that at first usually when people join a church or the you know they they they they convert or they get baptized you know for the first six months depending on people it's like right it's like it's like they're in heaven for a few months a year it depends on people you know and then it just like then it then all of a sudden you you see that no this is not your home you know this is not your home and that's i think helps us understand the image of christ more fully why did jesus appear the way that he does and there's a way in which the idea that the lamb is at the center of the holy city it's very powerful this idea that the lamb of god which was sacrificed before the foundation of the world that's a very powerful image because we tend to have an idea that death and sacrifice is it that's the concession you could say or that that's like the the the exception that christ came to die because of our sins and that's why the cross appears but there's a very deep deep mystery in the notion that that's actually how the world is made and that at the highest point and at the top of the hill is a sacrifice and that in order to have the world exist it has to be given up you have to give it up and that's actually how everything else falls into place once you give it up then you get it back you know and the story of the sacrifice of isaac that's exactly what that is you know that's exactly what that is god says you know god doesn't say it that way but ultimately it seems that god is saying for you to have your son you have to give him up and if you don't you can't you won't have him and that's actually the only way and you could think about that in all your relationships you know everything all your relationships if you think about it that way that you know if you love your wife you have to be willing to give her up if you love your children have to be willing to give them up and that once that happens then you stop grasping so you don't grasp so much and then you find these surprises right these beautiful joyful surprises that come that come with that gesture and so that's when we come to the image of the of the crucifixion there's a in the in the orthodox tradition we have it's one of my favorite i maybe is my favorite service in in in the church here it's a service of lamentation that comes on holy friday and it's a it's a kind of a meditation and a lamentation of christ who is on the cross and the imagery that is used there is the is the craziest imagery like it's some of the most powerful imagery and what happens in that poetry is a collapse of home and death together right where the tomb of christ is the bridal chamber you know where the the man who is dead on the cross is the bridegroom that the that christ entering into the tomb that is the highest sabbath that is the highest rest and like that clash in your mind right it's hard to hold it together but you know i hope the way that i've tried to kind of set up that tension for you to understand that in some ways that's actually how how reality works and when we say you know when i say that it's hard to explain it but when i talk about christ and i and i tell and i tell people like christ is revealing the way reality works it's not just it's not just a story you have to believe in to be saved it's actually showing us the way that the world is made and i think that in the image of the crucifixion obviously with resurrection coming without the resurrection then yeah then you're right then it's just some guy dying it's just some just death but the idea that it's think about the sacrifice of isaac in the image of the crucifixion that's what's going on the same thing but now it's a self like now it's self-sacrifice now it's a christ who gives himself up christ who gives himself completely was willing to die who's willing to let go to let go of everything the surprise behind that is that that's what makes you exist and that's what makes the fullness of your life possible is in that spot and you give up and so then you can understand all the right all this idea that in some ways the imagery of us being strangers in a strange land the imagery of us not having a home the imagery of the ascetics for example think of all the monks that go out into the desert and are you know that that want to give everything up it's not a it's not just a kind of masochism right it's not just a kind of of it is looking for fullness but knowing that fullness comes through sacrifice now we're all we're not all called to do that obviously i'm not a monk but those images and especially the i mean especially the image of the crucifixion they become a marker of how reality works and that the reality in which we can exist you could say that and so i'm not called to sacrifice myself fully i'm not necessarily called to go live in the desert but you know i'm i maybe i'll sacrifice you know i won't work 15 hours a day and i'll spend some time with my kids maybe i won't you know i won't buy that new car or whatever and you know i'll give that money to the church or to charity or i'll you know i i will understand that it's actually giving up things that those very things find their find their real their reality i always there there's a there's like a there's like a little secret joke behind all of that right there's a funny secret joke behind all of that which is that let me put it this way who enjoys food more a billionaire at a banquet right or a monk eating a piece of bread that hasn't eaten in three days who do you think has more pleasure it's kind of weird huh and then you realize that it's not and the thing is that i'm almost like i feel i'm almost probably shouldn't even tell you that like i shouldn't say that because i the idea is not to fast so that you have more pleasure you know like that like like some of the like some of the the epicureans but that is gonna happen actually it's like you know and we see that in the the way that the orthodox tradition presents the spiritual life that's actually how the whole spiritual life is presented i often bewilder people when i tell them that if you read the writings of the monks and the ascetics they tell you to not care for any spiritual experience like don't but his visions don't don't pay attention to that consolations forget it don't think about any of that it's like you you see an angel you see christ or the you know appear to you ignore it it's like what especially like in this modern like kind of psychedelic type people world where they all want to look looking for spiritual experiences and you think no that's actually how it works that's actually how it works and so the monk that ignores the spiritual constellations in a strange contradictory in a strange paradox will have more spiritual consolation than anybody who like is gonna go out to look for their little spiritual experience and that's actually that's actually like i said how the world works and so ultimately i think that you know hopefully you'll see that it it is anti-symbolic in the sense that it's the type it's the aspect of reality that i that i don't talk about as much but it's very important it's very important and it's true for all the things that i say that the secret part of it or the the hidden part of it is that all of the things that i talk about all of the beautiful imagery all of the powerful manifestations of these patterns they all only exist in in a in a sacrifice they'll only exist in the manner in which they're capable of emptying themselves into higher higher participations and so we we have to not we have to enjoy the meaning that is provided to us by kind of seeing the world that way but we always have to be careful not to not to grasp it so that was our message for you this morning [applause]
