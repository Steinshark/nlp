welcome back to tech intern guys if you haven't met yet my name is jason goodison i'm a software engineer at microsoft i help you get your next internship today we're talking about that first internship how do i get the first internship when this question comes into my head the first thing i think about is you know your resume where do you make it how do you structure it second one being how do you study for your interviews when you do get one third being you know you don't have any marketable skills what skills are marketable and how do you even structure that and the last being what are good jobs to apply to let's just kind of go through those one by one and we'll go from there so the first is your resume now if you go to waterloo you've done pd1 so here's my advice go ahead make that resume print it out make sure it's on nice colored ink get it with you and then just kind of it's not that i'm telling you that there's nothing you can learn from the pde resume tutorial or whatever your university resume thing is there are some there is some good advice in there there's stuff about how you should use action words you know use words like demonstrated implemented they have a few little bit of nuggets of information in there but by far and large it's just not a very good resume you'll come out with they're trying to check a box they're not trying to get you your next job make a resume for them but when you go to make your own resume you're probably going to want to use different template maybe even talk about different things or use different words which which kind of sparks the question where am i going to make my first resume now i want to do an entire video on like what tools you can use for making resumes because i've used a bunch over the years to save you from all of this talk i'm just going to tell you my recommendation would be figma go ahead go to figma.com find some community resumes for free and then just go ahead and use one of those fill in your information biggest mistake people make is that they'll make their resume two pages long now let me tell you something the industry standard is one page per 10 years if you're coming out of high school with two pages with a two-page resume that's not what you want to do make sure it's one page the average recruiter will look at your resume for six seconds do you really want them to spend three of those seconds flipping the page now i've got an entire video on this and it's in i'll link it in the card i don't know if the card pops up here or here and i really think you guys should take a look at those videos for resume specific questions so what i want to do is quickly jump to that thing about marketable skills before i get into how to prepare so in the marketable skills section volunteering leadership first jobs clubs you've been a part of you're not going to have many technical skills to put on that resume but that's okay you don't need technical skills talk about how you worked in a fast-paced environment talk about how you worked as part of a team talk about how you had leadership skills non-technical holy holy oh my god i'm gonna leave that down so what i was getting to you have the what are your marketable skills they're gonna be things like they're gonna be things that are like soft skills and when it comes to technical skills what do you have well if you're in waterloo you're you have probably just racket which is not really a marketable language if you put racket on your resume you're not going to get a job interview because you know racket it's not used in industry so what's the next best thing well i talk to people about this question i always prompt them like what is the first language you should learn to make yourself marketable i asked javin i asked tech with tim actually he's a youtuber i feel like i kept coming back to python and if you know racket already it shouldn't be too difficult to learn the syntax for python and then you can kind of say that you know python you know the syntax for python and since you know racket you can transfer those skills into python if you know a language like if you've done java i did a little bit of action script 3 when i was in high school so i put that on my resume even though i didn't really know it i just knew it a little bit i wasn't proficient in it but the point being you know put whatever technical skills you have on there now what jobs are you going to get in first year there's a bunch of programs like the microsoft explorer program i think there's a google version of that where they basically take first years that don't have much coding experience and they show them a great summer and that's what everybody wants that's what they have their mind set on you know they're going to go to this big tech company in their first internship and it's going to be a blast and there's only going to be puppies and roses and it's probably not what your first internship is going to look like i highly recommend you apply to those jobs but the overwhelming average is that people don't get those jobs right i mean they can only accept a few candidates and they have hundreds of applicants sometimes thousands let's like get some more real perspective let's say you apply to a bunch of programming jobs and you're not getting anyone any responses back from it because you don't have marketable languages on your resume what's the next best thing when i was in first year i kind of observed what other people did javin who's a software engineer at uber his solution to this was to become a qa and to do some kind of software testing he went to pivotal labs and his idea was to get his foot in the door and then his next internship he could go back as a dev and that loop actually worked he went as a qa he tried to do some programming on the side also apart from his regular job and they did offer him a return offer which i don't think he took that's not what i did however i went to a service desk role where i basically was on the phone people called me and said my windows isn't working today my outlook's not working today like help me with it so that's not programming at all and the way i kind of got my foot into a programming internship was i went above and beyond in that internship and i wrote a python script that automated a bunch of these tedious tasks we did so when you're looking for that first internship it doesn't necessarily have to be a programming internship it might be qa to get your foot in the door at a company it might be service desk like me even if it's not programming you can find a way to incorporate programming into your job find a way to automate some process to fix some inefficiency and you're gonna get rewarded for that and once you put that on your resume it's kinda like you had a programming job because you have a job where you did programming and that'll help you get your next internship which is exactly what happened for me it's exactly what happened for javin now i want to go back a little bit to how do i study for an interview when i get them essentially you're if it's a technical interview you're going to be studying probably lead code and probably cracking the coding interview cracking coding interview is a great book you can use that basically lays out all data structures and algorithms and the questions that are common to come with those and lead code is of course just a place where you can actually practice those coding questions in a browser one thing i think you should you guys should definitely check out if you haven't checked out leap party yet that's a chrome extension i made it's completely free costs me like 15 bucks a month to run and no ads no sign up not no kind of like that use that to leap code against your friends so make a get a group of friends you know friday night you guys can't do anything because of covid anyway grab a group of friends get on leap code and use that chrome extension i made elite party you guys can make a room together find a problem and compete against each other to get the best solution to that problem and that's kind of that's going to make lee code a little bit more fun for you so sure that's a little bit of self promo which i don't like to do on this channel but i'm not making money off of it man it costs me 15 bucks a month to run and in terms of non-technical questions you're gonna you're gonna have a lot of non-technical questions probably in that first year one really great exercise to do is a lot of non-technical questions kind of come down to tell me a time when those tell me a time when questions they tend to often point to the same few scenarios come up with your your best accomplishment your biggest failure come up with a time when you overcame adversity think of these like scenarios these basic scenarios in your head of a time when you did such and such and most of the time when they ask a question tell me a time when whatever follows that you're gonna be able to pick from one of your predetermined scenarios like something you've already thought out so for example they say tell me a time when everything just went wrong that's a real question i've had before tell me a time when everything just seemed to go wrong and what i do is go oh you know what how about my biggest failure that's a really good one so i just say here's a time when everything went wrong when i had this really big failure and here is how i came back from it here's how i bounce back here's how i solved the problem and here's how i learned from it so i was able to take one of those scenarios and and kind of fit it to the question i'm going to do an entire video about studying for those interviews i actually did a talk about it so i'll be able to use my same notes another thing i've been really thinking about lately is coming up with a coding competition that i run and i donate a prize to maybe a few hundred dollars for the winner but i really want it to be big and i want people to actually be engaged in this so if that's something you think you would like you know let me know in the comment section let me know with the subscribe these are things that i'm trying to build a community here and i need your help to do that so let your friends know you know shoot me a message if you like stuff all of that is is so helpful to me and i've gotten a bunch of comments so far i just want to thank you guys so much i hit about 225 230 subscribers the other day and i haven't even had time to make a video to thank my first 100 never mind my first 200 so i can't thank you guys enough for your love and support and yeah so thanks guys so much i will see you in the next episode
