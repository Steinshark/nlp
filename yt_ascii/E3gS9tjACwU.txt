something you want to tell me about yes i would like to talk to you about a equation that is called fitzlaw and how that affects the way that you point at things and use a cursor on your computer fits like fixes or fits off well it's fitz's but that sounds funny so i'm just going to say fitz but know that i know that there are two s's in there okay it belongs to paul fitz who was a researcher in 1954 who was trying to work out how we could predict the speed of people's movements from one location to another and what he was doing he was trying to work this out from a kind of perspective of how we can make production lines more efficient where people are putting pieces together but what he didn't realize then at the time was that it really really is useful when talking about how people move things on a computer screen how people move a mouse cursor on a computer screen and the result of this formula means that we can predict how quickly you can move between one target and another depending on a few variables what are we talking about here a target is anything that you might want to click on on the computer screen so you want to go to a menu item you want to close a window you want to highlight some text any situation in where you're moving your cursor to another location on screen that's what i'm calling a target here i'll write down the formula for you and then we can talk about which elements of it matter and which things you can choose to change as a designer and how you can use this formula to optimize the layout the user interface of something on a computer screen so the equation is the time it takes you to move from your location to a target is equal to a plus b times log base two of amplitude over width plus one the variables within this equation we have a and b here we can kind of ignore those so a and b just mean that you can adapt this equation depending on what people are actually using to do the pointing so if for example they were using a stylus you might need to make it take a bit longer than if they were using a mouse or something like that so a and b are kind of used for that there's like little dials you can tweak for exactly yeah yeah that's exactly what they do so we can kind of ignore those what we're interested in here are the variables a and w amplitude and width and these things describe the target so the amplitude describes how far away the target is from your start position and the width describes the width of the target unsurprisingly how big the target is exactly yes how big a landing pad you've got exactly so the width gives you an idea about exactly how accurate you need to be when you get to that target the wider something is the less accurate you need to be and the way that we use this formula is that we want to minimize the amount of time that someone takes and so we want to minimize this term and to do that we can do two things as designers firstly we can make this value the a amplitude small which means we can make the target closer or we can make w the width large so we can make the target massive this seems pretty obvious it doesn't that lie it does seem obvious it actually reminds me of sport as well like anything in sport like darts you either have a big bull's eye or you stand closer to the door yeah well it is quite obvious but the interesting thing is that we have an actual equation to describe it it's not just something that we can intuitively work out it's something that has been tested really really thoroughly to get to get some equations out of it the way that fitz tested it is he got people to hold a stylus and then move quickly back and forth between two targets and he altered the distance of those targets away from each other and the width of those targets and he came out with this wonderful formula to to actually accurately describe it now let's actually think about what this means for design and actually what we can do with this formula in order to make really useful interfaces and really quick to use interfaces so thinking about amplitude the way that we can minimize this that is the distance we want to minimize it is to give people things exactly at their cursor point so the closest pixel to you is the one where your cursor is and so that's why you get quite a lot of useful functionality at the cursor point that is you right click you don't need to make any movement whatsoever and so that is a target that's really really easy to get to this is the menu that pops up next to the thing exactly like a tool tip menu and that means that you can put all of the very useful functionality right there because it's incredibly easy for the user to get to because wherever you happen to be you right click exactly exactly wherever you are is exactly where that menu is so that's one way of doing it that's i don't think that's that interesting now if we think about width this is the really interesting part to me where do you think the best place is to click on it on a screen what's the what's the easiest place to get to on a screen the edges i guess because you can't miss the edge that's exactly it i say so if you put a target in the corners of the screen what you have essentially done there is created a target that is infinitely wide right you've you've made it so that no matter how far up and how far right they go the user will always be on that target and that's why the corners are such useful areas on a computer screen because they are infinitely wide which makes this equation get a lot smaller and so it means you can get to those corner areas really really quickly it's interesting because i think some people were upset with apple because the x at the top right on some interfaces that really is wedged right into the top and so therefore is infinitely big but then i think apple brought it down and made it into a circle so they moved the target from being infinitely massive to a tiny little circle just by bringing in like a couple of pixels from the edge which is kind of silly of them but it's interesting that you can do that is the fits equation do you imagine this is something that in the halls of microsoft and apple and game designers and that they're always thinking about or is this something that academics like you look at afterwards and smugly say well they should have done this or the real reason they did it is because of this or do you think they apply this equation no i do genuinely believe this is something that's that's people are very much considering when they're designing things there are loads of different variations of it so for obviously now we're starting to move to like touch screens and so things get a bit get a bit more different because the corners of your ipad are definitely not the best place to put things because there's no such thing as this infinite width and height and so the equations are having to change and alter depending on the new technology that is coming out but it is definitely still being it's definitely still being used by people in order to justify and come up with clever ideas for interfaces we'd like to thank

the fantastic future i think i've got that right hopefully i'll be here on the screen by now so he's builders in real life tony stark you know the guy behind iron man so get over to audible.com slash computer file download your free book and thanks once again to them for sponsoring this computer file video they're not testing the actual machines yet what they're doing in this paper is giving people a booklet that just has this on it when people filled this in 55 of people chose the phone layout 55 percent of people went well obviously it should go like this
