does it ever annoy you that with these new smartphones with six inch plus displays many elements the you i still need you to reach to the top there is a solution in the form of bottom a quick settings which when installed allows you to swipe up from your navigation keys to bring up a control center and in a way it's a better version of what you have on top there is completely customizable you can change rows columns colors and even take control over your notifications the neo line wallpaper is a live wallpaper unlike you've probably ever seen before it has incredibly smooth 60 frame per second animation and because unlike most wallpapers that are designed this is procedurally generated so that means two things it is always gonna look a little different and when you're rotating your phone you can look at it from almost any angle you want to not just what it's been designed to show from the same developer you've also got the zen tur led wallpaper similarly vibrant and colorful but with a little bit more character and something that's a little bit more personable most applications that are built to improve your focus and stop you getting distracted by your phone don't really work this does welcome to a launcher called less phone it puts your to-do list right on top gives you a dialer and then just three or four apps that you can have quick access to apart from that everything else is hidden away and you can still access it but because less phone makes that process longer you don't end up bothering unless you actually need to there is also a dark theme for a small fee which would save you a lot of battery considering most of the screen would just be black pixels here for those of you who have busier home screens what often works really well and better than using a photo wallpaper is using a flat color or you can go a step further and introduce a gradient that's where dydx comes in which allows you to either create a gradient of your choice or randomly make one itself which means if you're ever getting bored in the space of five seconds you can have a completely different looking home screen i guess the issue a lot of people have with their home screens though is that although you do get bored of having one home screen you also don't want to change it because your current wallpaper is pretty good that's where wallpaper moderate it has a whole bunch of different utilities that enable you to tweak your existing wallpaper you can do simple stuff like increase the contrast or boost the saturation to just spruce up an image or you can invert it which if you've got any kind of colored background completely changes the way it looks without reducing its quality in the last few episodes have customized your android i've introduced you guys to something called kl wp a really quick way to download or even build your own amazing live wallpapers well we can extend this when you're editing any wallpaper within this application you can add something they call a component some sort of visual indicator it could be a switch it could be a button it could be a progress bar and once you've added this you can configure it to show what you want to see so you could configure the bar to show you your battery percentage and you can configure the button so that when you press it it'll map out the nearest route to back home using public transport if you're looking for some sort of widget to fit with nearline wallpapers this pack right here contains a whole selection of neon inspired ones which pretty much slide into place sesame is a search feature built in partnership with nova launcher so it seamlessly slips right in and once configured by pressing your home button while already on the home menu you'll see a universal search page with quick access to contacts files apps and web pages it is super fast and also pretty clean looking all right one really good way of customizing your android phone completely changing the look is to introduce new icons and there is a superhero icon pack which only has twenty to thirty different options to pick from so it doesn't replace your main icon pack but instead adds to it so all you do is just pick a few icons that you're not a huge fan of or that you use really often and you want them to be different or exciting in some way and just swap those ones out and all of a sudden you've got a set of centerpiece to your setup and as long as you pick something that still color-coordinated you shouldn't have a problem recognizing it so now that we're talking about icons for those of you who juggle a whole bunch of different icon packs icon z is a really useful tool with three main features one it lets you search for icons based on roughly what they show you can save any icon straight to your gallery and if you're trying to find a replacement for an icon that doesn't quite fit your current setup and this can scan it and recommend alternatives reddit is quite a great but also pretty underutilized platform for finding wallpapers for android a wallpaper has to be pretty good before it's gonna get voted anywhere near the top of a subreddit and so this application read papers scours
