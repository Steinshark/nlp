hello everyone and welcome i hope you're not yet bored of rotary engines they are quite cool so i'm going to continue to talk about them and in this video we're talking about hydrogen powered rotary engines now mazda has been developing hydrogen powered rotary engines dating back to the early 1990s and then in 2003 they developed the rx8 hydrogen re so a hydrogen powered mazda rx8 which not only could use hydrogen as fuel but it could also use gasoline as fuel very neat and then they sold this vehicle in 2006 in japan so there's actually you know mazda rotary engines running around out there that are powered by hydrogen do any of them have apex seals left i don't know i don't know if there's actually still any on the road today but very cool that they were once sold in japan powered by not only hydrogen but also gasoline market what do you think about rotary engines oh no no no no now i already have a video explaining how this rotary engine works so that's not really what we're going to get into in this video instead we're learning how is hydrogen implemented within this engine and what changes does that cause for it so the engine operation is just like it was previously you've got your intake you compress that sparks ignite it power and then you press that out the exhaust same thing with hydrogen the only difference is now we're going to add a direct injector up here on the top so we're going to directly inject into the combustion chamber during the intake stroke and they will also have one installed on the intake so they'll have two hydrogen injector locations one to directly inject into each rotor and then one for the intake and for the intake that allows for pre-mixing so you can have some mixture of hydrogen going in already depending on what the driving conditions are now if you're using direct injection you want to make sure that that fuel has enough time to mix with the air around it and this is one of the advantages of a rotary engine so in a piston cylinder engine if you have'0 degrees of crankshaft rotation that piston moves from the top down to the bottom that's your intake stroke in a rotary engine you actually have 270 degrees of rotation at which you're pulling in air so you have longer duration of intake stroke which means that you have more time for that fuel to mix within the air around it so just to demonstrate that very quickly here you have your intake port so your air is coming in here you can see that port difficult to see but in there you can see the port where air is allowed to come in so as you start to rotate this rotor here if we look at our rotor starting at about right here so facing down we're just beginning to start to expose that intake port we rotate 90 degrees now that intake port is fully exposed rotate it another 90 degrees the intake port is still exposed and then we close it off right there 270 degrees so you have a longer duration for that fuel to mix within that combustion chamber now there's two additional points with regards to hydrogen being used in this direct injection scenario and mixing well with the air around it first of all hydrogen has a very high diffusivity that means once it's injected it spreads out and creates an even mixture very quickly it's much faster at creating that even mixture versus gasoline the other advantage is that hydrogen has a very wide range of combustible air fuel ratios so that means if you do have a lean area you can still likely have combustion occur because hydrogen can still burn at as high as'0 to 1 by mass air fuel ratios now another unique property of hydrogen fuel is that it has a very low ignition energy it's about 10 times less versus gasoline that means it's very easy to ignite it you don't need much energy to do so and so this is a disadvantage because it can cause knock but the unique scenario of using a rotary engine means that you don't have those hot spots like you might have in a piston cylinder engine so a piston cylinder engine the spark plug may get quite hot it could cause pre-ignition with a hydrogen fuel you also have exhaust valves that get quite hot that could cause ignition of that hydrogen but in a rotary engine you don't have that problem first of all you don't have those exhaust valves getting hot and also you separate your cold and hot sides of the engine now this is generally a disadvantage from a ceiling perspective with rotary engines but from a pre-ignition standpoint it's quite good but because it means the top of the engine is always going to have that cool intake portion occurring where you don't want that pre-ignition of your air fuel mixture to occur versus the bottom of the rotor housing where you're going to have all of your combustion occurring and there it's fine for it to get hot so you don't have to worry about you know backfiring and misfiring and detonation of that air and fuel mixture in here because you don't have the hot spots like you might have in a piston cylinder engine now with rotary engines you're going to have two spark plugs one here and one here and so once that rotor comes over it'll ignite that mixture and you can see there's a very long but very flat combustion chamber and so that's why you have those two spark plugs it's to help speed up that flame propagation within that very long combustion chamber and one of the unique benefits of hydrogen is that it has a very high flame speed so you'll still continue to use those two spark plugs but with hydrogen you'll combust all that fuel sooner because the flame travels faster that means you make more power and your engine is operating more efficiently another property of hydrogen fuel is that it has a lower quenching distance versus gasoline so the quenching distance is the distance from the wall at which the flame will extinguish in the combustion chamber and so if you're looking at the rotary engine as it's passing along so it's compressing that air fuel mixture you get to hear where those two sparks ignite you've got some really tight spaces in here and because hydrogen can burn closer to the wall you can see that in these narrow gaps right here that hydrogen can still burn versus gasoline has about a two millimeter quenching distance hydrogen's at about point six millimeter so that means you burn more of the air fuel mixture and you have less hydrocarbons going out of the exhaust and those are two problems that the rotary engine has not complete combustion and sending those hydrocarbons fuel out the exhaust neither of which are good to do it means they're not efficient and they don't have great emissions so by using hydrogen it's able to get in those little crevices and continue to burn and make sure all of that air fuel mixture is burned rather than being sent out the exhaust now speaking of emissions if you're only using hydrogen as the fuel for this engine that means you won't have any carbon emissions because hydrogen fuel doesn't have carbon within it so there's no co2 produced from the combustion there's no carbon monoxide produced from the combustion process now unfortunately hydrogen fuel burns quite hot and so it's not emission free you actually do have nitrogen oxide emissions because of the temperatures getting so hot within the combustion chamber so mazda has two ways of addressing this depending on the engine demand when you're at a low rpm like we see right here what mazda will do is reduce the amount of fuel injected so you'll have a very lean air fuel mixture and by running a lean air fuel mixture you reduce combustion temperatures by reducing combustion temperatures you reduce the amount of nox emissions but what if you want power so you speed up the engine rpm like we see there and as you get into these higher rpm what mazda will do is they will use egr to help cool the inside so you're not going to have as much air going in you're going to have some of that exhaust routed back to the intake and then in the engine and that's going to cool combustion temperatures help bring down the amount of nox emissions and then you'll also use a three-way catalyst to help reduce that as it goes out the exhaust pipe now mazda's engine can switch between gasoline and using hydrogen and so if you're just using hydrogen you've got the advantages of lower emissions and better efficiency and if you're running at a lean air fuel ratio like 68 to 1 double hydrogen's air fuel ratio then you can also reduce knox emissions as well unfortunately using just hydrogen alone your range isn't that great so that's why they have the dual fuel system you've got gasoline if you need the longer range hydrogen for the cleaner emissions and the efficiency benefits for shorter range distances so hydrogen fuel actually takes up a very large space and as a result your range won't be that great because you need a large tank in order to go a far distance but the benefit of you know using a rotary engine it makes a lot of sense in a hybrid vehicle so you've got the range extension from this very small compact engine if you're using hydrogen that means you know you can have clean emissions and then have that battery electric for the majority of the driving so charge it using you know electrical power and then have that range extender which is compact it's small it's clean if you're using hydrogen mazda's actually said that they will be bringing back the rotary engine and they have announced this recently saying that you know it's going to be used as a range extender in a battery electric vehicle so very cool to hear that it's going to be coming back it will be gasoline i believe but neat that it's going to be coming back and we'll get to see more of the mazda rotary engine what changes they make will be cool to find out now as far as the rx-8 in 2006 that used both gasoline and hydrogen the way that it works is you have the same old injectors from the gasoline engine and then you add that injector for the hydrogen for both direct injection as well as in the intake and so what happens is if you run out of hydrogen it will automatically switch to using just gasoline and run like a traditional gasoline rotary engine and the driver actually has the ability to choose which fuel they want to be running on and finally i found a study that showed that you can actually use both gasoline and hydrogen within the combustion chamber together and improve this engine so a study found that by injecting a 10 hydrogen mixture along with gasoline they were able to improve thermal efficiency by 28 percent break specific fuel consumption by 38 they were able to reduce hydrocarbons by 85 percent reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 64 and reduce co2 emissions by 36 percent unfortunately nitrogen oxide emissions increased by 137 percent so what they found was if they ran the hydrogen mixture lean increasing the air fuel ratio by about 50 percent they were able to actually reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by about 61 so fascinating stuff it's very cool that you're able to use hydrogen as a fuel and that mazda has actually put out an engine you know that you could buy in japan in 2006 and drive around in using hydrogen or gasoline if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below thank you so much for watching
