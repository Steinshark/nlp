they say it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to destroy it but that isn't the case here streamlabs who we're going to be talking about today which is a streaming platform they have a wide variety of products it came out today that they have been trying to destroy their reputation for years trying to start this fire testing their luck to see how far they could take it stealing cheating and lying their way to the top but only just now has it caught up with them and yes seemingly in only a few minutes most of the streaming and youtube community have suddenly found out what a complete pile of flaming trash this company is i myself have used streamlabs products in the past both their alerts and their broadcasting software but after today i will never be using it again now this situation has been evolving new companies are coming out of the woodwork to throw more fuel on the fire so we're going to cover all of that for you right now because this is a hot mess ex-ceos are getting involved the ftc violations are now suddenly being brought to light cs go lotto somehow rolls into it of course so we're gonna break that down for you all right now ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective now all of this started this whole drama with stream labs you may have heard a little bit about it but i'm gonna break it all down for you streamlabs is a broadcasting software they're a company that produces things for streamers and a lot of people use them for their twitch alerts as well as a fork of obs which is a common software that people like myself use every day to record videos or to stream live and streamlabs has produced a version they call streamlab obs or slobs and due to the similar names many people have thought that these are similar companies or there's a partnership between them in order to use the same name obs i myself thought that but this is absolutely not the case it came out today that streamlabs has been copying and stealing people's work for years now and companies are hopping on left and right like it's a damn avengers movie to dunk on stream labs and put the final nail in the coffin now it all started with light stream lightstream is one of many live streaming tools and they posted hey can i copy your homework they're talking about streamlabs new product streamlab studio they say yeah just change it up a bit so it's not obvious you copied clown bet and what they post i don't know if you can see this is two things one it's their light stream like software copy and then right next to it is the stream labs version and as you can see they're exactly the same down to the wording itself like right here level up your xbox and playstation streams level up your console streams how does it work how does it work and it even goes down to the very layout of these two pages they're nearly identical and so obviously this made quite the buzz nobody likes when somebody is copying other people's products but that's when obs which is probably the world's most popular broadcasting software lit the match and set fire to slobs obs in a post said near the launch of slobs stream labs reached out about us using the obs name we kindly asked them not to they did so anyway and followed it up by filing a trademark we've tried to sort this out in private and they have been uncooperative at every turn now again this is a obs is open source and so i mean like yeah you can fork the project but you can't literally call yourself the same name as the thing you're taking from you just put your name in front of it is not suddenly yours and obs goes on to say that they've faced confused users who don't understand that there's even a difference and i can attest to this because having used both software i didn't know that they weren't affiliated i assume one was just one that like incorporated stream labs into it and it totally had the seal of approval of obs now something that many of you may not know is that stream labs then fired back and said that is not true obs project and you know it we asked and jim said yes proof attached this was the former owner of streamlabs and you better believe we're gonna get to him because the history here is wild but you can see here they list an email where they're talking about a streamlabs github repo and they're talking about the naming of a github repo they say we are setting up the github to make the code available for everyone we're wondering the right name to choose and we're thinking about this one streamlabs obs and above it the obs team says sure that sounds fine eddie i don't particularly mind now i don't know why a github repos name is equivalent to naming your entire project after the team obs like naming your whole project streamlabs obs instead of just a github file but apparently these guys think so and not only do they think so they think it's okay to then file a trademark for streamlabs obs and why is this a big deal well basically we came to figure out that not only was streamlabs obs lazily copying people but they were also trying to poach traffic using the fact that the two names are very similar obs and streamlabs obs and people might mistake them for being affiliated for example when you type in obs to google i think they just removed this ad just today because of the backlash but streamlabs was running ads on the keyword obs so their thing would pop up even though the real open broadcast software is down here again these are not affiliated i can't believe that i still have to point that out but i feel like people are still going to be confused right because if i all of a sudden take the mcdonald's franchise name and i call it coffees mcdonald's and maybe i copy their interior layout and make a couple changes right you're gonna assume that those two things are affiliated and especially if i run ads on mcdonald's and show you my mcdonald's thing and i do all the same things i don't know i'd say it's fair to say that i'm trying to use the mcdonald's name in order to profit off it now obviously it's a little bit different because obs is an open source project but nevertheless i don't think anyone likes the fact that streamlabs obs is trying to basically poach their notoriety and then monetize it because yes ladies and gentlemen that's a big part of the story stream labs has been endlessly trying to get money from their users while the actual obs has been free to use forever this is just another wrinkle in this whole story streamlabs apparently was even signing people up to subscribe to their like premium service or whatever without even letting them know and then making it extremely hard to cancel so yeah these people have been doing horrible things forever but that's only the start of what's been going on here and i hope you understand why i'm like so crazy mad about this whole thing is that i literally supported this company i downloaded their product literally due to their lies right or their you know implied lie about being streamlabs obs i literally thought they were affiliated and many people like myself thought this too now the stories kept coming out after obs and lightstream told their story it was pretty much all the companies getting together like a superhero movie here we have warpworld saying that they reached out to us when our startup was barely born about our cryptocurrency donation service one up coin with a let's collaborate to bring this to more people tone only then to take everything discussed and doing it themselves as pioneers so we feel this and then elgato jumped in the fray as well saying that they also got copied by streamlabs they create the famous stream deck and streamlabs copied it with control your live stream from your phone with the streamlabs stream deck so streamlabs pretty much their mo is they take other people's products and innovation and they attach streamlabs in front of it and then they make money off of it that's that's the whole thing oh and here's another example and i know it just seems like everyone's just dunking on stream labs but this is what happens when you try to steal people's work for years and get away with it streamlabs also reached out to this guy he has a company called join combo which allowed you to like create twitch clips on the fly and turn them into tick tock videos he says they were also copied that they basically asked a lot of prodding questions about joint combo only to launch a copy of their product a few months later not only that then streamlabs employees started coming forward and saying that people in the company started talking about how bad these situations were internally and what did streamlabs do they fired them they fired the people talking about how aggressive and manipulative these practices were this is from one of their employees apparently so many people in marketing were reprimanded put on pip plans and fired for speaking up against unethical business practices to the point where they basically got rid of the entire marketing team by late 2018 by the way the irony of having to fire the marketing team who are usually the most aggressive in pushing towards you know like crazy claims and stuff like that that when you're marketing team's basically saying hey hey hey hey hey we gotta be kind of honest that's when you know that's when you know you've gone too far but this could have something to do with the fact that when streamlabs was acquired by logitech they were given compensation based on meeting certain revenue goals so we know they were pushed to go ahead and cr go out and you know generate x number of dollars so that you know the ceos and whoever owned it would get compensated this was actually pointed out to me by a user named shannon on twitter and here's the source an additional payout of 29 million dollars may be made if streamlabs meets certain established revenue growth targets this is right after they were acquired so pretty much from the get-go all the wrong incentives were there people were getting fired for speaking up and pretty much this company has had a practice of stealing other people's work and trying to monetize it and profit from it not only that poaching other people's traffic but honestly it goes back even further than the logitech acquisition see and this is where the rabbit hole really starts it actually goes back to 2016 with the ftc see before streamlabs was ever known as stream labs they were known as something called vulcan okay and apparently their owners were doing some really shady stuff according to this ftc complaint and eventually settlement what vulcan had done was basically they bought out a mobile game company replaced it with their own like chrome extension and were bypassing android security features to install a bunch of products people didn't want onto their phone and they eventually settled the charge with the ftc basically admitting guilt these are their founders that's what they were doing the game was called running fred and according to the complaint quote they used it to install a different app commandeer people's computers and bombard them with ads so actually if you're hearing about this news it turns out it's completely consistent with these people's mo signing people up for subscriptions they don't want stealing other people's work and then trying to backpack on top of that in order to make money and steal traffic this is literally what they've been doing from the very beginning it's just coming out now that it's the same company and they've been doing it to everybody so yes ladies and gentlemen even though i'm not usually the type to take a big grand stand about something like this and frankly it's not that big of a grandstand because you know streamlabs obs is a terrible piece of software anyways it's way behind where actual obs is and there's a ton of alternatives also to their alerts system like stream elements but i would make a stand about something like this either way even if stream labs was the best game in town because honestly you can't put up with something like this this company it's not like it was a bad employee in fact it seems like it was the opposite they fired all their good employees and left all the bad ones who didn't question their unethical business practices i cannot support or have my company even tangentially affiliated with this so i personally am removing myself from their ecosystem i think i still have their software still installed on my computer i'll be uninstalling it and i encourage everyone to do the same because this is not the case of you know a joke told 12 years ago that has nothing to do with the company this is the company's core product this is the company's core values this is the company's core business practices for literally years i mean all of their products a lot of them you can trace directly back to somebody else's work and them just stealing it now real quick i want to jump in here and also add i forgot it in the first recording of this the cs go part that i mentioned earlier see vulcan back when it was their name still this is once again back in 2016. reports came out that they actually bought or co-owned the cs go jackpot thing and they lied to people about it they said no we didn't but their allegations that in fact they had a strategic partnership running some of these cs go websites now i wanna just say for fairness that it is true that the co-founders who started vulcan and eventually twitch alerts which eventually became streamlabs are technically gone from the company but you've seen the same practices going on where there's always they're getting into the shadiest stuff denying it until they can no longer deny it i also want to add that streamlabs did issue a formal statement saying the following we are taking immediate action to remove obs from our name streamlabs obs is built upon the top of the obs open source platform streamlabs obs is also open source and our code is publicly available we take responsibility for our actions and support the community so there you go not really an apology they don't they don't say sorry but also not really enough either at least for me personally this goes much beyond just the use of streamlabs as a name and also you could have taken responsibility for this when obs originally asked you three years ago not to use their name and confuse people it seems like literally this statement is only because they got caught which of course it is it's always about that right and i think as eposvox mentioned he's a he's a great youtuber you should go check him out he always talks about obs streaming stuff like that he mentioned that look i mean how do you really take accountability for a lifelong practice of stealing work right what are you gonna give it all back are you gonna undo all the logitech deal right so it doesn't really make sense and for me it's really unsatisfying so yeah just wanted to add that quick context back to the video so to say i'm disgusted would be an understatement but it's pretty amazing to watch this thing go down and again i know internally they're probably gonna blame it on oh this is cancel culture man this is this is just you know people wanting to witch hunt i think i saw their ceo or former ceo talking about this no this isn't a witch hunt this is people finally becoming aware of who you've always been this isn't losing your reputation in five minutes it's people finally figuring out what you've been doing all along i mean literally since your inception so that's basically it what a wild ride this has been i'm sure given how much has come out in the last 24 hours we'll be seeing more come out and i'll keep you guys in the loop about that if you want to subscribe pump the stock anyway thanks for watching [music] but things will be different if i was bawling
