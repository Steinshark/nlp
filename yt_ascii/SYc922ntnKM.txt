i spent nearly a quarter million dollars investing in framework a laptop company with a mission to change the game by providing full user upgradability and serviceability in the name of right to repair and environmentalism and i promised them and you that my role as an investor in their company would be to keep an eye on things even going so far as to publicly call them out and dump them if they dared betray my trust no matter how much it ended up costing me well guess what it's been a year and a lot has changed so how is framework holding up has it been smooth sailing or are they on stormy seas like a pirate looking for a segway to his sponsor ridge ridge wallet has redefined the traditional wallet with its compact frame and rfid blocking plates the bulge in your pants shouldn't be from your wallet use offer code linus to save 10 and get free worldwide shipping australians huh let's start with the good since we last covered them framework has populated their store with replacement parts for pretty much every component of their laptop including drop-in replacement motherboards with 12th gen intel cpus to see how easy this migration process is then i will be upgrading my framework to a new motherboard but of course we aren't going to be tossing this perfectly good 11th gen motherboard that would be a waste we're going to use it to to make a whole other mini pc using components from frameworks marketplace i'm going to start by pulling out my ssd wireless card sewed in memory modules and i guess that's it i start pulling out the board unplug the battery unplug the battery you say no that doesn't really seem like a good idea boop let's just start ripping it open right i actually stopped using my framework laptop for a little while and the short version of the story is that we were going to do a video where we spilled coke right across the keyboard of like five different laptops including my daily driver and then went through the process of repairing all of them to compare parts and service manual availability and costs and then we didn't get around to it so my personal machine this one has actually been sitting on the pending project shelf for like three months and just because i'm invested in framework doesn't mean i don't still love test driving other devices i've been playing around with the new ryzen 6000 version of the flow x13 from asus and it is mostly pretty amazing is that really all there was to it we've got the board out already which one's which they can make it repairable but they can't make it idiot proof it shouldn't surprise me because i've already built one of these things but this is shockingly painless i think if you were experienced like if you were upgrading a whole fleet of these things you could probably perform this operation in like five minutes as with any startup framework has not been perfect according to the community the most common issues with their 11th gen model where'd it go here it is our battery drain during sleep failing track pads and a weak hinge for the screen now that last one can be easily addressed with frameworks hinge upgrade that now ships with all new laptops and hello ah there it is we also got one to upgrade my old machine as for the track pads once again those can easily be repaired by the user so you don't need to send your laptop away and be completely computerless just to get a replacement trackpad however while you can just fix it yourself isn't an excuse for bad quality assurance because that wastes both time and money for framework and for you also the more parts that fail the more e-waste gets created which is against their goal framework acknowledges this on their blog though and says that they are focused on ironing out the kinks by the way we have finally ironed out the kinks on the ltt screwdriver make sure to sign up for an in-stock notification because it's coming real soon as for the battery drain well that one is a bit more complicated an ultra portable laptop isn't really ultra portable if you need to have a charger with you all the time and other publications have seen similarly spec and sized options from dell and acer getting anywhere from 50 to 100 more battery life per charge the problem seems to be due to the expansion cards and while framework has issued some beta bios updates hoping to remedy the issue it remains not completely resolved as of filming exacerbating the problem on linux intel doesn't have proper support for their deepest s3 sleep state on the penguin flavored operating system putting an ugly stain on framework's otherwise excellent support record with the open source community an amd variant might be a way around this but in spite of me making introductions nearly a year ago i haven't received any update from either side so consider this a public call out amd and framework if you guys want to be seen as companies that care about consumer choice you've got to walk the walk get your collective acts together so that we can have ryzen in our frameworks please like seriously don't you want to be part of this amd compared to my early unit not only has the hinge been upgraded but there's also a reinforced back panel so i'll be upgrading mine as we go here and this is really cool because even framework benefits from their own modularity they don't actually have to re-engineer a whole laptop chassis to improve their build quality they can just swap the parts that they send to the assembly line and make these kinds of upgrades on the fly do they really need a stronger back panel i guess there were other benefits as well though i've never actually had the back panel part so this is kind of cool i wonder how hard this is to do i am extremely frustrated that i do not know where these screws came from this is really really bothering me a lot here's a spot where one of these screws is there's some here okay so it's definitely a framework screw but i have absolutely no idea where it came from do you want a part straight that seems unnecessary doesn't it i'll just remember these are all screen screws i will need my old camera module then whoa what just happened [music] this ribbon cable stays there we go like that sure shoot how was this in here oh i would strongly recommend paying attention to how it was assembled i genuinely cannot figure out how to get this ribbon cable in here hold on ah yes there we go i can put the new hinges on this as well great okay i guess part of that is going to be removing the old hinges no no the display yeah the display cables here so that can come out also oh darn it i cable managed in the wi-fi antennas and they need to come off now be really careful with these super fragile little connectors you can rip them off the board of the wi-fi module and then good luck repairing that if we just kind of go like this was this really so bad is the new one better wow that that's pretty stiff this boy goes here i didn't keep track of screws again that seems right oh crap i forgot about the wi-fi things i would say that the back panel upgrade is a little finickier than the motherboard upgrade for the benefit that i'm getting which is an increase in stiffness and more recycled aluminum remember how i said i definitely don't need a parts tray where are all the screws okay hold on hold on display cable here we go right no wait what is this what the hell is this cable oh no which ones are the screws for the display now whatever it is i need four of them i hope that a third-party accessory ecosystem can develop further dbrand shout out by the way does offer their protective skins and there are generic carry cases that fit the framework pretty well but what owners really want is more variety in the modules there is a small community of people creating custom designs thanks to frameworks open documentation but their official lineup kinda lacking no full sd card reader no powered amplifier not even a dual usb c card and worst of all no ethernet port oh actually they're making one wait oh do we have one oh shut up wait what all is in here sometimes it's good to be a backer an idea diary thanks framework this was definitely good use of time this on the other hand was good use of time oh wow how is this going to work one moment please you want me to use the orange bezel it really does look like a toy i'm sorry framework i'm not into the orange bezel but i'm i'm sure someone is that one's good that one's good ah yes my bezel's now on there's the new hinge right right i should put the keyboard back on how many extra screws do i have good god that's a lot these are all from that so i'm sure it's fine they're not framework laptop might have a percussive rattle oh no what did i do the keyboard is not installed yet that should fix that let's get this battery connected for such a simple operation this has been very scattered i'm sorry that goes in there oh yes assembled no longer recovery did i set a bit locker on this damn thing come on [laughter] so bitlocker is going to ask you for your key which is on your old motherboard so we need to set this up right now this though is a perfect opportunity to talk about what i'm going to be doing with my old framework motherboard this right here is a 3d printed case for the framework motherboard that they provide the schematics for there are also community designed ones so that you can take your old system and turn it into a slim desktop i would say that threading a tiny little laptop screw into 3d printed plastic ah not the best i mean it's working to its credit like motherboard is not coming out here we go yes how do you access the power switch i don't know chopstick give me that give me that hdmi i want that hdmi okay hey wifi majigs maybe i'll use this for the temporary setup for the lan center at home we haven't got the pcs for the rack yet so i've just got some laptops and stuff in there but i could totally see myself just using one of these for the time being i'm gonna do a little tour of it as an exclusive behind the scenes for floatplane by the way it's not worth a full video but you can go see it over on floatplane.com if you subscribe this is a 2070 and i like this one because it's super compact this is actually the one that i used to use for travel oh maybe there's like a chassis intrusion thing that you have to disable yeah this continues to not wait did it need a bios update to support this mode shoot i just spit on it damn it it looks like i'm running an older version of the 11th gen motherboard firmware that doesn't allow it to boot without a battery installed so our devious plan is to jankily connect the battery from the framework laptop here that is fully assembled i mean at this point you know what it might actually be easier to just pull the battery out of the chassis because it's like three screws come on baby you can okay there's just a little bit of lip there yeah oh there we go and then they have a chassis intrusion detection thing here and then maybe the switch will work look at that let's take things one step further and maybe grab the built-in display cable i am going to power it down what it's on oh gosh sorry there's so much glare on the screen from that light i couldn't see that so i needed to not hold down that thing then that might have been it's all right the hinged that might have been the hinge detection sure wait wait shut up this is two and a half gig no way yup it's two and a half gig land okay do you have any idea where to get the firmware or did you just not prepare for this video i had no idea that there would be more firmware to get so i need to go get my bitlocker recovery key before i update my bios and before i put my drive into the new motherboard here we go starting our firmware update we rebooted and we're back to the red lights flashing when i hold this thing it goes green and blue over here which is interesting the problem is that it specifically says hey don't like power off your computer or anything because i'm flashing the firmware so i have no idea how long to leave this thing like this how many blinks though oh boy this is a big list the code will blink white then 12 blinks that are red or green than orange this is not what we've been seeing i mean it can't have taken that long to update the firmware so i'm going for it before we go for anything let me read and it's off oh zone it fired up without me holding down the thing this time which might indicate that we have the new firmware on it sure well i don't know oh oh whoa hey okay okay it's doing the update all right good success i still don't know how the crap you're supposed to power it on are you really supposed to just like take off the cover and freaking like press this button is that circle thing the power button like does it have a little rod sticking out of it nope nope not even a little oh wait it totally does nice david this is freaking awesome and because it's a framework and they've got all their modules things that you might not have needed when you were using it as a mobile device like say a full-size displayport connection can be added once you're using it as a desktop now that we've got everything resolved with the old board then we can go ahead and get the new one fired up i wouldn't actually recommend this for a thin and light notebook not because the performance isn't great but because it doesn't exactly sip power but i just want to get the thing fired up and i haven't gotten around to transferring the other ssd back over here yet closes up like that held in place by magnets this is actually legitimately super cool yes the main board upgrade was pretty expensive it was over a thousand dollars but it's also a 1280p core i7 that's a freaking expensive cpu and of course it has all of the other components on it as well if i were to buy a full-on brand new laptop with that level of hardware i'd be spending a lot more than that and i wouldn't have been able to repurpose my old laptop like this obviously i could sell it but this is way more flexible i'm able to just buy only the things i need to bring my machine up to date and reuse everything that i already have touchpad keyboard screen webcam my modules subject of modules i'm actually going to swap out this hdmi module for a displayport module right now oh wait no that's not actually what i want to do i'm dumb what i want to do is plug displayport into this hey hey look at that obviously not many people have these external thunderbolt gpu enclosures but i said way back when they came out over the long term yeah they're expensive but they might not actually be a completely stupid investment this is cool is this not cool pretty it's pretty damn cool we got a little sidetracked having fun with the desktop build but let's put the product aside and talk about what framework has done to improve their efforts around environmentalism and right to repair first up they've launched an option to pay a hundred dollars to make your order carbon neutral through donations to carbon sequestration efforts i'm not entirely convinced that buying carbon credits is a true path towards the greener future but they also continue to find ways to introduce more post-consumer materials in the construction of their laptops their new backplate for example is made of 75 recycled aluminum while also being stronger compared to 50 from the old one that's the kind of effort that you only make if you actually care so thanks guys there's still room to do better so why don't we call this progress as for right to repair well it's one thing to offer replacement components but it's quite another to allow end users and independent repair shops to repair the components themselves friend of the channel and right to repair advocate lewis rossman has spoken at length about the importance of making schematics available and thanks to his advocacy and others schematics are available to repair shops fully available which no company has ever done for lewis's repair shop most companies avoid providing schematics to maintain an influence over their products by making deeper repairs too difficult to be economically viable this behavior is present across all major pc manufacturers and getting those chip giants to change would take a massive legislative action that is well beyond frameworks capabilities at this point in time so i guess we'll call this one a work in progress as well what is the future of the company well in february they secured' million in series a funding led by a company called spark capital and framework is using the funds for development of upcoming product categories and the long roadmap of new modules and geographic expansion for the framework laptop so given that i don't know anything other than what that says there i would say i guess we'll see what's next all i know for now is that i'm still happy with what framework's doing and i'm pretty happy with my upgrade here we started with a pedestrian quad-core cpu and upgraded all the way to a 14 core in the same chassis i don't think that's ever happened in a mobile device like this unlike apple who believe it or not intentionally even though they changed almost nothing about the main board design or the chassis prevents motherboard swaps between their nearly identical m1 and m2 laptop shelves framework on the other hand allowed me to spend hundreds of dollars less than what a brand new top spec machine would have cost with all of their newer more robust components and i still have these leftovers at the end that i can turn into a 3d printed mini pc running an 11th gen cpu it's a pretty sick little setup sick
