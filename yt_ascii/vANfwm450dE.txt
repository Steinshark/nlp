let me ask the last the silliest there may be the most important question what is the meaning of life what gives your life fulfillment / happiness me from a scientific point of view the meaning of life is the propagation of dna but that's not what i feel that's not the meaning of my life so the meaning of my life is something which is probably different from yours and differ from other people's but we each make our own meaning so we we have we set up goals we want to achieve we want to write a book we want to do whatever it is we do writer quartet we want to win a football match and these are these are short-term girls well may begin quite long term goals which are set up by our brains which have goal seeking machinery built into them but what we feel we don't feel motivated by the desire to pass on our dna mostly we have other other goals which can be very moving very important they could even be called as called spiritual in some cases we want to understand the riddle of the universe we want to understand consciousness we want to understand how the brain works these are all noble goals some of them can be noble goals anyway and they are a far cry from the fundamental biological goal which is the propagation of dna but the machinery that enables us to set up these higher level goals is originally programmed into us by natural selection of dna the propagation of dna but what do you make of this unfortunate fact that we are mortal do you ponder your mortality does it make you sad this is i i ponder it it would it makes me sad that i shall have to leave and not see what's going to happen next if there's something frightening about mortality apart from sort of missing as i said something more deeply darkly lightning it's the idea of eternity but eternity is only frightening you feel their eternity but before we were born billions of years before we were born and we were effectively dead before we were born as i think was mark twain said i was dead for billions of years before i was born and never suffered the smallest inconvenience that's how i was going to be afterward after we leave so i think of it as really it eternity is a frightening prospect and so the best way to spend it is under a general anaesthetic which is what it'll be beautifully put richard there's a huge honour to meet you to talk to you thank you so much for your time thank you very much you
