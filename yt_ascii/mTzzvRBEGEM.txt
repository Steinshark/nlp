you're if i may say so one of the richest people in the world so you're a good person ask does money buy happiness no it's been shown that between once you get over a basic level of income so that you can take care of the pain then you know you can health and whatever there's no correlation between the level of happiness that one has and the level of money that one has they that would think that has the highest correlation is quality relationships with others community if you look at surveys of these things across all surveys and all societies it's a sense of community and per interpersonal relationships that is not in any way correlated with money you can go down to native tribes in you know very poor places or you can go in all different communities and so they have the opportunity to have that i'm very lucky in that i started with nothing so i had the full range i can tell you i you know i not having money but but and then having quite a lot of money and i you know i did that in the right order i'll tell you started from nothing in long island yeah and my dad was a jazz musician but i but i had all really that i needed because i had two parents who loved me and took good care of me and i went to a public school that was a good public school and basically you know that you don't need much more than that in order to that's the equal opportunity part anyway what i'm saying is no i experienced the range and else and there are many studies on the answer to your question no money does not bring happiness bring money gives you an ability to make choices does it get in the way in any way of forming those deep meaningful relationships it can there are lots of ways that it makes negative that's one of them it could stand in the way of that yes okay but i could almost list the ways that it could stand it could be a problem yeah what does it i so if you can elaborate you mention a bit of freedom at the most fundamental level it doesn't take a whole lot but it takes enough that you can take care of your yourself and your family to be able to learn do the basics of have the relationships have healthcare the basics of those types of things you know you can cover the patients and then to have maybe enough security but maybe not too much security that's right yeah that you essentially are okay okay that is that's really good and you don't that's what a that's what money will get you and everything else is could go either way well there's more there's more okay then beyond that what it then starts to do that's the most important thing yes but beyond that what its tensta much to do is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways okay so for example now i i you know look at my case it's a those dreams might not be just my own dreams they're their impact on others dreams okay so my own dreams might be i don't know i can pass along these at my stage in life i could press along these principles to you and i can give those they or i could do whatever i can go on an adventure i can start a business i can do those other things be productive i can self actualize in ways that might be not possible otherwise and so that's that's my own belief and then in a dot and i could also help others i mean this is you know to the extent when you get older and with time and whatever rarey you start to feel connected spiritual spirituality is what i'm referring to you can start to have an effect on others that's beneficial and so on gives you the ability i could tell you that people who are very wealthy who have that a feel that they don't have enough money bill gates will feel almost broke because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish and through the gates foundation and things like that you know oh my god he doesn't have enough money to accomplish the things he wishes for but those things are not you know they're not the most fundamental things so i think that people sometimes think money has value money doesn't have value the money is like you say just a medium of exchange at a store all the well and so what you have to say is what is it that you're going to buy now there are other people who get their gratification in ways that are different from me but i think in many cases that let's say somebody who used money to have a status symbol i what would i say or that's probably unhealthy but then i don't know somebody who says i love a great gorgeous painting and it's going to cost lots of money in my priorities mecan't not can't get there but but that doesn't mean i don't who am i to judge others in terms of let's say their element of the freedom to those things so it's a little bit complicated but by and large that you know that's my view on money and wealth you
