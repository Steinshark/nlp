so hello everybody i am here with gutier pierrozak gaucier is a lover of symbolism you know very fascinating person in himself and he went on a very a really exciting journey to dive into and discover the works of luis charbonneau lasse many people don't if you might not know about him he was an early 20th century symbolist very important influential but because of the war and because of many things that were happening around him some of his work got lost and some of it got forgotten there is an english version of his main work that we know about which is the bestiary of christ a highly edited version his french version is quite longer and more is fuller and gautier is now involved in a new publication called the vulnerary of christ in which this is shabano's work on the symbolism of the five wounds of christ and just how universal they are and how extended that language kind of becomes in christianity and so it's a very it's a very fascinating book to be published right now a very important one and so i'm really looking forward to diving into his discovery of shabano and also and also the work itself [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] and so gautier maybe you can start off very simply and tell us how you became interested in the work of shabonu lasse yes thanks for inviting me to your to your podcast i i've been very interested in symbolism and christian symbolism in particular since i was very young i was introduced to this through the fact that i lived in france i lived in a little tiny village with a church that was over a thousand years old and they were symbols engraved on the outside of the church and of course it started my cursity and that i kept you know there's a lot of people who were along the way who who advised me to read which book and that book and over the years i was becoming more interested in the the bigger aspect of symbolism it's not just limited to to christianity it's just the way i'm looking at it it is a language based on intuition you use symbolism when you cannot express with words some concepts that are just divine or and and the best example and i'm gonna bring that back later is the concept of infinity our brain cannot comprehend infinity we can get close to it we can use with words we can try to explain but we cannot define it i think symbolism allows you to go a step above with communication of this concept and i'm sure you you you understand there's patterns surrounding us that that cannot be explained but we can feel them intuitively so that was my approach i also have kind of a specialty my brain sees in colors i see letters in colors i see depth when i listen to music so i realized after a while it's i think it's a known condition that i have already in my brain a wire that bypasses language and so that's why i really appreciate symbolism so in the process i was reading ronagno she's a a parent a parent niallist in france and found out that he was involved with a christian publication in the early mid 1920s called regnabit was a periodical monthly where it was dedicated to the sacred heart of jesus everything about it from doctrines symbol arts philosophy poetry anything and within this periodical was a gentleman named luis charbonneau lassie that started engraving for the periodical he was doing the the the wooden engravings and they would print these symbols these representations that's how he started okay participating in 1921 i believe it was after a while he started writing articles about some of his findings so what's very interesting is that luisa bonolesi was born in'71 so he's a 19th century kind of old-school gentleman he joined early i think he was 11 years old when he joined a christian school he stayed there constantly and and wanted to become a priest and he just became a teacher in that school started trying to become a priest and in 1903 a law in france just separated a church from the state officially and the the the congregation he was part of was disappeared simply disappeared so he ended up being back in into the secular life if you want and at that time and it is so interesting how little details can change some people's lives one of his teachers at the congregation he was part of was also an archaeologist or maybe early at that time they were kind of digging around and finding stuff they didn't expect they would dig under old stones you know standing stones they would find skeletons and a lot of old artifacts and he became very interested in this i have some old writing of his where in the early 1900s he was actually exploring underground caves where people during the past wars religious wars and they were hiding and they would leave artifacts behind so it's an interesting aspect because he became an archaeologist which is a scientist while being truly a christian true christian and by the way a catholic but very interested in all sorts of symbolism so he he found on his own all these artifacts he started questioning why he was finding there was really a lot of representation of christ through animals through all sorts of symbols and that's what the history of crash is really interesting in so fast forward in the 1920s he became part of that periodical regnabit and he started using his finding archaeological findings to write about the symbolism of christian artifacts so he would talk about the lion he would talk about the the bull and he would also explore and that's the interesting part for the vulnerary all the symbolism of the heart of jesus and his biggest mystery for him is how come i'm finding artifacts that are hundreds of years they were showing the heart of jesus even though the doctrine of the sacred heart only appeared in the in the 17th century so that's where his own quest started there and it took us and we'll talk about it if you want very deep in this book yeah and so he he was working in collaboration even until i guess the end of i don't know who who passed away first but until the end of their lives he worked in collaboration with guinea yes in this kind of rediscovery of symbolism yeah and and this is what kind of led to the the bestiary and so he really is a i would say one of them he was one of the key figures in the sense that there was a lot of symbolism thinking happening obviously at the end of the 19th and early 20th century but a lot of it was in the in the stranger world the world of the kind of esoteric world and the world of and all of these kinds of worlds but but shabbat unless they really wanted to frame his understanding of symbolism with within his catholicism and society yeah yeah i call that he's he was an auto doc catholic orthodox catholic he was very very careful not to to steer into occultism isotherism and all that however him and genome became really good friends so as i mentioned through different people who knew each other they were introduced and charbonneau and genome met geno went to his house in lewdown and saw all his artifacts and in fact when you what you see through their correspondence until the from 1924 to [music] 1946 when shabo no lasse died before geno was helping shabono by providing findings of his about christian symbolism he would give him everything he would even support the publication of the bestiary of christ even though genoa at that time was a muslim he would give everything to shabonu because he thought that was an extraordinary project in fact he was asking shabono for his opinion on christian symbolism and shabono would ask geno for other traditions interpretation because one symbol can be interpreted many ways depending on the context so it was an interesting collaboration of respect however they would keep their ground separate yeah separate because charbonneau even though you know talking about geno even though he is clearly catholic and orthodox he's also not afraid to point to the places where these similar structures appear in other cultures he's not also kind of a correct he's not close-minded and focused only on his thing but really sees through the christian lands even some symbolism coming from ancient pagan cultures or from other cultures as well yeah and i think that came from his archaeology background but also from genome i have actually we'll talk about this later but i have you know all these archives that shabano left behind and there is hundreds of notes of when he met with genome and they talked about this subject or another it was fascinating this is the indiana jones now part of the story so tell us what happened to his work and and also your part in rediscovering it yeah so you asked me earlier and i never answered how i found out about shabunu so i was reading genome and i was talking to some friends of mine who say hey you should buy the best theory of christ so that was mid-90s and so i did i purchased the bestiary of christ and found it fascinating i read it from beginning to and even though it looks like kind of a dictionary almost every every animal is is listed with a symbol and based on but i read it as a whole and i came out of this book with a very strange feeling and i don't know how the english version is it's been shortened yeah that's a product yeah there's a project of doing a new version i'll be involved as well we're going to translate the whole thing but after i finished reading the book i was i had a kind of a an experience of suddenly i was looking outside and i loved being in the woods and all that and everything suddenly i realized everything could symbolize christ the the the grant not just the man but the the god of nature yeah with the nature basically that's right so we started with the animals and it just blew my mind and i wanted to know more so that's when i started doing some of my own research i had some access to geno's letters that an italian scholar pierre luigi socatelli had published he published a few books so i contacted this gentleman and we became friends and and that's how i learned through him and and that shabono had planned to write other books the best year was one of several he was going to write another book about the symbolism of the plants and vegetable vegetables for that represent christ in any way possible and then third book about minerals but that's not it what i found out through the archives he was going to write books about other items there were anything liturgic objects planets and stars it was anything that could exist which represent christ and that's kind of an interesting approach to instead of hypothetism when you cannot express god god without talking negatively about him he took another approach with the infinity of god is expressed to the infinity of all the manifestation everything on earth and the universe i thought it was fascinating i've never seen that before and that's that's been my passion so i was wondering and that's where it was interesting what happened to those archives so i was actually walking at that time it was early 2010 with the genome happily i was gathering all the writing of genome and all these letters because i was i was just curious and in the process they shared with me some letters they had of shabu no lasse they were kept in cairo in egypt where genome finished his life and they shared those letters with me so i could i had them in my hand and i was reading the letters and i realized there was that book the vulnerability of christ that he finished just before his death he was very old he was in late 70s he was complaining to gain on that his eyes didn't work very well the publishing company had lost a lot of his engravings he had to redo 60 or 70 of those it was it was fascinating and he was telling the whole table of content of the book and it was very interesting because what i found out is that that book had been stolen after his death we don't know the condition we don't know anything but somebody came to the people who owned all the archives of shabono and he borrowed the manuscript saying he was going to publish it and he was never found again wow yeah so what i did i tracked those archives i contacted the family so they shared a lot of things with me but they didn't have those outcasts and this brings us to a very mysterious and kind of indiana jones story is that i don't know if you know that but there is somebody who helped chabono with the symbolism of the middle age middle a medieval symbolism of the sacred heart and all these symbols in the bestiary one of charbonneau's mentor he was a a priest nearby named theophil i may have a picture of him i'll share that with you for the audience and this gentleman was very old shabano was helping him just like he was very helping him with his with his day-to-day kind of he he couldn't write so he would write for him he was very old and that gentleman theophil babo shared with shabonu that he was part of a an organization of christians called and that was kind of an organization of a few people i'm not going to say a secret organization because that's really not fair but kind of an organization of a few people who who were carrying archives from the middle age it was very strange and it's it's it and they shared their information with shabono so he could write about it because the content wasn't in line with what chabun was studying the symbolism of animals the symbolism of the the sacred hearts so they gaven they this old man gave him their archives to study and he they also had carried through the middle age some kind of a night knighthood ritual it was called the chevalier du parkly the the the knights of the holy spirit if you want just some kind of a group of people like that would protect that knowledge and they made charbonneau he transmitted to shabono the basically that the right to make new nights that's why he was included he was brought into this yes yes so after his death he left all his archives to the few of those knights that still lived at the time and they were by the way friends of renegade so it was a small group their goal and i found out in the letter was to use the archives to finish the work of shambanu they're gonna finish the book about the the the plants the book about the minerals and but they they didn't the the group died everybody it didn't survive it just just invisible yeah that's what i hear so those archives were still in the position of the last of those nights i think is a friend of the last of the night after he died in 1999 sold those archives to publishers in italy it's just strange interestingly the owner of those archives was the one who published the bestiary of christ in in the 80s or 70s in the french version there was a facsimile his name was laszlo tops he was the director of the arcade editions and he's the one i've met and first he showed them to me so i could consult and he wanted he was supporting me he wanted me to help reconstitute the books because he was 80 years old when i met him he passed he passed away a few weeks ago yeah and he and in the end i negotiated hey can i can i own them can i buy them from you so we agreed on the price but i could not afford that price because first my wife didn't want me to spend my money on that garbage and i respected that so what i did is i said well what if i did a crowdfunding project okay where i asked all the traditionalists around the world to hold on i think my dog wants to come join us to to see if they wanted to help and they did and we did that 2016 i started the crowd crowdfunding project and in two weeks i had the money two weeks so i i bought the archives it was sent to me and now i have i mean hundreds of folders and i'm going to share that with you it's really i'm going to show you a little bit so for example this one is about the byzantine lazy yeah yeah intimacy presents so it has these notes so it's just so it's made of so it's interesting because we're talking about the 1930s 1940s so this is shipping paper it was recycling paper that was used yeah originally that symbol was for the mountain okay buddy the content became yeah so we have something yeah yeah and it's at the back of letters so you can see i may have some renegade on this 100 of them then he he talks about the contents and so it's been plenty of notes so it's all organized by symbol and then there is yeah like he would recycle some some of his own writings and there's some beautiful things so it's foreign artists and and for an artist it is an extraordinary mind of information and inspiration so what i've decided to do and that's important you may not know that in exchange for the forgetting the funds my goal is to share that with everybody so for the past three years i have scanned every single of those archives and they are now available there's about 40 000 notes for everyone i have a website called i'll i'll give you the link achieve shabonolase.org and you can have access to everything so that's my role is to share that's really what it is it's amazing so but there's a lot of so you've been able to scan the entire archives and yeah these are all his engravings all the drawings are his yes all of them and then i even have some some some things i'm going to show you so it's beautiful like he did some engravings of the holy land yeah nice yeah this is the this is called the rosa mystica 1923 yeah some of the these are more stylized very beautiful yes they are they are and then he has it's funny he was keeping track of all his engravings he's done thousands in sheets that you would just print them so you would remember what you had uh-huh right right yeah this is one of the underground he was exploring when he was these 19 yeah it's caves so there's some of that there's some all kind of all kind of stuff it's it's just incredible it's just incredible and there's a museum in france shabo no lasse it's in luda they have inherited all well these archives went to the knights of the paraklet everything he found archaeologically wise is at a museum in in luda so i contacted them and we became really close they gave me access to they kept they still have the engravings the pieces of wood wow that he engraved with a knife he was done with a knife and it's it's it's fascinating so now the books or the vulnerary were you able to recover the manuscript or did you reconstruct it good question i'm still not so so that's going back to the indiana jones so when i when i saw in the letters he sent again on the table of content and i realized i had a lot of because even for the best theory a lot of the chapters were published separately in the periodical over 10 years he had he modified them a little later but he done the same with the the content of vulnerary okay and and so i was i started collecting everything he published because i found some stuff from the 1910s some 1936. it was all over but because i had the table of content i knew what to look for so i had to reconstitute some of it and i had to and i was able to reuse some of what he published but my original goal was i'm going to publish a reconstituted vulnerary it doesn't matter if it's accurate i want the person who stole it to come out and say hey this is not right i have the manuscript it never happened never happened no never happened i don't know where it is huh well it's a strange world too it's a it's a it's a world of secrets so sometimes there are people involved in these circles that that find power and secrecy and so i agree i agree i agree and one of those is yeah it's being part of a group you i do not know what happened with that manuscript obviously the person who took it is probably not alive anymore this was another generation but i have hints i mean i have a name the goal is to my quest is not over that's astounding that's really amazing wow this is it's such a it's such a great story also because you know i also had my you know my interest in shabano of course early on when i became interested in symbolism you know because he was far more christian and far more and i was that that was the direction that i was taking and so obviously the bestiary was an important part of my kind of my formation and and even just the possibility of thinking about medieval symbolism and and i mean western's western medieval imagery is often more emblematic and so it's it's even more it's more easily interpreted in the way that you know would interpret symbolism almost in a geometric way and so i can really see i could really see how charbonneau and him would would come together quite quite well in terms of bringing out christian symbolism so this is so it's wonderful to see these books coming out and and also there are future projects that you're putting together i'm working on reconstituting the the lapidary of christ lapidary from stones and i've started so it's it's i am amazed at what he gathered i'm putting this together in french now of course he'll be translated in english after that because french is my original language it's also the all these notes are in french but right now just studying just the basic rock for example the rock symbolizes something that is indestructible right i even go even further think about the diamond diamond stone i'm writing an article about this i'll love to share it with you when it's published the diamond i don't know if you knew that but nobody knew how to cut a diamond until the 15th century when with technologies people were able to use diamonds to cut diamonds but back in the early ages a diamond was found in the rough and it was indestructible they could not break it the hammer would bounce off it and and you couldn't do anything and it's when it comes naturally that's the form of an octagon yeah kind of a diamond shape you know diamond that's why but when you look at the symbolism and i just finished studying this charbonneau identified that because the diamond stone is indestructible it symbolizes the the indivisibility god cannot be divided in fact i would say even further the god is without dimensions therefore you cannot cut it you cannot divide it you cannot measure it but that's what the diamond was symbolizing and and and what's interesting is that the diamond can only be cut by itself and if there were some old symbolism where the diamond was associated to jesus christ because the symbol you know when he was on the cross he let that happen to him so when you look at the old testament when moses uses staff to hate a rock and water comes out of it to to to help the the jews this is actually a configuration of christ on the cross where he he died to to redeem the world well what's interesting is you can see that a lot with the symbolism of the rock in the old testament mercies goes to the top of a mountain to go see god in the old legends the diamond could only be found in the eastern mountain at the very top okay and you put it on it makes sense yeah in terms of the symbolism makes sense like it's a heavenly stone almost yeah that's right and and the last thing is you know there's that story where uh the the builders they reject that stone that look like nothing and that becomes the stone that you use the capstone to finish a church or a vault or whatever so the capstone symbol end up symbolizing christ because he was rejected by anyone but he was the most precious stone of all where everything holds because of him so we found all manuscript medieval manuscripts or the shape of a diamond was put at the top of a vault the same way amazing yeah that's just one yeah it's an amazing joining of all the symbolism together because i remember that one of the insights that i got from guinea which is that the idea of the rejecting stone becomes the cornerstone that's how we used to understand it but you know really brought about the idea that no it's the it's the capstone or the arch you know it's the idea of this last stone that you put in which holds it together and i thought that's it and since then like there's no i could never interpret it differently it just it makes so much sense but the idea of having this diamond you know this image of the diamond at the top in in the in the vault is wonderful in terms of indivisibility and this heavenly stone that comes down that's great stuff yeah i'll send that to you that way you can show your audience i definitely definitely will so that's a very exciting project so you've got several exciting projects to to to to still work on yeah it's probably a lifetime and i probably won't finish it and i'll pass it on to somebody else and that's seems like that's what happened to me there was a generation who tried they started i have a lot of notes and all that from others passed it on to me i was able to publish the vulnerary and i'll try to continue and pass it on to others yeah it's wonderful and and you haven't had any you haven't had much resistance which is great like the the or maybe you have you didn't just didn't tell us well i'm i'm not very public you know i don't i mean when i talk to christians in general that friends of mine who don't understand symbolism they think it's paganism they think it's yeah all kind of stuff but yeah so i don't talk about this only with people who can understand now in private i have i'm walking right now with a small group in argentina who are christians they love symbolism and they are translating the venere right now so i'm helping them i'm sharing those archives with them and we're going to publish that one probably at the end of the year the spanish version of the veneer that's wonderful yeah i found that in south america there's some interesting in brazil as well there's a interesting resurgence of symbolic thinking which is which is definitely worth in being invested in yeah that's really amazing so and so you also i may be my last question because you mentioned that you were taught you were working with the guinea family as well in terms of of collating some of the letters is that a project you're still involved with so i did it for them no i'm not involved anymore there was a few years ago they had a kind of a they called a foundation where they would uh attempt to get basically they wanted to publish all the work of geno revised but the this project has stopped geno's work is going to be in the public domain next year january 2022 and i think at that time it's gonna be completely free-for-all basically everybody's gonna publish whatever they want unfortunately but i had access to all those letters of course there's a lot of confidentiality you know it's it's it's for them yeah but i yeah i had access to a lot of letters and by the way i have a website again where i actually put all the genomes work in french including the correspondence all the letters for all to access and this website has really means is 10 years old now it has thousands of visitors every day and i believe it helps bring genomes work to the masses if you want in some ways but really my i mean i live in the united states i've been here for 20 years my goal was to try to bring some of genome but mostly charbonneau lassies work to the anglo-saxon or the english-speaking world and that's i was very impressed when i mean angelico quest i don't know if you knew that when i tried to get my crowdfunding going on i sent a few emails in the united states a few people i knew one person who helped me was james cutsinger have you heard of james yeah i had friends i was friends with james cutsinger i made i made some even some pieces for the end of his life oh wow yeah yeah so he helped me very early on early in the 2000s when i was early i didn't even know about shabo no and all that but i was kind of guided towards the symbolism of the hearts yeah which is the center which is everything is one of those who helped me and when i contacted him to say hey i'm doing a crowdfunding crowdfunding he sent it to a few other people there's very few in the united states in north america you probably know them all but one of them was jean champu john shampoo who [music] could not why he offered instead of the crowdfunding to give me money he said what if i translate the vulnerary in english for you and that's what he did it took him years and and then he contacted angelico press we worked together we did another crowdfunding so we could pay for this but it went really well so it is definitely a walk of passion we don't do that for the money nobody buys this book you know it will never it won't it would be a better seller but it no no no we'll have it will have an impact i think so everybody you need to you need to get it i'm still working through it it's a it's a massive book it's heavily documented it has it has hundreds i think like at least a hundred images of all the different engravings that shabanola say has done so it's really a wonderful book and it's really like i said it's really in terms of my work a precursor someone who laid the foundation for symbolic thinking in the christian world and so we're we're very grateful for him and go to very grateful for the work you're doing and looking forward to seeing it continue to flower so thanks yeah no problem man i will send you the link to the archives and and never hesitate if you want me to look for something in the archives i'll i'll send them to you i was the other day you walked on that san christopher with a dog head located man yeah and i found out in these archives as well so i thought it was cool i remember seeing that image in the early bestiary edition like the french edition that that was actually probably the first time i ever saw that image was in charbonneau's early like the french edition the facsimile one that was like just it was it was massive that book yeah it was it was that's awesome yeah so so it's great and yeah for now like i think that yeah it's an opening for people to look into medieval symbolism and like i said for everybody who's interested in symbolism you know he was our he's our ancestor in in a spiritual way so so look into the vulnerary and the bestiary looking forward to the full publication of the book and all the future projects so thanks a lot now you're welcome thanks for having me
