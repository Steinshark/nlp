we're going to go back to a dark place freddy a very dark place place we haven't been to for about 10 years we're going back to minus of 12 i'm going to give you an astounding result i know this looks like a bit of mathematical hocus pocus sort of thing but actually the truth it's not and i tell you why we know it's not so we we we sort of told a story about the sum of the natural numbers i'll start for zero it doesn't really make much difference up to infinity which you know 0 + 1 + 2 plus three da all the way up to infinity we sort of told people that this should be equal to minus a 12th okay oh the equal sign the equal sign equal sign so right so so this is this is you know we upset a lot of people lots was said some of it was fair some of it was a load of rubbish i don't want to go into too much detail about my feelings about that but this we created a bit of controversy but we also got a lot of people interested in in these sort of questions so i think it i think it was worth doing anyway why have i decided to come back to this well about maybe a year and a half ago i saw a tweet which annoyed me so much right that it actually made me go scuttling away to sort of do a little calculation to sort of disprove the content of the tweet i won't say the tweet was by and i i did disprove the content of that tweet but actually in doing so it actually sparked a a research program which this week we are going to be putting a paper out about it which is which we're really really excited about so i want to tell you a little bit about it but i have to go back to this sum to to sort of tell you not going to do it as we did it last time we're going to do in a slightly different way a bit more of an intuitive way okay when you do this this sum okay h how how do you do it well one thing that you will often do at you know when you see a sum an infinite sum or an infinite series if we're going to be use the technical term you know you normally take the first bunch of them right so you take the first n of them so i i take this sum up to capital n right and i see what i get okay so what i've taking 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 and i go all the way up to n and i stop and then the idea would be that you take this n to infinity to get back to the thing that you're after right you say take it to infinity like that's a place you can go to well there's no finish line here yeah well quite we'll come back to that don't worry about that i agree i agree people are too flipping about this but let let's talk in the language that that i think people are familiar with this idea that you know you've got an infinite sum i'm just going to cut it off at some finite number of terms and then see what happens is i make that number of terms bigger and bigger okay so this is what you would do for this sum okay i i actually sometimes think people didn't realize that i knew that you could do this but anyway okay i do know this and i know what the answer to this is right it's n n + 1 over two and you know this is this is well known and and you know goes back to classical times i think and in this particular case the bigger n gets the further you go along this line the bigger the number gets clearly right i mean you can see that this this you can check that this is roughly going to give you the right answer you just take if i stop it here so i stop at n equals 2 answer i should get is three okay is that what i get yeah i do if i stop at the next one i get the right answer i keep getting the right answer so this this formula works and of course you're absolutely right i want to then start to i want to remove the cut off i want to remove the regulator this is what i this is the language i'll use for this this n is like a cut off it's a regulator as i remove it i'm obviously just going to blow up the answer i get is just going to be infinite right but actually there's even something more alarming about this that i think is that there's no sign of minus a 12 here at all there really isn't it's just it's not there okay and this is kind of weird and it's unsettling for for those minus a 12 sort of advocates like myself you know where is it and actually this this this was answered by teren tower the famous mathematician and exp explained why the minus 12 isn't appearing here and how we can make it appear and it's to do with the fact that what you're doing here is really quite drastic you're really cutting this off in a very sh very sort of violent and sharp way and you don't have to do that so let me explain a little bit more about what i mean by that so what am i really doing here when i when i do this what's called a partial sum what am i really doing it's like i'm taking the original sum i'm going to use the word sum rather than series cuz it's just a bit more familiar this is the infinite s but i'm waiting each term okay i'm going to add a waiting factor to each term so this is what i'm really doing here let me let me explain what i mean by that so it's like if i was doing this then this would be 0 times some waiting factor which is w of z whatever it is and then this next one is one time some other waiting factor and then two times some other waiting factor okay and so on and so you go all the way up to maybe the n minus one term that's got another waiting factor and then the nth term it's got another waiting factor and then you can carry on if you wanted in fact you do carry on you do the whole thing and basically you carry on and each term in the sum which is just zero one two and so on you add a weight you you weight it by a certain number and what are you doing here basically what you're saying is all these waiting factors are one when you do the drastic cut when you do a drastic cut you're saying all these are one yeah this one's one but this all these are zero so you're saying the waiting factor is one until you get to the nth term and after that all the waiting factors are zero right okay that's what you're really doing here okay so what that what does that mean that means this waiting function that you're multiplying the each term by it looks a little bit like this this is a terrible drawing it starts off at 1 okay and then around the point n it very sharply turns to zero yeah okay yeah that's exactly what you're doing here now terence to says the reason that you don't see minus a 12th is because of that sharp transition he says you don't have to do it like that that's not there are other ways to regulate this sum now i'm not doing anything weird no weird analytic continuation anything like that terence to says there are other ways to regulate some don't do the sharp transition do a smoother one something that takes you between one and zero in a much smoother way so it's just you know something like this yeah okay you could do that and it's the same sort of idea you're still you're still regulating the sum you can still move the transition points you know to larger and larger values to get back to the thing that you're you're after okay so what happens if you do that okay so's let's do an example [applause] so another possible waiting function which would have the property that it sort of went between zero sorry one and zero in a much smoother way is e to the minus n/ n okay you can see that at this end it's one and at the far end it's zero and i can and there a kind of a transition point which is set by big n is going to be around here somewhere and then and then i can move that along if i if i and remove the the sort of regulator remove the sort of way that you're sort of controlling the sum okay so you can ask what you get if you use this and you can do this this is actually easy to do if i calculate this this is what i get i can actually calculate this exactly i get e to the 1 / n e to 1 / nus1 sar so you can you can now see whates what does that look like well you can plot it and it looks a bit like this this guy just grows okay so looks infinite yeah it is infinite okay so all right well that's not very impressive is it i thought we was supposed to get minus the 12 wait okay now let's see what happens let's actually look at the behavior of this we're using this nice smooth waiting function look at the behavior of this for very large n and you can calculate this and you find that for very large n it goes like n2 to leading order the first correction okay and then everything else vanishes as n goes to infinity so there there further corrections but they're they're vanishingly small for for you know incre for infinitely large m so you're going to say to me well you still got infinity there haven't you okay the minus 12th is appeared now okay but you still got infinity actually what does tile tell t tells us this is very very general behavior that if i take any smooth waiting function okay and we extended some of his results actually prov some did a few more generalities if you take any smooth waiting function which goes between one and zero and if you go to zero fast enough and you've got some transition point you know set by by the end if you do that then you'll always get something which goes like c some number * n^ 2 minus a 12 plus the small stuff becomes vanishingly small so you always get this and this c depends on the choice of your waiting function okay so that's this way so so for this choice you get one there but for other choices that that you know take you between one and zero there are perfectly good ways of regulating some you get h you get you get some other numbers now with the sharp transition this doesn't happen because it's sharp this is when it's a nice smooth smoother transition okay let me give you another example another choice that i want to show [music] you let me give you another example of a waiting function so the waiting function i'm going to choose this time is not this this is what we had before i'm just going to throw in a ca okay so this still goes between one and zero with some transition around n it does a bit of wiggling around a bit but still it's dug between one and zero so as far as ti's concerned and and our extension this is a perfectly good way to sort of regulate the sum what do you get you can calculate it it's very doable e to 1/ n e 2/ n cos 1 / n - 2 e 1 n+ cos 1 n / e 2 n - 2 e 1 n cos 1 n + 1 2 okay this is what you get right just another way right now so now we can say what does this look like okay well i'm going to show you on a graph so you can see this isn't blowing up this is settling down on a number what number do you think it is it has has it a guess so you can calculate what how this behaves for very large end so in other words what does it mean to take n large it means i'm removing the regulator i'm removing the cut off if i remove the cut off in this case i don't get any divergences i don't get any infinity i just get minus the 12th plus the stuff which is vanishingly small as and goes to infinity this gives you exactly minus of 12 there's no throwing away of infinity it really does spit out minus of 12 but you've just pulled this out of thin air this coan over and like you could have you could have reverse engineered that as far as i know well of course i reverse engineered it yeah right but this but the point is the idea that that you always have to throw away infinity is not true it depends on your choice of regulator and in fact we go back to this you can whatever this this c as i said it depends on the choice here of the waiting function the regulator if you like and and and yeah there are there are actually infinitely many choices that are perfectly good regulators as good as e to theus one /n as good as a stat function actually that will give you zero for the divergence this this nice one with the is a really beautiful example of it okay so so this and all of these are infinite number that will give straight away they just give you manus of 12 straight out so who's to say that those are not some sense preferred way to regulate these sums is there something interesting in those so when when i but you're you're talking about regulating these sums putting in cut off points right and then removing it i'm removing the regulator because i take end to infinity i remember right you're you're taking the regulator but if you didn't put the regulator in the first place you would have blown up well well what do you mean you have to define what you mean by the sum okay and there are ways to define the regulation process that don't give you any divergence at all and interestingly this is not analytic continuation by the way it's it's another method that gives you minus a 12 but it really gives you it's not not you're throwing away infinity it's giving you minus a 12 end of story right well not end of story actually not end of story because there was no way i could sit on this and just think oh my god there's all these amazing functions and by the way this kind of combination of things smells very string theory like it just smells of string theory okay and i can't really put my hand on exactly how it is but it does right so and also there's something there's something interesting here so when i first saw this i was like this is this is so cool this property here this idea that the way you regulate it the the the power lord divergence the quadratic divergence that you see here that that depends on how you regulate it how you control the sum and yet there seems to be this universal minus a 12th that's very reminiscent of something we see in quantum field theory we see there we also get power low divergences which depend on on how you regulate how you control the well it's not sums there it tends to be integrals which are like continuous sums and and and then there's another bit which is universal so it it smells a lot of it okay so i started to look more into this and so my student robert and i we we we started exploring this much more and we found some really remarkable connection with quantum field theory that we and potentially string theory that we don't really fully understand so what do we find so in quantum field theory physics quantum field theory is the is the theory that sort of describes how how you know basically it's the best theory of of fundamental particles that we have the fundamental fabric of the universe okay it tells you you know how you know the the particles are toing and frowing how they interact with each other this is the theory that we use when you do quantum field theory you get infinities spitting out they just come out there are there are things like there are infinite sums there but they're also infinite integrals and you've got to control them okay in some way so you you you have these control mechanisms to try to do it and normally you have to throw away an infinity what we did was we decided to sort of develop a new way of controlling these integrals based on this inside of tos okay and applied it to quantum f then we asked the following question is there any that are preferred in some way now in quantum filter in particle physics the the most important thing the thing that kind of underpins all of particle physics is something called symmetry so you think of symmetry as like you know reflections you know something looks the same you look the same under under a reflection then there's kind of reflection symmetry or maybe you have a symmetry of rotation something like a a sphere you rotate it it looks the same right you can extend these ideas to particle physics and symmetry sort of dictate the structure of of a fundamental particles and and how particle physics works what's fascinating about this is is that usually when you do quantum field there when you add quantum corrections to it you break the symmetries and that's bad that sort of means you don't have control of the theory what you don't want to do that what we found was was that if you use our new way of trying to control the integrals and we asked the question question when do you not break the symmetries and it turns out that it's precisely when you use those regulators those waiting functions like this one so it's the ones that give you minus a 12 with no divergence with no infinity have somehow got something to do with how nature sort of protects us from infinity at the level of particle physics and we don't understand why this is happening okay we wonder if there's something about this sort of the stringy nature of how these interactions are going how string theory protects us at an even more fundamental level from these infinities when we've written this paper out that's coming out this week we're really excited about at the moment we've just pointed out the coincidence that somehow you've got these ways of of controlling these infinite sums that gives you minus a 12 and somehow they've got something to do with with how nature protects us from from breaking the symmetry symmetries how it protects us that from happening and is there something more to be said about it maybe there is maybe there isn't you know but but it it it you know it's tempting when you see these coincidences it's hard to sort of ignore them you you want to explore them more and yeah we're really super excited about it most people in the street if you ask them about the sum of all the natural numbers to infinity mhm say well it must equal infinity that's like the intuitive answer even you would say that's the intu how when you have this discussion with someone you say well actually it could also beus 12th how do you explain that to them without talking about regularization and string theory and that what do you what's the one thing you say to them that kind of justifies saying it could be minus a 12 i mean i don't think i don't i don't think it's possible to explain somebody an intuitive sense because i don't think anybody has an intuitive understanding of it it's not intuitive i mean it's that's as simple as that i think the best thing you can say is is that look this is an infinite summer an infinite series that you know this is what it is and you don't understand infinity because you live in a finite world and i live in a finite world we have no intuition for infinity not really you know you know this goes back this is infinity drove canel mad right you know this is it's not a place that that that that you you you think you understand and many many mathematicians and physicist have just said stay away from it almost like you have no right to have an intuition yes and fireman of course fireman won the nobel prize for for controlling the the some of these infinities in particle ph but he quite openly said we swept them under the rug okay and what we're trying to do is try to find ways to understand well let's not sweep on the rug let's try to understand how you know the journey to infinity in some sense is there a preferred journey to infinity and i think that's what that's what i would say is happening here in that you have these ways of taking this sum towards infinity and there are potentially preferred journeys which take you to a finite place and we can see that that is indeed the case the the system of partial sums well that's not going to take you to a finite place you know this but that's just one of an of a you know an infinite class of ways in which you could have carried out out that journey right and there are an infinite number of journeys that you can take which will take you directly to minus a 12 and those journeys seem to be special and i think they're worth exploring in more detail definitely people will always think of it as as as as the first bunch of terms and then they'll try to make that bunch bigger and bigger and bigger they'll do partial sums but as towers shoulders if you do partial sums you're doing a very sharp you're doing a very drastic event you're doing something very sharp that's that's actually you know it's a measures zero option in the class of things that you could do and why are you just just because your intuition says do this doesn't mean mathematically you should do that or even physically that you should do that and there are these other possibilities and they give more interesting answers which maybe telling us something deep about how the universe works and how numbers work all the way up and the third one is of course going to be our our one that we're really interested in which is 1 + 2 + 3 plus four and so on so we're going to evaluate all these three different sums now the first one is really easy to evaluate and and then you kind of forget so you kind of put it in a in a box somewhere and you put it in a closet and you kind of put it you classify it under stuff which you have already understood but i think actually we don't really fully understand
