the chinese government has spent a lot of time reining in the power of large tech companies like alibaba and deservedly so so it is natural that meituan should receive some scrutiny as well meitwan which used to be called meitwan dianping before a 2020 name change has risen to become china's third largest tech company starting off as a groupon clone meitwan has parlayed his success into a super app on par with 10 cents wechat founder and ceo wang xing seeks to make meituan the king of china's online to offline space he is now taking the company on a new journey challenging big incumbents in the massive community buying space and burning plenty of cash in doing so in this video we're going to look at one of china's newest and most ruthless tech giants but first i want to kindly ask you if you would be interested in the patreon if you are interested in what this channel does you can support the work by joining the early access tier early access members get to see videos before they are released to the public so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thank you and on with the show in 2010 wong xing a serial entrepreneur with experience in the united states started a website called meitwan he had been inspired by groupon and meitwan was essentially a china-based copy meiton joined a morass of nearly 5000 groupon copycats in the chinese internet space if they did not differentiate themselves then they would drown in a sea of competitors i don't know if you remember those days back in the united states but groupon's surge and growth foreshadowed ubers years later the industry burned immense amounts of venture capital you had to hire thousands of salespeople to knock on small businesses doors and convince them to sign up faced with so much competition from companies like last show.com indiscriminately buying their way into the lead wong decided to reject such unsustainable spending and focused on efficiency and profitability this focus paid off the next year when the market shook out and funding tightened up fortunately meitwan had enough cash in the bank to survive by then wang had established his business playbook a focus on efficiency and cost leadership through the use of technology ruthless horizontal expansion and a zen comfort with competition meiton began its move towards something bigger with the 2012 launch of maureen dienying an online movie ticketing site this came just two years after the company's founding movie tickets made a lot of sense for meitwan's first expansion movie times can be indexed and updated people like to buy tickets ahead of time so to reserve the best seats and lots of people like to see movies meitwan followed up mao yen with a flurry of product launches a year later in 2013 they stepped into the hotel booking space they also entered food delivery soon to be one of their core services in 2015 maitland expanded once more into transportation ticketing with train and airplane tickets the company also announced a merger with dienping.com a restaurant reviews website launched in 2003 that is kind of like china's yelp dinping had good traction in first and second tier cities like shanghai but they lagged behind in china's other urban areas the merger allowed meitwan to add dan ping's established customer base to its own and consolidate the industry the merger was pitched as a combination of equals and the two companies would collaborate on innovation but wong quickly sidelined yin ping's founder zhang tao and replaced the team with his own the new company emerged as a heavyweight in the chinese tech landscape they raised money and continued their horizontal expansion throughout the chinese local services ecosystem in 2018 meitron went public on the hong kong stock exchange raising 4.2 billion dollars at a valuation of 50 billion dollars the stock has done well since then and today it has a 220 billion dollar market cap may twine is a sprawling beast with over 200 offered services but its product lines are all centered on offline services ordered online i already talked about mauryan its movie ticketing service it also has its food and grocery delivery services waimea and maitland grocery the company has majority share over 65 percent in the chinese food delivery business alibaba backed leading competitor ellie mee has less than 30 percent its travel and hotel booking products maitland has majority share of the chinese online hotel booking market according to their q3 2020 earnings report and meitwan services more than just consumers too in 2016 the company launched supply chain online advertising tools and cloud-based enterprise resource planning software for their many small business merchants this is their first expansion into software and it helps lock in those businesses into the metron platform the company makes revenue from sales commissions online advertising from vendors on its platform and other service fees fiscal year 2020 revenues total 17 billion dollars usd wechat is china's most famous super app what started out as a simple chat app has bundled together various parts of people's lives to meet all of their daily needs meiton follows a similar strategy referred to in its annual reports has food plus platform meitwan has built proficiencies in delivering many types of items for instance they recently added delivery of flowers medicines and more but the biggest revenue in profit drivers are food and groceries the food delivery business is so important to maituan because it is so commonly used in china like with the rest of the world the pandemic has accelerated food delivery adoption over 421 million chinese have placed the food delivery order 86 percent of whom are white-collar workers furthermore they use it quite often an average of 25.5 transactions in 2019. since food delivery is so frequently used it drives traffic for matuan's other services like travel bookings in-store dining and even wedding planning this is the platform part of the food plus platform strategy cross-selling these local services makes maitland even more of a destination for chinese consumers that titanic transaction volume helps drive scale in 2020 metron hired 9.5 million drivers more than the population of austria this titanic scale lets them dispatch their delivery men on the most optimal routes minimize downtime and be the low-cost leader maituan had been one of those rare companies with backing from both alibaba and tencent rivals in the chinese internet space wong had originally raised money from alibaba but after the 2015 merger with the n ping tencent has a dmping investor had the option to invest in the combined entity they did pitching in a billion dollars in a 2016 fundraising round tencent's friendly relationship with matuan continues to this day with the latter's favorable feature placement within the wechat ecosystem alibaba sold their stake at a discount from the 2016 round citing their focus on their own homegrown online to offline services division in an interesting 2017 interview wong talked a little bit about meitwan's relationship with the two titans he likened it to china's relationship with the united states and the soviet union which is pretty fun to think about if you're familiar with that stuff after the dan ping merger wong went to jack ma and daniel tang today alibaba ceo to talk about resetting relations and in it he says i thought we could learn from the successful merger of dd in quite daddy alibaba and tencent fought endlessly eventually they shook hands and made up and now they are both shareholders of dd and so i told alibaba that meitwan sincerely hoped it could receive support from both tencent and alibaba but they said you are completely mistaken we think the consolidation of deity in quite daddy was a failure we will not make the same mistake again alibaba thereafter began developing several directly competing services to maituan as meitwan finished up on 2020 they warned investors to expect several quarters of operating losses as the company continues its battles and expands into community buying to fund this expansion the company raised 10 billion us dollars by selling debt and equity wang is so willing to stir up dust with titans like alibaba because he is in general very comfortable with competition meitwan's style of horizontal expansion means charging forward into a field of crowded incumbents this latest competitive push takes meitwan into community purchasing with its maitland select service community purchasing is a new chinese e-commerce trend where communities can set up local groups for bulk buying it's kind of like groupon but more localized pindul duo pioneered this model where people can band together to unlock group discounts founded in 2015 pinduoto is now worth 140 billion dollars and its founder colin huang is one of china's richest people the community group bind concept began in china's hinterlands massive cities with millions of people that nobody has ever heard of like dan dong jing and fushun it's a titanic market estimated to be worth 100 billion dollars in 2021. meijuan is not going to win it though without a fight metron select directly competes with jd.com's ding dong mai tai shing shan yoshin pindodo's mai tai alibaba's taobao mai tai and didi tru xing chang sing yoshin i should mention interestingly enough pindoto is also a 10 cent investment having scaled up in the early days through their usage of wechat groups and mini programs the meituan team is definitely not afraid of stepping on their siblings toes wang is a student of history in interviews he quotes chairman mao and cites the hundred regiments offensive a glorious world war ii chinese victory commanded by ccp guomindan general pang de huay he would be a great asionometry viewer considering wong's knowledge of history a recent deleted post on his social media is worth closing with may 2021 he posted on the social media network foundfold.com a one thousand year old poem by zhangjie titled the book burning pit then he deleted it because he knew he'd done goofed meituan's stock crashed to a seven-month low as the market immediately saw the post has a criticism of beijing and its recent anti-trust moves the chinese government has been very sensitive of such things starting with the very public beatdown of alibaba group after the jack ma speech meitwan is very comfortable with conflict they have carried their zen through years of battles and horizontal industry invasions but now perhaps they have come across an opponent against which they cannot win all right everyone that's it for tonight
