so let's ask the hi philosophically just about money yeah what at the highest level is money what is money it's a kind of game and it's a game where we have points and like if you have points there's this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's voice by the same number and these it's a fair game hopefully well it's one kind of fair game like for example you know you can have other kinds of fair games like you're gonna have a game where if i give someone a points and you give someone a points and instead of that person getting two points that person gets four points and that's also fair is but no money is easy to kind of set up for and it serves a lot of useful functions and so it kind of just survives in society as a meme for thousands of years it's useful for this storage of wealth useful for the exchange of value and it's also useful for words and nominating future payments a unit of account a unit of account so what if you look at the history of money in human civilization what just if you're a student of history like how has its role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view even if we just look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies that's something you think about yeah and i think like the big thing in the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot more intermediation and yes thank you i mean the first part is and if the move from bang yeah adding more of different kinds of banking and then we saw the move from and if dollar is being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's only redeemable by certain people to dollars not being backed by anything sue and it's just this new system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people like i'm getting and of bank accounts and then those things becoming electronic people getting accounts with payment processors that have i can bank accounts so so what do you make of that that's a fascinating so philosophical idea that money might not be backed by anything what is that like the fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical it definitely is what do you make of that like how how is that possible is that stable if you look at the future of human civilization is it possible to have money at the large scale it's such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully without money being backed by anything physical i feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that a lot of the important valuable things are not backed by anything like if you look at like tech companies for example like something like twitter and like you could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to or they could have kind of come together they would quit and you know start working on twitter 2.0 and then the e of how you will and just kind of build the exact the the exact same product source possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue on from there and the original at the original twitter would just not have people left anymore right like that there is theoretically kind of code and like ip that's owned by the company but in reality like good programmers could probably read up rewrite all that stuff in three months so the like the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems right like this employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users aren't all going to switch at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once and so there's these enough metastable and of equilibria in interactions between thousands of millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if you try to kind of assume that everyone's a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow they don't seem to exist at all this that's thinking is do you have a sense a grasp of the sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like the physics of that stickiness it seems to work but and i think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working yeah it's you know it's the sort of thing that's definitely been have economically modeled a lot they want to be a kind of analogy of something as similar that you often see in textbooks as like what is say yeah government like if for exactly 80% of people in a country just like tomorrow suddenly had had the idea that like the laws that are currently the laws in the government there currently is the government are just people and some of us and some other thing it is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then that way kind of become the new reality and then the question is well what happens if and if between 0 and 80 people are it were an 80% if people start believing that and like what is the thing you also you see instead if there is one of these kind of switches happening is kind of revolution then if you're the first person to join then like you probably probably don't have the incentive to do that but then if you're the 55th percentile person to join and then suddenly becomes quite safe too and so this definitely is the sort of thing that you can and if try to analyze and understand mathematically but one of the and if results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic sometimes yeah but still like to me the idea that the network effects that the fact that human beings scale like millions billions is sure even the idea of currency like you all agree that's just i know i can almost model it i'm a skeptic on economic and it's like somebody my favorite sort of field maybe recreationally psychology is trying to take human behavior and i think sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics those different perspectives on human behavior you can have or are difficult it's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of understanding human behavior but on that idea what do you think is the role of money in human motivation so do you think money from an economics perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like human desires money is definitely very far from the only motivator it is a big motivator and it's one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator think because ultimately in the almost any person in the world if you ask them to do something they'll be more inclined to do it if you also offer some offer the money right and that's big there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize how much money they have and that happens all the time but like though a lot of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and if who that person is and if where their situation is the relationship between the motive in the action and these other things what do you think is the interplay of the other motivator i'm like nietzsche perspectives power do you think money equals power do you think those are conflicting ideas do you think i mean that's the one of the ideas that decentralized currency decentralized applications are looking at is who holds the power yeah money is definitely a kind of power and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power and then even if my money doesn't seem to and have explicitly be about money a lot of things that people spend money on are ultimately about and of social status of some kind i definitely view those two things as and if interplaying and then there's also money as just a way of like measuring how successful you are i guess a scoreboard right so this kind of gets back to the game like if you have four billion dollars then the main benefit you get from going out one of the big benefits you get from going up to six million dollars is that now instead of being below the guy who has five year above the guy who has five good so you think money could be kind of in a game of life it's also a measure of self-worth it's like how we it's definitely how i have a lot of people perceive it define ourselves you know hierarchy of yeah i'm not yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy thing that people define yourself worthless money because it's definitely and of far from a perfect indicator of how much you like you value you provide the society or anything like this but i definitely think that they as a matter of kind of current practice a bunch of people do feel that way so what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you what is the perfect world look like i guess the economist's utopia would be one where kind of everything is an incentive aligns in the same in the sense that there aren't enough conflicts between what satisfies your goals and kind of what is good for and if everyone in the world in the world as a whole what do you think that would look like this does that mean they're still poor people on rich people they're still in income inequality do you think sort of marxist ideas are strong you think sort of ideas of objectivism like where the market rules is strong like what is there is a different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective what utopia would be no i definitely think that existing economic philosophy is do end up kind of systematically deviating from the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like one of the big things i talked about for example is public goods right and public goods are especially important on the internet right yes like the idea is what kind of money as this game where you know i was a few coin a few points and you gain the same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where i wish some money you gain some money you lose a sandwich and i gain a sandwich and this and if model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize this out of private goods right things that you provide to one person really benefit comes to one person but the like on the internet especially but also many many contexts and if off the internet there's actions that and if individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can't control where the benefit goes to right so for example this podcast i know we publish it and when it's published you don't have any fine-grained control over like oh these 38,000 people can watch it and then like these other 29,000 people can't it's like once the number goes high enough then you know people just like copy it and then when i write articles on a blog then they're just like free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying so and aside from that things like you know scientific research for example and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one so there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual actions with have concentrated cost and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job of encouraging these things and one of the kind of other things even tangentially connected to crypto but kind of theoretically outside of it that i work on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding and the way to think about it is i and i've imagined a point system where if like if one person gives coin gives poins to one other person then it works the same way as money but if multiple people and give coins to one person and they do so anonymous way so it's kind if not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves then the number of quinns are received by that person is and if greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by those different people so the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gave then you add all the square roots and then you add a square the sum squares yeah and then you give that and the idea here would basically be that if let's say for example you just started going off and kind of planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really happy that you're planting trees so that's how they go and all kind of throw a coin your way then the like there is like basically the facts that kind of you get more than the sum you get this kind of square of some of these of square roots of these tiny amounts as that this actually and if compensates for the tragedy of the commons rightness there's even this kind of mathematical proof that it's sort of optimally compensates for it what is the tragedy of the commons this is just this idea that if there is this situation where there's some public good that lots of people benefit from then no individual person wants to contribute to it because if they contribute they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution but they pay the full cost of their contribution in which context is this sorry what is the term quadratic quadratic funding like what's in which context is this mechanism useful so obviously you said to combat the tragedy of the commons but you know in which context do you see it as useful in practice yeah theoretically public goods in general right so like like services like what do we what are we talking about what's a public within the etherium ecosystem for example like we've actually tried using this mechanism i wrote a couple of articles about the center von vitalik ca where it goes through some of the most recent rounds and it's been really interesting some of the top ones that people supported and there or things like you can just unwind user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with aetherium there was documentation there are podcasts there were you know software and of clients like kind of implementations of the etherium protocol of privacy tools just like lots of things that are useful to lots of people wouldn't a lot of people are contributing for like funding a particular particular entity yeah and it's really actually interesting is there something special about the quadratic the the the summing of the square roots yeah so another way to think about it is like imagine if n people each give a dollar then the person gets n squared right and and so each individual person's contribution gets multiplied by n right because you have n people and so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind that kind of enter one tragedy over the commons i just wonder if the the squared part is yeah fundamental though it is an ida recommends you go to a vitalik ca i have this article called quadratic payments of primer and highly recommended it's kind of at least my attempt so far and of explaining the intuition behind this intuition you
