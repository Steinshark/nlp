2021 salary report the fastest growing salaries 
by occupation what jobs are currently growing what   jobs are kind of falling behind okay we're 
still growing it's okay i have a job still within the next 10 years a lot of 
jobs are going to become automated   it's a discussion i've been having with 
a lot of my colleagues and friends is   how is this going to look what does this mean for 
everyone well for one it means a lot of upskilling   with that comes a lot of new jobs as well the 
technology that is automating and maintaining   the systems of jobs that were once done by 
humans will need to be maintained there is a   ton of job opportunities that will come out in 
the tech industry because of these automations   i know obviously there is pros and cons to 
both sides but today i really want to talk to   you more specifically about some tech jobs that 
are set to boom within the decade before we get   into it though make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related videos   leave in the comments other topics you want 
me to cover whether it be future of tech   coding career salary you know any of the above 
leave down below okay let's get right into it recently i was reading a really interesting report 
by dice which was their 2021 salary report and   i'll link it down below so you can check it out as 
well it has tons of different information and data   in it which really covers in detail what jobs are 
currently growing what jobs are kind of falling   behind and it's really interesting and i actually 
want to pull something up on screen that i was   reading about it which is the fastest growing 
salaries by occupation now keep in mind once again   these are specific around tech jobs okay let's 
start with number 10 i think there's 10 of   them and work our way up to number one so they 
say number 10 being data architect with a 3.2   increase yearly for salary cyber security 
engineer data engineer web developer business   analyst cloud engineer technical support 
engineer devops engineer data scientist and   first is cyber security analyst no surprise 
here i think cyber security analyst comes in at   number one with a 16.3 percent annual salary 
increase because as you can see down below   cyber security engineer it's not that high up but 
what has happened is there's been so much demand   for cyber security that a lot more of the junior 
roles have been filled or starting to get filled   but now we have this gap on more senior 
level roles such as a cyber security analyst   that that kind of space or that those people are 
really missing still these are some of the tech   jobs that are set to boom within the next decade 
and i mean as you can see it's pretty obvious from   data cyber security business analyst and a lot of 
cloud it makes sense it's kind of the direction we   are headed any of these rules you will definitely 
be safe or if you get into these roles or if you   are navigating towards these roles to be able 
to continue to grow within the tech industry   now that being said if you aren't in these roles 
does that mean you won't grow does that mean your   job is going to disappear not necessarily what 
i think it means more than anything is that you   need to be open to continuing to learn and evolve 
as technology and really our world does as well   more often than not if you aren't continuing to 
learn and upskill you are going to fall behind   and i think that really speaks more true now than 
ever especially with technology being so quick   paced and really really integrated in every part 
of our daily lives that we really need to i'm not   saying spend your weekends and evenings continuing 
to learn but just be aware of what's coming   down the pipeline with new technologies even 
if it's not necessarily of interest to you   just having that awareness i think is huge okay 
i also recently found which i want to pull up   on screen here too this really really interesting 
tool it's futureskills.pearson.com what i really   like about it is they've done they've built this 
system where you can go and explore the statistics   of how likely your job is to be around in the 
future which is pretty crazy okay i'm going to   pull it up on screen here so let's enter let's 
start with us and let's see what happens here   job title i mean they're obviously collecting 
data on this so you don't have to be accurate   on it i'm going to be somewhat accurate 
just in order to you know help them with   who's really going to their website and what 
they're looking at okay so i found this website   a while ago and i think it's really cool just to 
see get a sense i mean obviously this is just one   report based on some certain data so don't you 
know hold your whole career or life to it but i   just think it's really interesting so okay here 
let's get personal so i'm 29 right now as you   know or maybe you didn't know now you know in 2030 
you will be 38 years old skills that would prepare   you most for your job as a software developer is 
learning strategy fluent fluency and ideas and   technology design they also go in talking about 
what does this mean which i think is really cool   so they really break down what skills will be 
important based on the role you are currently in and then the percent of chance of growth 
by 2030. so software developers have a   61.5 chance of growth by 2030. okay we're 
still growing it's okay i have a job still   and then you can see how your results 
compare okay so as you can see we   have different roles here information security 
analysts have a 62 growth this is what i am   database admin have a 58 chance computer 
occupations all other 58. so it's pretty   cool okay anyways i'll link that down below i 
just think it's a really interesting resource   to kind of play around with and get a sense of 
where your interests are and what growth rate   and potential they really have for the future 
you know you choose a role hopefully based on   what you're interested in and what you want to do 
with your time you want to enjoy your time and do   something that makes you happy but at the end 
of the day you also want to do something that   pays you you need to eat at the end of the 
day maybe you have a family maybe you have   ambitions for travel or whatever it is so you 
want a role that really fills all of your fulfills   all of your needs hopefully and one that sticks 
around for a while so i thought this was really   interesting to play around with and at the end of 
the day too i really don't want you to base your   career on what is trending right now for a tech 
role because realistically what is trending now   might not even be trending in five years so you 
can't really based on that which goes back to the   whole point of more than anything you really just 
need to continue to learn and grow your skills   do what is interesting to you find what your 
passion is for example right now i'm doing   software development but i have a huge interest 
in blockchain development so outside of work hours   or all my learning hours at work i've been 
learning a lot about blockchain and it's something   i find really interesting now is it related to my 
job not specifically but do i see a potential for   me to go that way yeah i kind of do and same with 
things like web 3 and different technologies just   exploring them and finding the fun in them 
reading different articles on them and   more than anything i hope this video just sparks 
your interest that realizing that you don't need   to you know do a full'0 into a job that's 
going to be in demand in 10 years because   we really don't know but i also want to share 
with you some areas that they do based on data   see a lot of potential growth okay i'll leave 
you on that high note but i'm curious to know   what are some jobs that you think will boom in 
the next decade do you agree or disagree with   the ones that i listed at the beginning if you 
haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe   button for more tech encoding related videos 
before we go i want to say a big shout out to   some of these subscribers here thank you i see 
you i love you you all are just honestly amazing   one of my favorite things is when i'm reading 
through the comments and seeing some of you   respond or help other people out to their
