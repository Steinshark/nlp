the legend of the flying lambos scam known as bitcloud continues ladies and gentlemen and we're talking about it today i've been doing some deep digging into the blockchain and i found out who holds all the risk surprise it's you it's not the founders it's not tyler or cameron winkle twins whatever their names are it's you i hope you're happy to know that and it gets worse there's some sketchy shenanigans that i think you should know about if you ever want to consider investing in this scam look i think it's a good idea a decentralized twitter or something that's basically what it is like a poor man's twitter right now it's just the founders are greedy and trying to extract the maximum amount of money from you in the most kind of a cynical way possible let's talk about it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today like i said we're doing some deep diving into the blockchain i never thought it'd be a blockchain explorer but here we are bitcloud guys you know it do you love it i don't know a lot of people like the idea as i was saying earlier it's supposed to be a decentralized twitter that's what it bills itself as if you check it out the front page it looks very aspirational it calls itself the crypto social network but there are some incredibly important details that have been left out conveniently of the white paper that i'd like to tell you about today now last time on our last video a big cloud the worst game i've seen in a while we talked about how they were stealing creators identity stealing their right to publicity to get some free money and they've so far accumulated about 200 million dollars in bitcoin no i did not stutter 200 million dollars and it's being seen and valued at one billion dollars and i'm just looking at this like it's like a bad movie right it's like if it's this bad movie and all your friends are like trying to pretend it's good it's like oh that's bad except instead of like your friends pretending the movie's good because you know whatever maybe they're hyped up about it it's like the friends are pretending it's good because they got paid in advance to be incentivized that is good that's what's happening all these guys that you think are fans of bid cloud have been prepaid to join in that's what we're talking about today see there's something called the genesis block we're going to talk about today this is the pre mind this is what happens before you ever get access to it before i ever get access for investors and founders they kind of give a little money off to the side this is not totally atypical a little bit frowned upon to take too much stuff because if you take a huge chunk of your currency up front this is seen as a short-sighted move to extract maximum amounts of money now previously diamond hands the creator of bitcloud said there was a pre-mine of 2 million bitcoin out of a total supply of something like 21 million bitcoin although he said because it doubles every ever every million big bit clout it's going to be a max of 19 million bits bit cloud so there's a pre-mine of 2 million that sounds reasonable right it's like less a little over 10 percent for founders and investors well turns out that wasn't exactly true see if you actually go to the blockchain explorer and go to blockchain block zero what you actually find out is that this man was being a bit deceitful see the truth is the total pre-mine was actually 8 million bitcloud that is equal to 42 of the total supply of big clout that will ever exist hey it's been pre-mined meaning you don't have access to it where did that money go where oh where did it go well it is true that 2.3 million went to the founders but we don't know where the other 5.7 million big clout went but quickly i realized this whole thing was set up to benefit everyone who were in early investors and screw over anyone who got in late right this is not a project that's built to last this is a project that's built to benefit the people who got in early so as part of the pre-mine i ended up cross-referencing all the public you know keys with big clouds blockchain explorer whatever it doesn't matter i did it anyway this is what we found these are all the users who got bitclout from the genesis block meaning they didn't do anything they didn't pay for it they just got it credited to their their account now if you notice our big boy chamath at the current price of bitcloud has 15 million dollars credited some people attach their real names to it some people don't the point is is that these are the names that got publicly credited with bitcloud but these names will come back later now of course this valuation is kind of silly right now because of course you can't get bitclout over to bitcoin this is just theoretically how much money they have so that's the first part of the scheme summarized investors got paid out huge sums of bitcloud and a total of 42 of all existing bitcoin big cloud excuse me that will ever exist already has been minted or pre-mined if you will now for this next part i want to refer to our good old boy gin and juice here snoop dogg should i claim my big cloud he asked on april 7th and somebody responds ye bro buys your bit clout first jump on the join clubhouse and i'll explain otherwise everyone will benefit from your coin and pump the value this is the stupid growth hack that big clout has put people in is people look at big cloud they go whoa i got huge sums of money all these big celebrities they say hey i have huge sums of money in big cloud i should go claim it i look it's free money right this is part of the scheme because when snoop dogg goes to his profile he sees that he has 41 coins were 375 000 that's really interesting who doesn't want almost half a million dollars for doing absolutely nothing but the only problem is where is this money coming from well this is where a guy named crypto comes in he's done an incredible thread i'll link it in the description below on this whole scheme and it blew my mind bitclout is artificially pumping reserved creator profiles to make it look like they're really valuable in order for legit creators to come in there by endorsing bitcloud to get big clout you have to tweet about it so you have to endorse bitcloud that gets your followers to think big cloud is a legitimate endeavor that they should go put their money in by the way you can't get your money out which then sort of legitimizes the whole project so how are they artificially pumping these things well on march 11th they started sending bitclout to all the profiles that were were reserved not like the investors right and they had the profiles automatically buy up their own coin see if you notice bit snoop dogg already holds his own coin despite not having joined the platform at all not having set a founder reward nothing so how did this happen well they were sent bitclout by these two genesis public keys okay remember the genesis block there were i think 482 genesis keys that were given these eight million bit clout that no one knows where they are who they're two et cetera now one profile named master specifically was in his job was basically to send bitclout to these starter profiles these profiles they stall pump up the value artificially so that these creators think to themselves maybe i should go maybe i should go claim that now remember in the genesis block master got a hundred thousand bit clout so that's how he did it now when snoop dogg goes on his profile he thinks that there's legitimate interest in his profile when in reality this is minted pre-mined coins that are essentially worthless right they're not worth anything it cost absolutely zero dollars to make him now this gets more insidious when you look at profiles even bigger like justin bieber one of the biggest profiles on big cloud now big clout would get a lot of credibility by him joining right so rather than go about this the official way and you know prove that their their company's valuable and prove that they have real legitimacy well first what do they do well they pre-give justin bieber a bunch of coins so his valuation just gets pumped up they just throw 40 coins at a creator just so they like pump up his value right away then they have people like fallows invest 13 coins he's from the genesis block and he's one of the main holders of justin bieber coin guess who else is happy penguin happy penguin is also one of the genesis block guys with elon musk it's the same story it's a bunch of anonymous accounts i wonder who those could be i wonder if they're the hundreds of anonymous accounts who haven't moved their genesis block you also have the talent fund who incidentally yeah right there one of the other largest holders is arts is arts one of the guys oh why yes he's one of the top 10 most rewarded bit clout holders right the genesis block now what does this mean well it means when people like snoop dogg are asking should i claim my big clout and people say well yeah it's free money it's really not it's just invented money that they pre-mined pumped up your valuation gave you a bunch of fake coins that they also i guess pre-mined i guess the whole thing is like to pressure you to join they're just throwing away money now you might say well i don't know it's a growth hack strategy whatever but there's an important problem this lures in legitimate investors who think these crazy valuations are due to actual demand who will then throw real money after fake bunk this is the whole beautiful thing about crypto you know back in the day when people launched a company who guess who took the risk the founder the founder didn't cash out until an ipo there's some kind of an exit event but until then they're taking all the risk crypto some of these projects have managed to figure out how to put all the risk on you the guy diamond hands or nader theory as we think he is does he take a loss the creator no he walks away with a 200 million dollar bag after failing what happens to your money because you're expected to pay in buy in with real bitcoin so even if it fails you take the laws not the founders right and the point is they're no worse for the where yeah maybe you lost some money but did they so let's just try to run back a brief conclusion of this whole platform this whole social media experiment that says it's just coins and code remember from the white paper guys last episode it's just coins and code here's how it worked they got a bunch of famous people who are kind of known in the investing crypto space i don't know how they got them involved i don't know how much these people knew ahead of time full disclosure they could have had no idea what was going on they could have had a lot of idea okay but they go hey you want to be involved in this thing we'll give you a huge chunk of the currency and we'll pre-mine 42 of it we're not going to tell anybody what we're going to do with that then what we're going to we're going to take all the popular creators on twitter we're going to steal their identity upload them our them to our platform preload them with a bunch of fake money and we're going to artificially set their creator value at like this huge inflated price so that when these people go look they go wow this is a big platform with a lot of creators by the way a lot of the genesis mining guys you tell them hey why don't you go invest some of that invest some of that in the creators before anyone else has access so they get access to all the top creators before you do thereby running up the price now this is all before you ever see anything then you get introduced to the the thing by saying wow guys hey look tyler and cameron winklevoss the winkle twins they're involved guys who's ever heard of them losing out on anything let's all dive into that not knowing their way to make money is this thing being valuable meanwhile journalists are writing articles about how a mysterious influence or stock market is worth one billion dollars i don't know a few like a month after launch really a billion dollars that's what you think this thing's worth i think it's worth the exact amount the last idiot puts into it but even apart from the scam think about what if it actually works what if they actually become the next twitter as they say they want to be i mean right like they want to be the crypto social network do you know the insane fees they're going to be that are going to be charged per tweet because as you know you have to pay fees for all this stuff right when you tweet or re-cloud when you cloud or i don't know what they call it you have to pay and as the price of these fees goes up what do you think the regular people who are supposed to make up the main body of this thing are gonna do do you think you're gonna wanna pay a dollar to tweet i don't think so and i think the final future of this project can be best summarized by this guy named chamath he talks about growing a business too fast and how it leads to destruction so here's my little theory about company value creation the faster you build it that is the half-life it will get destroyed in the same amount of time and so when you think about a lot of like social businesses that's played out but and when you see sort of like what the sort of like the top so like you know does it take eight nine ten years to build a really great consumer business it'll take eight nine ten twelve years to destroy it and we may see the tipping point a couple of these businesses right now we may be seeing it in front of our eyes well said chermoth it took about a month and a half two months big cloud exploded into a one billion dollar business seemingly overnight i wonder how long it'll take for this thing to collapse no matter what all the people who are profiting off this site want to tell you this is not gonna be the future of twitter people are not going to want to pay bitclout to go tweet and you'll be knowing the full time that basically you gave the bag to people who already have the bag i mean i don't know what to tell you i mean honestly you almost have to admire the architecture of this whole thing it's built perfectly to capitalize on people's fomo and greed but will it work in the long run i don't think so i think this team has demonstrated a pattern of lies and deception and what people are saying is genius marketing which just basically amounts to breaking publicity like right to publicity laws yeah breaking the law cool strat guys let's see how that works out for you anyways that's my follow-up hope you enjoyed nobody's covering this thing dude i can't imagine why all right well that's it see you guys next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost wake up and smell me coffee
