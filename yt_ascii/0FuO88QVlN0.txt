so this idea that the saints have that the more we focus on christ the more we are moving towards christ the more we have to humble ourselves more we have to sacrifice ourselves and lower ourselves because we recognize how flawed we are how sinful we are in comparison right and maybe to an external observer it would seem like we're becoming sanctified various saints would say like at the end of their life you know oh i haven't even begun to repent so these kind of inversions of of that this like a simultaneous movement toward god and the sense of moving away because we're just so hate to say repugnant because of our sins but it's our perception of that it's not saying anything about god's perception of us it's only speaking about our perception of ourselves when we start to really know ourselves in relationship to [music] christ this is johathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so hello everyone i have the great joy to be here with father joseph lucas father joseph is the priest and pastor at christ the savior cathedral the oca cathedral in florida he's also become a good friend and he is the editor of the rule of faith journal that you can look up on amazon it is an orthodox journal of theology but here i have them here with me today because we had amazing discussions when i was there he has published his own thesis on the question of sacrifice in st seral of alexandria i am lucky to have a copy of it here and i thought that it would be really wonderful to explore that with him now and look at how the church fathers obviously especially st serel sees the question of sacrifice in the old testament in the new testament how christ transforms the question of sacrifice and and just in general the insight that he provides and so father joseph thanks for coming with us thank you for inviting me and so when we talked you said you had watched i think even one of my videos and you thought there was some interesting connections to make with the manner in which st seral presents the question of sacrifice so maybe you can start us there and tell us what it is that you think what insight you think that he provides well i think for one thing it's it's great because st serel really had a he focus his career i would say he focused his career on trying to understand the old testament and how the new testament is the fulfill of the old testament and because sacrifice is such an important part of the of the law he had to deal with it a lot and it comes up frequently throughout his writing so he gives you know a very deep interpretation of it but but it's also important i think to understand it as part of his overall biblical interpretation like what he's trying to do with the law how he's trying to bring the law into you know into the church in a way that that can be understood properly and and so sacrifice i think is at the root of that and so what does he think sacrifice is for well the very first reference if you go sort of chronologically through the bible the first sacrifices can and abel and he mentions it two places so he has his commentary on the pento so he mentions you know he goes into it there and then he also brings it up again in his commentary on john which is much later in his career and between the two of them we come away with a few a few ideas and the first one i think think that's that's really important is the idea that sacrifice is innate in human nature because there's no commandment god doesn't tell can and abble go sacrifice he never says you know here's how you do it they just spontaneously do it there's lots of ways you could come at that you could say well there's other things not written in in you know in the text that would be one way of looking at it but st sio approaches it that that there's this natural desire for humans to want to offer to god something to be to to sacrifice to god he doesn't flesh that out until a little bit later what that ultimate sacrifice should be but in that context he said it's just something natural and so because one of them was a shepherd and one was a farmer they just took from what what gifts they had and naturally wanted to give something to god okay and when i when i first read that it struck me because you know that kind of ties in with say like a an anthropological or perennial idea of the of of the fact that sacrifices is in every single culture throughout the world right that innate desire is there people want to do something for whatever it is the numinous the supernatural you know there's there's whatever they perceive god to be they want to make offerings and and so the very first offering that's recorded then in the scripture of cain and abel is about that innate desire and then how god responds to that desire the right way to do it and the wrong way to do it so so abel's the right way to do it it kan's the wrong way to do it so that's kind of where it starts out so for sure at the outset it's important to notice that stal doesn't see the sacrifice of cain and abel as in any way a propitiatory sacrifice he doesn't see it as something that is like kind of sacrifice for our sins the way that a lot of people think sacrifice is only is only for right i think well a good point would be to to define what we mean by propitiation so if we mean propitiation in the sense of just it's pleasing to god be an acceptable definition father steven d and i just he was here last week and we had a long talk about that and and the fact that it can be used in that way right but the problem is is that it came to me in the west assuaging or removing anger that god has right so it's like so that's kind of a pagan definition and definitely you won't find that pagan definition in st serel and later on when he starts talking about the law that's when we get into how he defines it and and and probably the word i use a lot is experation in english because it has the it clearly connects to what what st s's trying to do but definitely not with the king and abble sacrifice there's no sense of of god being upset with them and they need to to to you know somehow turn god's face back towards them or something like that you get them to be in commune with god it's just a it's s serial sees it as a natural desire to want to offer to god to be in relationship with god in some way yeah so it's it's kind of yeah it it's some it's like to give back to god or to offer back with that which has been received and so i mean this is a i don't maybe he doesn't but what does he see as cain's miss offering because in the text it's very vague it just says basically god doesn't accepted does he does he talk about that well the subagent gives us a little clue and he he hones in on the because the subagent says you did not rightly divided okay so so he picks up on that you know so what does it mean did not rightly divided what means he he offered the leftovers basically is how you know to paraphrase them like what so you have offer the best part exactly right he didn't take the very best and offer to god he took what he already didn't want interesting that would that would also connect it in some ways to the the the classic story of the the sacrifice of prometheus like in the greek myth where prometheus is supposed to like the people are supposed to offer the meat but then he offers the bones and just hides it with the skin so that you they trick the gods basically yeah so that so so it's about disposition from the beginning and that's kind of that's another theme that runs throughout st serial's commentary in the old testament this idea about the right disposition when you offer what does it mean so there's an inter there's an internalization you know it's it's what's coming out of the heart that's being exhibited through the external action you know through the sacrifice itself but i didn't know that about that in the septu agent there's a hint about why it is that he the sacrifice and that's interesting because i mean that's that's a that's one of the most i mean setan is one of the most ancient testimonies of biblical interpretation we have in the in the translation it's like this is how we translated it it means that this is how we see it so that's a that's fascinating and so then so then after that i guess seriel kind of moves into the story of sacrifice and so how does he come from this this early sacrifices up to christ like how does he see that relationship well it's the way he he approaches the law in particular is that everything in the law so this is this is part of i think we have to look at how he how he interprets the scripture what his exod jesus method is and the first well i would say you know the experts disagree on this but i i take this side is that his earliest work is called on worship in spirit and truth that's the you know the phrase from st john's gospel and it there's a debate whether that was first or whether he wrote his commentary in the pentat first but it seems that that would make more sense he wrote on worship in spirit and truth first because he lays out how he's going to interpret the scriptures and it seems that he followed like throughout his career he started with then he went on to the pentti and he kind of moved in chronological order through the scriptures and and got to the gospels and epistles later in his career and why that's important is because he starts out his book on worship in spirit and truth with how do we interpret the law and how does it relate to the new testament and he has this he has this probably imaginary interocitor that he's talking with and and and this this guy is is walking along with a copy of the gospels and you know this perfect setup you know he says oh you know sirel how how do we reconcile these two things and he quotes first matthew when it says when christ says that not you know he didn't come to abolish the law but to fulfill it how do we reconcile that with where he says in the gospel of john that we're going to worship in spirit and truth it seems that we he's he's doing away with the law and then st serel says the answer is in st paul it's the transition from the letter to the spirit and then he kind of the rest of that text he's kind of unpacking what that looks like and applying it in a kind of a u almost looking at like the metan narrative of scripture like or what what st nathan called the scope of scripture which like you know the the sort of arc of story from genesis all the way to revelation and and he goes through and he shows how the two things relate and he has some some pretty strong things to say about about the law like he he picks up on what st paul says when the law is a type and a shadow and so he says the law is a type and a shadow and the formation of a piety that is still in travail and has the beauty of truth hidden within itself and he says the that the law was imperfect only because they weren't ready to interpret it through christ so there's this transition that happens where where the law had its purpose but it could never be it could never do what it was meant to do he says that very clearly it's never able to do what it was meant to do until the fulfillment of the law came christ and then through the lens of christ we understand it in a in a in a anagogical or elevated way and so that's kind of his starting point so then he applies that to sacrifice all the sacrifices are in some way pointing to some aspect of what christ was coming to do and so that's that's kind of the way he looks at it all the way through is he takes these very sacrifices and he reinterprets them and says this is how it pertains to christ or this is how it pertains to the church you know sort of this uh type and anti-type you know u relationship throughout all the sacrifices so can you give us some examples of what like let's say let's take one let's say the yam kapur sacrifice like does he does he talk does he oh yeah deal with that because that's i would love to hear what he how he says about the two like the goat and the the sacrifice the goat that's given to azazel like how does he cons reconcile that with christ yeah so so so as ael for him is is the devil that's interesting because because but but it's interesting that he says it's not offered to the devil it's not offered to the devil you know essentially he says that that that would be a myth he said to say that it was offered as as ael as the devil would be a myth but the idea is that is that so he he starts out with saying that that the the symbolism of the two goats they have to be absolutely identical and the reason is is because they're just two aspects of the same offering just two two different aspects of the same offering the first one represents the the blood of the goat taken into the temple represents purification or experation so it shows the fact that christ would come to die and through him we are we are purified of sin okay so that's the first the meaning of the first half the second half he does talk about christ carrying sin away okay connects it to the ascension uhuh so the idea is that christ going off into the desert land where where ael is where the devil is is him going hering hades and then ascending up rising up and then ascending up into the heavens and then he calls it the untrodden land beyond is paradise right he goes up to be enthroned in the heavens and so he he sees it in a very different way so basically the two gos represent the crucifixion resurrection and ascension you know that's kind of what together they mean they're all part of the same offering but different aspects of the same of so he sees the goat that's cast into the wilderness as resurrection and ascension yes huh yeah now he doesn't now he he says that he does tie in at one point and say that that definitely he carries away our sins yeah so i can imagine like the hering of hades that makes a lot of sense to think of that you in the sense that he takes the sins and and and he kind of goes into it goes into the world of death you could say but it's interesting to think of it as a as ascension and and yeah that that one's kind of surprising it's a surprising interpretation let me see if i find a quote right here he says he likens the himself to the scapegoat in order to be sacrificed for sin so in some sense he connects himself to sin but then he says for he arose and departed to the untrodden land meaning into the heavens in some way carrying our sins to the city on high to present himself before the father on our behalf so it's a it's a it's a weird connection of all of us taking the sins on carrying them away but then ascending up and and and then he'll connect a little bit later to the idea of him being the the high priest mediator so he carries them up to offer them up before the father as as our mediator to be purged of these sins in the heaven so it's it's in a sense still connected experation yeah but it's it's unusual how he connects it to the resurrection and the ascension but he he uses that same theme a couple different ways with yam so he he says the untrodden land so he's he's connecting in some ways the paradise with a strange land or a land that we don't know like as if the paradise in some ways is a using the image of wilderness for paradise like that to me that's weird like that's a surprise i have to say yeah it's it's it's it's unusual it's it's not what i expected because you know when you when you first do a cursory reading of like the fathers when you're trying to try come up with a hypothesis you know four thesis to examine the text that's not what i would have come up with initially and then when i you know of course you read the text to let the text teach you and then you get to these things you're like okay he's he's coming at this from a very different perspective than i thought yeah but it's i mean it's it's interesting definitely and so so does he still have this idea also of the offering to god like that the crucifixion is an offering in the sense of the can and aable sacrifice does he does he talk about that a little bit so he's he's fine with saying that the offering was made towards the father all right so this is before because it's not until the about the 10th century that they work out this whole idea that that that the the son is also the re receiver but he does mention elsewhere that the son as god also receives the offering so he kind of presages that a bit by about five centuries you know which gets worked out later on in a in a local council in constantinople where they say that that the son is also the receiver along with the father and spirit so he does say that so on one on one hand yes it's it's the it's the son in his human nature so this is this is something that would be controversial to maybe some people who think that seral is kind of a like an actual monophysite in some way has a definite idea of the distinction of the two natures and so christ's mediation is really in his human nature right or through his human nature so so through his human nature he's offering himself up to the father but as you know as god himself with the father he's also receiving that offering so he does mention that as well so there's this kind of connection there but but one of the things he's very clear about is that there's no point in which the in which the father somehow is disconnected from him in this offering yeah that's important like that that on that because this is something we've seen recently this idea that when christ says you know why have you abandoned me that god did abandon him this is something that i think martin luther ends up saying explicitly that that that god abandoned christ in that moment on the cross but sir st seral does not go in that direction no in fact i we don't have any idea who he's responding to at least i haven't i i don't know and i haven't found any other researchers who who have looked at this but he's responding to somebody when he says that you know there's some there's some who would say that the father looked away from the cross when the son offered himself and he goes at lyns to say why this is a ridiculous idea as he said first of all you know first of all there's there's two reasons one is that he is with one nature with the father and that's that's obviously you know on a theological level but then he says just on a very practical level he said why would the father look away from that which he desired you know this this offering was the will of the father and the son and that which is most honorable why would he look away from something so honorable as the self-offering of his son so there's this idea that you know there's nothing there's nothing tainted in the in the in the offering of christ this is his this is what was meant to be and and the father would never would never distance himself from that offering he's a part of it in the fact in two ways the fact that he's at at one with the son in nature and also that and that he and the son both desire this they have a common will that they desire this thing to happen and there's no sense of of even in his human nature because that's the one thing s does even though he he definitely makes clear that there are these you know there are two natures a human and divine nature it's always the incarnate son acting i think that's one of the important principles of his theology is this it's it's the one incarnate lord acting you know and so therefore you cannot even though it's through his human nature that he is the high priest can't divide it yeah he's not yeah you can't divide it in any way so how does he i mean maybe you you don't have an answer for this but how does he interpret that phrase you know when christ cries out to his father so he he has essentially laid out throughout this is more so not so much in his exegesis more so in his u his theological writings especially in response to noorus he makes clear that all the things that christ christ went through he did it not because he needed for his own for his own sake but in order to transform it for our sake so for example the the garden of gethsemane was very important for him yeah garden of geth is a point where one of the blameless passions one of the things that human beings all suffer through you know even if they're if even if they were perfected would be the fear of death because it's unnatural for us to really die we want to to live we have a sense of eternity and the fear of death is real and that humans have to face this and so in the guardian gemi he takes on the the human fear of death in its fullness in order to transform it for us he says and does the same because he accepts finally that's always what people have to understand is that although he goes through that anguish then ultimately he accepts he he says yes to the to to what is going to happen right yeah he always st s always emphasizes the idea this a voluntary offering it has to voluntary it has to be christ doing this fully taking it on active in every single part of it in order to transform it for human nature going forward yeah yeah there there's in the garden of gsem there's so many mysteries about that because one of the things that i think is going on in the garden of gethsemane is that we're actually facing we're actually seeing christ in the garden about to eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil but he he doesn't want it right that's the difference between him and adam he actually knows that if you eat of that fruit you will die and he says no if if i can be spared the fruit if i can be spared this cup then then then then but if that's your will then i'll do it and so it's like god gives him the fruit and now he takes it and dies but then that is the image of his of his being god like it's you could say that it's his deification he's already god but like it's his moment where he does in fact manifest fully that he he is like god by eating the fruit right well it's it's it's a it's a it's a you know the self- ting keeps happening throughout his entire earthly life you know it's not just it's not just that he he poured himself out in the conception in the theotokos his womb it's not that's not the only moment in which he he becomes humble and enters into the you know the status of a of a slave there's an ongoing you know self-emptying throughout his life all the way up to the cross ge's part of that that progress and then on the cross when he's saying you know my lord my lord why why have you forsaken me he's taking on the the he's taking on that the the the human sense of separation of dejection of you know and this is again part of him accepting all the blameless passions and you know because those are things we don't have control over right we it's just like hunger and thirst and all the other things he's taken on he has to ultimately take on the fear of death the fear of separation from god and then death itself is the final foe he has to take on you know in his that he overturns through the resurrection and and you know i know i know father stephen d young in part and others have pointed out that in that moment where he calls out and and and ask god ask his father why he abandoned him there's also a prophecy happening while he s saying that because he's quoting from a psalm in which at the end of the psalm god raises up you know david out of the pit and so it's like he's actually so he's saying like you said he's purifying it he's like he's like i'm gonna i'm going through this truly but there is a secret prophecy hidden in what he's doing which is that god will raise him up in the in the in the end it's very powerful and and it's always s s uses the the phrase you know for our sakes all the time right so idea i like to think of it this is if you remember back in the maybe late 80s and 90s i don't know if you had this in canada but we had the oxy clean commercials when they first came out and you had the tank of oxyclean you know the white powder thrown in the water and they stir it up and and they had this immensely dirty cloth or something and they they dip it into the oxylean and they make a point of saying instead of the oxylean looking dirty the cloth comes out white you know and so this is this is my analogy to try to try to put a put forward exactly what st s was explaining right so so he's like this oxyclean right so sin and and and these things are trying to you know to attack him and in his human nature he instead of him being affected anyway by the sin he doesn't that's why st serel points out you know that paul says that he's without sin he's like us in all ways but he's he's without sin is that when sin tries to tries to attack him or any of the the blameless tred to affect him instead of him being affected there's an immediate reversal for the sake of human nature at large right so he reverses it or or repels it in a sense and because he's of one nature with us according to his humanity we share in the benefits of that in a potential right we potentially share in the benefits of that when we by faith are united to christ we we are given that power to repel the sin to not be affected by it so it's part of his it's part of his overall idea of how we're saved how we're transformed it's all rooted in how he you know how he responds to these things and and so what it's interesting what kind of comes to mind in terms of what the way that he presents sacrifice is that it seems like if the sacrifice of cain and abel at the outset is natural in the sense that it's something that is in us to want to give up to god then it wouldn't if that's how he sees the origin of sacrifice then it makes sense that would move towards the idea of self-sacrifice right where ultimately you realize that the ultimate sacrifice is the giving of of oneself and so maybe you can talk a little bit about his ideas on that and how christ brings us into that that that that difference so the first thing is that is that the law was a way that to channel the innate desire that's the first thing right so so people have this innate desire like k and abel and so all of human kind was you know in some way making offerings and and reaching out to what they understood god to be but in the revelation that god gives the beginning with moses and and forward he's basically channeling that he's basically or giving order to it arranging it but he's doing it the one of the things that st s was very clear about is that none of it was necessary right there was no god's god is without necessity he doesn't need any he doesn't need meat offerings he doesn't need anything right there's which is said which is said in like it says that in scripture and that's really important to remember that right exactly i mean it's especially in the prophets you know it's all through like isaiah and ezekiel and things like that and he and he does one of the things i focused on in my in my thesis was also on the the the prophets you know how he u sees that in the prophets so so none these let me just say one last thing because that's really important because because if we believe that then we understand that the idea of the trade sacrifice like the of the simple trade of like you know or or also the idea that god god needs sacrifice in order in order to forgive our sins or some kind of weird idea that this is necessary in from the point of view of god for this to happen in order like as if there's this like weird rule that you know well now you've sinned so now you're impure so you got to kill these things so that god will god will that you can have access to god again like that is not nowhere this type of thinking there's no quid proquo yeah in the offerings yeah there there's a sense that god doesn't need it and and so he does two things so for one thing he he he makes it clear that that he's going to organize and and sort of channel this desire entirely to prepare people for his coming and the only necessary offering of himself he's the necessary offering to accomplish what he desires to do which is to save humanity to overcome death for us and things like that so that's that that is what he would say would be a necessary offering in the way that that god wants to to help mankind so he basically establishes or channels this this old testament offering system in order to point everything towards christ so everything is pedagogical he takes up that that idea from st paul that the law is is a is a tutor or pedagogue and so it's all pedagogical or or symbolic to point towards the one true offering of christ and then he can then he can go through and and apply the spirit of the law which the spirit of law is the intent so so what's the true intent and he go he presses this really really far because he essentially says that that the old testament law really had at some points he says it wasn't efficacious in any way right there's nothing it could actually do there's a couple points where he concedes a little bit and says that so long as the as long as the israelites were doing it with the right intention their faith had some efficacy right there was something they were gaining from being faithful and obedient to god but that it couldn't actually do anything because it wasn't just a like a mechanical system like obviously that that's ridiculous to think that it that anyways right well that's that's why that's why it gets condemned by the prophets the prophets say look you think it's an automatic thing it's all about your intention about you're acting in faith you're doing this in obedience and faith and love towards god when you do it in the right way then god is somehow blessing you that's what st serial is basically saying god is god will bless you and response because you're doing it out of faith so he's channeling this desire for sacrifice and if they do it the right way with the right intent like like ael with the right with the right heart then god will respond back with blessings for them okay yeah and let me just say i just want to say the people for the people watching and to understand how this is organically true in anything that has to do with any type of relationship that you engage with others whether it's hierarchical or whether it's it's it's across levels is that you know it if you it's not just like okay so shake the person's hand you know do this and that and if you do all these things then you'll be in a right relationship with others like we all know that's nonsense like that's not true of course we have to shake the other person's hands of course we have to we have to be polite we have to do all these things that are kind of like rules but if they're not done with the right intention of of entering into communion with the person then we know that we could do all the right things and and then we would find ourselves in disharmony with others and so it's it's as true for family meal for how you relate to your children to your parents to your to your spouse as it is for how we also relate to god so it doesn't mean that we completely remove the the rituals the rituals are there to embody the intention but without the intention then the rituals ultimately can become can become pernicious even you know it's like if you shake someone's hand and you you know you give them that look like you know it's like i actually hate you then the handshake is n you know yeah yeah symbol plus intention i think that's that's a good way to say what what st c how he defines it you know you have to have the the meaning is there but the meaning has to be backed up by the right disposition but but here's what he says though this is so it's this idea that that the antitype christ is the only one who uh imbus meaning to anything that happened any of the types right the type only only exists for the sake of the antitype and so so for example he says uh he says though the law of old was not sufficient to help those in olden times the myster mystery of christ was outlined in it but with the coming of christ's purification by a type then of necessity fell in obeyence since the reality was now present and then he goes on to say that you know that the real reason that there was any kind of you know efficacy in the old testament sacrificial system was because already christ was there in it yeah and now that christ has come it falls away and it sounds like some of the wording he uses i don't know if have you ever read uho sardis st meo sardis is this is a great if if you have time to get it sometime i know it's in the st vlad's popular patristic series it's on pca it's the sermon that st malo sardis gave in the second century probably like on the eve of pca it's like it's like a a poetic sermon that he gave and there's sections of it that are quoted later on our apostal hymnography so it actually got picked up in the church and it's many scholars think that he was a jew who converted to christianity and became the bishop of sardis and so st molo i'll read this little section of st malo it's very similar to what st s was writing a couple centuries later he says this is about the passover and the blood of christ he says tell me oh angel this is the angel of death at what were you turned away at the sacrifice of the sheep or the life of the lord at the death of the sheep or the type of the the lord at the blood of the sheep or of the spirit of the lord clearly you were turned away because you saw the mystery of the lord taking place in the sheep the life of the lord in the sacrifice of the sheep the type of the lord in the death of the sheep for this reason you did not strike israel but it was egypt alone that you made childless so it's like the angel of death comes and he already sees the mystery of the lamb of god who comes to take away the sins of the world and he's turned away by that very similar to what in fact i' like to write an article at one point seeing if there any connection if st s had any access to st mito because there's this sense in in st c that you know that that everything any any kind of response positive response god had to israel in the mosaic system was because he saw that they were fulfilling what would would ultimately point to christ right christ is the one giving it power in some way he says otherwise it would become ineffectual if they did not if it was not connected directly to christ and so then how does st sero or does he connect this ultimately with the christian life that is to to show that our life is a living sacrifice right these these phrases that we say in in our in our lurgical practice that or that we see that that we are meant to give ourselves ultimately that that is what all of this is leading to in terms of our own practice yeah that's actually that's i would say that's probably what everything is about for him because he says you know so the sacrificial system points to christ and then christ accomplishes what he needs to accomplish and so what is the spirit of the law now the spirit of the law now is to see how we become christ in in our self-offering so so basically he sets up this idea that we have to voluntarily die and then he connects that to this idea of picking up our cross each day and following after christ every day is like a like a spiritual death or or our own self-emptying for the sake of god and and this kind of sets up an entire way of looking at the world you know this this idea that the christian is the one who's constantly sacrificing himself yeah it's interesting i i i tried to you know when i was when i was completing the dissertation i spent a couple years just reading all the literature and sacrifice i could possibly find and so i had to read i had to read like you know you name it gustaf island all these different ones i read everyone who talked about different aspects of of sacrifice and some of them christian some non-christian anthropological studies and i came to rene gerard and and i was trying to see in what ways like his scapegoat you know idea you know there's a sense that i i saw that there's some some parallels between his idea of the scapegoat and how he says that christ ultimately fulfills that he becomes one who takes on everything you know but it was a little it still a little bit too protestant for me you know well it's not just that it's that it's that gerard misses is another aspect of sacrifice we and so if you take the yam kipur sacrifice for example it's like there are two sacrifices my friend there's one that is out to the wilderness and there's one that's offered up and the sacrifice that's offered up is not the same is not a christ brings them together and in a very very sh mind shattering way but they're not the same and so you know it's like when for example like the pouring out of libations and all of these types of behaviors that the ancients said cannot be reduced to scape co sacrifices so gerard is as if gerard gets half of the story right but he's missing an entire half of the story which makes his theory in my opinion insufficient and means that it's difficult for him to reach this conclusion so his tendency will be to say that christ has abolished sacrifice and now there's no more sacrifice now there's no more sacred there's actually no more sacred anymore whereas the christian the true christian position is to say christ has shown how all of this has to to become internalized and that we can be take the sins of others to some extent even that we can sacrifice ourselves that we can become the scapegoats in many ways that that is a healing and that it and that internalized process now is the way that we live and it's actually the way that it's actually our morality is based on that implicitly or explicitly is based on that image of what the s of what sacrifice is i think well in the the 20th century in st silon the athonite he has this idea that you know the ultimate goal is for us to all become adam and a sense and take on the sins of of the world in a sense right to be like christ is to be able to become a scapegoat ourselves to become you know the passover offering ourselves to the entire all the symbolism of the the old testament sacrificial system capitulated in christ we have to imitate that we have to take that on in some way and live a life of self- offering of constant sacrifice and it's unbearable like it's i hate every moment of what you just said like i just hate that i don't want to do that but i can see in the story like if you look at some of the stories of the saints you have very powerful images especially in the monastic stories of monks who do exactly that who actually take on blame of things they did not do towards the salvation of others and in the in the in when people see the monk taking the blame for their sins onto themselves you know they're transformed in ways that approach or that just scolding or whatever punishment would never be able to accomplish it's it's some of these stories are pretty amazing well that if i if i could branch off into just something else for one second it it ties in with so i've been my my kind of whole project over the last 20 years has been looking at you know su triology how how salvation works through the the father's interpretation of the bible and before i started working on sacrifice and expiation i looked at justification and and so i have a little i put out a little book back in 2010 based on my research on that and it was focusing on the desert fathers and so the desert fathers were picking up on the gospel of luke where in the gospel of luke in the the parable of the of the publican and the pharisee the the publican basically by by accepting all blame he descends down and the and he's the one who's vindicated or justified by god because he descends down by taking on all blame and god's the one who vindicates and lifts him right he exalts him and then the pharisee he exalts himself and god lowers him right he brings him down and and condemns him and of course the words the word in greek for to justify or vindicate theo it's opposite as k which means to condemn those two words are used in the parable so it's the opposite of to vindicate right he gets condemned down and and that gets picked up in orthodoxy in the the hymn for one of the one of the troparia for that sunday of the publican the pharisee during lent it says for the you know for the publican exalted himself or lowered himself based himself and he was exalted up and the the pharisee exalt himself and he was he was abased you know he was brought down low so we have this idea that that when we take on the blame when we take on and become that offering we allow god as judge christ as judge to be the one to lift us up and exalt us you know he's the one who takes us up to the to the heights rather than ourselves you know so it's kind of linked to this that's why you see this this sort of language throughout especially like the aesthetical writings the neptic fathers the desert fathers yeah understanding that way makes so much sense of so many bible stories you know even from the beginning from genesis you know and so you know you that's how you can understand that what god is asking of adam you you know to not raise himself up you know to not himself take the fruit to not to not pull himself up that that that what god wanted for him was to for that god does like that god was going to raise adam up and you see that in the in the scripture sometimes it's tricky for people because it's people might find it hard to see that in the text because it's like well you know it's a it's a bit tricky of st ephraim to say that god wanted to give him the fruit doesn't say that in the text you know but if you take the entire scope of if you take the entire scope of of scripture and you kind of see it together you realize that it's there all through like even the story of solomon when it's like god asks solomon what what he wants it's like i will give you and then he says i want the knowledge of good and evil and god is like good that yes that's exactly what you should ask for and i'm going to give it to you but he doesn't he's not trying to take it for himself so this weird moment when solomon shows us already that this was there there in the whole narrative scripture this idea that what is received from above is different from than what is taken for ourselves it's the opposite in some ways and it and we're lifted up when we when we abase ourselves it's it seems contradictory but once you kind of see the logic you're like actually no that's really how reality works yeah yeah it's it's so it's it's so prevalent throughout all of the u at least in the i'm not as familiar with the western lurgical tradition but in the eastern lurgical tradition i mean this idea of humbling yourself is is is just ubiquitous it's everywhere i mean it's just i mean all of all of lent focuses on that right all the the the hymns and the various themes of the services is almost always about how do we humble ourselves before god repentance is of course part of humbling which is so important during the the fasting seasons because repentance is about admitting you know that that we are against god and turning back towards him and and and reestablishing relationship because we're in the wrong we take on the blame and and the more we take on the blame you know we allow god to be god because when christ says that you know that he says judge not lest you be judged he's not talking about a lack of discernment right because the same wordo is the same word to judge or to discern they're not two different words we sometimes translate them differently but they're the same word used in different parts positively and negatively in the new testament what he's saying is is don't usurp my position i am the lord i sit on the throne of judgment i hold the keys you know to life and death don't youer my position it's not your place to determine you know the the outcome of of you know human affairs or of individual humans you have to humble yourself and see yourself only in comparison to me he says right and so again in the desert fathers there's this idea of you know it says you know who is man that you know he's made a little lower than the angels and they take that and they say you know god placed us down here you know in this in this reality and you know this idea of up and down right of above and below we we should only be looking up we should only be we should we're down here only looking up at the lord and comparing ourselves only to him and we compare ourselves only to christ we can't really exalt ourselves in any way you know in fact um this ties into like in isaiah 6 when isaiah who's probably the holiest man of his time right he's this incredible prophet and he gets initiated into the throne room of god he's there in probably what st paul would call the third heaven or something like that and and he says i i am undone i'm a man of unclean lips so this idea that the that the that the saints have that the more we focus on christ the more we are moving towards christ the more we have to humble ourselves more we have to sacrifice ourselves and lower ourselves because we recognize how how you know how flawed we are how sinful we are in comparison right that comparison it's like it's like this weird inversion where we're moving towards christ and maybe to an external observer it would seem like we're becoming sanctified our own perception of it we realize how much further we're getting away from him simultaneously so various various saints would say like at the end of their life you know oh i haven't even begun to repent you know or you know or i'm afraid you know they're glowing with the uncreated light and then and the people there hear him talking and say you know he says he's he's responding to the demons i i don't have any hope you know you know so these kind of inversions of of that this like a simultaneous movement toward god and the sense of moving away because we're just so hate to say repugnant you know because of our sins but it's our perception of that right it's not saying anything about god's perception of us it's only speaking about our perception of ourselves when we start to really know ourselves in relationship to christ you know and and the more we're able to offer ourselves up freely to christ the more we move towards him but the more we realize how much more work we have to do in offering ourselves up yeah yeah and you can see like you know you can see how this applies even at lower levels you know when you think you know when you think of the problem of the politician you know the problem of democracy for example which is that you end up with like narcissists you know because you have to you have to fight so much to get it like you have to do everything you know and basically to get that position of power you have to be willing to do anything lie do whatever it takes just to get there whereas what we really want is something like a reluctant king like that's what we would really want right someone who we know is the best to be the king but really he doesn't want to be the king and we almost have to force like to say no you're the king you know like all these stories of of the ancient bishops you know they go get the the monk in the cave and see say okay you're the the bishop and you you would just run away and bring it back no no like we know that you're the bishop so that's what we would want but it's a it's yeah it's difficult to yeah it it's it's at the one hand impossible you know it just feels impossible but on the other hand you know that it it has to be that way and that's the that's actually the best image of reality right father joseph this was amazing like thank you so much for for for this conversation and and and and yeah and i hope i see you i think you're you said you're going to come to the symbolic world summit and so people can will be able to meet you there that's my plan i hopefully get up there i mean it's not that far i mean tarp and springs we call it tarpon p that's a greek because it's it's entirely greek up there exactly it's like the greek capital of america i try to get up there once every year or so and my family and and walk around the sponge docks and buy some greek stuff and bring it back to miami so so definitely looking forward to to to seeing you again and thanks for your insight and thank you for your time father yeah
