- we wanted to say hi. - i thought i heard
someone in the distance. - it was him.
- that's what i heard. (upbeat music playing) - i wonder what they're
talking about right now. - [quaid] there's lots of
footsies going on right now. - [mary lisa] i know, i'm moving my legs to try to get more air.
(wind whipping) - [quaid] getting footsie
from two different directions. - what challenge are you doing? - we're in money. and then whoever gets

too close to me. okay? can you just get out?
(all laughing) (truck engine rumbling) - don't die! - i'll try not to! - very smart idea for the fishing net. (wind whipping) - [mary lisa] i would've
never thought about that. (upbeat music playing) - [jimmy] all right
guys. we are back home. you guys are getting push
out, back into the warehouse. - take 3, 2, 1 go.

window with your butt? - how did you do-

(all laughing) - what? - how do we explain that to the insurance? - i'll offer a thousand dollars if someone gets out now
to make this easier. - ooh.

(all clapping) - we had to lighten the load. so i offered him a thousand
dollars if he'd get out. there. we're good.
- we're good. they survived.
(team cheering) so our first contestant has gotten out. how does it feel? you still
made a thousand dollars. not bad. - not too shabby. - yep. well, ty made nothing. - oh, i'm sorry man.
- zero. - all right. well, you
can go home now, ty. are you jealous that he's
standing out there and you're not? - not really.
- not really? - not really.
- why not? - i'm good for another like five hours. - [jake] he's about to win this ten grand! - how about you? - oh, i'm good. - what was going through
your mind when i said a thousand dollars? - [mary lisa] he tried to get out first. - really?
- yeah. - oh really? - what? well, did you?
- no. what? no. - [jimmy] how about you? - nah, i'm- i'll stay put. - yeah, going for the 20? - yeah. why not? might as well. you know? - all you have to do is sit there. - that's what i like to hear. - that's what i do best. - that was crazy. it was pretty sweaty. i had a great experience. it was fantastic. - would you do it again?
- most definitely. - [tariq] that's actually baby powder. an umbrella- now you give her an umbrella? - watch.
- that's really nice. - that feels so good. - i'm really good at this. - when did you learn this?
(chandler laughing) - since the ripe age of 12. - play with umbrellas all day. (gate slamming) - hey guys, future jimmy. i'm watching the video. and i just realized, we never mentioned that the contestant splits
the winnings with their coach if they win. i made it that way so the
coach would be incentivized to keep their contestant company, go buy them things, and
just take care of them. i don't know why i
thought we mentioned that, but we never did. anyways. back to the video. - how long do you think
you've been in here? - six hours, maybe? feels
like a trillion years. (mary lisa laughing) - i don't carry around a wallet anymore. do you know what would be sick? is if you said the amount, the
amount you want to shoot out- - 450. yeah.
(all laughing) - so then when you pay,
it just shoots at them. - how you holding up on bathrooms? - it's getting there. i'm gonna try to, i'm trying- (bottle crunching)
i'm holding out. - [chandler] i'm going
to get you something. i'll be right back. (vegetables scraping) - what is this?
- oh my god. - oh no, you did not. - premium treatment. - that is great. (mary lisa gasping)
- oh, no regret. - really need to use the restroom. - really? - yeah. i think my girl's
kind of pissed at me. so we'll see. we'll see how longer i can play it out. - what's the biggest
struggle for you right now? - had to pee for like a while.
- really? - but i can hold it. - my dad has trained me for this moment. we always go on road trips, pennsylvania, and he never wants to stop and pee. so... - oh. - [chandler] so you're
a trained professional. - i'm a trained
professional at not peeing. - wow.
- well that's funny, because i take baths
like these all the time. (all laughing) - so you wanna use the restroom? you wanna use the restroom-
- so bad. you do not understand. - oh my god.
- i don't know, man. - he's struggling.
- yeah. i think i might have to call it. - okay. i mean, if you
wanted, but ten grand's a lot of money. - it is a lot of money. all right, all right,
we're doing it together. - i'm gonna grab your sweaty pits. - one, two, three-
(team clapping) (quaid groaning)
(disappointed crowd effect) - he's done.
(chandler clapping) that's it, man. yo, he just got out.
(chandler clapping) we're really gonna win now. aren't we? - yeah.
- get out. why are you gonna sit here and suffer for jake to win 10 grand? - i'm gonna get 10 grand. - i'll give you two
grand if you get out now. - yeah.
(chandler clapping) - it was pretty crazy. honestly. - you still couldn't win. - yep. - you gave up 10k for that girl. she better realize that this
man, quaid station four, is the best boyfriend in the world. - there we go.
- there's only two left, jake. - i know. - still in it?
- yeah. - i got you a present. (air conditioner thumping) - oh my god. (laughing)
- god. - he said he was hot, so. - how much was that?
- don't worry about it. - how much was it? - like 300, but it's fine. (gate slamming) - have we ever had a female
win a challenge before? - no.
- really? - you can make history.
- oh my god. - you'll be-
- you're gonna be the- - [chris] bag over head. - no, you have to write on the bag. i need a girl's face.
(bag crinkling) - think of the millions of women that watch all our videos. they're looking up to you right now. - they better be. - you could be the first female in history to ever win a mrbeast challenge. (gate slamming) - wait, what are you guys doing? - origami.
- origami. - what's origami? - i don't know.
- folding things. - you're so nosy, tariq. let us do our own thing. - what is, wait, what is that? - that's a shirt. (laughs) - that's a shirt?
- it's a shirt for a mouse. - it's a collared shirt. (gate slamming) - [mary lisa] so how are you feeling? you're looking a little tired. - sweet. oh, someone's
trying to facetime me. - hey, i'm still doing
this challenge thing. it's me and this girl left. - this girl. ouch. (laughs)
- and we're sitting- - so you're mad. all right, well, have fun. - see, this is why you
just shouldn't date. because you have nobody waiting on you. - the girl i'm talking
to thinks i'm having fun with some other girl. - i mean-
- this isn't fun. (all laughing) - this is not fun.
- i'm having fun. - you're talking to a girl, and she's getting kinda, you know- - well, she called earlier.
- so- he answered to say, "i can't talk." and she overheard her saying, "this is why i don't
get in relationships." (jimmy clapping) and she's like, "have fun with the girl
you're hanging out with." - really?
- she probably thinks i'm lying about this whole thing, 'cause it does sound so far-fetched. (mary lisa laughing)
- oh my god. - all right. i don't want her to hate me. - literally. that's what happened? - what?
- i'm talking- - you should get out to go talk to her. - i can't. i've invested too much time. - you're gonna choose
money over your girl? - no. - do you feel bad for what you've done to
this man's relationship? - yeah, put her on- - i'm sorry i laughed. (gate slamming) - i'm getting tired. i thought i had this in the bag, but if she can hold her
pee longer in than me- - give. it. up. (laughs) - thomas, give me the rundown. i'm tired. - okay.
- i got pee. again-
- be honest. - i just hear a bunch of excuses. - be honest. - what? i kind of want to go make sure my lady friend's all right.
(mary lisa laughing) - oh, you're gonna turn
down 20 grand for her? or 10 grand for her? all right. well, you sound
like you want to get out. go ahead. but you can still stop, all right, okay- (all chattering)
- he's done. (chandler clapping) - that is out. - oh my god. get me out of here. - (chandler) okay.

sudden won three in a row. - i went out of the country
and came back a new man. that's all you gotta say.
(mary lisa and jimmy laughing) they started just slapping me. and i was like, okay, i'll win. (jimmy and tariq laughing) - oh my gosh, i have to pee. - what are you gonna buy? chandler, what are you gonna buy? - [cameraman] what would
you get if you won 20 grand? - i'm getting an ostrich. - an ostrich?
- yes. - where is the ostrich? (clapping) - [tariq] where is the ostrich? - yo, i can't really like have him, 'cause it's kind of like, illegal. - guys, riot. comment on every video until he gets an ostrich. - if i can get some legal documentation for an ostrich, i'll get one. - mary lisa.
