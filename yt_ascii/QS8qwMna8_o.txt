you're no longer a big user of email that's true can you tell me about your attitude to email them and is it in is something other people should consider is this just specific well as i said on the web i'm not i'm a special case i'm not my role in life is not to be on top of things as much as to be on the bottom of things it's best often for me to be a bit of a hermit and and and have time for things that require long attention span and no interruptions email is the name of the game is interruption on the other hand i do impose on other people and ask them random questions but starting about 1990 i realized that i had done i started using email 1975 and 15 years of it was kind of a lifetime's worth as far as i could see because i had become treated as a random oracle people all over would just ask me random questions and i would dutifully reply not only that but as an author i also don't want to just dash something off but i read it off make sure that my sentences are well constructed and spelled correctly and so on so it took a long time and it turned out that i was spending you know i would start out with an idea of what i can do that day and then four hours later i say okay now let me just let me try to go forward after after processing email on the other hand i sent a question to a guy i mean i had my secretary send a question to a guy last week and i'm disturbed that he hasn't replied yet so so i'm not being fair i mean i'm imposing on other people and not letting them impose on me do people bring it up with you the main problem is that they that they try to go through my wife and bother her and so so i have to have to try to stop that as as soon as i can it was an indescribably great experience it really was because there were so many people there who were so good and the environment was totally open and supportive if you had a problem it was like the corridors of the building everybody's office door was open you could say i have a problem to anybody and they would try and help you they would drop whatever they were doing
