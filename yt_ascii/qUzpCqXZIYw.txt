this is the brand new rog phone 7 ultimate it's 1400 it's the fastest most extreme android phone to ever exist by a mile does it beat the iphone is it finally time for me and other iphone users to jump ship to android spoiler this is me getting into bed at 3am last night because one of these phones batteries would not die during my battery test so starting with the unboxing experience i can say with a high degree of confidence so far yes the phone comes packaged in what looks like an interplanetary object this magnetic strap by the way is also a dock for the phone that launches an augmented reality video game which is shockingly well fleshed out for what's basically just a party trick i mean these things are actual buttons that control your phone like a games console there's an insert which has a case inside of it cool design but just shockingly little material here considering the beastly size of the phone you've got the charging brick usbc cable a very sizable pouch don't even think about editors and that's made to carry the single most ridiculous phone accessory you've ever seen the aeroactive call at seven here's the phone which with the case this skimpy kind of looks like you've just slipped a bodybuilder into a bikini now compare that to the unboxing experience of the iphone 14 pro max i guess they win on minimalism but yeah at this point clearly goes to the rog eight more tests to go let's see if the most extreme flagship phone on the planet can be the most popular flagship phone on the planet so then we've got audio and to be honest i've been super impressed with the speaker quality on the new iphones no one can argue that this is not one of the best sounding phones on the market with a pretty powerful combination of its bottom firing speaker and then its vehicle speaker on the front but this is something else entirely last year's rog phone 6 already had the best phone speakers on the market and they say they've now given the speaker units even more room to be able to move and therefore push more air which should result in even boomier sound oh wow okay instantly you can probably hear this all the way to apple bar wow this is insane how much better that is in the iphone it's louder the bass is something and the position of the speakers makes it feel like the sound's being fired directly into my ears but then it just gets silly good when you use this so this rog company has been making coolers like this for generations now and every time they release a new one they add a key new feature to it so at this point we've got a kickstand the headphone jack physical buttons leds a portal that opens up on the phone to allow it to pump air directly over the chip itself but this time around it's also a subwoofer or in other words a third speaker designed specifically for bass so just by locking it in like this it's adding a whole other layer of warmth and richness to the track don't know what else to say second point also goes to the rog okay fine the unboxing experience the audio experience you could say they're still niche features so let's test what's arguably the most core fundamental phone feature for all of us the battery so we'll get both phones side by side these are brand new versions of each phone by the way just to make sure they have 100 battery health i've equalized brightness and put speaker volume at 50 so let's see who wins the plan is we're running straight youtube videos for the first couple of hours okay wow the iphone is actually a reasonable amount ahead possibly because its display can automatically reduce its refresh rate to lower than the rog phone can when not needed to save battery i also reckon though at least some part of this is the fact that apple's battery indicator does not tell you the truth i'm pretty sure that iphones hang on the first few percentage points just to reassure the user that their phone's not dropping as soon as they take it out of charge so now social media we'll do instagram and tick tock for another couple of hours and after that you can start to see the rog pulling ahead but what's really going to separate the men from the boys is some proper gaming so we'll run some genshin impact some doom and just basically keep these games on until the phone's call it quits which in the iphone's case gives us a total time of 9 hours and 30 minutes i would say that is towards the upper end of modern black but just not the best meanwhile the rog is still going it's still about 37 for goodness sake but slowly surely if we push it hard enough it too eventually dies but it took 12 hours and' minutes to get there which frankly is insane and yes i stood around for 12 hours to get this result so you know subscribe if you appreciate it you won't regret it i'm only half surprised by the results i mean this thing does have two separate 3 000 milliamp hour batteries inside of it so six thousand milliamp hour total which is a lot more than this guy it's just that because it's actually the lighter phone between the two you forget how much is in there but then i was like well the phones are down here anyway they're both at zero percent right now we might as well also test how fast they can charge and you see why i ended up sleeping at 3am now so i plugged both in using the original charging bricks and cables provided with them which gives the rog up to 65 watts of power and the iphone well technically zero watts it doesn't come with a charger but assuming you'll pay the extra forty dollars to get the fastest possible charging this brick can deliver 27 watts of power to an iphone 14 pro the iphone's definitely off to a faster start which might sound strange but it's not actually unheard of because that wattage figure it doesn't tell you the full story because the number only tells you the maximum charging power the phone can't reach not the power that it can keep sustaining the charge at so anyway as soon as the rog phone kicks into gear it very quickly equalizes even slightly overtaking after just 10 minutes and deciding to think about is that the iphone also has a far smaller battery capacity too 4 300 milliamp hours versus 6 000 so there's just less to fill up and so the fact that it's even close sends a very clear message that charging speed is not one of apple's fortes and yeah if you look at the final times for the complete charge rog phone slips in at one hour seven minutes while the iphone still has a way to go so that's another point to the rog now you might all be thinking well of course the rog phone wins all of this it's a 1400 phone but the this thing comes with 512 gigabytes of storage by default and if you go for 512 gigabytes on the iphone it's the same price as this in the us and actually the much more expensive phone basically everywhere else but surely surely the iphone wins in the camera department right the camera is one of the reasons to buy an iphone well both phones have one camera on the front and then a triple camera on the back and there's probably not as much in it as you might expect the rog has more natural background blur when you're taking selfies it's just as sharp in 98 of situations extremely good at those difficult dynamic range situations arguably better than the iphone not to mention that it has the power to shoot full 4k slow motion which is far beyond the 1080p that apple can do but with the iphone does pull ahead is intelligent it's the way it identifies and treats faces so that they're the center of attention the way it uses all of its sensors to focus on subjects instantly even for finicky difficult objects that most phones would struggle with plus just generally the video video requires far more advanced processing to be able to pull off well than a simple photo and this is where the years that apple has spent refining really pays off so that brings the score to 4-1 one thing that i think will be a really interesting experiment between these two is wi-fi speeds because on one hand most of what the average user does on their phone is internet related and so you would kind of expect the most popular flagship phone to have that internet aspect completely nailed down but then again this thing is all about shaving off milliseconds of lag when you're playing online competitive games so who actually wins all right let's start with the iphone we'll do google speed test wow okay it's not too shabby considering we're tucked into an attic and just over 40 megabits up same thing for the rog phone and that is an absolutely enormous drop off that's really really slow in comparison but just to see if i could get a result that felt a little bit more reliable i also ran the test 10 more times in a controlled environment but there were actually no consistent friends the rog seems to have higher peak speeds but the iphone seems to have more consistent speeds especially when it comes to upload but there's enough variation that i'd say call this one a draw but what's even more more important than a bit of slightly reduced latency here and there is how good everything actually looks on these screens so they're both huge displays ideology is actually even slightly larger but you probably wouldn't notice without a side by side and they're both better in their own ways so the rog is technically a faster display you know how phones have been dialing up from standard 60 hertz to 90 and to now the 120 hertz displays that we see on pretty much every 2023 flagship well this thing has a 165hz display proportionally that should be nearly as big as the jump between 60 and a 90 hertz display which was huge and yeah if you scroll your home pages and record using a slow-mo camera you will absolutely notice the difference but my eyes are struggling to it feels like one of those 50 more effort for five percent more gain type of situations and to be honest i think at this point what makes more of a difference is the quality of animations which apple really does have nailed down the rog does also have a second display on the back although i would say it's far less useful than the rear displays on most phones that have it it doesn't let you preview the camera or check the content of your notifications it is almost exclusively just for those hey look what my phone can do moments and then for the iphone we have a higher peak brightness 2000 nits versus 1500 which basically covers you for those extra bright outdoor scenes or those extra dark tv shows i'm looking at you game of thrones and ozark it has ltpo tech which is why it can lower its refresh rate all the way down to one hertz when not needed which as you've seen it does help you to save some battery it has a slightly higher resolution and also symmetry i'm fully aware that the reason this rog phone has these top and bottom bezels is that people like something to grip onto when they're gaming not to mention in order to fit these massive speakers in but i am just too much of a sucker for things being aligned and neat so for me iphone takes the best display award but now it's time for the big question performance i don't know about you but i definitely hear a lot about how apple's bionic chips lead the pack how they're two years ahead of the competition in terms of power i mean apples actually reached the point where they started releasing new phones using the previous year's chips which if i've ever seen a sign that a company is comfortable that they're ahead is that but then this thing is geared for performance performance is what these rog phones are all about so let's start with some benchmarks opening with antutu which is a very general test that looks at all aspects of your phone and gives you one number to summarize its performance and for this the rog is coming out over 30 percent higher which is ridiculous that's more than a generational lead bear in mind i have attached the air active cooler onto it which can apparently call it surface by up to 25 degrees celsius and so will naturally improve its performance and yeah that's not completely fair to the iphone because that's not being called by anything but then again the cooler did come in the box so i feel like it would probably be more unfair to not use it so then we've got gfx bench we're just going to focus solely on graphics the entire reason we even need to run multiple benchmarks by the way is that while we all do love the idea of just one number that summarizes all performance actually comparing numbers between android and ios is a bit weird because even the benchmarking apps themselves are two different apps built on two different lines of code that said if we take multiple tests and we see consistent trends that should be enough for us to make a conclusion it's going pretty well so far for the rog with it finishing this test we've almost double the performance what but then with geekbench which focuses on the cpu the iphone is ahead and not really by a small margin so to get to the bottom of it we're just going to run benchmark after benchmark after benchmark until now where i have a result i'm confident in so essentially apple still has the lead when it comes to cpu and no amount of cooling or overclocking on the rog's end can make up for that gap but top level android phones currently have a better gpu for gaming especially helped buy this cooling not to mention faster memory too so anything that looks at overall system performance is going to rank this phone higher which really makes the category a draw overall but it's one thing to have these theoretical numbers what about the games themselves because something i've definitely been told multiple times is how games on iphone are just more optimized on average than games on android and so the numbers don't tell the full story so here's my favorite this is bloons tower defense six and it's going to allow us to basically cover the screen in enemy balloons creating vast amounts of particles on screen as well as damage calculations that need to be made to see which phone starts to lag first okay so let's start by sending 999 medium strength enemies on screen so right now this is performing millions of calculations per second so you can see a little bit of lag just there starting to drop a few frames but it's definitely still playable so let's see what happens if we send in 999 of the strongest enemy yeah okay you can see it start to choke you can only be impressed by how much is actually happening on screen at one time all right time to see what this rog is made of you can instantly tell the saturation of the screen is way higher let's try the media minimums i think it's either about the same or slightly better but yeah you can tell it's not running at its maximum frame rate let's try the big boy i think this is actually slower than the iphone there's more lag here so it could be the iphone's better cpu helping out with all these calculations or potentially just the app being less optimized on android so this is not a bad result by any stretch of the imagination but it is kind of funny in that you've got this whole game of phone where every single decision about it has been designed with games in mind you've got a cooler that's half the size of my face and yet the end result is not dissimilar from a phone that just looks like it's not even trying which is enough for me to say this is a really great phone for someone who's already an android user but just not quite enough to warrant an entire shift in ecosystem but whatever phone you decide to use in the end if you want to make the most of it this is why i strongly recommend surfshark vpn see every single time you connect to the internet your personal information is being shared with not just your network owner but every company whose website you visit and there's a whole load of situations where you don't want that to happen like it's a pretty common thing for criminals to set up free open public wi-fi spots for the sole purpose of collecting people's data with a vpn though your data goes through server before reaching the other parties and the goal of the survey is to basically scramble your details to make you anonymous as to why i recommend surfshark particularly well the app is really robust i've used a lot of shoddy vpn apps this is not one of them we've got a ton of extra privacy features included with it and also it's stupidly cheap which just gives you that peace of mind that you're being looked after using the code boss you end up at less than three dollars a month which because that can cover multiple users per person can end up as literally sense
