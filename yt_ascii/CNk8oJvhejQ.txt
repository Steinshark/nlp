one trick in mike tyson's punch out that remained a mystery for years was a soft luck that sometimes occurred after you beat or lost to super macho man every now and then instead of the game progressing onto the mike tyson fight instead of it showing the game over screen the game would simply show you this in an endless loop [music] for years we knew that this sometimes happened but we never knew what cost it some people never had it happen while others had it happened repeatedly but a few months ago i was able to crack the code and figure out exactly what the cause was it's become common knowledge by now that there are certain people in the crowd behind the fighter that can give cues about when to punch or dodge whether it be the bearded guy who ducks on pisson honda 2 and bald bull 2 or the camera flash on bald bu one these cues are intended to help in observant fighter get further into the game however the least known of all these cues would have to be the sunclass guy on super macho man throughout the entire game he doesn't move at all till right before super monro man is about to do a single spin punch pay attention to what he does [music] here did you catch it right as macho did his spin punch the guy dropped his glasses like this normally this would be nothing more than a simple little easter egg unknown to the programmers at the time though this little easter egg actually had a gamebreaking flaw pay attention to the crowd in the background here if little mac punches right when machu man is starting his spin punch right when the sunglasses dro down then the sunglasses dude freezes freezing the whole crowd with them once you either beat or lose the macho man the way the game checks to see if you can move on to the next fighter is whether or not the crowd is flashed like this and since the is frozen they never flash so the game never receives the message to move on and mao just sits there doing his thing forever although this trick was hardly known by the general public in the 8s nintendo actually did find out about it at some point probably in ' 88 or ' 89 nintendo switched for making cartridges that had this soft lock to ones that had a simple fix no matter what as soon as mario walked onto the screen for anything the crowd will continue moving to tell if it's possible to do the soft lock on your version of the game check out the link to the version guide that i made in the description of this video it documents the six versions of this game that i currently aware of and if the soft lock is possible on each version or not another easy way to check is to open up the game and check the circuit board if it is labeled p eo rom then the soft lock is possible if it's labeled pn rom then it's a fixed version where it is not possible it's also worth noting that the trick was fixed for the mr dream version of the game as well that's all i've got for you guys today if you like watching mike tyson's punch out please check out my twitch channel at twitch tv/ summoning salt and thanks for watching
