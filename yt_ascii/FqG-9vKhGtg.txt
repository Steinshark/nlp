your opinion about cp and.net is outdated so let me tell you my opinion about csharp and.net when i was in college university as some of you europeans call it we just call it college around here went to a state university nothing impressive montana state university by the way bobcats meow what we had to work on was a compiler's course and i wrote a compiler in c for something called pascal you may have heard of it it was called micro pascal it had less options and we wrote it to translate into iel iel was the intermediate language representation of all of the netes into how they compile it okay so yes i worked on windows yes i did all these things that's what i did okay with my life okay i did that and it was fantastic it was a lot of fun and one of the big challenges was that it didn't have closures at the time iil had no closures and so we had to make up closures programmatically if you've ever used groovy groovy 2.3.6 actually did the exact same thing groovy would compile your groovy code into java by creating these these like little virtual functions inside or these real functions but that you don't see them where just takes all the arguments that is the closure is all the arguments super fun it was a super fun project and it helped me understand groovy really well when i went to netflix and had the right groovy when i went to netflix and rogue groovy people were like how did you write all this code how were you able to do this and i'm like yo dog it's just a little bit of rx and a closure and they're like i don't understand how it works i'm like well just a what i was like the best groovy developer for a while it was absurd hello everybody nck in this video i want to talk about cop and.net and how your opinion about by the way is c dead is c dead is c++ dead let's go is c dead is c dead is c++ dead is cp dead whole c family were accident from the tree okay the whole c the whole c family starting at the rote c the whole branch is going okay the language and the framework might be outdated especially if you haven't really looked at it in the past four to 5 years i not looked i was browsing youtube and i saw one of those videos that sounded like should you learn cop in 2021 and while i was watching that it was very clear to me that this person didn't know what they were talking about they were giving like all outdated information about the language you're welcome for the discord notification by the way let me just mute that really quickly you're welcome you're welcome but this is a real problem by the way on youtube this is a real problem is that people like it's very one of the easiest ways to get views is to make a video about something dumping on it it just really is i why i don't know you guys are sick okay you guys want to see other people in pain you guys just want to see somebody hurting and crying and so people can make these c dead videos and give like 5-year-old advice and that pretty much matches everybody's expectation and then it just works out you know it's like an expectation fulfilling prophecy problem okay we're not going to do that we're going to let this guy give us the he's is's going to give us the deeds give us the deeds framework comparing it to java and how java is significantly better and faster and whatnot and that you should learn that over c so i dived into quora and i sear a little bit and i can i pause this for a second i actually do agree with it every place that uses c is like government related i swear it's like government or healthcare related and so at least with java you could work at like netflix or or other cool companies or you're working for like a government medical job finance like i i i don't want to banks oh that's a w oh that's cool i'm just throwing it out there okay unity unity would be fun okay at least unity would be fun okay i get it i get it unity is fun a few interesting answers on similar questions that are so outdated that i want to use this platform to address those this is not a comparison between cop and java or any other language other languages can do whatever they want i only want to address cop itself and.net and yes some facts i have work let's see facts except i work c and i don't work for the government or bank or healthcare but i used to yeah i know i know i know i i understand c's not using those departments but it's primary landing if you were to have all the jobs in the universe that involve c and you put them all into one big circle and then i close my eyes and i could just shoot an arrow somewhere and it would land somewhere in the middle of all this i would land into government healthcare or finance okay some of the answers just against java because of how similar in principle the languages are and let's be honest c was made by microsoft to be their own java y and maybe give you my take on how things are nowadays if you like of content and you want to see more make sure you subscribe h the notification bell geted when i upload a new video so let's go the first one here and this one is why is c so much better than java yet not as popular now is this statement true i don't know and also i don't care what i do care is about by the way sign of a true chad is this statement true i don't know and i don't care the first upvoted answer which is from 2017 by the way by the way and one of the things is cop costs money and you're tied into windows that's 2017 no you are no tiing the windows net and cop are crossplatform they have been since april of 2016 clearly this person and you can see it from what this how good was their crossplatform in 2016 like i know people say this how good has the cross like is the cross i know it was really bad at one point it was awful how about now is it good now is it good enough now it's top tier now it's top tier good the tooling is bad linux could run games since 19 1999 it's pretty good okay so yeah fair fair i like that it's really good okay good enough for me okay yeah i c is a fine language it's just people always ask why don't i do c and i jokingly say that i hate microsoft well actually i don't jokingly say i don't like microsoft but something to really think about is that i already know a c-based language right i don't i don't need like if i already know go do i really want to go and learn c no like i'd rather you learn a language that's going to change my perspective i'd rather learn rust maybe learn a little bit of o camel right i just like do i need another javal like language right i i i tear things up as as like c rust super rust c++ zig super fast i really do want to learn more zig then b languages are like go java c they're they're still pretty dang fast but at the end of the day they still all have garbage collectors like you can only be so fast when you have a garbage collector o camels also in this category as well right and then you have your like c tier languages which is which is going to be pretty much it i mean it should be java py or javascript python ruby any of these but javascript has had so many people focused on it that it's become so much faster than all other interpreted languages that it's like your c tier is just javascript it's just like how' this happen i'm not sure i think i've said the word java instead of javascript like three times now and then your d tier would be like these other ones right as far as speed goes now that's i don't know if that's a fair take but in my head it's a fair take javascript is full on d tier that's just all there is assembly would be s tier right because you can actually just make it as fast as possible python is slower than js dude do a just do a loop in python okay python a language known for not being good at for loops what do you what do you want me to say about that python is one of the greatest languages though python should always be in your tuck on how to get chad gpt to write you python like that's how that's i for me python is a chat jity language it's great thank here experience in c c++ java and go they have no idea what they're talking about and this is the most upvoted answer with 6 5,000 views this is ridiculous cop is crossplatform it is free you don't have to pay anyone it runs anywhere from your raspberry pi's to a windows server if you want to all linux or mac and many people that i know develop on linux and mac and they have a lot of free open source frameworks as well okay you can do anything you want now some of the best ones are made by microsoft but those are still free let's go to the next one and this one is a blog saying java vs python vs.net which one is the best let's go to the pros and cons for net and the prons are it supports great third party languages yes stable code yes great community of experts indeed the platform is highly productive true you can do tons of things we like from games to applications to windows apps to like anything you can do with net okay the cons it often faces some issues related to stability for new releases it does not it just does it just does not does anyone know what this issue is referring to i've never really heard about that and by the way quora is terrible i've ne like one thing i've never heard in my lifetime is that new releases are not stable i've heard about dll hell he is very offended and limited object relational support interesting isn't it's being scrutinized before released to a ridiculous degree and then limited object relational support i'm assuming they're talking about ors like entity framework is just so good so i really don't understand this con and i'm not really going to dive into the other ones because again i'm not comparing here so the next one is interesting it says is java in the jvm i think one thing we should all be taking away here is that quora is a horrible platform if you're going to quora to find answers to things you've already messed up okay that's that's right now this is what i'm taking away heavily from this video is maybe i don't know csharp fair i already knew that was happening but two you you you dumb messed up blocky when when when you're going to quarry when you're going to quora behind also i always think about internet comment etiquette do you know coneticut if you know that youtube channel it's so good it's so good and he always goes to quora with querious betsy to ask the dumbest dude just so good tshop fop and net with the release of net 5 and that was a year ago at this point and the answer from the first question is yes it was already far behind and don't pushed it even further okay let's not really address that someone is defending java and it's way ahead but what i want to talk about is the sentiment behind this comment the fact that java was already behind let's see what java is adding from java 8 to java 17 so if we go to the features yeah and we go to like pattern matching for switch this is a lift and shift one for one actually it's a bit clanker because it has a case here cop doesn't have it but it's very much exactly how you do pattern matching for s in cop do like that lift and shift also this is a great feature i'm very happy about this i'm happy that java is making good you know inroads to more convenient i i think pattern matching is probably the most powerful and the greatest programming language feature ever and i am not good at it but every time i see someone solve a problem with good pattern matching i realized just like how stupid i am and how amazing it is hard agree yeah there literally is no greater i i am i completely convinced of it at this point that there is pretty much not a greater programming problem solving than pattern matching the the fact that this guy reads core approves your opinion about c not is not outdated shut up tj i already saw that did a few versions too and this is still in preview in java or you have the sealed classes which you don't allow anyone to inherit from that class cop had it since forever it's been yeah also also just first off the i i'm very confused at abstract sealed class how do you have an abstract class that no one can inherit from isn't that like fundamentally just broken i thought you couldn't instantiate an abstract class oh it permits oh it permits circle rectangle and square oh okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we already read about this i knew about that also i hate i hate this i just want everybody to know that i hate this the reason why i hate this is that saying who can use you at the point of declaration just seems like such a weird inverted way to program like you have to know everything you have to know everything about you like this just seems like make this an interface it feels so backwards this is asp pennies straight up ass pennies been in preview for two versions and ga now record type we added that a version ago likeing for instance off to say if is instance off string cop says x is string all these features that effectively yeah switch expressions same thing cop had it for a while and actually implementation go back a little bit i actually first off i know this is supposed to be about c but i'm happy that java has this this is great a little pattern matching with instance of that's cool that's that's super cool let's go like that's good i like what i'm seeing that effectively yeah switch expressions same thing c had it for a while and actually implementations look one for one so at this point making arguments about language design doesn't make sense and then you know the other one is c better than java in 2019 and the first 1 3.7 th000 views and the commenter says java is both language and runtime and environment is better no i've actually never heard anyone say that people that i respect a lot in the world of programming have all said that java has a horrible environment that yes it is more used in kind of like cooler companies but man to get started in java is like a nightmare versus c aware maven i it's just you don't like maven no i don't i don't like maven maven and gradle you can gradle these nuts okay facts of life in a run time the jvm is the runtime java is the language and many things can compile to bite code which is what the jvm will run similar to groovy or cotlin or whatever anyway groovy mentioned let's go and there is no second class ci and version of java on different platforms as it happens in net i'm assuming they're referring to mono this is 2019 by that time we had net 3.1 i think and that was like fully crossplatform you can run it anywhere and in fact it might even perform faster in linux so i don't know what they're r about and then java's compilation and optimization happened you heard it here first folks c windows language runs faster on linux for years now years absolute years this is great at run time not before as with net and cop no java similar to net will compile to bite code or intermediate language code for net and that will be the first stage of compilation and then there's a jit compiler that happens in runtime for both the jvm and the clr our own version of the vm which will also optimize that even further so the the argument programmer for 40 years isn't really strong please don't leave comments like this if you are not proficient in both languages and there's other comments as well saying that net is not crossplatform or cop is not crossplatform that's not true the aspet core framework as you can see fully crossplatform here anything you want can be found here same with the runtime you can found it here it's fully crossplatform and i think there's i mean i know i on c a lot i think c is is a pretty wonderful language there fine i'll say it i'm saying it i'm going to say it i understand that c wasn't truly cross- platformed back in the day it was a really it was a it was a piece of  for a long time i i i knew a lot of people that tried to make it work it's just not great c has a lot of great language features for being i'm just going to be real for being a java clone c did it better okay somebody tell me i'm wrong if you had to work in either c or java i would pretty much choose c if i could fully be on linux people going to hate that tweet let's do it let's absolutely do it people are going to hate this tweet people going to hate this tweet but we're doing it we're doing it we're doing it c sharp is greater than java post it shambles tears tears of rage cannot wait for i cannot wait for the fallout of this tweet i actually cannot wait what am i losing a thousand followers on this one it's going to be so dang good we're very very excited about this i'm very very excited is that even a hot take people get people get flustered okay people get genuinely chapped when these kind of things happen bait thrown oh yeah oh yeah all right let's keep on going and in fact if you want to very easily and quickly search for some source code you just go at source do dot.net that's a stupid name anyway and you can search like source dot dot.net oh that was so good oh that was so good that was just so good i loved it i love that password hasher to see how net is doing password hashing by default and you can see all the code here it's all open so file as well if you just click on that it takes you to like is this kind like chromium now for those of you who don't know in stock overflows 2021 survey as net core came second as the most loved framework a little bit under spelt and spelt had only 1,000 responders so really it was very high higher than react higher than express higher than spring so clearly people like what rigged election stopped account react 69% easy yep jquery okay so here's one problem i have can we all just take a step back for a second spelt a rendering view library asp core and asp.net core i'm not sure if that's a rendering view library for the web api fast api i don't believe this has anything to do with the web it has to do with servers reactjs okay this is okay okay we got this spring okay this is like spring and react being in the same category bothers me can can we all agree that spring and react in the same category is is is bothersome min minimum minimum ruby on rails what laurel what por maria like none of this makes any sense then all the way down here jay query the fact that jquery lel spring react and asp.net core are on the same graph means this survey makes no sense okay this is a rigged election commies are taking over and what i want to is i want to go to the tech empowered benchmarks which are public benchmarks third party it's not by microsoft they benchmark a bunch of different tech from rust to c++ to java to cop to everything and we can see the plain text web server responses and how many requests per second this thing can do and as you can see we have 7 million here it's the by the way i hate this this has been so known to be gamed this is this website is by far one of the most misleading websites of all time like you go and you go into some of these sources people have it like pre-programmed into it to be to to be exactly what they want like there's like a series of things you have to do it is it is this is one of the just the worst possibilities it really it truly is because what you do is you optimize your framework for this one stupid better performance test and then when you actually write an application it's dog water like that's the problem that's like the truest problem is that real code does not behave the same as these toys ex examples it's super misleading second most performing under pv i don't know anyone using pco or the v language and by the way how do you how do i know cuz just js is 99.6% okay p and maria right that's a micro framework ignore it as you can see it performs faster than anything else faster than java c++ rust anything of course this is just plain tech so it's just effectively testing the web server but if you go to other examples like let's say json sterilization and you search for asp core it's still pretty high because if you search for something like nodejs that's 45,000 request this is interesting because i'm pretty sure nodejs actually parses jonon the fastest what this is what this really points to is likely garbage collection or some other thing going on here i'm more curious about what's happening here cuz i mean it's impressive that asp has beaten it but still at the end of the day at the end of the day i' would also like to you know i'd be very curious if the code actually is doing what it's supposed to do just per second while as core strong cop if we go all the way up it's 160 almost and then if you go to the single query test as well you can see that asp core is still very very high and if we go to compare that with something like spring with web fla that's',000 requests per second and if we go with rw spring that's 14 it's very performant very efficient very fast this isn't to say that you should use cop and net this is to say that's how things are in 2021 also i just think that it's it's all just by the way if you are basing how fast things are going to run based off of these really tiny teeny tiny little little little items it's not that great okay because your server doesn't do this your server isn't just simply a same text hello world responder okay your server does things it looks up stuff it has many requests performing it does authentication it does a bunch of stuff and so for anybody to think that these two are the same or that this actually has any indication into anything about how fast it is it's just copium it's just pure copium stop looking at these kind of tests they they mean nothing they literally mean nothing please update your opinion about the language you don't have to use it but at least when it comes time to talk about it understand what the state of the language and the frameworks are well that's all i have for you for this video thank you very much for watching special thanks to my patreons for making this videos possible if you want to support me as well you're going to find a link in the description down below leave a like if you like this video subscribe for more content like this turning the bell as well and i'll see you in the next video keep coding actually there's a lot of things i really liked about this video i think something i really liked about this video is that really what it goes to show is two two very important things one when you have a perception of something when you read something that's incorrect about it but it fulfills your perception you will assume it's correct and number two quora is the worst place ever to go for answers ever like just don't go to quora why are you going to quora stop going to quora people okay it's terri stop it stop it why what por maria okay third can you believe that qu ceo is on open ai's board and after the overthrowing of sam alman he remains on the board okay i don't trust any of it okay i don't trust quora i don't trust open ai and i don't trust the answers on quora okay everything seems dangerous here and i don't like i don't like it one bit i don't like it at all which also makes me think maybe we should get a a whole army of people putting bad information into quora wait that already happened happens dear god is our ai trained on quora data oh the the future is doomed i'm a doomer i'm a doomer as of officially i'm a doomer i am a doomer now oh no oh no a jam
