calculators computers and teachers throughout your 
life have told you that you can't divide by zero but i'm here to tell you that you can it's true in the real numbers 
division by zero isn't defined but neither is taking square root of -1 and yet mathematicians found a way to do it checking all the details might be a bit complex but ultimately the idea is just "throw in a number whose square is 
-1 then follow the normal rules of   algebra to figure out what this 
new number system looks like" if you do this with the square root of -1 
you end up with the familiar complex numbers they might have some weird properties compared to   the reals but they're a perfectly 
good system of numbers to work with can't we just do the same thing 
with division by zero? can't we   just throw in an inverse of 
zero and see what happens? given that you've been told your whole 
life that you can't divide by zero you might expect that for reasons 
you don't fully understand you can't just throw in an inverse of a number the 
same way you can throw in a solution to x^2 = -1 nope that's not the problem the process of throwing in 
the inverse of a number or   set of numbers and seeing what 
happens is called localization and it's no more difficult to do 
than throwing in square root of -1 suppose you started with the integers there's no 1/2 in the 
integers so let's throw it in in order to be able to multiply numbers 
as usual we would also need to throw in   all the multiples of 1/2 including negative ones and multiplying 1/2 with itself means we also 
need 1/4 and all the multiples of a fourth and so on and so forth we need to add in anything that's 
an integer divided by a power of two but then we're good to go we end up with what are called 
the dyadic or binary rationals which is another weird but 
perfectly valid number system if we also threw in 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 
inverses of every positive whole number then we end up with all the 
rational numbers--ratios of   integers where the denominator is not zero this is a pretty standard way 
to construct the rationals so what about zero inverse? well let's do it let's start with the real numbers 
throw in an inverse of zero and   just see what kind of number system pops out just like 1/2 is the unique 
number such that 2 * 1/2 is 1 our inverse of zero is going to be the unique 
number such that 0 * the inverse of 0 is 1 so let's assume that's true then what? pretty quickly we see this implies that 
1 equals 0 because anything * 0 is 0 but wait--this is not a contradiction of course in the real 
numbers 0 is different than 1 but in the real numbers x^2 
can never be negative either and yet we're perfectly okay in the 
complex numbers saying that i^2 is -1 just because we've discovered an unintuitive 
property of this new number system that doesn't make it wrong let's just continue and see where it takes us take any number "x" in this system and note that 
x is 1 * x because 1 * anything is that thing but because 1 = 0 this is also 0 * x which 
of course is 0 because 0 * anything is 0 thus we've shown in our new number 
system that every number equals 0 there's still no contradiction, no error in logic we've just invented what's called the zero ring where 0 is the only number 0 + 0 = 0, 0 - 0 = 0, 0 * 0 = 0, 0 / 0 = 0 and 1 is just another label for 0 feel free to check that this 
number system satisfies all   the normal rules of algebra it really does so it's not that you can't divide by zero it's just that if you allow it then all 
numbers are zero and you get what you deserve
