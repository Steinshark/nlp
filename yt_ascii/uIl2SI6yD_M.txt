wanted to relive one of the great episodes of shark tank where the guy is pitching something that supposedly is going to get rid of bad habits by tasing you basically so i bought his product every time i fake laugh i'm going to give myself a little zap guys today we're watching one of the all-time great episodes of shark tank and if you haven't watched this yet we're gonna relive it together with a twist listen i'm now a daily uploader which i have no respect for no respect for daily uploaders but now that i am one myself one bad habit i want to get rid of is fake laughing fake laughing is it see i just did it i just you hear that little chuckle no no no no no no no no no last time every other youtuber does that i'm like come on dude and then i catch myself listen it's in the dna of daily uploaders you're just like in there and you're like gotta get a piece of content out get that fake laugh going baby anyway so i'm trying to break myself up that habit just so happens i also wanted to relive one of the great episodes of shark tank where the guy is pitching something that supposedly is gonna get rid of bad habits so i bought his product and we're gonna be reacting to his video where he goes down in shark tank fail history you're in get them out of here while also getting my rid of my bad ab ah i did it again see now i'm gonna show you how this works every time i fake laugh i'm gonna give myself a little zap let's see how the first one feels i hate doing this this is really hard to do like shock yourself this is number one problem with the product you have to get rid of your bad habit you shock yourself every time you do the bad activity so let's do it okay problem one with the product half the time the shocks don't go through maybe that's part of the product just like adds the edge if you don't know so it'll you'll see the well if it lights up oh there it goes it lights up no no zap other times it feels like a scorpion just stung me in the arm so i'll try to be honest with when i get shocked when i don't get shocked but that's how this game is played let's get started from the beginning by the way just gotta be honest with you adrenaline runs through you every time you press this thing because you're like am i going to get tased with the force of a military great taser or am i going to feel nothing it's a scary thing honestly deadly i'd rather just shock me because i just track what you do but actually changes what you do padlock helps you become aware by alerting you when you do behaviors you'd like to reduce then simply press the button and pavlock releases a mild electric nothing my old maybe it's because i have 2.0 there's nothing wrong about it sensation that helps you reduce cravings you can laugh but it's actually something very serious i am laughing it releases a mild electric sensation that helps you reduce cravings and actually breaks bad habits in the brain how did you come up with this idea i've always had severe add i could never get myself to actually get stuff done i couldn't get myself to commit to anything so i did what any normal person would do i hired someone to sit down next to me and slap me in the face what every time i went on facebook and i wrote a blog no barbara not nice creepy weird oh no and there goes problem number one let's go let's try it out okay hey listen it's not my fault if it doesn't work it's not my fault if it doesn't zap me okay his fault for shipping a bad product see that's something they don't know in this shark tank episode is like the product half works do they actually slap this video from me getting slapped did you get the work done i did yeah it was really cool yeah what made you come up with this idea yeah i was visiting a friend i'm like dude why are we why am i paying i could just make a make a zapper that zaps every time i go on facebook [music] after one moment i just want to explain kind of the science behind it and then i'll bring it out for you now you're already noticing that he kind of is a little aggressive with like i'll run this presentation thank you very much that's going to continue and these facial expressions will continue to get worse it's a slight electric stimulus that's done while doing a undesired bad habit i bite my nails i'm trying to not bite my nose all the time where it falls down for me is if i have the discipline to buzz myself do i not have the discipline to stop people okay people anytime you hear the stuttering like okay well you need to relax if you're up on that shark tank stage otherwise it's like smelling blood i mean they start small blood in the water it's honestly what it is cool you have the discipline to stop well i don't do you wish you could stop i do so can i so here's your premises nonsense robert it's all nice across the board just i'm i can't get around that like i'm just i want to bite my nails and for me to stop i have to hit this thing correct and you don't want to hit it trust me i honestly full disclosure i've had this thing for like a week and a half and i didn't want to use it because i was like dude this thing it's like a jack-in-the-box where you like crank it like you don't know when it's gonna shock you when it's not isn't this just like a rubber band on your wrist that you snap but just a hundred and fifty dollars sure why can't laurie buzz it for me she can i'm she absolutely can there's a remote control there's a there's a remote control app there's automation that sounds correct percentage of time does it not work it doesn't work if you don't want it to work no actually it doesn't work a lot of the time so you watch didn't feel it again dude i've done it like four times already it hasn't worked a single time i'm honestly disappointed so it does oh wow yeah of course so if you use it on sugar after about three or four days on like a cookie or tortilla chips you'll start to notice the flavor changes now what's interesting oh no no no no the flavor changes yeah you're such a con artist con artist he just comes out and says it and i'll give myself a zap for that one because there's a little bit of it i can't tell honestly i'm so deep in the daily grind i don't even know what my real life is like anymore i'm just like see guys this is why i need this and by the way it didn't shock me again dude this is a piece of junk i thought this was going to be a great challenge it's ow okay okay a little bit of a delayed one on that one dude that actually legit hurts oh dude it just okay take a break that doesn't count this thing just started like uncontrollably zapping me sorry i had to take it off i gotta like reset the the programming of this thing for a second what the heck this thing is the worst design product of all time i pressed it like four times it didn't work and then all of a sudden it's not supposed to be working and i'm like getting shocks through my arm this thing sucks that's what i get for making fun of this guy he's probably like somehow getting in here he may be listening to me it's probably how these things make money probably listens to him and he's like oh yeah you want to talk text me give you a little zap ow all right let's try again results mark more than fifty percent of our users break their habit and five days in seven days or less first point okay let me just leave this step one minute what you're going oh i love skepticism because that guy's an idiot he doesn't even know what he's talking about you want to get a deal explain to me why you're worth 14 million dollars that's right 50. what is it how much he's like not 14 15 million because you can't do math you idiot look if the product worked if the product didn't randomly shock you it like didn't not shock you when it was supposed to shock you you might actually have a real product here the problem is his arrogance combined with that number one number one our sales are great what are your sales and we actually just began shipping this week we've sold eight hundred thousand dollars of revenue wait wait pre-orders three-fourths of the users were pre-orders and one-fourth of the users were prototypes what did each of those people pay for one device too much 200 how much too much 200 but i paid for this who buys these so our biggest users are youtubers let's try again let's roll the dice okay it didn't work it didn't even turn on that time i'm so pissed this is 200 do you guys hear me 200 for all it does it's just like a big battery it's just supposed to shock you in an app and it doesn't work this is such trash dude this thing doesn't work sorry sitting too long waking up on time nail biting and eating so we've started to build out multiple really cool integrations for them oh yeah everything is the alarm clock what the heck that works it's a delay it's a time it's a ticking time bomb this thing ah i hate this i hate this is a dumb idea because i thought you had a real product okay i thought you had a real product what you have is a torture device you have a stanley milgram experiment on your wrist we're gonna try this one more time okay bud four sharks are out but kevin seems interested in manisha's habit-breaking watch pavlok i believe this technology works because i've seen it work your valuation bro that face unbelievable it's the way he's making these expressions is unbelievable he's just like instead of having a face that says i'm here you know i respectfully he's like so condescending is crazy okay i'm sorry it's not worth 15.9 million now i'm gonna solve the problem in deal structure i'm very creative i'll give you the 500 000 as debt on the company okay you're going to give me the 3.14 percent as equity today and you're going to walk out of here with a shark tank deal i'm going to put it on for 24 months at seven and a half percent and balloon payment be back in two years kevin o'leary loves these like these terrible deals if one third of projections are right you can easily do that it's an offer it's an offer this is the problem damn there's something there's no problem so the problem is that we're not focused on the money we're focused more on the focus on the money why did you come to shark tank if you're not focused on the money you've come to the wrong place my friend i'm here to make money let it finish our big okay that's a real laugh dude mark human cracks me up he's like you can see it in his face he's so excited to just see this guy implode look at those eyes i honestly thought manish had the best eyebrows in the game no mark cuban dude got some brows this thing our biggest goal is to break bad habits around the world and mr wonderful like i just i can't work with you why not i'm just worried that if you work together i like him i do like him as a person but i feel like as an investor in the company would be really bad you didn't want an offer here today you really want an offer right i'll say you got one and why don't you want the structure of that offer the structure's actually quite good what's the person it's the person i feel like you just said you like mr wonderful but now you're gonna say you don't i would take an offer from anybody besides mr wonderful [applause] manish you already yes okay well give this man what he deserves for torturing me all episode and yes i'll give myself a final shock for it okay and then i'm immediately taking it off if it doesn't work because this thing is a death trap okay it didn't work i'm taking this piece of crap off and never dude you're a you're a piece of work bud look at that you don't even have a good product it's not even that people don't like you which they didn't in shark tank okay because you were rude and condescending it's also that your product just doesn't work sorry if you are you all out yeah we're all out yes ah i just feel so good i have a tinge of regret for rejecting the deal with mr wonderful but the truth is our company is building something much bigger than no you're not you're building it for idiots like me who want content you're not building it for like real people wanting to break their habits because no one wants to deal with that little trap we're trying to change human behavior and kevin wouldn't be the right partner for us to work with i'm telling you whether it was you or me or robert or one of us he was going to do that to somebody it just happened to be you were the last guy i realized he's a gold digger he's an idiot he's a con artist this technology he thinks he's sincere technology kevin don't feel bad i don't feel bad don't feel bad dude did you hear that he goes don't feel bad kevin i don't feel bad and then he's like sad kevin look at this it's so sad play the music music don't feel bad don't feel bad [music] oh it's okay kevin it's okay you're patting on that for kevin okay okay that's me sincerely laughing this is a good this is good see i in some ways maybe this helped me i don't know you'll let me know in the future videos do you think it's helped me get rid of my addiction to fake laughing as a daily uploader let me know if not whatever i'm never putting that stupid padlock on again i had other content ideas with it but i'm not sure that i'm willing to risk the the random shocks i mean i feel like if you deserve the shock that's fine i get it i signed up for that the random shocks is it's uncomfortable it really is so let me know what you think of the comments below don't go harass anybody listen to the guy it's just funny we all react and if anything i'm the one who took the l on this one all right well that's it thanks for watching see you next wake up and time the coffee
