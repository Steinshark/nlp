wow i did that that was me that is going to be you 
whoever is watching this i'll tell you something   i've never told anyone before never on the 
internet before that's for sure i can't believe   i'm saying this i've never told anyone this i 
don't even think my fiance paul knows this and   being like wow tiff this is not a good sign your 
future is not looking bright i felt so such like   a fish out of water i think i spent equally as 
much time in the classroom as i did crying in the   bathroom because i just hello world i felt think 
that was fitting considering we're talking about   coding and my coding journey and today that's 
exactly what we're doing we're going to have a   very candid conversation very real authentic 
i'm just going to spill all the beans for you   about my journey how i learned to code to really 
transitioning from fashion and modeling into a   software developer role doing that for many years 
still doing it today to moving into developer   relations to founding my own tech company which 
is kind of funny because as i'm speaking speaking   about that last part the tech company it hasn't 
launched yet but i believe by the time this airs   it will have just launched which i'm so excited 
about but that's not why we're here today we'll   get we touch on a little bit anyways i want to 
share with you my really honest journey with   coding because a lot of times it can feel really 
overwhelming when you are going through learning   something like coding which to many of us feels 
very strange or different from anything else we've   learned before and honestly a lot of the time 
when i was learning to code i felt very alone   and very very i questioned it a lot as if it was 
for me am i smart enough i had a lot of impostor   syndrome in self-doubt we going to cover all that 
today all right i need a sip of my water let's get   into it all right let's just jump into [music] it 
i'm going to give you a bit of a backstory and i   know some of you might have heard this before but 
i hope if you are someone who's been following   me for many years or recently started following 
me that you'll find value in this regardless of   where you're at in your coding journey or learning 
something new journey because it's always nice to   hear others others perspectives and journeys and i 
don't think i've ever felt as comfortable sharing   my full story as i do now so let's just get into 
the meat i remember when i first heard about   coding it was not until i was in university i 
think i heard about it in the sense of movies and   different things like that but i was late to the 
game when it came to coding i didn't go to a high   school where there was computer classes required 
or i got to build anything even on a computer i   grew up in a very small town and that wasn't an 
option so naturally what i focused on was i loved   building different things loved working with 
people so i gravitated towards fashion because   that to me was what that equated to and from 
going into fashion i i had the opportunity to   go model overseas in hong kong and throughout 
china so i thought this is great this is an   amazing experience to go meet other people travel 
and you know get paid to do so doing modeling   and that was a whole an incredible experience i 
met so many amazing people but even i hear this so   often from others as well even if that's not your 
journey that's a very specific journey but i hear   about you know you're taking one path but there's 
something missing i felt very lost at times still   or confused as where is my future going what am i 
really doing from there i thought okay i need to   take a step back and move back to canada where 
i live now and or where i'm from and live now   and just pick the biggest city on the map because 
at the time i didn't want to go back to my small   town that i grew up in and so i said let's go to 
toronto check out toronto don't know anyone there   never have been there but we're going to move 
there moved to toronto and at that point when i   moved to toronto i was really craving more formal 
education i wanted to go back to school to get a   university okay we keep on getting cut off but 
that is okay we are back now i have my phone   on silent how rude of me no so where was i at i 
was at coming back to toronto starting university   and so for me coming from a fashion background 
i thought okay naturally makes sense let's go   to university for something fashion related and i 
remember i'll tell you something i've never told   anyone before never on the internet before that's 
for sure i applied when i applied to university i   applied to two programs i applied to business like 
a business major and i also applied for a graphic   communications major and i can't believe i'm 
saying this i've never told anyone this i don't   even think my fiance paul knows this which is 
funny anyways because why are we so embarrassed   about things like this but i applied to those 
two programs i got rejected from the business   program they said nope you're not good enough 
i think it was my math grades from high school   that weren't good enough which is so funny looking 
back on it was like such a blessing i didn't get   accepted into that program because the rest just 
completely went in the right direction but it's   one of those moments where i remember receiving 
that rejection letter for business like i feel   like everyone gets into business and being like 
wow tiff this is not a good sign your future is   not looking bright and then i got the the letter 
in the mail from the graphic design program it was   graphic communications management and i said 
okay they accepted me let's go see what this   is about i think it was a smaller program at the 
time and that's why if i'm being totally honest   i don't really know at the time what i thought i 
was signing up for i think i just thought going   back to school and we'll figure it out and i 
was really excited to do to do just that but   i remember feeling so nervous and i i don't even 
know how i had the courage to go on the first day   like i thought i felt so such like a fish out of 
water fast forward to 4 years because in canada   here university programs are all four years 
and well typically not always and i i remember   my fourth year it was required to take a very 
basic coding course and i wouldn't have taken   it otherwise it was so basic it's i mean it was 
literally just markup it was html css building   i forget what we were building with at the time i 
don't know it was an editor though but i remember   feeling those feelings of wow seeing things come 
up on screen building things that i had in my   head and now they're on the screen like that is so 
cool and i still get so excited about that today   and that is really when it all happened for me 
when i realized that i want to become a software   developer the next challenge i faced was i don't 
want to go back to school for another four years   and get a computer science degree i don't have 
the money to do that i don't have the time to   do that so from there i went to a postgrad school 
where it was focused on coding it was 3 months in   length and it was one of those intensive programs 
and that i think i spent equally as much time in   the classroom as i did crying in the bathroom 
because i just once again felt so out of my   comfort zone out of my element and it was during 
that time though where i started realizing if i   wanted to succeed in this i needed to do so on my 
own time as well i couldn't rely on solely others   so i started taking classes i remember one of 
my favorite which it still is today resources   that i really leaned on was code academy they 
had so many different courses to take actually   on that note one of my first courses that i took 
on code academy was their full stack engineering   course and i remember when i took it i had mostly 
front-end experience but i really wanted to gain a   better understanding for the backend i felt with 
their lessons they were super easy to understand   i wasn't someone who was coming from a technical 
background so i needed a place where i could go   and have these technical concepts explained in 
a way where i was like yes i get it now and that   really goes into you don't need prior experience 
to go sign up on code cademy and start building so   you can see on screen here this is a bit of their 
syllabus from overview of web development and   then starting with the fundamentals and i think 
that is so key starting with the fundamentals i   think to in today's world or whatever you 
want to call it can feel like oh is this   really needed i want to get ahead i want to get 
so done this so fast but the fundamentals are   what will really separate you from everyone else 
so it's super key also too when you're starting   out you don't necessarily want to start with 
this you know in crazy setup from downloading   different virtual environments or idees and 
one thing about code academy is they have an   interactive coding environment so you don't have 
to download anything you can just learn by doing   which is key because yes having a proper setup 
when you are a developer is important but when   you are learning you want to be able to put your 
time and energy into actually learning versus the   set up portion of it and last thing i'll say is 
it is free to start on code academy it literally   if you do the math cost less than $1 a day which 
gives you access to all programming languages and   courses and also too don't worry i got you covered 
you can use my code here tiff in tech which will   give you one month free to code academy pro for 
the first people who sign up so use the link i   linked it down below after i graduated from that 
program i my first job was not a developer it was   in qa quality assurance because i couldn't land a 
job as a developer right away and that's because   my portfolio was probably not where it should 
have been or maybe i just gave up too quickly   on looking i don't know but i just felt like this 
is a great window a great opportunity to get into   a tech company working at a startup and then i'll 
i'll tell them in a few months that i need to be   a developer that's what i did i started really 
getting in their code base and getting familiar   with bugs picking them up on my own time this 
was at a very small company a bigger company i   probably wouldn't have been able to or allowed to 
do that so it worked out really good it's another   a little tip startups are very key when you are 
starting out fast forward i worked for a year   two years there as developer moved to ibm where 
i worked on the de as a software developer   grew quickly into a senior software developer 
was working on leading a team of developers and   it was such an incredible experience building 
things working together i don't know i i really   even to this day i still love coding and i love 
the developer experience i think something that   a lot of people forget is they think oh it's 
very isolating or you're very alone throughout   it all for me i think if you are interested in 
that community and seeking it out there's so   many people who will connect with you and i just 
remember feeling this community was so supportive   i had a tutor i would meet with once a week this 
is before ibm and i just look back and the amount   of people that supported me along this journey 
is probably another big piece of advice that i   would really recommend with you is lean on these 
communities whether it be online in person but   just find seek out for that support and you will 
find it then from there tr fast forward a little   bit even more i moved to i wanted to get into 
deval and the reason for that was because i loved   the coding building technical side of things but 
i also love education creating content connecting   with others like you i thought there's a job out 
there that i can do both this sounds perfect so i   moved into devil at another startup going back 
to my startup routes i had the best time there   i absolutely loved it and still doing deval work 
work now today at another company which is great   and on the side on the side doing tiff and tech 
and now launching my own business takeoff which   more will be coming soon on that so stay tuned i 
will make a entire video dedicated to what exactly   that business is about and how it's going 
to help support you but in the meantime that   is my coding journey in a nutshell and the most 
exciting part is it's not over it never will be   and that's because i think it's so important to 
continue to always learn and grow and going back   to using resources like code academy the internet 
is at your fingertips or your fingertips are at   the internet whatever that saying is you can 
literally learn so many amazing things online   that you just need to really identify what you're 
passionate about or what you're not passionate   about which is equally as important and then start 
building but make sure most importantly you have   that community i really hope you found this video 
helpful and insightful i know it's me sharing my   story but for me when i hear other stories i 
feel like i always there's always a lot i can   take away and gain and just learning that when 
you're going through these highs and lows you're   not alone others have gone through them too and i 
can tell you as someone who has done it the other   side feels so good you know you put in all this 
work to learn how to code and grow a career and   once you get to that point where you can look 
back and really be like wow i did that that was   me that is going to be you whoever is watching 
this and i'm sure for many of you it already is   you so anyways i just wanted to sit down and have 
a a very candid conversation with you cuz i feel   like we haven't had one of these in a while leave 
any questions that you have about my journey or   any questions you have about your own journey 
down below and i will see you all soon thanks [music] everyone
