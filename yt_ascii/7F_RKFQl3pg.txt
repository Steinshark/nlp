ladies and gentlemen the scamming doesn't stop today we've got yet another juicy little scam coming from the influencer section of the internet the biggest scumbag greedy people on earth who are happy to sell you out for a few bucks let's take a look at who's going to be doing the scamming today shall we roll the video my name's frasier my name is jarvis i'm tyco i'm ricegum i'm nikon and i support save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token save the kids token that's right ladies and gentlemen a bep 20 token redistributing wealth to both holders and charities actually it turns out to have just redistributed wealth to the people who got in on the ground floor aka these guys now if you're already confused why this is bad because you see the name you go hey save the kids what's wrong with saving kids hold on let's back up let me explain what's going on here this is what's known as a charity token that they're shilling where part of the money like a small portion one percent of the transactions or two percent goes to charity they become really popular to promote because they sound good at their heart though most of them are just once again you know greedy little ponzi schemes with nothing really to add to anything save the kids is supposed to give money to kids and and save them i guess and a huge group of top influencers jumped on board to promote it these people include faze clan which you may know they're like fortnite characters and ricegum who you may know as the asian jake paul he's famous for his hit single god church drop merchant is selling like a god truck but that's not all even instagram model summer ray got involved all these people promoted this charity coin right before launch the price pumped they got out they they deleted their tweets suddenly out of nowhere they said hey my manager called i can't do this they backed out of this project like a homer simpson meme and they ran away leaving their fans holding the bag and listen i know what you're saying steven who cares just let a influence or scam their fans you know you know aren't you sick of trying to hold these people accountable when we all know nothing's gonna be done about this but of course we know the answer is i'll never stop okay because i'm devoted to holding these people as accountable as as humanly possible which i think the bare amount of accountability here is just that people know what you did because right now the tweet deletion is going on like crazy i mean these people have scrubbed these tweets from the internet most of them i'm here to archive them for you so you at least know what happened so let's go to the board and talk about it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host scott fuzzilla and today yes we're talking about influencers which i know is everyone's favorite subject right we've got to hold these people accountable aren't you sick of it dude don't they have enough money bring down the board here okay so this is the save the kids token website by the way love that name it makes you sound like there's no way it could be a scam it's for the kids guys but honestly we all should have known something was up when they said it's a token redistributing wealth because the question is of course to who i like to say very bluntly our mission is to redistribute wealth a lot of people bristle at that phrase that is in fact the phrase we need to use i mean maybe call me crazy in hindsight it was a bad idea to trust the guy who flexes from a yellow lambo to know a lot about crypto or maybe the the fortnite boys here don't know tokenomics that well that's also a possibility but nonetheless they promoted it to their fans anyways in a series of now deleted tweets but that are archived on the website itself phase k says i'm extremely excited to announce that i'm an ambassador for a project that's coming very soon they want to donate over 1 million dollars to charity in 30 days launch is on june 5th another promotion to his fans same guy 4 000 members in the telegram and the name hasn't even been released no other project has done this faze nikken says i'm so excited to be an ambassador for a new altcoin that's going live saturday they're donating to charity it's something i truly believe can make change faze tico sort of the brains of the operation then jumps in announcement i'm the third ambassador for new charity altcoin with phase kane phase nikken we're going to be making a difference and changing some lives don't worry guys you change lives all right and then we have ricegum ayo guys super excited to be an ambassador for save the kids bsc this is going to be one of the biggest charity coins ever on the bsc network they hype it up they get people really excited you got faze jarvis getting people really excited they just finished a boxing match and the point is they're telling their fans if you're a fan of me you're gonna be a fan of this coin so understandably thousands of people flood into the telegram chat they get super excited to jump on this coin instagram model summer rae also promoted it let's take a watch okay guys one more thing i haven't really gotten into the coin world at all but my first venture is i'm just now a ambassador for this coin it's called save the kids it's a charity coin and this month alone we're going to give a million dollars to charities wow so they're going to be giving a million dollars away they're hyping up this launch so the day of what happens it goes to the moon right guys well no the the the answer is the first day it pumps and immediately it dumps all the way to negative 90 i mean people completely lost their shirts on this thing and pretty soon people start accusing rice gum and these people of getting in on the pre-sale and dumping their bags which if you're not familiar with crypto basically means getting in right here selling right here that's that's the general idea but honestly it's really hard to prove if somebody sold off immediately or not you need their actual wallet address what we know is that all the whales in the coin sold off immediately and why would ricegum the king of the lambos do anything if he's not actually involved in some of the project and so after the coin dumps and their followers start to lose tons of money with one of them saying that they're down 50 percent in two minutes after launch what do they do well these brave influencers who got their fans into this they peace out they delete all their posts and basically pretend like it never happened actually that isn't quite accurate some of them deleted their posts like rice gum i believe some of them like phase k jarvis some of these guys left it up but the point is actually the same which is they all promised to be ambassadors of this token and whenever it's time to actually promote it now that it's dumped and your followers have gone in and the value is completely tanked they're nowhere to be found now the question is why would these influencers stop promoting this coin maybe it's because according to them their managers took their tweets down so apparently the excuse for why they had to abandon the project is because they had difficult managers faze had difficult managers summer ray had a very difficult manager you know guys it's just tough when these influencers they get out of these tokens and and they're managers guys it's fine to promote the coin pre-launch but once it goes live and fails and they all abandon guys it's the manager's calling so on the way up when everyone's making money in the pre-sale when they're promoting some garbage coin hey it's fine but when the coin disastrously tanks and all their fans are screwed rather than stick with the project they go oops all right my manager's calling i'm sorry i'm gonna have to cut this in this interview short but look now what right like like what can we learn from this well two things number one never trust influencers never ever especially about anything related to finance police number two and this goes out to the influencers if you wouldn't chill a penny stock some worthless penny stock don't shill worthless crypto with you know anonymous founders etc because a common defense of these people that i always hear is like hey maybe they were well intentioned hey maybe they didn't know it was going to be a scam whatever but that's the thing if you weren't sure that it wasn't gonna be a scam why promote it to your followers like you wouldn't go push some pink sheet trash why are you gonna push some random crypto that started a day ago like that doesn't make any sense at all this is why i'm not buying the whole like well they didn't know influencer excuse because people come to me all the time listen now that we're like the crypto call out channel here people come to me and they go hey steven like hey man like i'm not doing anything wrong right like i may have promoted this or i may have promoted like that's not too bad right i get the sense that what they're trying to get at is hey can i push this like like what if it fails like am i gonna be a scam if it fails and my message to these people is like if you're thinking that this project could has a reasonable chance of failing don't show it to your audience like if you want to gamble that's fine don't go push that on your audience these influencers are just ridiculous man they're pushing trash on you guys when it fails they cut their losses and run and pretend it never happened everyone else may have let you get away with it everyone else may have given you a pass for shilling these trash coins to your followers but not me baby i'm gonna call you out every single time anyway that's basically it i don't know do your own research be smarter don't get involved with stupid influencers and thanks for [music] you took my watching away you said that it was safe but i'm robbed and i don't feel okay [music] i trusted you you said that it was all right [music] oh but now i'm broke and my wallet
