all right i want to see this you know as i am a longterm longtime kinesis user in fact i've used kinesis for so long i forgot to turn off alerts i've used kinesis for so long that i used it back in its advantage two days and i got inspired by multiple co-workers i have a coworker that h still has his from college in the early 2000s or late 90s and he still uses the kinesis advantage one to this day 30 years same keyboard it's incredible by the way for those that don't know if you haven't seen men in black keyboard okay kinesis advantage two okay that's the two all right all right let's look at this let's look at this veteran viewers know that i have a bit of a history with ergonomic keyboards but it all started with the kinesis advantage 2 me personally i got the kinesis advantage too never looked back i literally never went off and explored other keyboards i've never had the desire to i found my baby i've loved my baby i will continue to love my advantage the end this is the advantage 360 professional there's also a nonprofessional which is basically a souped up version of that same keyboard i saw back then so the question is what's new what does it come with and will i switch to it i do currently use and have used for several years a similar but different eic keyboard why would you want to do wait why would you want to use that i i i have several problems with just this keyboard in general have used for several years a sim i i i mean your hands are so close like you're going to have this weird shoulder like bone out i i don't know i don't know about that i mean i what i do appreciate is that the the lean into the thumb cluster i think this is good i think this is a good move you got to have thumbs like isn't it crazy that you have you have 10 fingers and you largely only use eight for typing like isn't that by itself crazy isn't that just wild it's like why why why do you like you got 25% more fingers just available yeah it's hard to say you use this one other than for space right space is like pinky equals garbage finger yeah if you're better no not 20% more that's see you did incorrect math so this is actually a statistics thing this is where people fall apart on statistics and they don't understand why statistics are so manipulative now if i would have said you have 10 but you use eight that would be a 20% reduction in fingers but if you have eight and you use 10 that's 25% increase okay it's the old trick of the brain you always use the direction that has the bigger number because it sounds it sounds more important doesn't it absolutely atrocious simar but different that's how crypto made me broke exact inside the box we have two key modules i have two of those box i have three kinesis advantage 360 boxes i have two kinesis advantages up there i have a pinks i have ray browns and i have jades jades sound so good i'll do a little sound test at the end of this with bubble wrap for the children as well as a box of accessories it's pretty funny you get a key cap puller but not a key switch puller more on that later you get a usb a to c cable for connecting the keyboard to a to c baby let's go your pc they even have advantage 360 branded cable ties pretty cool maybe 6 fet long i'm not 6 ft tall so you know i can't grab that wide a bridge connector basically a piece of plastic says 360 on it and it holds the two key modules together this guy at least pretty endearing i've never seen this guy before with this model these are shine through abs caps on the nonprofessional they're actually double shot pbt caps weird that you get different key caps but that's what the $30 difference gets you baby and a quick start got it also zmk versus their like proprietary smart set engine that's like the difference between the pro and the not pro i don't like wireless i've just never liked wireless ever less is just like so frustrating to me so i just don't i i just i just can't do it i just can't do it cu it always it's there's always some sort of problem with it i just want the effing wire and i want it to work every single time and then you you have to have the the problem with wireless is you have to have wires anyways cuz how the hell do you charge it right so it's like you're not escaping wires you just have wires that you shove behind then you reull them and if you forget to pull them out you're wired for the day so it's just like f it i'm going wired i don't care about this crap okay it's annoying just stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop l take for headsets i use wired headsets baby i use wired headsets i use wired headsets okay i use wired everything let's look at the mod mostly because i think bluetooth is going to give you cancer make the frogs gay and all that stuffs don't give these to your kids to play with but they're so fun these are so awesome they have a great weight to them they have very high quality plastics they don't feel 3d printed at all like they look pretty modern i remember the advantage 2 was like had a great ergonomic innovations but it's kind of just a weird like 80s feeling keyboard even though it wasn't but this is nice now let's talk about the features i typically say that you can kill a man with this keyboard like this this keyboard could double as a weapon like that's a good keyboard in fact the base plate on it the base plate on it is steel like that's nice like that's a that's a good that's a good it's a good measurement right it's chunky yeah whereas like if you used if if you used like a 3d printed one you couldn't kill a man you'd hit him once and the 3d printing would explode this one you could go you could go to prison for the rest of your life if you played your cards right like that's how good this one is first of all it's split and that gives you a lot of flexibility because you can put them close together you can put them far apart and this allows you to have whatever kind of ergonomic setup for your shoulders that you need so you can turn them like that and have it like that which is nice and that's going to reduce what's called allner deviation which is when your hands go like this if you're like that's the devil don't do that that's how you hurt yourself with a split keyboard you can tilt them in put your elbows on the table that's great it also gives you the freedom to put your mouse where you want believe it or not some people may choose to spread the modules like this and put the mouse in the middle and what that does is it prevents them from reaching way over here for their mouse which can cause shoulder and neck strain that's the name of the game you know a really big tip not to get strained from reaching just so you know is exercising this may be this may sound crazy is you should just exercise it really help it really does help drinking water exercising and sleeping right really works and neovim also is a great way to avoid the mouse if you just if you just you if you just use neovim you'll never use the mouse whereas i mean i know most of you use vs code i'm sorry that you guys use vs code i know you just love clicking on your little things like oh i got to jump to definition clickity click click control click it's not my fault you're a loser okay enjoy enjoy being a loser ergonomics we're trying to reduce prevent or heal from repetitive stress injuries and there's a few different ways you can get them all deviation shoulder strain another way you can develop an rsi is from having too much wrist extension this is flexion this is extension and that hurts and normally it's be that's why you don't want to rest your hands on the keyboard right when i type i float like you're playing the piano you float okay it gives you more confidence at first you feel more afraid because you're floating and you're and you're and you're out and you're out and you you don't want to you don't want to me you don't want to mess it up and you feel scared whoopsies i just pressed the button but then as you get used to it oh man you can fly you can fly are on your desk if your keyboard has those little legs on the back that make it tilt up i used to always use those but once i got educated i stopped cuz that's extension these you don't even have the option of extending your wrist because the wrist pad is built onto the key module itself just like forces you look how neutral my wrist is there it's just straight and not only that do that an in fact i believe the kinesis advantage 360 i believe i believe if you read the manual you would know that the manual specifically states you should float your hands while typing rest your hands when you're not okay you rest while i talking and then float read the friendly manual i liter dude i dude okay yes the guy that can't read just told the guy that probably can read that he should read the the guy that does not read the manual just told this man to read the friendly manual i'm sorry sold separately accessory for $25 and it's attaches on with magnets it's so awesome and slick i have some of those they make my hands send getting it if you're in the i literally became a sweaty mess so i just i just never use pronation which is when your hands are like this the two bones in your arm the radius and the allna they scissor and they pinch tissue this is the one that i feel the most and this is also the the way that this this keyboard has improved probably the most like i that's also why i can't use like i can't use gaming keyboards like some people can use some people can use gaming keyboards i can't use gaming keyboards like they they just by the way this is a kinesis tko total knockout sounds delicious i can't i can't i can't use these like i can't they they just destroy my they literally destroy they just destroy myself that's not what scissoring is i know i use windows to stream shut up there it goes [music] uh that's literally the window sound use keyboards from urgod which are really cool but their tenting system is so much more finicky you got these little legs i hate i hate those kind of little legs like that cu you'll crush it down with a button under it and what that allows you to do is you you to press the button and you can increase the angle and it does it's not a pressure situation right the button has to be pressed to move whereas those ergo do ergo dos ones one of the problems i had is that i type pretty violently and when i get into things i type so hard i was getting the legs to go or lower it just like that there's only one dimension to it you you know the extra jank of the ergodox allows you to put all sorts of different angles but this is just up and down this way which is un pronating your arms unpinch so awesome that he said tent it to the max look i don't like see i actually don't cool this has a cool profile if you guys could see what i see from this way like it's neat and finally what's the deal with these contoured key wells well that is because travel your fingers don't have to sit on the keyboard like that they get to rest in a natural state like this and not only that look how look at the variation in the key heights what they're trying to do there is have it so that the keys are at a consistent distance from your finger as it sweeps in its range of motion it should be able to touch all those keys they're all right there see like this number key is farther away but it's also sticking out more so by the way this is one of my favorite features it doesn't feel like i'm reaching that far when i'm when i'm going upwards right like it just feels like i'm i'm reaching out i'm just pushing it and i have small i have like little baby hands so i have to reach a little bit but it's just not much it's very nice f that's why i love concavity that's that's why i always say it goes thumb clusters then concavity like if you don't go thumb cluster concavity as the order of importance you're way off right it dude i do have small hands okay i have little baby hands i'm 6 feet tall and i have like baby hands my wife has the same hand size of hands as me she's 5 foot6 everybody has bigger hands than me everybody beast co when i put my hands in his hand it was like it was like i my my my child in my hand okay it was just so easy it's just awesome they thought it through if you're someone who's suffering from an rsi or we're trying to prevent one and that is your number one thing this is proba oh we got to pause this that that that was a great that that was great yo i'm 6 foot4 i still i still got that six i still got that six foot in there concavity is something you have to feel to understand the distance your fingers move are so short that you feel as though the energy you deplete while typing is one/ third yeah i agree with that anyways probably or at least this brand is probably the ergo keyboard to go with they've really thought it through but that doesn't mean i don't have problems with it which we'll get to in a bit but first thanks to ug green for sponsoring this video meet the revvo do max 213 a 13 in1 connectivity solution with 13 ports including usbc an sd card reader and a 2.5 gb etherna port it's a great compion for any workflow its two thunderbolt 4 ports let you enjoy blazing fast file transfers at blazingly fast 40 gb per second along with or dual 4k 60 hz display options you can even keep your devices powered up with 90 ws fast charging universally compatible with major apple windows and tablet devices the re 23 is built to real talk i have no what what is this for i actually have no idea what do you use this for is this for like is this like an extension thing it's just a dock okay i i like liter i' my setup is so stupid i i've just like never used a dock in my lifetime it's either i'm on my laptop or i just have 1,000 cables horrifyingly done all shoved together docs are good for laptops okay yeah i could buy that it seems like people like that i got one for my wife not for me increase productivity no matter what setup you have get yours today at the link below let's continue the journey of discovery here you can see there's a power on switch for each one there's also a usbc port for each one if you're wondering what that bridge accessory does i think keeps a solid distance so in case you want to so so in case you don't know if you didn't read the friendly manual this distance right here mimics the advantage 2's distance and so if you wanted to have the advantage 2's distance but you didn't want to have and you didn't want it to shift cuz one of my problems with these things is that as you're typing you get aggressive you get a little bit of shifty shift and so by having that thing in there it prevents it from happening i i took mine out cuz i wanted to you know i wanted to move it a little bit but yeah so if you wanted to replicate the advantage to you can just do that you hear that loud snap unit that's pretty cool but i like it to be a little turned in so i probably wouldn't use this yeah neither would i keyboard does not come with a dongle it's bluetooth which is okay i do like to have a dongle a little lower latency and just kind of simpler setup just leave that thing in your computer the keyboard is available with multiple different switch types from the store however they're not hot swappable which is yeah sad you can't i don't think so i think hot swappable is largely unreliable and poopy put any key switch you want on here you do have a little bit of a selection these ones that comes with these browns they're not cherry mx browns they're gaton browns it's one of those things these keyboards uro keyboards often have a hefty price tag and you kind of just wish that you got everything under the sun for that price like and hot swappable key i i sorry i i didn't realize that you guys type so gently and you guys don't type like a furious maniac like i do i type really really hard i i've literally broken my keyboard by how hard i hit space bar i am not a gentle i am not a gentle i am my macbook pro when i used to own it had a wave in the metal okay i'm not a i'm not a gentle person no it's not in frustration i just type hard because i grew up like a man finger power people also by the way he this may be a little bit old but he they have different switches now you can get different switches so i have i have i have jades here let's go over to here so i have some sweet jades you can get you know what i mean i got some some sweet some sweet one i'm a monster i work by myself cool to have and if i'm spending so much for a keyboard it' be nice for it to be not just my ergo keyboard but also my enthusiast keyboard like let me put freaking pandas in here but alas i would say that's a through line with my criticisms for this thing overall during filming kinesis added the advantage 360 signature to their lineup where an aftermarket outfitter called upgrade keyboard will build you a 360 or 360 pro with purportedly any switch you want and cool other upgrades as long as you're willing to wait up to 6 months one thing that i love to have in an urb keyboard is thumb clusters which is what you have here their philosophy at kinesis is why let your little pinky i took thatout so much heavy lifting on a keyboard when your thumbs are way stronger let them do repetitive tasks like space bar back space i will say enter was one of the hardest like the thumb cluster was pretty hard to get used to you know what i mean thumb cluster was pretty hard to get used to overall the control being right here on your thumb you know it took a little bit like it definitely there was definitely a jump there for a little bit that it took it took a little bit but i i will most certainly say now that i now that i'm used to it it's like i could never go back but the initial on-ramp is is is non-trivial for sure and why not chuck in some other lesser known keys like paging up and i really like that approach i will not use an ergo keyboard that doesn't have thumb clusters it's just so sweet the keyboard i have my desk i personally use space and backspace and delete and enter all on my thumbs and having backspace in particular on the thumb rather than i used to use my how does it feel to use a normal keyboard occasionally that was my laptop right i'm i'm i'm used to it i can i can do it it's like it's my laptop way far away i had to go like way over to my laptop and lean over so i i'm fine using it i can use it it's just that i i prefer not to like if i can yeah chad is dumb that's the name of my project okay it's to reflect my feelings about you but like that that i mean i can use regular keyboards still you know what's really cool is that i can actually use regular keyboards and i've started to switch back to dvorac or i mean switch back to query on those keyboards so that way i actually have since there's like a feeling difference i can actually map my brain to just query on flat keyboards and just dvorac on on on these concave keyboards it's something i'm starting to train myself to do which is kind of an interesting thing but i'm finding that it's still a little bit hard it's still a little bit hard to do that so i was on dvorak just then was dvor a mistake yes i think it was a mistake generally i think doric was a mistake i think the only thing that i should have done let's see github github oh my goodness github stupid [ __ ] code just give me just give me the executable the primage in keyboards this is my biggest mistake is that i designed this layout by the way to work on a laptop with no layers other than shift right that was the whole point that was the whole point of this keyboard layout if i could go back in time i would have kept my base layer with the symbol layout like this and the shift layout like that but i would have kept query it's the symbols that were causing me the problem i over optimized you know what i mean i effed up i over optimized thinking because i i i really started getting a wrist pain before i switched to a kinesis i really started getting wrist pain and so i switched to dvorac and typically because dvorac was just so dang you just moved way way less and switching just the symbols was really the thing that was good you know what i mean early interface implementation i did i really did it early interface i should have waited you know i was younger in there i was i was younger but honestly everything else is perfect you know what i mean you're still in virgin yeah aer sounds like bad wrist pain wasn't from that literally you don't know and shut the hell up i sometimes i swear people you just want you just want me to punch you in the face i don't want to punch you in the face but when you do something and pain goes away that's how it works okay the problem is is that all when you use a laptop all of your all of your symbols are effectively on your pinky and third finger and so you're constantly doing this when you're on a laptop key keyboard and this is like literally where the problem is is when you do this and so it was it was shooting pain up the side of my arm and that's when i got super freaked out i just got done having my second kid i'm sitting there thinking i live in california which i'm from montana so you know how all montans think about californians i'm living in a i'm living on enemy territory i am having i have two kids i work at i work at my job that requires me to use a computer all day am i about to have to like quit and have a life change like what the hell am i about to do i'm freaking out like i genuinely was having like a life crisis because it was hurting so bad that i thought i would have to quit programming man i was terrified i was terrified terrified pinky up here at what age was that 29 or 28 28 yeah enemy territory feels real yeah you get it you get it 28 is when it happened and i was freaking out i was freaking out and so that's when i switched to vorac and 6 months later i got this keyboard as well or or i got the kinesis advantage too and then i used it for years and just loved it and then all my pain went away just ab i mean obviously you see me program now i program still like a mad man absolutely loving it it's fantastic like reaching over there so much better highly recommend just so you know that i i am now paid shill for k's keyboard but i hay to be fair i did buy multiple of their keyboards for a half decade before they even convinced before they sent me one free keyboard then they sent me a free keyboard and then 3 years later after that they they actually paid me they've paid me twice feels pretty cool i've been paid a few bucks by kinesis you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about yeah i've used a moonlander i used their predecessor arodo do i i just didn't like it i i i borrowed a few different keyboards to try it out and i just really didn't like it you know what i mean i tried to like argo dos because that was the first one because it had that super sweet tenting so i figured that i would want i figured that i would want that one more i didn't i thought i did but i didn't so bought a kinesis because of your marketing skills yeah i bought a kinesis knowing for a fact in 5 years i was going to be a successful twitch streamer i haven't started yet nor did i even know what twitch was but we knew it was going to happen however you will see that there's other elements of this keyboard layout that are non-standard for example where's the caps lock button is it right here beside a no that's escape yep the philosophy of yep and that's a good thing thank you kinesis for not putting not putting a button that i remap in that location okay thank you for not putting that button that everybody remaps really appreciate that of kinesis is who uses caps locks sql engineers like they're trying to make the most ergonomic keyboard possible they want to have everything within reach of of the home row and if there's keys that are not within reach then they go onto a second layer you hit some key press and then you're on a layer that has all your numpad for example if i show you the k key there's a second legend on the bottom of it indicating that it's the number five which is super cool got your f keys on layer underneath the number that thing right there you can hit this thing and turn your keyboard into a number pad i don't use it and when i type it and i get i get super confused and scared why nothing's working and then i always remember that this button's been lit up and i've accidentally hit this key keys i would never use that's all gravy if you get used to it i don't want to get used to it i never ever want to switch layers i want more keys and that's because i don't have an rsi i'm usingg keyboards to prevent rsis and because i don't actually have an injury i'm willing to like sacrifice some ergonomics for extra productivity so my preference would be if they made a i would love for them to make a keyboard that also had f keys up here and just maybe just a couple more keys so they don't have it technically does have f keys right here you just have to press this bottom my i don't have any key keys on mine this button right here is function so these top keys are function keys this bottom one is function so i mean like you do you do have it you do technically have them the kinesis the kinesis advantage two actually has the f keys dedicated but it's just like eh eh they're cool i don't really need them you know what i mean i don't technically need them i think i like them but then once you get used to this i don't know i when whatever i'm debugging it's already like that you know what i mean i i don't really layers aren't slow anyways layers aren slow but i can understand i actually truly understand his argument which is it's the same reason why i designed my keyboard layout to be base layer and shift layer only and no alternative layers because i don't want to have a bunch of layers i'm not a fan of layering but i will sacrifice or i won't care if there's a function key if i can press a button to get function keys because function keys are a rarity for me they're not a com like i never press a function key ever like only when i am debugging do i use a function key where are the the arrows then the arrows are right here right right here two arrows are right there the other two arrows are right here on this side so you got left and right up and down keyboard that also had f keys i use h maybe a couple more keys so they don't have to do things like move escape down to over here and caps over here whatever they see the arrows and i hate these arrow keys that are divided you see they've got you're supposed to go way down here fers i i'm actually i actually got used to it and now i love it i love the arrow keys right there right it makes a lot of sense but i mean i used theor so unfortunately j and k are right here so in my brain i go up and down right here and then left and right right here but if i use the arrow keys i go left and right right here and up and down over here very you know like it it you know what i mean because sometimes you have to use the arrow keys like sometimes you don't have a choice on the the the arrow keys for the left and right arrows for the up and down arrows i don't like that i want to see all the arrows in a normal cluster in a normal orientation because that's so good i i'm i i'm i'm i'm stealing it i'm stealing you the mit mit chat repetitive skill yoink yoink got them got them hey you should know that chat's mit you spend years working in retail getting muscle memory for the arrow keys gaming getting muscle memory for the arrow keys to relearn stuff like that is brutal in the case of hotkeys i want to use the same muscle memory i already use on my laptop which i might be using while i also have this keyboard in my life you know we're multi-device people you got to switch between and i have no problem switching between orthol linear keyboards like this with the up and down keys and using my thumbs and then going to my laptop it's different enough that i actually don't have a problem switching between but switching the muscle memory of hot keys is a big deal so why not just reprogram the keyboard that's easy to do on most keyboards right indeed you are right except for this keyboard this specific keyboard if you get the advantage 360 nonpr that's a usb version you plug that puppy in it actually has a different and much easier to use keyboard reprogramming my guess is this take right here is going to get you guys really upset and you guys are going to hate this take because it's it's not it's probably it's probably not the take you want to hear so get ready it's you're you can pre- right now you can pre- so i in fact a lot of people don't like it seems like in our side of the world we don't want the smart set app software with this particular pro board they're like hey you're a pro you're such a pro that instead of having a nice gooey that's just like on our website for you to reprogram your keyboard like a ergodox might you actually have to go to their github and fork their github in order and use zmk yeah it's so i told you you're going to be you're going to be upset he literally is where's the [ __ ] ex like that that is the take right here i know i know just let it go i think but this is great though this like really shows the difference between us a select subset of of kinesis advantage users versus or or keyboard users right like you the fact that you even know that there's both qmk and zmk shows the difference between this okay to reprogram which is doable and they have an instruction guide on how to do it it's just not like i just don't get it on the one hand is there customer people who are like are not keyboard enthusiasts but just need ergonomic keyboards to serice their injuries if it is yes why are you expecting those people to go and be power users on your git repository just one thing fun fact when they started their keyboard it was originally designed for accountants and st and typists people that typed as secretaries and stuff it wasn't actually designed for programmers they acally discovered that programmers liked their keyboards it wasn't it wasn't even for it was never designed for us how funny is that right and so then when they started realizing that actually engineers were the largest were were the their largest section that's when they switched over to this and that's when this is why we're having that weird change over is because it was designed not for it was designed for tommy lee jones it was but then it became from tommy lee to zuckerberg you know what i mean so you know we're in the process what where why is there a cvs where's the xlsx right that's two different users i don't get it i think that all their keyboard should have easy remapping since it's so important on a on a smaller non-standard layout where you're going to want to customize it your way especially with thumb clusters make it easy for us guys another issue i have is that it's not rgb seems like a stupid thing you should laugh about that one child keyboard why does it need it it does have a backlight on the pro model there is a global white backlight which you can turn up and down you hold mod button and arrow down and up you guys see that going off and on it has a didn't even know that i literally had no idea there was a back for a price of $480 what yes it's $480 the non-pro model is $450 so that's my thing you guys it's very expensive and you can't put a price on health and that's their aim is solving your health problems it's almost a medical device you can probably probably write it off so it's cool i just wish it was be it went beyond that and could be also my enthusiast keyboard so for those prices like yeah throw in some rgb and like cuz why not it's cool that you can have five different profiles for attaching bluetooth it's cool that there's multiple layers of keyboard profiles you can connect to it or program into it beyond just the standard three profiles that are included i just have a general problem with the take overall which is like if you're an enthusiast keyboardist i would assume you'd rather use something like qmk or zmk to be able to adjust your your stuff because that pretty much works on all of these like more enthusiast styled keyboards is something that's a little bit nicer but if you if you don't want that if you're kind of more of like hey i just want to be able to kind of like remap a couple things then i totally understand you want this and i think that's just i think this is just the golf between a programmer and not programmer right the golf is huge and this actually you know what i'm going to go here this is a a great reason why ai and the pred engineer is like such a failure right because like how do you get the person just real talk how do you how do you bridge that gulf right how do you bridge that gulf if this is kind of like the if if this guy represents the typical pred engineer coming up like this is very very difficult pro is not meant for non-programmers agreed but this is like the same problem right you go into these things that are a little bit more difficult and all a sudden you feel like oh this is sucks this is this is terrible how could i ever use this why would you want to do this it's like most people prefer it this way so it's kind of wild right it's kind of wild that we see something as such a net good and somebody else can see this as such a net negative me personally though again i still don't use the i i still don't use the pro i deal with the smart set engine just so i can just so i can have it wired i like it wired i'm a wired guy i don't want it not wired i did go i have i have a pro version i just didn't like it you know i just didn't love it and i don't want to continue to use it i i prefer the i'm a wired take i'm a wired take it's a wired take okay it's just how i feel i've just never loved bluetooth wired is the way i think wired is the way honestly personally again can you wire the pro you can wire the pro yes but that's what i was doing so that's why i stopped using the pro is that i was sitting there and it was just always wired and i was just like what am i doing why am i doing this i remap one key and that's it because i do software level remaps because zmk can't remap my keyboard i have i have to do software level remaps for my keyboard layout unfortunately my keyboard layout it causes some goofiness where is it it's it's the dollar sign and the til or it's the grave and the bar grave and bar and dollar sign tiy tend to be very hard ones to do on zmk and it took me quite a bit of time to like get it correct but i had to make some admissions and i moved some keys around to make this work and so i just found it to be really frustrating what software do i use to remap i use i use ubuntu's x1 i use x11 i use ubuntu and i just use x11 x11 has their own keyboard remap it's like built in n it's completely possible yeah you should try it i have i have a whole i have a whole deal on it and i spent a lot of time getting this grave to work correctly it's not quite what you want it to be right it's not like what you're hoping it to be it's in go can i even remember this it's in like cat shared where the [ __ ] x is x x1 shared keyboards xkb okay we're getting places we're getting places we're getting places it's not here dang it where is it i can't remember where it's at where is xkb at where is xkb at xk kb name or type directory name xkb oh you don't have permissions where where's it at dude i can't even remember where it's at user oh i bet you i i think you're right i think you're right it's in user yeah see i knew there was share remember i kept trying to type share i kept trying to type share so user share the problem is i do this like once once every couple years and then i got to remember what is it what is it what is it what was it what is it what was it let's just go in here and let's go like this find i can't remember what it is it's something with dvorac in it there you go there it is there you go so i have my little remap right here so it's a software level remap i just do it right here it's awesome dude i forget i forget i forget these things you know what i mean i forget where things are at cuz i just you just it's such such a rarity that you do those things it's cool that it has this easy to use tenting system i have the i have the 360 pro and wireless connection between parts sometimes is [ __ ] af you have to have time to boot to the left one and then turn to the right one yeah see that's the problem is i've had i've i've always had some connectivity to two half zmk keyboards and i've heard so many other people say there's some sort of connection goofiness when it comes to bluetoothing and all that i'm tenting right now and it's cool that it's like the most ergonomic thing ever but i just wish they had like a a middle ground keyboard that had all these benefits but just like an extra row keys over here maybe some macro keys on the side and and let every user have the cheap and easy non power user reprogram ability and then it would be my perfect keyboard and i would put it on my desk i i'm stuck using the truly ergonomic cleave keyboard with its optical switches and you know it's flat it it's it's not everything i want i want it plus this smashed together and like an external keypad i'd probably put like a little keypad in the middle here or something like that but anyways thanks for watching guys if you like this video maybe go down memory lane and check out all the other weird uro keyboards we've covered over the years it is cool i i mean i like i like i i his take is just so much different than my take which i think it's just so funny because like i i don't know how to like map my brain onto his take that well because the product person inside of me says i like how heavy and steel and hard plastic these are so if you add keys to this the keyboard val the keyboard or the keyboard cost is going way up right and for me i don't want that right like it's already expensive enough for me i don't want to have to pay more like so you add a whole bunch of stuff to it and i think it's just going to you know it's just going to skyrocket i know corova is awesome right it just cost more so i don't like that i'm fine with a layer on the keys i don't i rarely rarely use like functions i'm fine programming zmk if i have to obviously you saw me i dorked out on software remaps in x11 i also have it for windows and mac at one point but i think those ones don't quite work i had it for ukulele on mac and all that but it's just like you get to this point where i think i just have such a different approach to keyboards because i use it in a in a programmer's mindset not in a not not in just like a casual mindset he's not a programmer exactly so i think that that's where the big big jump is would you like help with zmk i i i got really far with my zmk setup i'm not sure if it's in here i don't think it's in here yeah i'll have to go find it i i got really far i got there there was one thing that couldn't be done that was annoying and that's it so anyways there you go i like it though i've had a really good time i like it i like the keyboard i think i think overall the problem is is like his trade-offs aren't the trade-offs i would make so like i couldn't like i literally could not use that keyboard he showed at the end cuz anytime i use like a flat keyboard i start getting i start getting like like what's it called forearm pain so like this like flat resting really hurts me close together hands really hurt like really hurts me i don't know what it is i type too hard years of skateboarding i don't know what it is it's not tennis elbow i think it's technically golf elbow because of where it's hurting but it all i know is i get effed up whenever i use that mr burns typing move nick burns but yeah so i just have that one i just have that problem and so that's golf elbow yeah i think it's golf elbow yeah hold on you night shade dude you don't even have to you don't even have to ban the guy or you don't have to you don't have to delete the guy's message let's just get him out of here epicx guy you're out you're done you're done unable to ban user ban epic saxs guy you're done unable to ban user you must already be done okay you must already be done and so the the the keyboard that i actually am very curious about and it it looks pretty cool is that glove 80 i think this is actually a pretty dang cool keyboard like i will always probably like my kinesis i already own it i don't need to spend more money on keyboards i'm already very used to it and plus they they they now sponsor me and they send me free keyboards like i love that but if i were to buy another keyboard i think i'd buy a glove 80 to try it out cuz it looks like this action's really low and i think i could get used to it i think i could try it out so if i were to use one i would probably use a glove 80 real talk i think this is where i'd want where i'd want the problem i see with it or the thing i'd hope is it doesn't feel cheap i'm really worried about these little stands and them being perfectly even or having to adjust them i don't know if i like that i'd like to i mean i'm hoping that it be good you know what i mean so that's kind of where i'm at on keyboards i will continue to use the low profile keycaps are awesome yeah i agree the low profile looks good i just hope that it feels good i really want to feel good on using the keyboard because that's kind of that's kind of my problem is that i need a keyboard that also feels good i can't just have one that feels really light and i might get like angry at it so we'll see had one sold it because it was feeling cheap yeah see i mean but i mean but that's the price point right you pay for what you get so if if this thing costs like $150 or whatever it is how much does it cost how much does it cost to get one can is there like a price how does one find a price this one has lots of rgbs okay 400 bucks i'd expect it to be pretty dang good then honestly i i'm a little bit surprised it doesn't feel magnificent at 400 bucks but i think this is i think this is a great keyboard if i were to use a keyboard i would want to try this one so i'm hoping to try this one out someday just to say i've tried it the thumb clusters are going to f me because i'm so used to the problem is is i'm so used to like a specific style of thumb cluster having a different thumb cluster would be very difficult for me to like use you know what i mean like that would be very very difficult people confuse light with cheap they do confuse light with cheap but i'd like to try it out have you seen a moonlander yes i've used the argo dos the the pre moonlander i have not used a moonlander i've only seen it i've never really enjoyed their style like i don't like i don't like flat keyboards i like i like the concavity right concavity i think to be is is really one of the best ones there's another keyboard that i thought was beautiful that i really wanted to try it's like this magnet keyboard magnet keyboard it was a really cool youtube video hold on let's let's see if we can find it for a quick second hold on just give me a moment give me a moment people what what do i say keyboard magnet gosh i figured is it flux is it is it flux yeah yeah this one this one just we already watched this one this one just looks super super cool to begin with flip you may have to take out the music i don't know if it's gonna dmca me if it does you can just take out the sounds aluminium wheel like that's cool like i love that like the fact that you can take things off and put things on and change things around i think that that is super cool i love the idea of it the char recorder yeah so the char recorder has a new keyboard i i actually have an open invite to use the char recorder keyboard what's the what's the what's the company what's the company's name chara chara quarter keyboard the problem is is that for me to be able to do that i have to like there's so much i'd have to do to use it effectively you know what i mean i swear there was a really cool keyb keyboard that they had anyways this is also a super this is also a super cool keyboard company i thought they had a new one this is a super cool company right i think that they they've done a great job with this and i would love to i'd love to become a stenographer one day and just try it out it would be a lot of fun to see can i use it oh someone said they they they found it's like gold yeah if if this is the one it's like golden this isn't the one that i was looking at oh maybe i remember seeing this guy's video but this is this isn't the one that i was looking at no anyways super cool all right well you get the idea i like i mean i like this this is super cool but as far as keyboards go i don't know people really people really dork out on keyboards i just want something that works you know what i mean can we all be real here i just want something that really works and i want something that doesn't hurt my my my wrists or my elbow you know what i mean like that's that's all i want and so i like thumb clusters concavity everything else i don't care about the name is the primagen
