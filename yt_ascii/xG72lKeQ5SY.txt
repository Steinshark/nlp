saint gregory really gives us a beautiful image and this is actually one of my favorite images in the in the life of moses and i'm actually going to read it to you because it is so amazing it really is like if you want to understand everything i do it's pretty much contained in this text and so so when he says that when you remove the the garments of skin and you enter into the holy place where you move the coverings and you come into the place where god is manifesting himself in the world he says when we do this the knowledge of truth will result and manifest itself the full knowledge of being comes about by purifying our opinion concerning non-being in my view the definition of truth is this not to have a mistaken apprehension of being falsehood is a kind of impression which arises in the understanding about non-being as though what does not exist does in fact exist but truth is the sure apprehension of real being this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] [applause] with jordan peterson's daily wire exodus seminar in which i participated a few months ago and which is streaming now on daily wire they're putting out episodes i think once a week now i thought i would really continue looking at exodus as a kind of compliment adding to the discussion which i had and so last the last video i did was on the first two chapters of exodus we're gonna do chapter three and chapter four which is really the burning bush this is one of my favorite parts of the text but it's also one of my favorite parts of saint gregory of nissa's commentary on the text and so i'm going to dive a little more into sangria of nissa in this particular episode and we're going to look at what it is that's going on in the story of the burning bush leading all the way up to this one of the strangest stories in scripture the circumcision of moses the sun by the hand of zipporah as god is coming to kill someone either moses or or moses his son in the in the in his tent and so i think i have a little bit of insight to offer you of course i sadly for that story i will not be able to completely unlock the mystery but i do have some insight i think i can offer starting at the beginning of chapter three of exodus now moses was tending the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the back of the desert and came to horeb the mountain of god and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush so he looked and behold the bush was burning with fire but the bush was not consumed then moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush does not burn so when the lord saw that he turned aside to look god called him from the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here i am then he said do not draw near this place take off your sandals off your feet for the place where you stand is holy ground and so the first thing to understand which is very important here is of course the the importance of understanding that as moses is ascending the mountain what we're going to see this is going to be true everywhere in this story which is that moses is a microcosm of israel we have to keep thinking in fractal structures moses is a microcosm of israel the story of moses is a microcosm of what's going to what's happening to israel and so we can see that moses going up the mountain here and seeing the burning bush in the mountain of god is a preview or as a little version of what will later happen when the entire nation of israel is gathered around the mountain and moses goes up the mountain to encounter god it is very important to understand that if we want to understand the symbolism most of you i hope that many of you will have read saint gregory of nissa's life of moses and you will see that saint gregory takes certain things for granted that is he takes certain understandings for granted his text is very slim and he presents things sometimes which may look to people like a kind of of jump in logic or kind of jump in in understanding or analogy let's say too much analogy but when you look at the text you realize that his analogies are deeply deeply grounded in this structural vision of how the text lays itself out one of the things that saint gregory for example emphasizes although i'm not sure it's there in the hebrew text but he says that it is a thornbush it's a bramble bush that he would have seen in the desert in the mountain which is not completely unfathomable considering that you know those are the types of bushes that can grow in deserts our thorn bushes and so the importance of understanding that it is a thorn bush can help you understand what it is that's going on that is moses is coming up the mountain and he is encountering two extremes he's encountering the fire in the thorns now the thorns are of course the thorns of of the fall that is what's going on the bush represents the the fallen world right the fall that the consequences of the fall and so he is seeing the fire of god burning in the inside the the consequence of the fall but not totally consuming it not consuming it there's these two things that that exist together and so saint gregory really sees this as an image of the incarnation and especially as an image of the incarnation based on the notion of the virgin and so we have traditional icons in the in the orthodox church where we will see the burning bush represented as the mother of god with her hands up with the image of christ in her center and this is something which comes in part for sure from saint gregory directly because he talks about how the burning bush is an image of you know the virgin's virginity not being consumed in the in the the manifestation of christ but it's not just about not being consumed but also the possibility of of manifesting god right the possibility of manifesting god in the incarnation this is what we mean by not being consumed because we have to understand that in exodus god is represented as this all-consuming fire which will consume everything if it's not connected to it properly and so there has to be of the proper relationship between god and the world in order for what we see in the burning bush to be possible which is for god to be present in the world without consuming it and so this is why the burning bush is so important because it is a kind of miraculous represent miraculous event where god is present in the world without completely consuming it which is why it is an image of the incarnation ultimately for christians but why it is in some ways this the beginning of what will be set up later which is that god is going to manifest to moses the manner in which he can be in a relationship with the world without consuming it and that will imply a hierarchy and a set of mediations which will mediate let's say the the presence of god down into the world in order to to be able to to be there and so you can see already that the question of mediation is important in the story because moses immediately he covers his face but it's interesting because there is in the in the the approach to the burning bush a uncovering and a covering and so this is of course the mystery of the of the revelation of god all the time it is always this mystery of the relationship between covering and uncovering and so how things veils cover the holy place but they in some ways reveal the holiness because even in their veiling and so that's why there's this mystery of a relationship between veiling and unveiling in the idea of of manifestation right because the only way to see god is through mediations but those mediations are at the same time a covering and so that's why on the one hand moses removes the sandals from his feet but then also covers his face those two things are kind of happening simultaneously to show you this this mystery of how it is that you can encounter how you can encounter the infinite in the finite how how can you do this what's important to see here is of course the idea that moses removes his sandals in order to come into the holy place like i said it's important to understand the the fractal nature of this saying gregor nisa really points us in the right direction when he links the fact that moses removes his sandals in order to come to the holy place and this removal of the sandals is an image of circumcision it is an image of removing the animal garments of skin which god gave to adam and so god gives to adam these garments of skin which are there to be a protection from the thorns and now in order to you know and they're right they're good to have these these garments to protect you from the thorns but if you want to come into contact with the manner in which god reveals himself in the thorns then you have to remove the garments of skin in order to be able to have that revelation and so it's deeply linked to the story of adam and eve in the garden of genesis but like i said it's deeply linked to what will happen later and so saying gregory pointing us to the fact that he removes the the sandals in order to come into contact with god in the burning bush is directly related to when moses goes up the mountain to receive the law that what he will leave down there at the bottom of the mountain will be the golden calf the animality will stay at the bottom and saint gregory points to the fact that in the ascent moses it says in the text that the animals should not touch them even touch the mountain and that he sees this as this image of animality which is lower and has to be let's say removed in order to come into contact with the revelation of god but when he come into the the revelation this moment where you encounter this saint gregory really gives us a beautiful image and this is actually one of my favorite images in the in the life of moses and i'm actually going to read it to you because it is so amazing it really is like if you want to understand everything i do it's pretty much contained in this text and so so when he says that when you remove the the garments of skin and you enter into the holy place where you move the coverings and you come into the place where god is manifesting himself in the world he says when we do this the knowledge of truth will result and manifest itself the full knowledge of being comes about by purifying our opinion concerning non-being in my view the definition of truth is this not to have a mistaken apprehension of being falsehood is a kind of impression which arises in the understanding about non-being as though what does not exist does in fact exist but truth is the sure apprehension of real being so whoever applies himself in quietness to hire philosophical matters over a long period of time will barely apprehend what true being is that is what possesses existence in its own nature and what non-being is that is what is existence only in appearance with no self-subsisting nature it seems to me that at the time of the great moses was instructed in the theophany he came to know that none of those things which are apprehended by sense perception and contemplated by the understanding really subsists but that the transcendent essence and cause of the universe on which everything depends alone subsists for even if the understanding looks upon any other existing things reason observed in in absolutely none of them the self-sufficiency by which they could exist without participation in true being on the other hand that which is always the same neither increasing nor diminishing immutable to all change whether to better or worse for it is far removed from the inferior and it has no superior standing in need of nothing else alone desirable participated in by all but not lessened by their participation this is truly real being and the apprehension of it is the knowledge of truth that's what saint gregory of nisa is setting up for us here is the idea that i've talked about several times on the channel which is that things exist he sets it up in an extreme way so he says nothing exists on its own things only exist to the extent that they are dependent on self-subsisting existence with that they are dependent on god and if we wanted to use other words that maybe can help you understand more being we could say the good we've talked about this that that that things are dependent on their good they exist in their good so although saint gregory he sets it up as this radical distinction and it makes sense to do that saying nothing exists if they don't if they don't exist in god there's a way in which we could say only god fully exists because he is the the end his he doesn't have other causes above him he is the cause of all causes he is self-subsistent existence and all things depend on him for their existence but you could also understand it fractively in a way that is is suggested in the exodus text which is the things exist in their goods and those goods the intellectual let's say the physical things exist in their intellectual goods and those intellectual goods also don't have self-cent nature but it all scales up and moves towards something like an infinite good which which is the source of all the other goods and the way which they exists and so anything which is grasp for itself and we acted on it if we act on it as if we think that it has independent existence and existence in itself becomes an idol and this is of course what is the whole much of the story of exodus is about which is why you can understand for example the story of the of the golden calf because there's nothing wrong with a golden calf but that if you try to make it into a point of attention on its own then it becomes bad but if you see it as scaling up towards higher and higher goods then it participates then it finds being then it becomes something which participates in this this transcended possibility and so you can see that this is true of anything we've talked about this before it's true of of of any action that you do whether it's the normal actions of eating or you know making money or working or loving other people like all these things are good if they scale up towards higher goods and they become let's say they manifest their illusion if you try to grasp them for themselves and so if you if you grasp them for the cells it's an illusion but if you see how it is connected to higher and higher beings then it becomes good then it because then it has its proper level of being you could say and so this is of course what saint gregory is pointing towards and he's pointing towards how all of these is is pointing towards let's say the incarnation as the very movement of this as the very movement of the highest into the lowest and how if things are seen properly that this not only becomes possible but becomes the very way in which the world actually exists and so saint gregory sees the image of the burning bush essentially as a as an image of ultimately of the incarnation which can be understood as the possibility of the transcendent to manifest in the particular and so when we look at all the other aspects of the burning bush we're going to notice that this is what is this is what he's going to see almost everything in that story as related to and it will make sense and for people watch who watch my content you'll understand it especially if you understand it practically as something which is true in the absolute but is also true at every level that is at every level that has a transcendence to it that has a good which is above the particulars that this is true all the time all the way up into the highest goods all right and so let's continue all right so then he said do not run here to this place take your sandals off your feet for the place where you stand is holy ground like i said this is circumcision it is removing of the garments of skin wherever he said i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the oppression of my people who are in egypt and have heard their cry because of their task masters for i know their sorrows so i've come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land to a land flowing with milk and honey to the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel has come to me and i have also seen the oppression with which the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore i will send you to pharaoh that you may bring my people the children of israel out of egypt so there are a few things to understand in this revelation the first thing is that god presents himself as the god of moses's ancestors and this is important because this is what in some ways is happening fractally because you cannot you have to understand the israelites as this this kind of scattered people in egypt that god has forgotten that god doesn't remember that they also don't really remember themselves and you know aren't able to to to come together as a people and exist as these as this potential for the egyptian tyranny and so god is saying he's going to deliver the egyptians out of of egypt but it's important that he also connects himself to the order of being that the israelites have which is he's saying you know i am the god of your ancestors i will you i will gather you back to myself but i will also gather you back to the identity in your father abraham and and your father father's abraham isaac and jacob and so he's he god is going to do that at different levels and it's important to understand because you'll see that israel when they leave egypt they're represented as a as a even not the people that leave aren't actually just the actual descendants of abraham they're they're that plus a gathering of all kinds of people you know they are mixed multitude and that the the let's say the the the the creation of these intermediary structures of the giving of the law that moses will do will bind them together as a nation and will create a hierarchy amongst them even though some of them aren't even actually descendants of of abraham and if they agree to to follow the covenant that god will give them then it will bind them to the identity and so this is important because a lot of people sometimes see that christianity is somehow factitious because there are places where saint paul talks about how you are also children of abraham as christians because you you participate in this covenant but this is something which was there in exodus it's already there in the in the exodus story and so in the version of the christian version it's only let's say expanded even more but it's not new it's not something which just comes out of nowhere but rather finds its place in the exodus story as the manner in which the mixed multitudes are able to cohere towards towards unity and towards participation in israel and becoming becoming children of israel and so god says that he remembers israel and not only that but he sees israel and this is important in understanding the manner in which first of all even how creation was done we have to remember when god creates he creates and then he sees and he sees he evaluates when he sees he he notices the phenomena that he's created and then he evaluates that it's good and in this he's doing the opposite he's seeing that it's bad but he is he is noticing let's say that's really important because a lot of what's going to happen has to do with the problem of attention and noticing and memory and so god remembers israel and so he wants to reconnect with israel but in some ways israel is too scattered israel is too far from god we could say in order to be able to properly connect to moses and so what god has to do is he has to create and all these intermediary structures these mediating structures these veils is a good way to understand it in order for him to be able to connect with them but he also has to remove the improper veils and remove the the the improper aspect of the egyptians in order to be able to join with israel so it has to do with exactly with what we saw in the right away when moses comes to the mountain he has to cover his face but he removes his sandals and so he's removing the improper aspects of the the egyptian covering we could say or the animal covering the the the uncircumcised flesh but then he's also covering it fit his face in order to manifest the proper mediation in order to be in contact with god and so this is something which we'll you'll see if you understand it that way there's a lot of the things that happen that are going to that are going to make sense so god says he's going to bring israel into the land of milk and honey and it's interesting to understand the land of milk and honey and to understand that you know what are those images like what what does this represent and so the land of milk and honey seems to represent something like that that which is tame the the best of what is close that is the the the pure the you know the tame animals that produce milk or the mother that produces milk the idea of something which is also in some ways for for nourishing and then the best of the wild or the best of that which is barely connected and so but then but that is also extremely sweet and that seems to be the honey and so because it's very you know the idea of why honey is kosher in in in the laws it's very it's ambiguous right it's like it's it there are a few of these types of foods which are a little ambiguous and so if you want to understand the best image of the land of milk and honey it really is an image of the diocese and you see in christianity you have this image of christ in the center with the mother of god on his right hand and saint john the foreigner on his left hand and that really seems to be something of what is represented here which is the best of the right hand the best of the left hand the best of that which is close and nourishing and you know and pure you could say and then the best of that which is wild because of course people would gather honey in in the wild they would gather it from they wouldn't they didn't necessarily have honey the way that we have it now that the best of that which is wild and the best of the of the wild prophet in the desert wearing the garments of skin and so you have these two extremes where god is saying this will be the land which is flowing of the best of the two sides of of reality you could say and so that's of course a very interesting part of it so god says he's going to send moses as his envoy right towards the egyptians and he's going to deliver israel by him but then moses comes back to god and says but moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh that i should bring the children of israel out of egypt so he said i will certainly be with you and this shall be assigned to you that i have sent to you when you have brought the people out of egypt you shall serve god on this mountain then moses said indeed when i come to the children of israel and say to them the god of their fathers they sent me to you and they say to me what is his name what shall i say to them and god said to moses i am who i am and he said thus you shall say to the children of israel i am has sent me to you moreover god said to moses thus you shall say to the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has sent me to you this is my name forever this is my memorial to all generations go and gather the elders of israel together and say to them the lord god of your father is the god of abraham of isaac and jacob appear to me saying i've surely visited you and seen what is done to you in egypt and i've said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt to the land of canaanite and the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites to a land flowing with milk and honey then they will heed your voice and you shall come you and the elders of israels to the king of egypt and you shall say to them the lord god of the hebrews has met with us and now please let us go three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god but be sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not even by a mighty hand so i will stretch out my hand and strike egypt with all my wonders which i will do in in its midst and after that he will let you go and i will give this people favor in the sight of the egyptians that it shall be when you go that you shall not go empty-handed but every woman shall ask of her neighbor namely of her who dwells near her house articles of silver articles of gold and clothing and you shall put them on your sons and your daughters so you shall plunder the egyptians so in this text you can really see you know how this connects with what i was talking about before which is that when saint gregor needs to talks about god being being in itself being being that has no other causes you can really understand that in this text god says i am that i am that is i am that which named i'm the only thing that can name itself you could say because it is he is the origin of being he doesn't have anybody anybody else naming him and he all in some ways almost doesn't have a name his name is simply being his name is i am and so you can see that there's a relationship right here because god says tell them i am sent you true being sent you but then he says then tell them that i am the god of your ancestors that is it connects fractally down the levels from true being and being itself to the way in which you recognize yourself to have being that is how do you recognize how does israel have being it has being by sharing a common origin in the patriarchs they have they have this common ancestor and of course it makes sense because this ancestor had a covenant with being had a covenant with god himself and so it all connects together that this is the way in which this is the way in which uh it it works down the hierarchy and so if you look at the if you look at the the text i mean it's it's very interesting and so god says i am being i am the god of your fathers i am the way in which you connect to to your identity i remember you i have seen your scatteredness i've seen your suffering i've seen that which is breaking you apart and now i will gather you back and how will i do that you will come out and you will all come to the mountain together and you will gather together at the mountain and you will worship me at this mountain and and then you you know this is how you will join together this is how all this is going to happen and then i will bring you to a land flowing with milk and honey after that happens after we are able to to after all this connection has been done and you've remembered who you are you're you are remembered brought back together and you receive something from above and now you will be moved out towards the land of milk and honey and so what's interesting is that if you look at the entire text you can really see there's an interesting kind of hierarchy just in in the way in which god presents himself he starts with being and then he ends with the idea that you are going to plunder the egyptians that if you're going to take riches from the egyptians so he starts with being itself moves down to identity talks about gathering the people together and goes all the way towards the edge and says this is also how you're going to take from potential from the stranger you're going to take your possibilities and you're going to gather them together as well and so it's like this whole cosmic image of how being moves all the way down to even into the idea of you know leaving egypt and gathering the gathering all the the strains and this is important like the idea of plundering the egyptians is an image which is very important in in the commentary of secure givenessa but also in other church fathers where they talk about this which is san gregor nisa really represents the egyptian as being all that which is not let's say which is pagan which is secular which is not directly coming from the revelation of god this kind of indirect aspect like i said philosophy science all these other all this other knowledge and saint gregory talks about how you know we are called to plunder the egyptians that is take which is good from this these this outside knowledge and gather it together towards being towards the highest being and that is how it's going to find its true value and so you know the egyptian is a tyrant if the if the egyptian rules over you but if you are subject to god and you're subject to the highest good then the the what the egyptian offered becomes potential for for you and so there's a this is interesting reverse potential if you reverse relationship if you remember in the first chapter the first video i talked about how the tyrant in the egyptian wants to reduce the israelites to being potential for his tyrannical rule well here you see a similar structure but now it's seen as being good that is that which the egyptians offers is gathered together towards a higher purpose not just the tyrant but then all the way up towards serving god serving being itself and this is what saint gregory talks about this is the text this is why the text that i read from you from saint gregory is so important because it shows this this symbolic structure that i've talked about in terms of dante that i've talked about in different guises of how realities exist together all the way up a hierarchy of goods and it's presented very beautifully in this in this statement that god makes so moses isn't sure and this is going to be important to understand moses hesitates of course and he says so then moses answered and said but suppose they do not believe me or listen to my voice suppose they say the lord has not appeared to you so the lord said to him what is in your hand he said a rod and he said cast it on the ground so he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from it then the lord said to moses reach out your hand and take it by the tail and he reached out his hand and caught it and became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has appeared to you so what is going on here is what just happened like it's just a repetition of what just happened it's a repetition of what god said when he said i am that i am and then he says i am the god of your fathers and he moves all the way down and he says you will gather the riches of the egyptians in service of the highest god and so now god is exemplifying it in practice a very simple in a very simple way he's saying he's saying you're holding a rod and this rod is the image of the vertical like you could say it's the image of the mountain it's the image of identity it's the image you know it has the masculine quality and so it's the image of the name right it's that which which is straight it's the it's the right and then he says let go of it and as he lets go of it then it becomes change it becomes a serpent it becomes that which is wavy that which moves from left to right which doesn't have a direct with a direction it becomes something like missing the mark it becomes potential it becomes the the waters and that's why it's also thrown on the ground so it you know he's it's standing up he puts it down on the ground and then it becomes water it becomes shangy and shifty and all those things and then and then he says grab it again right so let's say grasp the potential and then you when he grabs it by the tail then it turns back into it recovers its identity and so this is what god said he said you will you will go to the to the israelites in egypt and you will call them out of egypt and they will come and gather around the mountain of god and then they will become one people they will they will become my people and i will be their god and they'll be this vertical relationship which will be established and so he's showing you how attention works basically right how things gather together in attention and move from potential into identity and this is you know this is something you can experience this is something that you experience all the time you move out into reality that is how you you grasp that is what attention is it's like you there's a quantity of phenomena you grasp it mentally not just physically but you also do it physically as well and that's how you discover the identity you gather it together into one and then when you let go of it then you discover its multiplicity you know and so this is what john ravaki talks about this you know all the time he talks about what he calls optimal grip which is the notion that when we when we hold on to things physically we have to be careful not to grasp them too tightly or too loosely we have to find the optimal way in which we can we can we can hold them and this is true physically but it's also true in terms of categories in terms of identities because identities are made of of multiplicity and unity and so you have to be able to find that balance between the two and here in the text you see the movement from one extreme to the other but in reality this happens sorry to use the word fractal all the time but it happens at every level and it happens subtly in terms of every moment you're constantly judging between letting go and grabbing the serpent you're you're constantly judging between the rod and the serpent between that which is one that which is many that which is stable that which is fluid that which is that which has identity in that which is changing because all of that is part of reality so this is really a very powerful image of what of just how reality works so gregory needs to really he sees it obviously as an image of the incarnation itself as the manner in which god can move into creation and so when when you know the the serpent when moses lets go of the rod then he becomes a serpent and saint gregory goes as far as saying and repeating the words of saint paul which is that christ became sin for us that missing the mark is what christ became and in becoming that then he he it's in some ways returns it to the father and let's say he becomes the snake and the snake which will then be re-gathered up into the rod and that would be of course an image of the resurrection an image of the man which christ gathers all things up into into the father and so that is the that is the the image and so then if you understand that then you can notice that the second image that moses gives so furthermore the lord said to him now put your hand in your bosom and you put his hand in his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous like snow and he said put your hand in your bosom again so he put his hand in his bosom again and drew it out of his bosom and behold it was restored like his other flesh then it will be if they do not believe you or heed the message of the first sign that they may believe the message of this the latter sign so you can notice that now we have the similar image one was a vertical to horizontal right a rod to a snake on the ground now it's the center to the periphery and so he's saying you know bring your hand into your bosom and when you exit it it becomes it becomes disease or it becomes leprous and then when you bring it back then it becomes healed and again san gregory sees this as an image of the incarnation and as the you know it's basically the same image as the snake and the rod there is one possible difference is that there might also be a hint that this in some ways might be the opposite of the other one and that is something that you can ponder on yourself something that i've thought about which is it has to do possibly with an excess of purity we the idea of leprosy in the old testament the idea of your skin becoming white is snow seems to have something to do with an excess of purity and not exactly the same as an excess of the snake but this is something that i'm not 100 sure of but if we take the story of the the the story of of miriam and moses's ethiopian cushite wife that seems to be what's going on is that is that you know he a miriam criticizes moses for having a dark wife and then she becomes as white as snow and so it becomes like it's like a it's like a funny it's not funny but it's like an ironic punishment where she becomes too too light and that two light is actually a is a is a is an excess of purity but you could also probably see it i mean for sure st gregory sees it as the idea of the incarnation and disease right he sees it more in the sense of disease so something healthy moves out into disease and something disease moves back into that which is healthy and so i think that that's also completely appropriate reading of this particular text and so then you will have the last sign verse 9 and it shall be if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice that you shall take water from the river and pour it on the dry land the water which you take from the river will become blood on the dry land and so here of course he is talking about the plagues and you can kind of understand that in some ways he's hinting at the plagues from the beginning the plagues are like a exploded version of what it is that's going on here in terms of the the sign of something untouched turning into blood now as christians it's very important to to understand what is going on here and also understand what at least in the christian story this is going to return now where are the plagues leading to right we're going to see this later when we get to the actual place but the plagues are leading to the final plague which is the death of the firstborn and the changing of water into blood leads to the death of the firstborn ultimately and you can understand it as a kind of saturation of reality as well as moving from let's say that which doesn't have any identity to that which is something like it kind of controlled a control breakdown of identity right that's what wine is it's like the extreme of fermentation and so in some ways it's like a control decomposition so you have purity without any identity then you have wine which is kind of inebriating you also have the milk honey situation here sorry i'm talking about wine already but in in this is it's blood but you can understand where i'm going with this which is that in the story of the winning of kana it's it's referring to the plagues of egypt because the changing of the water into blood leads to the death of the firstborn and now once you understand that you can understand why the strange story of the winning of kana represented represents itself that way which is why is it that why is it that you know when the mother of god says to christ change you know there's no wine there and he knows he's going to change water into wine that it means he's gonna die it's like it's it's leading him to his death this is deeply ingrained in the story of exodus in the story of the plagues but then you know you'll see how the whole idea of the death of the firstborn has a lot more than you think a lot more than you think related to it all right and so then moses said to the lord oh my lord i'm not eloquent neither before nor since you have spoken to your servant but i am slow with speech and slow of tongue so the lord said to him who has made man's mouth or who makes the mute the death the seeing or the blind have not i the lord now therefore go and i will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say but he said oh my lord please send by the hand of whoever else you may send so the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite your brother i know that he can speak well and look he is also coming out to meet you when he sees you he will be glad in his heart that you shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth and i will be with your mouth and with his mouth and i will teach you what you shall do so he shall be your spokesman to the people and he himself shall be as a mouth for you and you shall be to him as god and you shall take this rod in your hand with which you shall do the signs and so i hope by now you can see how this is becoming connected together and so god set up a relationship of the way in which he is being itself and then also the way in which he is the god of the ancestors of moses the god of the ancestors of israel and the way in which israel the place in which israel binds together and so now god is telling moses to go speak to be his spokesman right to be a representative of him and moses said i am not able i cannot speak and so now we're going to start to see god set up the intermediary structure between himself and the world and it's going to start already with aaron now it's important to understand these things are they're they're a little difficult to proceed but once you start to perceive them you'll notice so for example a good example would be in the story of king david the israelites ask for a king and then god is angry and in some ways doesn't want to give them a king but then ultimately relents give them a king but then the king becomes the tool of god in the world the one who builds the temple he becomes the one who builds the house for god and so sometimes we see the text a little too simply and so we say you know kingship is bad because god didn't want israel to have a king but that's not how it works it's that in some ways you could say that that which is below because of its insufficiency requires mediation in order for god to manifest himself in the world and so moses asks for something to mediate and then god is angry but then god ultimately relents and that's the way in which it happened god gives moses it's an extension of himself and so here you really see the fractal relationship getting set up it's pretty clear god says to moses aaron will be your mouth right and then you will be my mouth in some ways and you will be as god to him you will and and i mean it's pretty wild just to that that's written in the text it's like your aaron's god will be you and you and i will be your god obviously not completely but in this context there is this this self-same relationship this fractal relationship going down the manner in which mediation appears and so and so you you can see how even though let's say even you could also get the sense that moses is aaron's heart you know emote and that's why it says like he's glad in his heart when he meets moses because moses is one level lower than god and then he speaks to aaron and then aaron speaks to the people so so moses appears as hidden behind a veil now aaron is his veil that moses is constantly you know hiding himself behind a veil in the sense of god but then also for the people like when he comes down the mountain and puts a veil on his face well god is doing the same to moses now he's saying i'm going to put a veil in your face you know and and thou this out this thing that i'm putting in front of you that will manifest you in the world will be will be aaron and so it's pretty interesting and saint gregory of needs to really gives us a powerful image and this is one like i said one of my favorite this whole part is my one of my favorite aspects of san diego of nisa's commentary because here san diego needs to talks about aaron as the helper and he really presented as the angel and the demon right the angel on the right shoulder and the demon on the left shoulder and so the guide the helper the this this aspect of moses which can either bring him up or bring him down and you can understand it in terms of a supplement in terms of the the idea of mediation or the problem of mediation because mediation always causes a problem which is the problem that saint gregor miser brings up in his text which is that if you create mediating levels between with that which is above and that which is below and those mediating levels are always in danger that people will see them as having being in themselves will it attach to them too much and because of that they will appear as an illusion as a mistake as an error and so aaron is exactly that think about it god says to to moses aaron will be the one doing the signs and manifesting you in the world so he's like one step down on the hierarchy of mediation but then who makes the golden calf aaron makes the golden calf right that's the problem of mediation it's the problem of creating these levels coming down but it's but it's also inevitable and it has to be done appropriately and we could say that all of the book of exodus is about understanding the way in which these mediating levels exist and the ultimate image of that is going to be the tabernacle because the tabernacle that's what the tabernacle is the tabernacle is the manner in which the presence of god is mediated in the world through ritual through space through layers through through veils through sacrifice to offering up receiving down all of this is what the tabernacle is and that's why the tabernacle is an image of reality and that's of course the way that saint gregory presents it in his own text as well all right and so let's continue verse'. so moses went and returned to jethro his father-in-law and said to him please let me go and return to my brethren who are in egypt and see whether they are still alive and jethro said to moses go in peace now the lord said to moses in midian go return to egypt for all the men who sought your life are dead then moses took his wife and his sons and set on a donkey and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you do all the wonders before pharaoh which i've put in your hand but i will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go then you shall say to pharaoh thus says the lord israel is my son my firstborn so i say to you let my son go so that he may serve me but if you refuse to let him go indeed i will kill your son your force born you can see being set up right the idea of the giving of the firstborn and how it is related to how reality works which is that egypt has to let god's firstborn go in order to be made sacred in order to be given up towards god and though he says if he doesn't do that then i will take his firstborn and we're going to talk about this a little later when we get to the actual plagues but this is obviously it's the plagues are being set up in this text and a lot of people really struggle to understand the next part which is coming so i'm not going to go too much in terms of understanding the idea of the giving up of the firstborn and why that's important we'll talk about that when we get to the place because we've already been going for a while now but when we read the next part maybe it'll help you already see hopefully if you've been listening to me for a while you'll start to understand at least what's going on here so the next part is one of the strangest texts in the entire bible and so here it is and it came to pass on the way at the encampment that the lord met him and sought to kill him then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at moses's feet and said surely you are a husband of blood to me so he let him go then she said you are a husband of blood because of the circumcision and so what is happening in this story now there's a few things going on and it's a very ambiguous text the way it's written is ambiguous it means that when even when the way that it's translated it's translated in a way that's trying to kind of guess at what the meaning is because first of all it says and it came to pass on the way of the encampment that the lord met him and sought to kill him and so the question is who is he who is he trying to kill it's not clear whether it's moses or the son of moses and then zapport took a sharp zone and cut off the force universe gun and cast it at moses's feet now again in the text in the hebrew text at least it just says cast it at his feet now it doesn't say whose feet it is whether it's moses or the sun and it's actually possibly not just his feet it might be his genitals because in the text the genitals and the feet in the bible the feet are a euphemism for genitals and you see that in the story of ruth you could say the story of ruth is like the opposite of this in some ways of what's going on here because where it's related to this let's say where the strange woman uncovers the feet of boaz and here you have the strange woman circumcising her son and then putting the the foreskin on the feet of moses now at this point if you it's funny because because saint gregar nissa doesn't go very far into interpreting this he he basically i'll give you his interpretation which is excellent but he doesn't go far but if you see this you can understand why is it that saint gregory makes the analogies between egyptian stranger in general stranger foreskin and sandals and garments of skin where he makes these all related because in the actual text there is a euphemism between the feet and the genitals and so removing the sandals and removing the the foreskin is an is is there in the actual language of the text as being related in terms of what it is that's going on and so the the first important thing to understand is where the text is placed people i've always seen people tend to want to interpret this little sequence as being a self-contained event but we have to see it as following the text before which is israel is my son my firstborn let them you know let my son go so that he may serve me but if you refuse to let him go i will kill your son your firstborn and then you have a text where moses is going back to egypt and his son is not circumcised and now god wants to come and kill someone in the camp either moses or his son and in order to prevent that the zipporah removes the garments of skin around her son around around uh remove the garment skin around her son and then cast it at touches moses's feet with them and so it's like it's very mysterious but it has to do in some ways with the relationship with the stranger which we've been talking about the whole time and this is what saint gregory of nissa says he says he understands of course the son of moses from zipporah as the fruit of our union with all that is pagan all that is secular all that is all the secular signs all these things and so the fruit of that union is moses's son and now in order for things to be proper right in order for for for his son to be given up to god right let my son go so that he may serve me then he has to be purified from the negative aspects of the strange he has to be circumcised all the the negative aspects of the pagan knowledge of of secular knowledge you know all the dangerous captivating aspects of them has to have to be weaned and and have to be let's say cut off in order to be able to present the son of his union with with the stranger as being acceptable to god and so saint gregory uses the example he says you know in philosophers or in greek philosophy they have this idea of the immortality of the soul which is something that that is the right the right way of thinking but you can imagine that the fact that the greeks taught reincarnation or that taught other aspects which were not let's say which were kind of were off key then those things have to be pruned so we can read plato we can get from plato the a an insight and a help even in the language and in the the terminology to help us formulate and understand our christianity but it has to be circumcised you have to remove the excess and the things that don't that don't fit ultimately and so that's one thing that's going on but there's another thing that's going on like in terms of structure folks like it's very fascinating think about it just in terms of the story moses goes up the mountain and then he has to remove his garments of skin in order to enter into the sacred place and now moses is going back to egypt and so his wife removes the foreskin of her son and she she touches his feet with them she she puts them on his feet and so it seems like she's also adding sandals to moses so that he can move out and go back into the strange land that seems to be at least part of what is going on there but like i said it is a very it is a very strange text but i think it's also possible that some of the ambiguity in the text serves the serves the meaning of the text but for sure you cannot interpret this part of the story without understanding that it has to do with sacrificing the firstborn and giving the firstborn up to god which is related to removing the the the the the excess and then giving up to to to god so but it like i said very mysterious so all right and so then we get to the last part and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses so he went and met him on the mountain of god and kissed him so moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which had commanded him then moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel and aaron spoke all the words which god had spoken to moses then he did the signs and the sight of the people so that people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked on their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshiped oh so of course this seems like an obvious thing it's reads very easily but you have to look at it properly and this has something to do with the manner in which multiplicity becomes one the way that i've been telling you guys for years now so there's the hierarchy right moses and aaron go down and then aaron becomes the spoke man for moses he becomes a spokman and then god says i have seen from above i've seen you and now i'm manifesting myself through this hierarchy down to you and what that looks like is the gathering of the children of israel together and the worshiping that which is above and so gathering in order to give attention to that which is that binds us so they listen to aaron they listen to moses and they listen to god and they worship god because that is how let's say that is how multiplicity binds to one through attention to a common good something which is beyond the multiplicity and what that does is it gathers multiplicity into one and ultimately in terms of the transcendent it looks like attention a different level but ultimately it becomes worship and it also means that they bowed their heads right they submit themselves to that which is above and that's how they that's how it all comes together and so this in some ways you could say is an image a little image of what is coming later right because it says aaron met moses at the mountain of god this is the same mountain that that who's they're going to later and then he comes down the mountain and then he gathers the people together and they worship and so it's a little image of what is coming later when they leave egypt and they go out into the wilderness and then it's going to happen at a grander scale and at a more let's say at a larger in a way that will bind them let's say more permanently we could say so that they can actually become a nation but that that also that they can be in a relationship with god through these these mediations so i hope this was helpful like i like i've said you before like i told you before this is a compliment to the videos that i'm doing with that i did with daily wire on exodus make sure you check that out the discussion is very interesting i've been getting some great feedback from people who have watched the the video so i'm excited to see that people are enjoying it it's going to continue and we're also going to do a second part in january recording the second part from the law until the end and i will try to track these as the videos come out with daily wire i'll try to track them with some with some videos on my own so you can get a little more of what i think of the book of exodus so thanks everybody for your attention and i will talk to you very soon
