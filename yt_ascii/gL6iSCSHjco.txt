you're gonna pick a number between one and 10. same with you. if you guys say the
same number, you're out. if you say different numbers, you stay in, and we do the same for ty. if they say the same number, ty gets out. one, two, three. - [ty] two.

he wrote down beforehand. - that's fine. - [jimmy] we're gonna
keep rollercoaster going. all right, ty, you got out. how do you feel? - i feel pretty confident
we're still gonna win. i got faith in my boys. - [jimmy] can you still dance? - oh, i can definitely still dance. - [jimmy] let me see. (upbeat music) - [ty] that impressive, connor? (jimmy laughing) (bouncy upbeat music) - [jimmy] $1,000 for the
next person to step out. i don't care who. none of you guys want $1,000? dustin, you could have
a grand and be done. - that's fine 'cause last time i checked, five is more than a one. - [jimmy] go ahead and send them off, but let this thought
marinate in your head. - all right. - [jimmy] $1,000, boys. final offer, $2,000 if anyone steps out. (dustin groaning) here's the deal though,
if one of you left, you would have more leg room, and you actually might
be able to last longer, instead of being scrunched up. - i like it. - [dustin] all right, i'm doing it. - [jake] are you going? are you doing it? he's doing it. doing it.
- [luke] he's doing it. - [jimmy] $2,000 step out right now. you getting out? - [chandler] welcome.
- [jimmy] all right. (hands clapping) dusty just won $2,000. congrats. - oh, my god, leg room. - [jimmy] so, how do you feel? - mentally, i'm drained. i couldn't go any longer- - [jimmy] so, fans want to
know, do you have eyeballs? - yes. - [jimmy] nice, gotcha. and three people remain on blue. you guys have lost two teammates, but you've gained a lot of leg room. let's see how it does you. - [fan] chris, you want some gum? - oh, yeah, hold up,
when we come back around. this kid's gonna throw me gum. you got to catch it. i got it. yeah! he threw me gum. - thanks for the gum, boys. hey, they love us. hey, let me get another piece. - that gum's really good. oh, whoa. whoa.
- yeah! - he gave the boys gum. - [tareq] hey, we got
a whole pack this time. - hey, jimmy, some kid gave me gum. - i wish i had some playing cards or like a board game or something. - do you want your gum back? - [fan] nah, do you
want beef jerky though? - yeah. - yeah. (chris laughing)
(hands clapping) yes. we put in an order. this time he's getting us jerky. - [tareq] y'all, chris made a
friend on this rollercoaster. - [man] holy. he got a jerky. - [garrett] no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [chris] no, no, no. - [fan] hey, will you sign this? (fans yelling) - [fan] bye! - we started a problem. now, every kid wants to throw us stuff. - [tareq] that's not a good idea. especially being on a rollercoaster. - no. what if we came back
with a xbox this time. (tareq laughing) just, we got an xbox now. (upbeat music) - [jimmy] so, i heard
you guys have a deal. - we want to trade marcus for jake. marcus gets out, jake gets out. - [jimmy] i'll let him
know your negotiation. they offered marcus for jake. - no. - [jimmy] jake said no. he said, screw your offer. keep going. - i look like gangster
mike from "the office." oh, scranton, where you at? - [tareq] garrett, you
are dwight happening. - [garrett] i'm not dwight. - you are dwight. (upbeat music) whoa, chris, what are you doing? - i'm getting out. - chris, no. - [contestant] not this time. - i'm getting out. - [contestant] not this time. - [tareq] chris, what's going on? - i entrust everything
in marcus and garrett. they can do it. - [jimmy] if you get out, your
boys might not carry through with the 20 grand. - [chris] boom. - [jimmy] he's out. it is now a two v two. - game over. - [jimmy] game over? - [garrett] we will win this for you. - i get really motion sick, and that roller coaster
was just tearing me down, tearing me down. i knew i had two solid teammates. i'm gonna just get out,
and you guys got it, and i believe in them they can do it. blue team. - and then there were four. - [employee] all clear. - all clear. - [tareq] how does it
feel to have more space? - it feels like i got a lot of space. - [tareq] aye. (hands clapping) - mom, if you want to know
why i haven't messaged you at all today, i've been here. - whee. - [tareq] oh, put your legs in the cart. - we have lost garrett to the
madness of the rollercoaster. (upbeat music) - [jimmy] let's rock paper scissors. - we're talking it out. we're just talking out
the thought process. - [jimmy] all or nothing,
rock paper scissors. - yes.
- all or nothing. - okay. - [jimmy] white team
wants to settle it all for nothing, rock paper scissors. - ah, let's get it, come on. - all right, let's just game it. - [tareq] why is it- - 20,000 on the line between you guys. the reason we're doing
this is 'cause the park actually closes in under an hour, and they're gonna go all day. so, we literally have no
other way to settle this. do it. rock paper scissors. - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - [jimmy] turn around. - [jake] let's go. - [luke] hey! - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - hey, let's go. - [jimmy] it is now tied. it's tied. - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - [jake] let's get it.
