ladies and gentlemen all that glitters is not gold sometimes the people faking a perfect lifestyle like jinsha of the real housewives really are running a secret crime ring behind the scenes in this town i'm queen bee and mvp a real housewife is now facing federal charges along with her assistant on suspicion of running a nationwide telemarketing fraud and money laundering scheme she's accused in a doj release of conspiracy to commit wire fraud money laundering it is crazy and we're gonna get into all of it today i was up late last night trying to dig into this and figure out what was going on because honestly listen i've learned that what is shown in the press release and what is actually has actually happened or two different things there's a lot that wasn't said and i tried to dig up some of it for you guys to give you the most context for this kind of insane indictment of one of the big celebrities on like reality tv recently guys again a reminder you can't trust these people you can't trust them at all all these influencers and you can stop smiling and being a because you are yeah you are and koa handled this okay this is her behind the scenes hey this is kind of what you get if you're going to talk like a crime boss maybe you're going to go to jail i don't know you don't have a attitude with me [music] this week shut the up okay yeah i'm not too surprised by this anyway let's roll the intro huh ladies and gentlemen welcome to coffeezilla the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host and today of course we're going over these charges like obviously i want to keep you guys informed with what's going on okay now to talk about jennifer's shot we have to start from the beginning she became a real housewife star when it was found that she lived a lavish lifestyle she had a husband that was the coach of a football team and generally she fit the profile of someone who's entertaining bombastic you know seems to have all this wealth who is she no one could figure out what she did she talked about being rich because of direct response marketing and a few other things but she's always vague about where her money came from business side we have a bunch of exciting exciting stuff shaw beauty just launched we have a new like entrepreneur program for women where we're helping women pivot and shift their business through the quarantine and covid she's basically a guru she's basically a fake guru she's like hey i'm gonna help you guys like isn't it funny that all these entrepreneurs who end up getting caught for some kind of front a lot of them were doing some kind of coaching scam too and we have a new product called fixture because of course gen shaw would have a product called that whoa whoa whoa wait did you just create a product called fixture and did you just refer to yourself in the third person i think she deserves to go to jail just for that that's straight up how can you say that listen all in all all these explanations for how she made her money a beauty line direct response marketing some kind of business coaching thing that wasn't how she made her money instead according to this indictment she had a telemarketing scheme where she would call a bunch of old people and try to get them on the hook for a bunch of scam services they say to perpetuate the business opportunity scheme they sold alleged services purporting to make the management of victims businesses more efficient or profitable geez where have we heard that idea before including tax preparation website design services notwithstanding that many victims were elderly and did not own a computer they're selling website design to people who don't own a computer apparently a lot of the people were old very very old as we see a lot of the telemarketing scams that's who they cater to important to this indictment by the way is that at no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment nor did the victims actually earn such returns now that's really interesting because of what we're about to find out because she tried to hide this she wanted the appearance of being like this star on camera living this lavish lifestyle but she didn't want people to know where the money was coming from because clearly it wasn't coming coming from a beauty line it's coming from this scam scheme so how did they hide it well actually ginshaw is one of the more sophisticated fraudsters we've seen see she took significant efforts to conceal their roles in the business opportunity scheme it's her and her assistant by the way who are indicted they incorporated their business entities using third-party names and instructed other participants to do the same and used and directed others to use encrypted messaging apps to communicate with other participants so listen it's not like they didn't know they were committing fraud that's the thing here the fact that you're using a bunch of encrypted messaging apps the fact that you're registering these businesses and third-party names the fact that you're communicating with other participants and instructing them to send your share of certain fraud proceeds to offshore bank accounts hey you know you're committing fraud hey by the way i just found this clip look at how she describes what she does because she calls herself the wizard of oz like behind the curtain that no one knows about knowing now what she did it cast this in such a sinister light salt lake city so how do you live the life you and your husband have such a lavish lifestyle where is all this money coming from so i it's funny because a lot of the ladies are like oh my gosh where does jen get all her money and i think part of it is like here in utah the ladies are like oh my gosh how does the brown girl and the black husband have all this money because that's you know what i mean they're like no don't bring race into it no it's just because no one your businesses aren't public you're rich but you no one knows what you do i am like i own three different marketing companies and what do you do lead generation data monetization so it's customer acquisition yeah i'm basically scammed the best way to describe it is i'm the wizard of oz i'm like the one behind the curtain that nobody knows exists but i'm the one making everything happen wow wow you could play that in court like literally i bet you that will be played in court by the way i'm the person behind the curtain nobody sees me but i'm the one making things happen jeez dude bang the gavel you're guilty all right guys so what can we learn from all of this jinsha yes a lot of people are surprised by this but honestly i'm not look someone pops out of nowhere they're mysteriously making all this cash and no one can find the businesses that they're supposedly making the cash from something's up of course it is somebody's living some lavish lifestyle on instagram and there's no explanation for how they made their money are we surprised when it comes out they're committing fraud typically well to do people like this are under prosecuted and they don't get a lot of jail time so i wouldn't be surprised to see her get out on like six months it's sad but true i mean we just don't care when it's a rich person committing fraud when it's a poor person robbing from a store five bucks hey you might be going to the slammer for a while but when it's a rich per person defrauding old people well what's the harm i don't know it's kind of like a sad reality of the modern criminal system white collar crime is horribly under sentenced so anyway that's basically it thanks for watching don't forget to pump the stock and i'll see you guys tomorrow i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to tell me on a dream but that was where you lost wake up and me the coffee
