28 separate radio and microwave radiation emitting and receiving devices operate within its airframe each critical to every element of this aircraft's operation this is the story of how an obscure observation made during the 1980s led to a breakthrough an observation born out of the centuries-old curiosity for the mathematically absurd that not permits the complex fusion of technologies that form this aircraft to even exist our story starts in africa over the village of la bazanga in mali in 1988 dr ron aglash a pioneer in the study of the relationship between math and culture made a striking observation of this village and other similar traditional african settlements geometric repetition this theme was not limited to architecture these recursive patterns would echo throughout much of african design and knowledge systems these patterns would also appear within the artwork of other cultures as well as in nature with no obvious rules determining their form in the age of enlightenment the prominent mathematician and natural philosopher gottfried wilhelm von liebnitz would usher self-similarity into the world of mathematics with his ideas on recursive self-similarity leibniz conceptualized an object that exhibited a shape that looks exactly like a part of itself this characteristic was so strange that he proposed it could only be found in the geometry of a simple straight line it would take almost two centuries of the world of mathematics falling deeper into abstraction removing itself even further from intuition for leibniz's oddity to resurface in the summer of'72 german mathematician carl weistross presented a unique mathematical function to the royal prussian academy of sciences y struss's function exhibited behavior similar to that proposed by leibniz in that it was self-similar when graphed what made wirestross's function so troubling was that it operated on real numbers yet produced a result that had the non-intuitive property of being everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable just imagining the implications of this was a demanding task at the time it would take the arrival of computers a century later to even make visualizing his function possible [music] once again self-similarity was categorized as pathological it was deviant and counter-intuitive the french mathematician famously described why strass's work as an outrage against common sense a decade later set theory pioneer george cantor would introduce the cantor set cantor's set abstractly describes a set of points lying on a single line segment in its most common representation called a canter teneri set a construct is built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments as we progress deeper down the set the properties of self-similarity once again emerge towards the end of the 19th century self-similarity would appear across the works of other notable mathematicians it could no longer be ignored by mathematics in 1904 swedish mathematician niels fabian helga published a paper expressing dissatisfaction with wire strasses work he criticized its analytical expression for masking the true nature of self-similarity reasoned that approaching the concept from a geometrical point of view would allow these non-differentiable functions to in fact exist when caught aimed to express a link between these monsters of analysis and geometry in his paper cope presented a curve that can be built up iteratively in a sequence of stages the first stage is an equilateral triangle each successive stage is formed by removing the inner third of each side and building another equilateral triangle at the location where the side was removed this process is then repeated indefinitely called close snowflake this peculiar geometric structure would always possess an area eighth fifths that of the original triangle no matter the iteration while its perimeter grows without bound in effect coast of snowflake enclosed a finite area but had an infinite perimeter over the next half century self-similarity began to show up in greater frequency in mathematics as new methods of exploring curves emerged in 1915 polish mathematician or claus sipinski would introduce his famous triangle construct known as the sierpinski triangle it was loosely similar to a centuries-old decorative pattern composed of an equilateral triangle subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles a few years later two french mathematicians gaston julia and pierre fatou would simultaneously discover self-similarity in the behavior of how complex numbers and iterative functions converge self-similarity began appearing across all of mathematics but this was just the tip of the iceberg of something entirely new in an attempt to formalize these new constructs german mathematician felix hausdorff introduced the concept of a fractional dimension the strange idea was developed to deal with the infinite nature of the length of these curves it was described as a method for defining an object that was too detailed to be one-dimensional but too simple to be two-dimensional hausdorff's fractional dimension is an abstract concept that effectively quantifies the complexity of a self-similar curve as a ratio of its change in detail as it changes in scale it bridged the gap of visualization by offering a measure that corresponded quite closely to our intuitive notion of roughness after centuries of mathematical development and battling with the challenges of perceiving the ramifications of self-similarity within the bounds of human imagination the advent of the computer would open up an entire undiscovered world to mathematics in 1967 mathematician benoit mandelbrot a researcher at ibm's thomas j watson research center wrote a landmark essay called how long is the coast of britain statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension in it he linked the works of self-similarity of previous mathematicians to the real world he declared that self-similarity methods are a potent tool in the study of chance phenomena including geostatistics as well as economics and physics empowered with the aid of computers mandelbrot returned to the work of julia and fatou for the first time it was now possible to see what these sets looked like in their limits in 1975 mandelbrot coined the word fractal and illustrated his mathematical definition with striking computer constructed visualizations from this he created the widely recognized mandelbrot set the quintessential fractal he not only invented the discipline of fractal geometry but had also popularized it through its applications to other areas of science fractal geometry could be applied to represent natural phenomena items like coastlines the shape of mountains and river basins the structures of plants blood vessels and lungs the clustering of galaxies structures that could not easily be represented using traditional euclidean geometry fractal geometry would soon tie in with chaos theory forming important connections to physics medicine and even the study of population dynamics and other natural organizational structures the power of computing pushed the understanding of fractal mathematics beyond anything seen before and in the world beyond mathematics it would simultaneously ignite a massive paradigm shift in how we process use and transport information the world was now entering the information age over the next decade rapid advancements in computing and its synergistic pull on the semiconductor industry would usher in changes in the medium of how we communicate with the wireless revolution advances in radio frequency and microwave engineering would bring on the proliferation of commercial technologies such as mobile telephony wireless computer networks cellular networks and satellite communications within the defense industry the tenet of network-centric warfare would evolve from these advances sophisticated networked satellite communication systems that shuttle both tactical and strategic data between assets and command structures would be pioneered during the 1990s these advances in radio and microwave technology would also migrate to the sensors used in weapon systems particularly in military aviation by the turn of the century these advances would culminate into the first practical global unmanned aerial vehicle systems among the complexity contained within these technologies lies a common critical component that has existed since the early days of experimenting with radio waves the antenna for decades antenna design was relatively simple radio communications tend to use antennas made from a singular linear conductor or a pair of conductors each of which are about a quarter of the wavelength of the design frequency these relatively simple designs also had a narrow bandwidth losing directivity or gain as they operated away from its design frequency furthermore antennas that are required to be small compared to their design wavelength sacrifice efficiency and are limited in directivity as radio technology progressed especially in portable use a greater demand was placed on antenna design efforts to develop antennas that were both low profile and wideband were ongoing from this a category of designs known as frequency independent antennas were developed during the 1950s pioneered by english electrical engineer victor h rumsey these radiating structures were capable of maintaining consistent pattern characteristics over multiple bandwidths their operating frequency range is only limited by their size and the finite precision of their center region one of the most recognized examples of frequency independent antennas were the log periodic antenna found on countless rooftops its multiple element structure allowed it to cover the wide bands of television broadcasts other examples included the spiral antennas which were used in military aircraft for radio direction finding what made frequency independent antennas so astonishing was the nature of the structure that made them so effective they could retain the same shape under certain types of scaling they possessed some of the properties of self-similarity in 1988 physicist nathan cohen realized that the general concepts of fractals could be applied to develop antenna elements and arrays that allowed for physically small multi-band and broadband antenna systems that could be easily optimized for gain the power of cohen's fractal antenna concept lies within its recursive self-similarity each iteration of the fractal pattern possesses a resonance allowing for a frequency operation from the largest iteration down to the smallest that can exist on the design this concept can also be implemented in an array similar to a log periodic antenna because of the fractal nature of these shapes designs that are far more compact than traditional antennas could be implemented cohen would go on to co-found fractal antenna systems in 1995 where he continued his research into applications of both fractal antennas and fractal meta materials his research had led to the development of fractal electrodynamics this new field examined the properties of fractal antennas arrays and apertures and how electromagnetic waves scattered from fractal surfaces fractal antennas would find some success in commercial products mobile device automotive electronics and cellular infrastructure equipment manufacturers would all experiment with the technology however its most successful use case to date has been its role in military aviation wideband antennas are used heavily for defensive purposes known as counter-camouflage concealment and deception they're found in radar threat detection jamming and electronic warfare systems they're also a key element of the design of advanced radar systems forming a critical part of synthetic aperture radar and ground-moving target indicators in unmanned aerial vehicles they're key to the complex data links required for their remote operation not only does fractal antenna technology suit the performance requirements of these systems but their compact and versatile nature even allows for antennas to be embedded into the airframe structure this becomes especially important with stealth aircraft that require clean surfaces to maintain a low radar cross section as we move further into an even more connected future this emergent field barely out of its infancy will play a key role in pushing the boundaries of wireless communications and how we sense the world around us and behind it a convergence of centuries of abstract ideas and a revolution that would not only bring the abstract into reality but exploit it to the benefit of decades of advancement to come [music] thanks again to nordvpn for sponsoring today's video please check
