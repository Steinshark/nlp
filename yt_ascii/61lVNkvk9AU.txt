here we go junior devs 2010 fresh out of high school and they say you can make a lot of money as a software developer so clearly i have to jump on the bandwagon those intensive pascal classes will surely come in handy now my first compiler i ever built was a micro pascal let's go this is great this is fantastic micro pascal compiler let's go you know i built it translating it into microsoft il intermediate language this is before llvm and they didn't have a concept of a closure back then right closers just like you couldn't do that so you could so in pascal you could do a function inside of a function but in c sharp in all these languages you couldn't do that you couldn't just raw dog a function in so il couldn't express that so i had to do this like weird compiling technique where we would actually capture every variable and we'd have to capture it in the proper order so our functions would get this really long signature underneath the hood in the actual like intermediate language where we'd pipe everything in so yes i did do c sharp at one point but this is a long time ago okay and yes i know the title says 15 years of development but the one who had never embellished their linkedin profile should throw the first stone anyhow it looks like nobody i have not embellished my linkedin profile therefore someone hand me us down i am ready to toss me some stones right now everybody knows what pascal is but i found this site called 99 designs where i can do design work and the pay is really good forget coding i'm just going to learn photoshop and illustrator and that should be set for life with a design geek right nope scratch that apparently all these clients are willing to pay me way more if i'll do the implementation for those designs as well okay so i learned to connect to a database via php this is really funny my non-school life this was my first thing right here this was my first baby right here right here right around the same time frame as this guy and perform some basic operations i need to update my resume now i'm also using this stupid is the language to write code when the users interact with my web page it seems fairly easy so i guess i'm an expert in this as well like i remember my first javascript because i came out of school i went deep into inheritance it's where i learned my love of not object oriented programming really was right around that time is where i learned to not love it however php my admin days good days feels good i'm an amazing programmer however some of my friends are building really cool stuff in this programming language called java and they laugh at me when i mention php i should look into this it looks like they were right there is more to programming than what i'm doing i should probably take this more seriously and look for a proper java internship program okay now that i found one for whatever reason i can call myself a junior software developer but i get the feeling that this is a step backwards since my pay is half the amount i used to get as a freelancer my head hurts there are so many data structures i need to know opds and you know i don't think data structures are hard to learn you got to think of it like what you know like when you walk a path like when you walk a hiking trail or something like that you can remember all these places along the way but it's not like you have to re it's not like you really memorize it right like the the act of walking you memorize in kind of this unique way is the same thing with programming long as you can be like a talented enough programmer if you just know the steps everything else just kind of flows right out of it it's pretty straightforward to be able to do things right like i've talked to so many people i was recently just talking with somebody they choked completely on their interview and they're like hey can i send you this interview question because i feel like it was like a really tricky question i feel like it was really really hard can i send it over to you so they sent it over to me and within reading the first two lines i could solve in about 16 seconds it was an extremely simple programming problem but that's just because i've walked this path 9 000 times right so breadth first search you know i will never forget how to do breath first search i'll never forget how to do depth first search i won't forget how to do these kind of traversals because they're very very simple once you have a proper look at it after that it becomes really like if you don't have that it's like impossible it feels incredibly hard but once you have it it's like incredibly simple it's crazy how depending on what size you're on the problems either like deafening like definitely difficult or just absurdly simple will be dead and how the hell could you write a 400 page book just about java threads looking back i was really terrible at php so i should probably remove that from my resume i guess there is more to my sequel than the basic select i used to do so i can't be more than a beginner here and i know for certain i have no idea what javascript is this front-end guys are working with frameworks like angular and i have no clue what that is i think i'm getting so this description he just did there is very very interesting honestly what he just said is actually super super interesting and very very insightful there's something did you recognize that his ability to gauge how good he was at a language depended on his knowledge of a framework and i know this this might be like a troll video i don't know if there's a troll video or whatever but it's actually like how most people are when you try to hire someone for javascript you're not hiring them because they're great at javascript a lot of times what you're hiring them for is because they know a library right like it's very very hard to find someone that's good at javascript you can find someone that's good at react you can find someone that's great at view but it's hard to find someone that's good at javascript and what it makes you realize is that most people's experiences aren't building something with the language they're using a bunch of pieces to hobble together something that you can actually like put together and it's it's it's really strange which makes me also realize that i had one of the most fortunate programming beginner experiences because my beginner javascript was right before jquery hit the scene so when mr jake weary decided to make a jquery i already was pretty familiar with javascript and building applications so i had to build the whole thing myself and then jake query came around right and then i was like oh wow like look at how i can compose these things this is fantastic i totally get this and it just totally changes your perspective on things because as these frameworks came out i had way different understanding right i had to go from nothing to something versus starting at something and just learning how to use it and i feel really bad for a lot of beginners because they never realize that they're bad at programming they don't even know it because they don't have any reason to think they're bad at programming because they're only in this perpetual forever highly frameworked life it's just like you know like you go on the server you just simply put a file in a path boom that's a path how the hell do you think pathing works it's really not hard how pathing works but if you have no idea you're just gonna it's gonna be like it's gonna be like completely magic to you then you're gonna go there and you're gonna take this and you're going to write out some react and somehow that  goes from there to the inside the browser and then it gets hydrated and you just know okay so here and you just like know how to use these little little pieces here and there and you don't actually know how anything works you don't know how to build it like you could like so many people couldn't just build a simple application to generate text on a on a server based on say file path and then put that over here on the client and then how to call back and forth why are you describing me i'm sorry i think it's very very good that these things exist but i also think it's very very troubling for those that don't know how to program because they never actually take the fundamentals and this is one reason why i think college is fantastic i think college is fantastic because the point of college is to teach you programming it's to teach you computer science it's not to teach you about react it's not to teach you how to be a good javascript software developer it's not good at trying to teach you how to be useful the moment you step out the door that's what a boot camp's for what it's there to do is that when you walk out the door and someone says here is react you go oh okay yeah okay yeah okay i understand these things okay so how do i use it oh i gotta go look up some documentation yeah i get this look at me go this is easy because i understand what's happening underneath the hood oh yeah i've had a graphics class i understand that you don't want to be putting on and off things in graphics and i've had this oh yeah i built a compiler i can tell that by doing doing a dot dot dot underneath the hood it's doing some sort of mem copy or some sort of linear operation oh yeah when it's doing this i understand what's happening over here like you get it because you took a different route and yes you weren't as productive the moment you came out i get that but you were 10 times more useful within a year than anyone that simply just went through a boot camp and so that's why i love that right that's why i love college now why do i hate college it's four years long and it's not very practical when you come out and it's very very difficult for someone to be like i'm gonna take four years off to go do this thing right especially later in life people like that's very very hard right pretty good at this java thing though i finally got the hang of the basics and i built some pretty interesting apps using servlets and jsps also i spent some time looking into angularjs and i'm pretty confident i know my way around it it's time for a resume update and javascript is back all right hold on someone's telling me to mark this you know i'm gonna get passionate about that okay java 8 is out and everything i know is useless this is the first time i'm hearing about functional programming why would you need such nonsense anyhow is that a was that a typical functional programmer that i just saw you know i could tell that wasn't a typical functional program right here you can tell right away why how can you tell this this person has no idea what functional programming is it's not a tie-dye t-shirt okay once they wear a tie-dye t-shirt you know that they understand functional programming okay zebra okay this person clearly is into some sort of like kind of more hip language like javascript definitely not programming java no definitely not programming c or c plus plus definitely not okay c c plus plus like a suit or or like a dirty old t-shirt from a conference okay anyhow i suck at this new java now in other news all my front-end colleagues are switching to this new library called react exciting stuff angularjs was indeed fairly limited but i'm sure we'll all stick with react from now on i'm spending a lot of time really learning about javascript's prototype oh her fingers are driving me mad people learn how to type scopes and good parts it looks like functional programming is not that bad and i'm confident enough to call myself a full stack developer now after more than six years a new version of javascript is out and i'm believing the java 8 release nightmare in other words i embed at the javascript again oh and vue.js was really okay so i can't tell if this is like tongue-in-cheek or if this person's being dead serious i do want to make one more point which is that if this is a dead serious take what i see here is that it seems like someone who does not build things in their spare time ever that's what it looks like right because as javascript makes these relatively small changes over time it's not like you should be like i suck at javascript again i have no idea how to use it it's like no there's just some moderate niceness right at least and people say it's the next best thing i guess this is yet another library i don't know and i'll have to learn if on the front then things are bad on the back end they are just plain terrible spring boot was released and everybody is building microservices now yet another thing i'll have to learn yet another downgrade on my linkedin profile wait spring boot 2015. that's real it'll never end of course the angular team just released a completely new framework and the jso world is a mess and they keep changing their minds about what the best practices are you know what is javascript is categorically the worst place to get best practices you know i'm gonna piss off a lot of people with this next take so buckle up get ready okay hey just i mean i want you to i want you to get ready how many people are here hey all of you 1776 get ready javascript thought leaders push functional programming in a language that sucks at functional programming to space indenting they don't know what function most of them don't even know what functional programming is just because you put everything in a function doesn't really mean you're a functional programmer two space indenting was a mistake a lot of spreading a lot of copying immutable js is also a mistake figure it out stop it stop it stop it shout out john who it's just safer to say i know some front-end stuff but i'm not excelling at anything at least my long-term relationship with java is stronger than ever i finally got the time to look into kotlin and the conclusion is java is the worst possible language ever invented it is a waste of my time and it will never be able to compete with kotlin you can't call yourself a modern programming language when you release new versions once in a blue moon and guess what i hope he sucks so i don't want to hear anything about java ever again spring plus cutting is the best way to build rest apis from now on also kotlin can be used to develop android native apps and it's all about apps these days the number of tools i'm expected to know increases by today apparently i need to know to write a jenkins pipeline and deploy my spring back-end via dockers in the cloud there are so many things the dockers in the cloud now i feel like a fraud this is true though tool overload has has really launched pretty hard recently to be effective i think one of the problems in our modern like development world is to be useful at this point you have to know so many things or you work in such a sandboxed magical environment that it's completely just crazy and so you know you see a lot you see a lot of people a lot of thought leaders coming in again telling you here's all these things you want to use and you just have like no idea what you're just like you just glue things together all the time it just seems seems rough seems rough these days i should remove the full stick pot i really love that i make tools for devs because it's a lot less gluing and it's a lot more just like massaging i like massaging more than gluing real talk from my title well i was wrong about java they recently moved to a twice a year release schedule and they are really achieving some interesting things and i hope i have the time to stay up to date with it moving forward on the front-end side i finally decided to stick with react it has a great adoption rate and boom did you just see that boom boom this just captured so many great thoughts what's the difference between this picture i hope i have the time to stay up to date with it moving forward and on the front-end side i finally decided to stick with react that picture javascript the language is gone for a library or framework written in javascript i don't know if it's a framework or library if you say framework in front of the right person he gets very very angry again proves the point proves it it has a great adoption rate and a huge number of third-party tools i can use great stuff it's like i forgot the last couple of years when i spent days configuring react stacks and trying to make libraries work together okay i'm nine years into this and i believe i got the hang of it react on the front end spring and kotlin microservices on the back end all in aws using dockers let's go dockers i am using negligence for most of the front-end work and some of the back end work as well these days on the back end there are more tools i need to learn but i can't complain things are pretty easy let's hope it will stay like this yep it's 2014 all over again and the monolith is back i guess i'll start rewriting the tens of micro services i have written and deployed all over the cloud the only positive thing is that i can now remove redis and rabbit mq from the stack since i never really got the chance to properly understand them also i'm finding out the tools such as dino make it really easy to write and deploy rest apis directly to the edge more cloud providers are offering it the edge the final frontier of having a difficult time all right which function support and back into the service solutions are powerful and cheap these days so i know for certain that my efforts to study and stay on top of the backend development for the last 10 years were pretty useless don't get me started with the front end it looks like react is beginning to lose market share to some of these newer libraries which are basically changing everything we know about front end so i expect all my knowledge will be deprecated here soon as well these guys keep moving the finish line in the famous words of ruth from ozark i don't know it looks like i'll never become the developer i expected so maybe i should just become a youtuber instead what a great video what a great video right there honestly what a great video and why i say that is that this i feel like this just perfectly sums up the ecosystem right and now obviously this doesn't represent every ecosystem this just represents only really web focused stuff there's still plenty of much more stable much more normal systems out there if you know like this whole embedded world not nearly as crazy as the there's not just a new framework every few days oh no i really like this video i really feel like it captured a beautiful thing which is this perpetually always feeling like you never understand anything because every few weeks something new comes out and everyone is claiming it is the greatest thing ever i don't know i still always go back to the exact same thing i always go back to this as like this is what i consider the pinnacle of good website right here frontendmasters.com it comes in it loads quick it's fast it's smooth you browse the courses like that's fast as a full page reload right there it's just fast okay it's just simply fast and so why why don't look at this the last algorithms course you'll ever need and it's free forever for anybody who ever wants it and you only need an email yeah you're welcome but real talk like when you see like when i see this i go wow they really did a good job right because when i when i go in here and i jump over here and let's let's whoopsies i put you down there let's go over here i somehow got you on the wrong side that's fine oh dang it i'm in firefox i don't know how to use firefox i i honestly don't all right everyone shield your eyes all right shield your eyes now all right we're gonna go in here we're gonna zoom it out a little bit we're gonna go to the network and we're gonna disable cache when i refresh this look at this less than a second it's at five look at that that's look at it that's not even oh my goodness i missed it i just put on alerts i did it here hold on look at this not even 600 milliseconds right that seems really good right that seems incredible right it's like blazingly fast the back end is in go the front end has no framework it is a hand rolled framework to be the best possible for their website just saying that's really impressedness that's really that's really impressive so i always look at this as like being super impressive this is what i would consider the pinnacle of like the best it gets because nothing on the on the net loads like this nothing loads like this this thing is like fast and it actually feels good to use it's the best a man can get for sure better than netflix hands down netflix is at just a just a turd compared to this thing is incredible and i'm not trying to i'm not trying to be mean to netflix it's just that netflix will never be as good as this netflix will never be as good as this because netflix just fundamentally will always be using a lot of stuff it's just a lot longer that just happened right there that's just a lot longer you know what i mean ugh all right the name is the primogen
