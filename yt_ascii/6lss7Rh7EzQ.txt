hello everyone and welcome it is finally happening we are supercharging the s2000 and by we we have here the humble mechanical.com.com charles thanks for joining me thanks for having me i'm excited he sounds very thrilled to be here yes so we're going to be putting a science of speed kit on a s2000 it's a stage one kit should be good for about 100 horsepower 6 psi boost any thoughts charles before we get started looks pretty straightforward i'm not gonna say too much more until we're done so i don't jinx it but let's hope everything goes well but either way i guarantee you will get what you pay for with this video right on that you will get absolutely what you paid for for this video so let's get right to it okay so first things first we're going to talk about what tools you need i'm going to list them all on the screen most of them are pretty basic there aren't too many specialty tools you'll need the one being the crank pulley holder which i don't have so we're going to find that so we'll get that during the week yes a 35 millimeter hole saw a torque wrench that can go down pretty low i think seven foot pounds is the lowest torque so something that can go decently low and then the higher one is like 58 or 60 so pretty normal range something you can cut hose with you're also going to need a four and an eight millimeter allen as well as a three and a five sixteenths to remove some parts that i don't know what they are so overall pretty basic stuff and again links in the description now before we get started with the installation there's a few prep items we need to address so we're going to disconnect the battery we're going to remove the fuel fill cap we're going to remove and inspect the spark plugs honestly this is just a great time to replace the spark plugs if you haven't done that in a while again i will list the spark plugs needed in the video description and science of speed recommends adjusting the plug gap depending on how much power you're adding so if you're adding 100 horsepower like this kit we're going to be reducing the spark plug gap by .008 inches okay so first step on the front of the car we're removing a few things charles what do you got there got the air box here this is obviously going to get replaced with a little bit more superchargery style design so more noise more less bulkiness less bulkiness so remove some of the stuff in the front pretty basic overall the challenge there was the crank bolt that we had to remove to get the pulley off right that's torqued to 260 something newton meters so it's a it's it's pretty tight 192 feet we broke a breaker bar it was a 3 8 breaker bar but it was in my garage we used it then we went and bought another half inch we are on one trip to home depot motorsports and one trip to the parts store something else that i think is important to do while you're going this far and before you bury all this stuff up with supercharger components is to do a quick check of the pulleys listen for any noise these actually the tensioner pulley and the idler pulley or the relay roller they both spin freely for a long period of time which means a lot of the grease has leaked out and so we're gonna get i say it's sufficient but charles says it's not the way it's supposed to be so we're gonna replace them the amount of horsepower you might gain well let's put it this way it drives the water pump too it looks like so we don't want to horse around with that stuff horse around good so we're gonna show you the method that we ended up getting the crank bolt off with okay so this is the tool that you're gonna need which you can get at pretty much any part store this is just a honda crank pulley tool and we stick this on there like so and the way that charles and i did it is we have this basically resting up on the shock tower so we put a bunch of padding over it and then we have it resting like that between those two nuts there so it's on a bunch of padding held in place using that shock tower so this is going to be our resistance that we're pushing up against and then charles go ahead and show what you did so that's basically the counter hole tool then we'll take the socket that goes on the nut that goes in there and then using this with a cheater bar which just extends this out this is just the jack handle from my harbor freight jack all right let me stuck it on there yeah and then charles just pushes that forward and that is resisting against this cracks it loose and off it goes yes it's a real man does it oh all right it is day two charles get in here so today we had to do some parts ordering a little bit of a panic moment because the first dealership said five days and charles isn't here for five days that is true so we need a new crank bolt because we ruined this one so that will arrive tomorrow and so because of that today we're doing some smaller tasks and we'll get right into them charles how you feeling about today i'm feeling really good about today despite running into a parts issue which is actually not that surprising i would have been more surprised if we ran into no parts issues one of the other things about doing bigger jobs like this is there's other things that you always want to check like those rollers that we found that we really do want to address not only do you not want to neglect something maintenance related like the oil change or coolant service that we're doing but if you find something that's even marginally questionable adding this extra stress through cash at it just keep throwing cash at it the phrase while you're in there has cost me thousands of dollars recently that's basically what happened today but but the flip side of that is think of what what would happen if you maybe didn't do that or you know it's it's really easy now two bolts for a tensioner now versus pulling all that stuff back off in order to do some of these parts that do you know they're not maintenance necessarily parts but they do have kind of a limited service life so good so let's get into it what are we doing today so the first thing we did was remove the bumper pretty simple to do there's several bolts up on top a few on the bottom on the sides in the fender and then there's one inside here up towards the top and then there's some clips to pull it off near the fender the lovely charles has just rolled in right here is where it clips into this this retaining bracket and it's actually pretty easy to get off of here just pulling it down a little bit and we used a trim tool to release the clip here pull the bumper away and then kind of walk the bumper cover off of the car shimmy on out of there shimmy on out the reason we did that was to install this electric coolant pump as well as the heat exchanger for the charge cooler both of which were pretty easy install and we'll wait till we have everything back together and all dialed in to look for coolant leaks or anything before we put the bumper cover back on yep so air to water intercooler we've got the water portion up front so it'll cool the water which is then fed to a charge cooler which the air passes through before going into the intake manifold so it's nice and cool and happy and lots of power and lots of cool and super cool cool next we installed the fuel vtec map controller and so there's a couple panels that you need to remove to get to it the first one here on the door sill is pretty simple just pops right out and then this one the only really tricky part is there's a little plastic retainer down in here that you have to fold up this rubber flap to get out but once that's pulled off you can use the hood release latch pull that out and you can access the ecu so there's a couple wire plugs you're pulling out of the ecu installing the new harness that comes with the kit plugging that all in and then mounting the vtec map controller on the side of the ecu jason jason don't forget that wire we ran for the coolant pump and yeah we also ran a wire from the coolant pump down into here so that it could have some power this is our electric coolant pump that we installed it also has a bracket and a small retainer with it and of course power coming from inside the car and the ground connection right here we also had to drill two holes to run these coolant hoses through this i guess radiator shroud here or belt skirt whatever you prefer to call it we still have the top one to do that one's going to go up to the charge cooler as well as the back side of this water pump that'll go to the other side of the charge cooler to make more better coolant flow it also came with some grommets which was nice so that you didn't just drill a hole so pretty cool they included those big up on the grommets i'm into that and a pretty neat mounting for the heat exchanger did you have to move the dryer at all oh yeah i did they actually supply two small spacers to pull that receiver dryer away from the condenser a little bit to allow room for that heat exchanger so definitely a lot of small touches came in with this kit that i really really like that i've experienced a lot of other companies don't don't account for so big up to science of speed for being thorough in their development okay so while we had additional time today we also lifted up the car and went ahead and drained the fluids there is some hose cutting that we needed to do so we went ahead and just drained the radiator entirely it's not required but might as well just change the coolant while we're in there and also drain the oil put a new fitting on the oil pan and then we're going to have an oil return line for the supercharger and here's charles you said well we're in there that's all i came to say so over on this side we have the high performance stage five fuel pressure regulator replaces the oem one also ran two new fuel lines into and out of this regulator in addition to that a vacuum line from the intake manifold pretty easy setup took a couple of brackets off installed the regulator in its bracket and then put them back on and you were also messing with the fuel rail yep yeah i went ahead and took the fuel rail up we're going to install some new fuel injectors there's also a new fitting banjo fitting that goes on top of the rail that takes the place of the oe fuel pressure regulator so we'll drop some new injectors in tomorrow when we get them and reinstall all of this and keep moving forward on the engine and we took a peek at the valves while we were at it i mean the the fuel injectors are out so looked inside and they actually were surprisingly clean i thought they looked great so yeah i you know there is some corro a little bit of carbon nonsense where the where the injectors are but probably doesn't impact performance in any way the valves look pretty good so happy carbon nonsense is the official term that's what all the manufacturers are trying to avoid these days it's carbon nonsense all right so day three we started off the parts did arrive so we got our crank bolt in it turns out jason is strong enough for 192 foot pounds of torque which we rented from a part store pretty much any part store will rent you one for free i didn't have one because that's a high torque number i feel like charles says it's not that high for him he's really strong oh it's high but yeah what else did you do in there charles while we were in there the statement that cost all of us so much money we went ahead and put on a new serpentine belt tensioner as well as an idler roller they were a bit worn out and now we have buried all of this stuff with supercharger goodness so it was a great time to go ahead and put all that stuff on new as well as a new serpentine belt yeah not only did those pulleys just kind of spin indefinitely which i claim is super efficient and i'm standing by that but they did kind of wobble back and forth a bit so it they weren't yeah i agree with charles's logic in replacing them it was only a matter of time before failure hondas don't fail charles okay so next we worked on assembling the supercharger so this was done outside of the car there's six little bolts that hold together basically how it's clocked so you can change the orientation of it in order to get it mounted inside here there's also an oil feed and return plug that you switch around and then a bracket a big nice metal plate which you're bolting it down to and then we bring it over to the car there's a little v-tech bracket right here so you take the v-tech solenoid off and mount it up to the engine and then charles man before we put this on he was like hey let's talk about pulleys again and i'm like charles enough about the pulleys but i do love i do love some pulleys this is actually an issue that we ran into with the pulley that came with the kit and i don't think it's because of the kit i think it's just kind of a weird anomaly they probably just ship the day code just had the wrong part in the box bingo there's a small insert inside of the center of this pulley that is actually a little bit wider than the insert that we used for the kit so this shouldn't be inside of the middle of this pulley so we had to run to the store and pick up another pulley good thing it was only like 20 bucks or whatever yeah so a minus another 20 charles while you're in there jason 20 bucks is 20 bucks man so and actually very easy to install very easy to assemble a little bit of massaging to get it to fit exactly the way we were looking for including clocking the front side of the of the supercharger but and charles also had a clever idea about putting some weather stripping you want to just chat real quickly about that yeah one one thing we were looking at is as the engine moves up and down with with torque we didn't want the supercharger banging off the front crossmember so while those weather strippings won't prevent it from banging on the front cross member at least there's some kind of protection so we don't risk damaging either the crossmember or the supercharger housing so we just picked up some pretty inexpensive weatherstripping or it's actually like door edge guard i think and installed it there on the on the weld the pinch weld so it looks cool yeah it actually looks pretty good and there is a little bit of clearance between the two but just to kind of be on the safe side not have metal to metal contact ruining this thing so i think it was a solid idea and that actually worked out really well because the supercharger is kind of a universal application it can fit in many different orientations we needed to move a couple of the plugs around to get the oil feed line in the right spot what that meant was removing one plug from the bottom side and installing it on the top and then swapping the things around and of course what would a project be like this without a little bit of drama of bolt breaking so yes i broke the bolt that plugs up one of the oil lines in the supercharger luckily it was a pretty universal thread i think 3 8 thread so very easy to find at our local hardware motorsports store and thankfully it it went real well it was interesting though that bolt broke before the crush washer crashed and yeah it didn't seem like it was a torque problem but this doesn't seem to be kind of the best designed bolt because it doesn't have it has like a little dip so the little hex part goes down all the way past where the threads start and so you just have a tiny little bit of surface around there that's actually doing all that torque so it snapped very quickly so we also spent some additional time working on the cooling system so we've got the heat exchanger up front which is feeding coolant to the air to water intercooler up here which we installed one of the things you have to be careful with so you're taking out the stock upper radiator hose and then replacing that and you want to make sure that the one that you replaced when you trim it that it's coming in contact with the expansion tank and not rubbing against that intercooler you don't want it near the intercooler so you want a nice space between the two so you don't have to worry about that rubber hose touching the inner cooler and kind of wearing away at it aside from that pretty straightforward the two hoses coming from the heat exchanger wrap around down here come underneath they go under that little cross member front bumper deal and then up to the air to water intercooler feeding in on the back sides of these and a nice little design thing is that this has the port right up on top so it should be really easy to bleed out the air once we've filled this with coolant and start running the engine okay so after the supercharger is in we're putting the air-to-water intercooler in it's got six ports that we need to be dealing with so there's a coupler right here from the supercharger seven ports we've got this guy also for filling coolant there's a coupler right here going to the throttle body then on the back of it there's the two hoses coming from that heat exchanger up front so you've got water in and water out of course using honda coolant type two and on front what do we got charles yeah on the front we have two different fittings one we have for the diverter valve return so that when jason lets off the throttle all that charged air can be rerouted back into the non-charged side that is it's actually it's funny it's an audi diverter valve and a super common setup on oe turbocharged cars the other fitting we have is for the secondary air pump which is a cold start emissions control that actually shoots air across the catalytic converter and heats it up faster so you can get into your closed loop fuel management a little bit quicker than than you would without it so it actually looks all looks really nice once it's installed using a mix of oe parts and parts from the aftermarket kit charles why are you sitting in the trunk i am sitting in the trunk one because it's a very comfortable place to sit but more importantly the fuel filter or fuel module fuel pump module is something we also replaced the filters built into this housing here we also installed an upgraded electric pump which was awesome because it plugged right in and fit perfectly in the well here for the pump just like the factory one does and a pretty easy setup the only challenging part is it's like buried way back here which which makes for a little bit of difficulty getting it in and out but after taking the driver seat out super simple this really could not have been easier to to fix now jason's got a new filter and a new high flow pump pump pump to gain access to the pump we did remove some of the trim panels back here in the trunk as well as up here in the cab of the car the only real challenge there was some of the trim clips that become no longer serviceable very quickly once they once you start poking at them and trying to get them out so jason overnighted a handful of those from san francisco and we'll install some new ones when we go back together with it after we've confirmed that there's no fuel leaks or any issues other than me sitting in the trunk back here okay so final steps here we've got the air filter on we've got we've replaced our battery connector we've got the fuel cap back on so we're just going through startup procedure and what do we do next so what jason's going to do is he's going to turn just the key on to accessory position that's going to prime the fuel system we're going to start by checking for fuel leaks because that's the one that will cause a catastrophic thermal event that's why we have a fire extinguisher standing by standby we ready for keon kion engine off please luckily with the s2000 that's a whole separate button you can't just crank it i hear the fuel pump our coolant pump is running so we are on all the time be careful when you just sitting with the key on in your car shut it off and turn it back on again okay no leaks at the tank good thing about fuel is it's very you can smell it smelly odoriferous odor let's check for you want to do random scan tool yep let's scan it what kind of car is this this is a honda acura ferrari oh honda first that's two million charles what are you doing we are gonna go ahead and just scan the ecm for faults and make sure we don't come on bro make sure we don't have anything silly happening all right kiddo you got no faults right on let's fire it up all right ready when you are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten how'd we look charles so far so good i see no issues i smell no issues other than maybe me all right so charles is inspecting all the fuel and oil lines jason is my name and i am looking at the oil level so next is running until the thermostat cracks so basically once it gets up to operating temperature and more checks okay so things are coming to a close here we did have to make a couple trips to the store today so overall let's see how many times do we go to the store charles i think it's in the 12 or so does money even matter anymore goodness okay so there's some receipts from building this supercharger day four went really well we've got the bumpers back on we've got the air intake on today we got the rear panels covering the fuel filter back on your seat i'm sitting in a seat which is nice charles put that back in very kind of him to do i'd say and then we went for a little test drive charles kind of talk about why you think that's important yeah you know you you can let the car idle and that's great but you're not loading the vehicle up you're not putting it through its paces you're not changing the geometry of the suspension which can you know do different things to the behavior of the vehicle but most importantly it's actual load on the engine and that's important and you need to build that boost in order to make 100 sure your hoses are all on correctly even though i feel like we went through this thing about 30 times but that's all important steps and so far so good it'll just be a constant check of things but that's good to double check when on the little test drive you could definitely feel it i mean i didn't give it anything probably past 50 throttle but maybe went past 6 000 once i feel like i'll be more comfortable if i get it on a dyno and i see an air fuel ratio and know that it's getting the right amount of fuel but it felt good never gave it you know full beans but it was it was good i'm excited and speaking of signs of speed i did buy the kit but that said like it's not a sponsored video but that said it was an awesome kit i mean i was really impressed with it i looked at a bunch of different kits there's a lot of companies out there that make kits for the s2000 and a lot of them required some cutting and drilling i mean this one had a little bit but only in plastic parts which i feel like were easily replaceable and it's only if you do the after cooler which i do think you should do the after cooler overall like the the kit seemed pretty good i think also a part of that was the fact that charles was here because charles is amazing the customers that got to have him as his technician when he was working full time didn't realize what good hands they were in i don't think or maybe some of them came back to you because you are awesome and handsome and very good looking so i have guys i have dealt with so many kits right kits for aftermarket stuff and this is by far the best kit whether that's brakes supercharger turbocharger kit i mean the comparison from my gti to this supercharger kit it's not even in the same universe so big ups to science of speed for for putting for doing a lot of r d and putting together a complete kit most of these receipts are for yeah that's like a little stock stuff and not stuff that really needed to be replaced in the kit there was a pulley from the kit and there was a hose adapter but i don't blame signs of speed for it i think the pulley was just the wrong part got put in the box and perhaps the same with the little hose coupler but easy stuff to go out and find yeah it's awesome if you guys have not seriously check out this dude's channel he's awesome he's super smart he's the best looking youtuber i mean hands down that's chris thanks chris six hands he has beautiful hands you gotta give that to him he manicures those heavily perma-dirt permander it's been a pleasure man thank you appreciate you having me out man this has been super fun check out his channel guys i'll put links everywhere and just click on all of them as many links as receipts i think bye
