12 000 plus developers declare that python will replace go here is why go will die die soon i don't say it 92 of developers say it you know if i were writing this clearly i would have said go yourself what if 12 000 developers declared that python replace go as the most used programming language in the world well i would say that represents about point zero five percent of all developers and i would say that's not really a statistically a big deal especially if you did it like i mean to me that just sounds like nothing that actually sounds like that sounds like you know i can get 12 000 developers telling me that react is the greatest thing in the universe and it doesn't doesn't make my opinion change would you believe them what if i told you there's a website that actually made such a declaration tell me the go developers please tell me it was go please tell me it was the go developer survey that said that python for replacement please tell me this is the truth oh no let's go that would be the greatest thing ever we'll we'll look at that here in a second okay if you're still here reading this i can tell you one thing you are more interested than 80 of the internet users who had given up and moved on to something else and this is something else a huge let's see and this something else usually is social media sites like facebook or twitter or news websites that don't hold your attention long enough to get to this point okay you know if you just don't even say that paragraph it also we can just move on go is a programming language used by google even though it has been present for about 15 years numerous significant firms such as uber twitch and slack have recently adopted it as part of their overall strategy well i would really love to see slack have reconnecting websockets so before they adopt yet another language i would love to see them you know just have like a little on disconnect try to reconnect like do you think they can do that i could i could write i can slack i could write you the code in a tweet i get 280 characters and i can get that done could you do that for me that'd be really cool i'd really appreciate that thank you what is go okay go was first released all this kind of stuff we already know all about that blah blah blah blah we actually even read uh rob pike's message about trying to create go and all that all right we already have that already have that video on youtube man they are slacking on the job i know jeez what developers think about python versus go no doubts about it python is one of the today's most popular programming languages the open source language has been around since 1991 but continues to evolve to me new challenges it's flexibility and readability makes it a favorite for both beginners and experienced coders on one hand there are developers who think that python is more suited to to advanced software development and that go should be used for simpler applications although many also believe python can handle anything my python don't want none unless you got go hon huh what has happened to my life if you're considering which language to use you might want to consider a few key points what do other developers say how fast are each language's adoption rates are either of them in line with your business goals okay yes this is classic trade-offs this is every this is every developer not wanting to ask or answer a question well you know really let's you know you just gotta ask yourself you know what are your goals and you know what kind of trade-offs do you want to make preferred alternatives to go going is a program blah blah blah blah okay so what languages did you intend to use let's see what language did you use instead of go for this project rust python java typescript c sharp oh feels bad on it feels actually the worst that people are choosing ruby overgo i assume n is the number of respondents okay is this is this this is 2018. a lot has changed source go.dev let's see for those that who evaluated go and didn't use it notice here i want you to i want you to look at this look at how small all that number gets versus how much these numbers grow at the top right so a lot of people are are doing things with go and as the questions get more narrow the amount of respondence goes significantly down so it's kind of like what only 233 people answer this question so what respondents do you use instead when they didn't choose go so what you're trying to tell me is that of the 12 000 approximate people responded 233 who didn't choose go i'm not a math magician so i can't do that off the top of my head but two three three divided by approximately 12 000 is a 1.94 of them that's 92 percent of all developers you're right you're right i did the math i did the math math relations wrong all right a language design for the cloud python is designed to help developers take advantage of cloud infrastructure in both terms of app development and deployment there's a much more versatile programming language than go isn't go like the most designed language for the cloud i actually don't think this is a chat jeopardy article i think this article is just plain bad go is literally a great language like i get that there's a lot of ai tools that are in python and data science stuff it's just literally a propaganda article and we're here to destroy it okay we're destroying propaganda articles one day at a time okay okay blah blah blah blah all right while all these tools aren't specific to python itself all popular programming languages have support from third-party tools it speaks to python's flexibility that has become so widely used in many different fields beyond web development okay learning languages on their own while some people have an innate ability to pick up new languages for most of us it's a lot more complicated learning a language on your own can be extremely time consuming and without structure progress often feels stagnant that is why companies are switching from on-site language classes to online alternatives yeah like front and masters since you're here reading about python we assume you're interested in using it for your next big project or a few why not take advantage of some online courses and then the next then write down all the links are to go except for the ibm one let's learn about some car says okay what's this one all about oh go that's it so what what i'm seeing here is that this is an actual article that people are saying out loud forever let me let me just make sure that this let me just make sure that i understand this all right hold on here we go so there's 10 000 people who work and go there's at least five there's at least six thousand who work and go outside of work you can see this number is actually slightly larger and it's it's definitely kind of slightly going upwards but slightly going downwards that'll work okay so so one interesting thing to take away from this right here is this right here look at this for a second outside of work interest might be slightly waning from those who took the survey is that fair maybe not where is yeah where where's the 2022 to air is human is this 2020 no this is 2021 this is 2021 these are all 20 21. is there 20 22 at all there is no 2022 at all in here see we've seen jess besos over and over again as an imposter good ones go dev 2022 survey all right these are all generic questions we don't need to do generics positive feedback what's that do they include n on these ones they're not really including n this is really just like about generic stuff only 6 000 people told us that this is about like go one point yeah 1.18 which is when they did that the survey of model respondents isn't really changing now novice go developers are interested in web development okay error handling and learning are responses top challenges okay okay okay survey killed by google yes survey might be killed by google that could that's likely to what has happened while i was just here i was just here are you saying that there is something here check out the toyota index are you saying it's in here oh look at this i program at work and go a lot i program outside of work so people still seem very interested to me this is a huge this number right here is the most important number how many people program and go outside of work when you choose to program and virtually never get paid for it what are you doing look at this 92 percent of response are satisfied using go in the past year again this is a good lesson for everybody this is crazy okay i want you to know something you know how crazy this is you want to know how crazy this is this article required me to pay for medium that's right everybody i pay for medium for you okay for you i paid literal money to read this article i have never felt more cheated in my lifetime okay i've you know what next week i'm paying for winrar i'm paying for winrar next week because that's the only way i can make my feels make myself feel better after this it's the only way winrar i'm gonna go with 7-zip we're gonna just pay for all the things i've never needed in my life just to make myself feel better because i do not feel good right now the name is i legitimately paid for medium and i got scammed that good by just trash articles again
