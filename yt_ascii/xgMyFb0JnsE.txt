this youtuber made 12 million dollars by secretly pumping and dumping crypto and no one caught him until now in public he says irresponsible sellers should be hit by a bus yet behind the scenes he's been relentlessly selling the cryptocurrency safe moon to his gullible followers in recent months he's used his new wealth to buy a rolls royce he's now flying private jets and he's bragging about literally eating meals made of gold now if you're wondering what is paying for these luxuries and look online for answers currently all you'll see is a rag to riches story about how this youtuber went from being homeless to making millions of dollars because of sick pranks he uploaded to youtube however financial records show a different story and no one would have found out about this had it not been for one individual who tipped me off my name is lewis and i have some interesting information about one of the one of the premier leagues behind safe moon so to back up a second i've been talking to a lot of people about my safe moon investigation and at one point i held an open room where anyone could come in and talk about their experiences be it positive or negative what comes to mind when you say safe moon i think scam and i think pump and dump to me i see it as a long term hold i've seen a lot of people get into it kind of yellow all their money in just and everything was going normally until the unexpected happened this guy joined he's a youtuber named seizean and he's about to make a very serious accusation one of the promoters of safe moon was dumping safe moon while obviously saying oh i'm holding to the moon guys and while he was tweeting those things was was unloading literally millions of dollars worth of moon wait a second that could be criminal what is this influencer's name ben phillips uk is his twitter account wait a second ben phillips is a famous uk youtuber he runs a prank channel he's got hundreds of thousands of followers on twitter and most importantly he was involved with safe moon since march 25th 2021 as part of their marketing team is ben phillips if you haven't seen me i'm actually a youtuber i think it's it's absolutely incredible you know what's going on with the community themselves being just like picked up my twitter and being like yeah let's go so this is the guy being accused of a pump and dump scheme but how do we know if this is true well if you look today at bin phillips twitter account for answers you won't find much most of his statements have been deleted and that's for good reason because in one of them ben phillips does what you should never do if you pump and dump crypto he leaked his wallet quote if anyone wants to buy me starbucks today this is my bmb address now many of you have watched the show long enough to know what a huge admission this is and how this can be used to find out everything ben was doing with safe moon and the first thing we find is that he was definitely being paid for his role in promoting safe moon the day he joins the team the 25th of march he starts getting paid in safe moon by the deployer wallet he ends up getting paid several more times a total of 5 trillion safe moon tokens for his services but what was interesting was not when he got safe moon but when he decided to sell it we can check this using archived tweets from bin phillips twitter account and we cross-reference that with the blockchain to see his financial activity at the same time and here's what we found a pattern of pumping and dumping safe moon with on the one hand positive tweets about safe moon while at the same time ben phillips would be dumping the coins for a large profit onto the same people who rushed in to buy based on his tweets for example ben phillips tweeted holy  doge new all-time high and now safe moon on its way to hitting new all-time high tonight who's glad they holding not financial advice that very same day been sold 44 000 and these dumps escalate as we go further into april on the 20th he tweeted diamond hands always win and then tweeted again fire sale that same day he sold three times for over a million dollars the next day while tweeting about an all-time high he said i feel bad for everyone who sold again his next tweet i feel bad for everyone who sold and then this well i'm holding that same day he sold three times again for over half a million dollars these are clear pump and dumps if he really thought there was a fire sale on safe moon why sell a million dollars of it and why would you sell half a million dollars of safe moon right after you say well i'm holding the reason is obvious he wanted the price to be as high as possible when he sold and once ben phillips started making millions of dollars in such a short period of time what does he do with that money he starts spending it on stupid luxury items and bragging about it on instagram of course for example on may 21st a month after making millions from pump and dumps ben phillips suddenly buys his dream car a quote top of the fleet rolls royce a month later ben is chartering private jets to scotland for a birthday bite with his girlfriend of three years he also can be seen bragging on instagram about eating steak wrapped in 24 karat gold now it should be noted i'm not against people making money or promoting a product that they believe in but this isn't that ben phillips is profiting millions of dollars from publicly praising safe moon saying he's holding safe mode saying it's a good buy while secretly selling it he talked a lot during his pump and dump days about responsible versus irresponsible whales he compares himself to a responsible one someone who owns a lot of the token and isn't going to sell it suddenly he can trash this with irresponsible whales who sell suddenly he says these people they deserve the worst in fact on july 30th 2021 when safe moon dipped bin said irresponsible whale i hope you get hit by a bus now lucky for ben his wish wouldn't come true because of course it turns out ben was a irresponsible whale the exact month he was complaining about it in fact in the month of july when he tweeted this he was selling over a million dollars of safe moon lowering the price even further than it already was but what are the final figures how much did he make well i enlisted some fellow researchers to tally the total amount and according to our calculations he sold 16 million dollars worth of safe moon and it looks like he profited roughly 12 million dollars now will ben get prosecuted for any of this i don't know very few of these crypto cases get prosecuted no matter how obvious it is just very few people pay a penalty for example a few months ago ice beside admitted on tape to a massive scam and nothing's happened to him yet so i can't say what the future is for ben other than i've done my best to report these actions to the proper authorities and you're welcome to look through the transaction data yourself linked below everyone is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law and all of this is allegation and opinion until proven otherwise wait so that's it it's over he's not going to prison yeah our work here is done now we let the actual authorities take it from here that sucks the evidence is literally right there in front of everyone well i don't know what you want me to say it's messed up it sure is hey did you reach out to ben about all of this i'd like to hear from him i did but he didn't respond i think he's too busy making more money with sick pranks oh you lost all your life savings whoops it's just a prank bro oh thanks i needed that this stuff gets really depressing after a while i don't mention it in fact i want to show you something i think it'll make you feel
