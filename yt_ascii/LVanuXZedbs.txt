it's hard to believe that only a week ago luna was one of the top cryptocurrencies with billions of dollars flowing into it and all it took was one market downturn to turn this golden token into digital toilet paper i mean in one week luna has gone from 80 a token to less than one this chart is just hard to look at i'm warning you it reminds me of bitconnect not to mention ust their stablecoin is still d-pegged and at this point i think it's safe to say it's over for terraform labs there's simply no way to re-establish the trust that algorithmic stablecoins need i mean after all who wants an unstable stablecoin so today we're going to try to explain what happened and tell the story of why i think this collapse was predictable by that i mean it was literally predicted there was a 20 million dollar bet about this and i'm also going to be honest with you about what we don't know as well because before we move further let me say loud and clear as of right now no one knows the true culprit for this crash so far i've counted four different and unique threads going viral all claiming to know how luna collapsed and the explanation is slightly different each time but what is consistent is their proof is trust me bro in fact my personal favorite of these explanations is the theory that citadel who's the gamestop super villain secretly gotten a hundred thousand bitcoin loan from gemini which is owned by the winkle twins and they destroyed luna with it now jim and i denied these claims but who are you gonna believe a private company or an anonymous 4chan post kind of a toss-up right and i'm not even saying these are wrong they just don't have any evidence so that's where it stands with this forensic side of things a lot of people claim to have solved it but nobody seems to actually have done so but while we don't know exactly what happened i think it's important to say this crash also didn't surprise anyone and i think that's worth talking about there were a lot of people who have been calling for this for some time and these were mostly for two reasons which we've already discussed ust was built on a ponzi scheme and algo's stable coins have sort of always failed and we've covered those but there's a third option that i really think has been overlooked in all this and that is dokwan's role remember that dokuan is the creator of terraform lapse and what most people don't know is that as luna became more and more successful do kwan slowly became more and more arrogant he would dismiss all his critics and call them poor and i believe this played a role at least in so many people rooting for luna's downfall if not actively playing a role in it as i said we don't know if luna's demise was like an attack or naturally occurring but i want to give you some examples of this because i think we can learn from it about sort of what not to do if you suddenly happen to become ultra rich and powerful so on november 25th 2021 a guy named freddy reynolds proposed a theory of how you could crash luna with a soro-style black wednesday attack by that he's referring to when george soros broke the british pound and he goes into great detail about how you could do this if you just had a billion dollars on hand he described a process where you could make 50 million dollars and sort of rinse and repeat it until luna falls apart now in response to this possible attack vector does luna investigate does it implement strategies to defend itself no instead dokwan says this probably the most thread i've read this decade silence is a perfectly acceptable option if stupid and then basically he asks sort of to be attacked he says billionaires in my following go ahead see what happens i mean can you imagine the arrogance to taunt billionaires that are following you and going like yeah see what happens go ahead attack me see what happens now look i know the internet's kind of a wild place but i usually think there are two rules to it that you have to abide by at all times one don't ever taunt the internet and two don't ever taunt billionaires and you certainly don't want to do both at the same time but this kind of arrogant response wasn't even an irregular occurrence rather than engaging with flaws in his protocol dokuan would repeatedly call his critics poor in fact a few days before luna collapsed do kwan said that if you listen to crypto influencers about ustd pegging for the 69th time or you could remember that they're all poor now and go for a run instead and he repeatedly did this he also taunted this guy al god trading who said if luna breaks new all-time highs i will short it with size and do kwan responds yeah but your size is not size this guy responds statistically you're dunking on 99 of your community but all right someday your ponzi will collapse you can't keep fueling anchor and this is my favorite part of the story because that same guy then responds four days later offering a one million dollar bet that luna will be at a lower price in exactly one year now what does dokwan do he takes it of course he takes the bait he says cool i'm in and i guess that got enough attention because someone noticed it and decided that they actually wanted to raise the stakes gcr on twitter decides to offer a 10 million dollar bet dokwan once again agrees and they decide on the escrow being another crypto twitter user kobe and so right now at this address which we will put on screen there's currently a 10 million dollar bet going on on the blockchain this is real money we're talking about literally just put up to see if luna's gonna fall or not which obviously two months later it did but even that wasn't enough for gcr who at the time decides he wants to double the bet saying the initial spirit of it was this like yeah your size is not size whatever like kind of a weird insult weird way to say you're poor basically and so he says look we're gonna play for big money i'll double it to 20 million dollars to which dokuan doesn't respond and so instead what this guy does is he decides he's going to short luna with the remaining 10 million dollars that he wanted to bet him with now for those of you following along at home this is what we call a chad move this guy would end up cashing out with 16 to 20 million dollars profit and it shows how much dokuan pissed everyone off not just the quote poor people but actually the richest part of crypto twitter remember he literally asked billionaires to attack his protocol and to make it even worse he also began attacking other competitors around this time saying about stable coins like die by my hand die will die and it was sort of this unique combination of arrogance antagonism and disregard for criticism that contributed either directly or indirectly to luna's collapse people don't like a sore winner and it's fair to say that do kwan had to learn that lesson the hard way my point was sharing this isn't to suggest that the only reason luna collapsed is because this guy is kind of a jerk because remember they were basically running a ponzi scheme but being a jerk along with sort of running and benefiting from a ponzi scheme definitely doesn't help and the other bit of news we learned in all of this is that coindesk reported that do kwan was secretly behind a failed stable coin in the past called basis cash he turned out to be anonymously involved going by the pseudonym rick and his partner was called morty according to coindesk he modeled the project after an earlier project called basis which you may or may not remember as the failed project of founder nader al-najji the creator of bitcloud so that's where we are with this story a lot has come out and while i hold very little sympathy for dokwan's failure i do feel bad for all the traitors who got swept up in it for example ksi claimed to have bought a hundred thousand luna claiming it could be the quote best or worst trade of my life he later says he spent 2.8 million dollars buying the dip and that is luna was now worth a thousand dollars ouch and that's not even to mention the regular investors who don't have millions to spare i mean i cannot stress this enough billions of dollars have been wiped out overnight like reddit communities are being makeshifted from supporters into support groups like i don't want to show you guys too much of this because it is dark some investors lost houses others lost life savings and that's truly sad but we can't forget about the painful lessons things like luna can teach us in this case it's sort of three things don't taunt internet billionaires don't build ponzi schemes and beware algo's stablecoins that's basically it pump the stock and i'll see you in the next one
