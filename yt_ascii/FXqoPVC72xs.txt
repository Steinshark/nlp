oh no why do they bother you might have heard of a site called wish it has some incredible value things but it also kind of looks a bit like a scam so today we're gonna head on to the smartphone section and see what we can find wow okay this is clone city so we've got mate 30. look at those bezels i don't think we've actually seen a real phone come out with those bezels the images actually look pretty legit but i think the problem is that the real thing won't because it's saying it's 77 pounds and you're getting a full hd display a 4 800 milliamp hour battery which is even bigger than the actual mate 30 and the 13 plus 24 megapixel camera i doubt it but we're gonna have to try so we'll add that to our basket oh look so here we have the s91 and it is 29 pounds that's nuts yeah i guess we should just try it we'll go for black what else oh we've got iphones oh look the i11 pro that's a bargain let's go for white and it's so funny how they basically take real phone numbers and then dial them up to make them look better so this isn't the s10 or the s11 you're looking at the s18 plus phone sure why not oh and of course it's not just the mate 30 we've got to worry about we've got a mate 35 which in reality is not actually a phone that exists so this will be interesting let's go red let's just look at the names for a second so we've got the huawei p41 pro here the mate 33 pro we've got of course the i11 pro can't forget that one and oh a mate 36 pro oh and actually this is interesting so if you look at the top corner it tells you there is a 97 discount on these phones and if that was true then retail price of this fake would be 2 505 pounds which is higher than the real one oh my goodness so this one is not a renault this is a rhino it's 29 pounds that's crazy i'm just i'm curious how good they can make a phone for that is it even a smartphone okay and there's also some fairly legit looking iphones so i think we should try one of those too and just see how close they managed to get okay these specs cannot be true not a chance but then how do they get away with straight up lying i'm just i'm confused why a site like this exists in 2020. i do also at this point i want to thank surfsharkvpn for making this possible because this is not something i could do without them i want to see if i can find a phone which has a real hole punch in it because with fake phones because it's much cheaper what they often do when they're trying to copy phones that have hole punches is just create a notch hole punch phone oh okay note 10 pro and you can tell that's not real because there's no such phone as the note 10 pro but it looks convincing and if they manage to pull off what they're showing in that photo for 101 pounds that's actually impressive so let's give it a go and the other thing i thought i'd try is to just find the cheapest smartphone like how cheap can actually go we've got lots of 27s lots of 29s okay we might just have a winner then it's looking like this phone over here 23 pounds what are we getting if probably not a whole lot if it even works i'll be quite impressed to be honest okay let's buy that and then for our phones we need a couple of accessories so let's have a look speaker oh man it's full of knockoffs let's go with this one okay so 11 pound we get pretty nice looking speaker blue okay 17 pound and we could pick up some earphones oh wow okay they really don't look bad and then of course one of the first things you see is airpod clones and this is something i've always been curious about because i've not really played around with many of them okay we can pick colors let's go okay let's just go with white and eight pound let's see how good it can possibly be last of all i wanted to have a look at power banks okay so this power bank has a capacity of 990 000 milliamp hours that's got to be a joke so this one says capacity of a million milliamp hours it's like you're trying to power some sort of nuclear generator it gets worse wait this one's this one's 10 million so when you click select size you can click 100 milliamp hours 9 million milliamp hours 10 million milliamp hours or 20 million okay you know what let's go 20 million and let's go black and red 14 pounds bargain don't know what's going to turn up at my door it's not going to be a 20 million million power battery it'd be the size of an airplane oh god i'm a little bit worried i'll be honest it's almost like they think it's a joke just for the sake of it let's just order one more of these ridiculous power banks okay let's go for gold why not 16 pounds bye i just don't get it you know let's just let's just try it and see what happens it's also interesting when you're filtering by price for these smartphones that the absolute top price bracket here is 77 pounds plus as if that's about as expensive as phones get and to be fair on this site they're about right but it's just curious oh i mean they look fantastic let's give those a go as well while we're at it it's interesting that it says they're refurbished i'm assuming that means the packaging it comes in is not convincing enough to count as new so we've got 15 items in our cart and the total that comes to is 782 pounds 20. so i'm gonna check out on that probably wait for about a month for it all to arrive if it ever does and then we'll see what we're working with one eternity later okay so probably the most surprising thing is that everything actually arrived apart from that m20 pro phone that ultra cheap one but i still got refunded so we're gonna start with the accessories and then we'll get on to the phones all right so we will start with the beats by dr dre any hope of this being a genuine item is now gone it's a little bit more than just refurbished by the looks of it as well okay it actually doesn't look bad do you know what the logo the paint job it's better than i thought it would be the cushioning's a bit flat okay let's give it a go and i don't have a headphone jack thank you pretty budget experience so far it's pretty bassy no actually you know what that's that's pretty good i wouldn't say there's a lot of clarity but it's about as good as you'd expect 15 20 maybe even 30 dollar headphones to sound and actually while we've got the laptop we've also got a pair of earphones these are the one pound earphones there is a bit of a shipping cost involved as well but incredibly cheap offense okay first impression they look cool but they do feel incredibly cheap let's try it i remember how the website was talking all about how this is a dual driver pair of earphones yeah i doubt all of it okay they're not great but they're serviceable earphones for the pound or four pounds in total i spent on them very base heavy the kind of sound signature that you get with cheap earphones here's one i'm very curious about so these are the incredibly inexpensive airpods the first impression is that it actually doesn't look bad this magnetic mechanism here the hinge is a little bit loose like if it's open and you give it a wobble it closes but you know what it's it's but you know what i'm not unimpressed okay okay so auto pairing these instructions are cryptic [music] something i'm really curious about is this speaker it looks actually really really good take that wrapper off yeah i'm not gonna lie i think at least visually you could probably fool someone into thinking this costed 60 it's also completely sealed by the looks of it so i think there's a good chance it could survive a drop in water i wouldn't try that yeah i wouldn't i would not test that it's compass the charge three oh [music] [applause] okay it's not great it gives the impression that it's some sort of 360 surround speaker maybe even with the base coming out of here these potential subwoofers but it's not there's some sort of small unit sitting in the front and it just fires forwards a bit upset about that one ah now for the batteries and yeah they've airbagged it up as you would for a 20 million milliamp hour cell it's tiny so i'm already convinced that this is not more than about 10 000 million powers two immediate observations it feels kind of cheap i guess as you'd expect there's a bit of creaking in plastic but it's also not nearly as heavy as it should be this is almost definitely at least a third hollow that doesn't leave me incredibly hopeful for this next one but we'll take a look anyway oh okay completely different style of battery this one's much slimmer and actually quite a bit nicer looking although that finish is hardly reassuring it kind of looks like this top bit has just kind of been super glued onto the bottom bit five minutes before leaving the factory the weight again though definitely makes me question the capacity okay time for the smartphones i've been slightly nervous mostly excited about doing this and because there's so many i think the best way of doing it is for me to just kind of lay them all out and do it at once and it is actually quite interesting almost like there's some sort of coordination going on at wish because they all come in very similar strange plain white boxes oh and this one's refurbished so i think it makes sense to open them in price order we'll start with the cheapest and work our way up to the most expensive all right let's start so this is the s91 many many years ahead of its time okay it actually kind of looks like a galaxy s9 it's got a dual camera setup but weirdly a matte finish that's not actually as bad looking as i thought it would be we'll come back to it who doesn't love a good rhino3 it's a bigger phone i'm curious how well they've replicated the oppo renault's design because design was a big part of those voting selling points oh that's better than i expected have a look at the back of that oh actually it doesn't look as good without the wrapper on okay i 11 pro this is the cheaper i11 pro oh that almost looks like a it looks like a google pixel really tiny little camera module in the top corner and on the back instead of saying apple it actually just says hd camera still a pretty good peel though ah okay i'm very excited about this one this is the completely unreleased huawei mate 35 what an honor oh we got a bit of color going on here oh my god okay this is exciting look at the back of this let's or not let's try a different corner okay all right i'll do that later it's a feature that actually feels like a glass finish which i wasn't expecting mate 30. oh that's a heavy phone that's the heaviest so far i'm curious to see how well they've replicated it because the design of the mate 30 was pretty out there it was a different design to most smartphones so not easy to just make a generic fake off oh quite well take a look at that that's not a shabby looking fake phone at all okay where are we at now so this is the more expensive i know and this is the more expensive i11 pro it takes a punch hole to a new meaning okay so we've got emerald green here very clean looking back although that feels a bit plasticky the module isn't quite right either there's a little bit too much space between the cameras but it's better than the first one aha the galaxy s18 plus oh 5g as well okay this is exciting 8 gigs ram 512 gigs of storage all the bells and whistles okay that is a galaxy s10 plus so in the future it looks like samsung's actually going to move backwards and start remaking their old phone oh plus a rear fingerprint scanner funnily enough on the front it has the in-display fingerprint scanner sticker but i don't think it's gonna work and finally it's a bit of a shame i was actually kind of enjoying this we have the note 10 pro and the reason i think this is the most expensive is that at least i think they've managed to recreate an actual hole punch which i've never seen before on a clone fake phone so let's see how they've done it oh nice okay so to start with the finish they've actually kind of managed to recreate it the note 10 and note 10 plus they have this crazy psychedelic aura glow color i didn't think the fake would actually have that and it does look like we have a hole punch although we will have to turn the display on first to actually check it plus the s pen which i'm pretty curious about alrighty so i'm going to take 30 minutes set all these phones up and then tell you what i think much much much later okay i suppose the most curious one is going to be the iphone because ios is incredibly hard to replicate convincingly oh that is something i'll get back to that power this one on this is the huawei mate 235 [music] goodbye goodbye and literally like the welcome screen looks like you're walking into jurassic park for the first time it's just so incredibly off-brand see if the mate 30 is any better i think this is the back of the phone that i'm most impressed by always designed was not easy to recreate here but it does actually look good ah s' plus i'll tell you one thing this has inherited from samsung's galaxy s10 lineup is the incredibly high power key i remember thinking that you know while you're holding the phone in your hand that is a stretch to get to [music] how does this have the and we actually have a hole punch display admittedly there's a few dead pixels around [music] all right so everything's set up now and this varies from being absolutely appalled to actually being quite impressed so let's start with the samsung display has incredibly bad viewing angles let's take a look at the cameras how good can a camera on a phone this cheap be i don't think there's any hdr here god and in terms of the image we were sold on yeah it's fair to say i've been fairly misled the bezels are much thicker in reality and those dual cameras are not dual cameras okay moving on to the rhino again terrible viewing angles like if you tilt this more than about 60 degrees you're gonna struggle to read what's on it but what i want to test is the cameras okay no it's exactly the same as the camera app for the last phone but yeah this is not a periscope camera in case there was any doubt at all and compared to this image i've been very misled the bezels are nothing like what they were on the page and yeah all of this is definitely a lie okay the cheaper looking iphone and actually while this looks pretty unconvincing from the back it's not terrible from the front everything is a little bit more spaced out than it should be you can tell it's not ios but they've done at least a semi decent job so compared to that image the specs are obviously not right it doesn't have a 10 core chipset but in terms of the way it looks they weren't actually that far off i'd actually go as far to say that the back of the phone i've actually got looks better than the back of the phone on the image this one's really interesting so this is the huawei phone and they have fully recreated admittedly an older version of huawei's mui software it's not a bad job software-wise let's take a look at the cameras oh and we've actually got a huawei style camera app as well oh yeah that's definitely a better camera than the phones before compared to that image yes i've been misled obviously the side bezels here are thicker the bottom bezel is much thicker but the back is actually again one of these cases where i'd say it looks better in person than it does on the image so this is kind of cool the next phone the huawei mate 30 has the huawei mate 30 wallpaper pre-installed on it and software-wise it looks like the exact same skin as this one and as expected the camera is the same okay it does actually have a blur mode so if i put my hand there oh right okay it's just blurring all the way around the sides of the image never mind i just like the fact that they have actually delivered on the image in terms of the way the phone looks this is quite a beautiful phone and if i receive this in a shop with better internals and a better screen and without the lies i think i'd be quite happy iphone and this software is just appalling i don't know how they've managed to take a step backwards from the cheaper one oh there's an app to do with the fingerprint touch screen fingerprint no surely not it it's giving me the the indicator to start setting up an in-screen fingerprint is that working surely there's only one way yeah there's any form of i've supposedly set my entire fingerprint up so let's turn the screen off it's got a little indicator there okay well joe and that works too why do they bother us it made me set my entire fingerprint up oh what a mess okay you see this i didn't hate this is the s18 plus this does look quite convincingly like samsung's most recent software skin oh that's a bixby button and it takes you to a fake big speak oh no the real one's bad enough see if you flick to the side they've recreated samsung's entire side screen 10 out of 10 for effort and finally this is a curious case first of all it just looks like a bit of a joke the way they've kind of rounded off all the bezels and how the hole punch has this massive thick black border around it but the software is note 10 software as far as the eye can see obviously it's fake but it's a convincing fake let's try the s pen now okay so to be fair to this listing it doesn't appear to actually show an s pen okay so maybe i walked myself into that one okay let's try this front camera if this works it does mean working hole punch yeah it does it's not great but it's not bad well no it is quite bad actually this gives me such an appreciation for actually good phones alright so this has been weird but i've actually had a lot of fun here now i can't wholeheartedly say you should go on to wish and buy this stuff the whole operation is just incredibly dodgy and i don't really know how it works but as far as an experiment goes interesting results okay about a year ago so shark vpn contacted me and asked if i wanted to partner up with them and i distinctly remember thinking i haven't heard of surf shark but sure let me give it a test and see if i like it and i did it does everything you need a vpn to do like give you that peace of mind that your browsing is secure and anonymous also i'd be traveling around the world for launch events and i'd be using it to access uk netflix while i'm sitting in china for example so okay fine it's a vpn it works but now that i've been using it for almost a full year it's becoming pretty clear that a lot not all but a lot of vpns out there are borderline daylight robbery they'll charge you 20 30 per person per month for vpn access but so shark is 199 a month for an unlimited amount of simultaneous connections and there are some unique things too you've got hacklock which is a feature designed to give you alerts if your password or email ever got compromised and that just ensures that the first person to take action is you and i like that using the surfshark app on my macbook i can tap once in the bar at the top and quickly connect to the last server i was connected to so check the link in the description and use code boss to get an 83 discount and an extra month for free thanks a lot for watching i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
