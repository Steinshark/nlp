ladies and gentlemen the world of chess is changing every single day and chess prodigies are getting younger and younger every single year and right now in 2024 perhaps the youngest chess prodigy and the most well-known one is falino oro a 10-year-old boy who is from argentina he is being called the leonel messi of chess which is a very small amount of pressure to put on the shoulders of a child foso has defeated hikarin nakamura he's defeated magnus carlson and yesterday not only has he defeated him let's say in the past he outperformed them over 11 rounds and tied for second place he had as much as the second place finisher in the title tuesday chess.com tournament a tournament with a minefield of grand masters he's an fm this list does not even have a single im on it crazy crazy and i'm going to show you some of his best games and perhaps most impressively i know he's defeated magnus he's defeated hikaru he outperformed them in a tournament you saw on that list right eighth and ninth perhaps more impressively than that fustino had defeated me including in his run yesterday he beat me then he beat grandmaster kbov grandmaster leang lim and grandmaster nanan and all these player look at their ratings dude 3021 3041 and 3055 i mean you have got to be kidding me these are ridiculous ratings ridiculous ratings but first let's let me show you how i lost to a 10-year-old child not only have i lost to him i've lost to him four times i am one in four against him with a draw mind you now i had no idea i was playing him yesterday because what i've been doing i've actually been using this cool chrome extension i extended i i a chrome extension i ended i mean oh my god i am such an idiot which hides who i'm playing so i didn't know who i was playing and and you know my opponent played knight f3 and fto and i have had a lot of battles against each other i played the queen's gambit accepted and he played in a in a in a very principled way he played knight c3 and he kind of developed his pieces like this very normal and here i actually lost the game but neither one of us really saw it or kind of understood the concept but basically he's trying to play this move d5 right and foso is playing and that is the best move here by the way just completely ignoring the attack on this bishop which is i mean that's a little hard to spot i should have just went there with a solid position he didn't see it either so he took and did this right and so now i took on d5 and i saw this knight and i was thinking okay well i got to find a way to consolidate i'm under some pressure i got to find a way to consolidate this is not really a threat this is not really a threat and so i thought you know i got to obviously be a little careful i should have just went knight c6 i should have just stayed put but i didn't really know what to do after knight c6 well the idea is i can go rook e8 i can't go rook e8 now because he takes my bishop and i can't take with the queen but i should have enabled that by moving my knight to c6 and i didn't and falino just immediately won my queen so i'm just the queen down and it got much worse than that because then he went here and i went here and then he found this move knight e5 so he's threatened f7 i can't take because of this i thought about resigning here then i went knight c6 and then he got a totally dominating position against me but suddenly i started defending myself and what's funny is he should have put the bishop on b3 because then he has this and i can't really stop him from checkmating me like if i play knight e5 he plays rook c7 and queen g8 and there is no back rank checkmate but falino misplayed it and actually i got back in the game and not only did i get back in the game i was winning i was winning in this position it was very complicated he's checking me i obviously shouldn't take the bishop i took the bishop and i should just run to the corner and then he's pinned and i'm i'm actually winning here in a completely insane sort of events but instead i went for the end game and i thought well you know i have two bishops again i had like 10 seconds on the clock so stupid stuff happens and yeah now with 10 seconds on the clock it's complete chaos and then i proceeded to for some reason lose this pawn i don't know why i did that again 5 seconds on the clock fao's very very fast very very good we shuffled and played and played and played and he kind of put pressure on me and it's still a draw it's still a draw it's still a draw but white is playing for a win it's still a draw but it's very tricky cuz he has that f pawn and it's still a dow it's losing and he went and he promoted and he had two seconds on the clock so he's very good under low time i have had the unfortunate reality of getting defeated by this 10-year-old this is like very very humbling stuff like you think you're good at chess and then you just meet like a 5-year-old who's better than you not in my case in my case i lose to 10-year-olds not 5-year-olds but again i can't even really be that mad considering this dude finished better than magnus and hikaru so let's look at some of his other games against slightly better chess players than myself i'm rated 2780 blitz when i'm on my game but these guys are rated 3,000 so fao versus anton kbov plays c4 e5 the reverse sicilian like this and then he plays g6 b4 kbov takes the center very solid setup by foso nothing too special knight bd2 and at some point the sides kind of start clashing right foso is trying to fight back over here now from the opening his more experienced opponent with the white pieces just gets a very pleasant position but he doesn't capitalize with this move c5 instead he plays e4 and then c5 and yeah i mean falino is under a lot of pressure he is getting positionally squeezed here this is a very bad position for black black is going to lose his center pawn have doubled c pawns i mean it's very very unpleasant but what falino does is he doesn't just dominate games from certain to finish because he's 10 he he doesn't he he can't do that just yet he fights he's a fighter and he also plays pretty fast so knight d7 right they trade knight goes to b3 targeting the pawn on c5 atino says no no no i'm i'm going to protect this pawn but rook c1 i mean he's just going to lose it so he loses it on his terms he loses it by playing c4 which is the best move now white takes and white's pawns get split and now black tries to create a blockade queen c3 check king to g8 now the simplest thing here is probably to trade and keep playing but okay carall plays queen here queen b3 queen c5 i mean white is just completely still up a pawn now again the best move from foso queen b4 like identifying that the queen trade is the best move is very tough and basically black just wants a pass pawn and black just wants a pass pawn that he can protect he could play c5 knight c6 and then the game goes on and it doesn't really matter the air pawn down queen b4 is a very high level move very patient move from the young man queen queen goes to g5 now a very nice defensive idea activating the knight you can't take it but it's actually the best move and now corov plays this and corov is just literally moments away from winning queen h6 knight g5 game is over but falino is like i'm not scared queen f8 my queen will always come back to stop checkmate okay now carbuff continues to attack and also creates a getaway for his king rook e4 falino is down a minute he is down a minute and white is completely winning rook b6 and yet and yet white should have went c5 protecting and attacking and getting the pawn out of the way and falino is like wait a minute he just gave me the pawn back uhoh now suddenly in in two moves corol lost all his time so now the position is back to rookie two now anything can happen i mean it looks like black is still worse but black is no longer upon down but falino has an 8 seconds but corov has 16 seconds and look at bishop f3 removing the defender of the rook rook e six rook e six and out of nowhere fatino is a pawn up what just happened king g2 rook f5 kicking out the queen now king g7 getting off the back rank and now it's chaos just like my game against him it's complete chaos but he's young he's tactically sharp he thrives in chaos and suddenly kbov is going to lose all his pawns and he does lose all his pawns he gives a check king h6 even though falino has 5 seconds on the clock he's still finding the best moves and he's just up three pawns now queen h3 queen b5 queen g5 you give a couple of checks and then you just go for a queen trade and right here kov lost on time that's insane he defended so well and he wins he just he just won that game like defeating a very very strong grandmaster then he played lawang liam who is a world blitz champion i think in like 2015 or something liam straight up won the world chess championship of blitz which is crazy now this one fao plays an italian knight f6 this is some sort of mainline italian position nothing is particularly impressive yet but the time advantage is apparent as falo is up 30 seconds like obviously he knows the opening pretty well he's playing it pretty quickly and yeah it helps to be 10 cu you have a really good memory so knight goes to g6 okay bishop back to d3 and now liam begins putting the knight in front of fos king plays knight h5 puts the knight on f4 visually the position looks very nice for black okay black is putting a lot of pressure on the king side if black could get like two moves you know obviously you can't but that's what you're trying to accomplish and the bishop is very strong but the position is very much balanced so now bishop c2 getting out of the way pawn takes d4 pawn takes d4 and the center locks like this now i i guess lim is relying on the move c5 if he's not relying on the move c5 i'm not exactly sure what he's relying on like definitely the best move here for black is c5 but liam plays f6 and we have knight to g3 right liam is trying to open up the f file and also trying to open up things for the bishop pawn takes faso takes with the knight the best move here for black is to play queen f6 we have knight e5 and suddenly after rook e5 falino has a winning position against liam which is crazy but it's a little bit difficult to handle queen d7 is here and your advantage is felt here with the move rook a3 if you play rook a3 and bring the rook into the game like that you have a plus two and a half advantage with white why you have a lot of activity your piece is point at your opponent's king and this bishop is out of the game that bishop never reemerged because black never played the move c5 so liam didn't play that move fatino doesn't do that he plays bishop e3 queen d2 after which he still enjoys a pleasant position but this move gives it away that is not what he should have done instead he should have played knight to h5 knight takes e5 tak it on f6 tak it on e5 traded like this and then targeted these pawns and this is the way the engine gives white the advantage fasino doesn't find that he puts the rook there and he's no longer better not only is he no longer better it very quickly spins completely out of control because liam plays this move and suddenly it becomes abundantly clear liam is going to go here and that is when things are going to get really unpleasant for white because the knight is going to come to4 so for example bishop to b8 like knight is coming to f4 it's going to be very unpleasant so at this point foso says i'm sacrificing the bishop desperate stuff right he had a big time advantage he had he had a nice position rook h6 he's a big fighter but now this beautiful knight f4 disconnecting the pieces and falino has to trade and he's just lost he's lost plays rookie five he's just down a piece now he has two pawns for the piece but he's just down a piece now what black has to do here is play bishop to b8 and run the king to safety somehow he begins running the king to safety that's completely fine fasino plays knight h5 it's a good aggressive move but you trade another piece black is just up a bishop however it's you know white is trying to go here so what you should do with black is probably play bishop back to g8 after which there is literally nothing at all because queen g5 rook h8 like i mean black will very slowly consolidate and be okay but it's blitz and in blitz weird things happen like this move and it's not really clear what liam missed i think liam was so focused on this side of the board he was like queen g7 is smart because i'm going to put my queen on g8 if he goes rook h7 i'm pressuring him here pressuring him here he completely forgot he has a pawn hanging on the other side of the board that's a hanging bishop that's mate like queen d8 is straight up made in one so liam goes queen g7 and hangs the game rook h7 game over queen a5 falino fights gets the queen bishop d4 and now he has to convert this position he gives a check gives another check brings the bishop back it's not the most clean way cu he's going to lose the pwn in front of his king but he gives a check gives another check puts the king away and now we got we we still got a game on our hands rook b2 queen f4 but it's it's looking a little bit precarious bishop c3 bishop g6 and liam just lost on time liam had 1 second and he just lost on time after this move and it's not you know it's it's not the best like fasino is winning 100% but he's going to have to get these pawns going and in that time i black is solid you don't have any fork you don't have any forks like if you check the black king indefinitely i'll go king d6 queen f8 queen7 queen d7 king b6 like i'm going to run the safety i'm going to be safe i might even go forward by the way i might even go to c5 in fact king c5 is apparently better for black almost but falo kept fighting he sacrificed the piece he was lost but it's blitz it's complicated he kept the fight going and he beat liam and then he ended the tournament with the strong i this is not his best win because he beat he's definitely he beat hikaru in a blitz game but i mean it's ridiculous like again dude is 10 years old he learned chess like 2 three years ago how is this even possible it's absurd so his opponent here is ess the ryanan strong indian grandmas and we have a two nights caroan we have a caroan from black g6 by white but what okay just want to like apologize my allergies have been absolutely ridiculous like i wake up every day with a completely swollen face i've tried zertek i've tried claritin none of it works my eyes feel like they're going to explode that is why i'm like scratching my nose and why i just called this wh's move like that is yeah d4 principled move take take bishop g7 and h3 a very solid choice you don't allow black to put the bishop on g4 black plays knight f6 you actually can just trade here you don't mind black plays like this and falo is a very straightforward player he likes a straightforward game he likes to take the center he likes to develop his pieces he likes a straightforward game he likes to take the center he likes to take the center and he likes to develop his pieces and that's exactly what he does in this game bishop e4 rook d1 look at this i mean this is exactly how you are taught to play chess that's why he doesn't have to spend a lot of time on it he and you are not much different all right you might have a full-time job he doesn't have a mortgage to take care of you know but you might have kids that are his age you know what i'm saying but at the end of the day we all learn to put our pants on the same way backwards all right and then we realized there's a huge stain on them so my point being you got to develop your pieces you got to put pieces in the center of the board like he doesn't play that much differently from you then after that it gets you know a little bit different so now he plays bishop e3 the thing is now he spent 21 seconds and was like i don't actually know what my plan is here to be honest it's kind of tough so he over protects the center and black also brings his rook now what do you do in this position how do you beat a 3055 like i get paired against these guys and i'm like how do you even beat them okay you attack their pawns okay they protect their pawns now what's funny is that here this is a very tough move to defend against for black the best move for black is to lose the pawn in the corner and white can't even take it because after so rook a8 here rook b8 here knight e6 is a queen trap so you can't do that right can't b6 here would have been a nice move but he goes a6 and now f falino has some has some dark squares to work with he plays knight d2 targeting the bishop the bishop attacks his rook bastino attacks the bishop bishop goes here now knight b3 right very simple play we arey trying to beat the grandmas on the dark squares rook b8 best move here for white a move that is a bit tough to spot is g4 because the light scored bishop actually can't really move anywhere if it goes here it gets hit with knight c5 and various f3s f3 doesn't quite work because that bishop loses a protector but knight c5 is very powerful and if g4 bishop e6 yeah the engine just says knight c5 and like keep improving g4 is not a human move it's also not a foso move like i said he likes to keep things relatively straightforward he likes to have a quick a good plan he plays chess like an old man there's nothing wrong with that but it's a very annoying style to play against so he just he'll make improving moves like he doesn't care that was 1.3 this is 7 i'm improving the position of my bishop now black plays b6 kicking out the queen but still weaknesses queen d queen a4 now this is a smart move this is why black is a gm he trades off white's bishop because it's a better piece takes takes rook d1 so what i love about falo's chess he thinks for a little bit he doesn't over complicate things he doesn't look at c5 he doesn't look at he doesn't play knight d2 he spends 3.7 seconds just defending the pawn in the center his style is so good for blitz because it's so straightforward and he doesn't do anything goofy f5 knight d2 4 seconds spent on that move now the rook's got to go and now we put the knight back on f3 the knight did its job black weak in the position now we're looking at knight to e5 now black plays b5 now it's a moment white needs to spend some time do you take do you keep the tension he takes for the record i would not have taken i would have probably kept the tension like i said straightforward playing style he takes and he continues to target the side of the board with his queen the best move for black there was to probably take with the a pawn i don't know why but that's you know and now the knight goes to d5 now falino plays bishop g5 knight to e5 is the top choice of the engine trying to kind of open up the position he goes here attacking the rook and now he plays knight e5 same kind of concept knight back to d3 this is on the way bishop d4 is not possible i mean it might be is it knight c5 okay well now falino is just the pawn down did he blunder the pawn on d4 when went here like what what happened bishop d4 and okay now he's a pawn down he's pawn down but apparently it's not that bad it's not that bad black has six pawns but look at black's pawns six pawns all on light squares which means this guy is about to feast on stuff absolutely feast on stuff the knight goes back to f6 falino plays rook d8 finally he's down a little bit on time rook d8 black spends a little bit of time should he block with something should he trade rook should he just ignore and play king g7 he trades and blocks with the knight every single piece in black's position is on a light square i mean it's very funny looking right how is fao going to break through rook c8 it's no threat yet but that's kind of the idea also very useful white cannot get mated always make sure your king has a getaway queen to e4 now this is just a multi-purpose move but the straightup plan is also queen e1 and queen f2 like you just want to win a pawn meanwhile while white's plan is to put pressure on the black king that's really the only thing that you can do so the bishop goes back to d2 what i love is he spent two seconds on that move you know how many people here including myself would freeze up at the thought of like not being able to break through and panic and he just he spends two seconds and is like i'm going to bring the bishop there and then put the bishop there and then play a3 and then i'm going to put all my stuff on dark squares and that's the setup that we're going for he doesn't need to think about it because he has a feel for it he's not worried about queen b1 he's not worried about these pawns because of queen b2 he's still going to go here attack the queen and he's threatening mate queen e2 is the only thing that you can do and then maybe queen d4 like it's it's he has a feel for it black plays f4 f4 is a blunder which is so ridiculous f4 is a blunder because actually you can play f3 and this absurd looking move attacks the queen but there's no check cuz everything is covered and now this is a target you actually with black do not have a move that protects the knight on e8 and the pawn on f4 you don't let me explain because if you play queen e5 which is the only other way to protect both of these things i go here and suddenly suddenly you're in trouble what you should have done here is you should have gone to e2 which it's tough to explain the difference of so now you play king h2 and foso is winning he is winning on the dark squares which is not something oh my god these allergies are killing me which is i've developed mucus just sitting here you didn't have to know what's inside my nose but you're watching my video and this is just an out loud therapy session yo my nose is itchy again oh my god if there is an allergy spray company that wants to sponsor this channel please save my life it's ridiculous i have seasonal allergies and they are horrible i don't even i can't even fathom what it's like to be allergic to nuts pause like it's oh my god h5 you know what indian lad is allergic to protecting his dark squares all right queen d7 but where's the breakthrough where's the breakthrough like you still can't get in look at that that's fancy okay oh the idea is queen here right yeah but what if what if this well as it turns out you're supposed to put your queen on d8 and rook on b8 so in this position rook b8 is the key idea and actually black doesn't have a move like if black plays king h7 now you go here and if black goes back now you play rook b7 and black doesn't have a move and if this you take it and it's made on h8 in the corner so that's what falo he had to find that which is not really findable which is why he did did it this way and lost all his advantage so he loses all his advantage and suddenly the grandmaster is coming down with g4 and i would lose this game 10 times out of nine okay i would i would lose so bad in one of the games they would give my opponent two points like once you realize you don't actually have a winning idea well the winning idea is you have to play you know 20 48 with your pieces you guys remember that game like boop boop boop boop oh my god like this yeah and suddenly g4 and falino was completely lost completely lost crazy wait but gotham you said he won this game yeah that's what i said because again he's a fighter and you win games at this level defensively as well pawn takes g4 pawn takes g4 this is mate this is made in a couple of moves he goes here g3 check king up to h3 he's got to otherwise he was m it on the back rank king h3 how are you going to survive this position well you're going to survive it by making it difficult for your opponent believe it or not black is only winning here with one move and that move is unfindable it's not findable it doesn't even make sense the move the winning move here for black is the move b4 because if you take you get off of this diagonal and queen e5 queen h5 is checkmate you see black would have loved to get the queen to h5 but it's not possible so you got to go b4 that is the win wi move let's there's no square for the bishop rook e6 this is a check then you take on c3 b4 he doesn't find it and now falino is back in business and falino misses his chance because there was queen f8 there he goes here the best move now for black is to go to to an end game but you don't always have the ego to go to an end game against the 10-year-old child you go here and fatino hits you with a tactic from the top rope king h5 queen of seven king h6 and now we give a check we give a check we hang the game one last time knight the g5 check blocks a check with a check and straight up wins the game and now white is winning that is the move that he had to find by the way right here he had to bring his king the hero the hero has to play king to g4 you could probably win with bishop f6 as well but there is knight to g5 and you it's like a tricky queen end game he has to bring the king he finds the idea but a move late and he's actually losing now because knight g5 and now he's winning and some of these were absolute nail biters he also here misses maiden one not that this is maiden one he finds mateon whatever is going to be mate here and you know black black goes down and falino ends with d so he wins some crazy games he beats liam in a in a wild game where he was lost for a moment he defended he fought and then liam blundered under pressure this game was bananas both opponents trading haymakers and ultimately he comes out on top this was a crazy game against kbov an incredible defensive effort like he wins games defensively and offensively he wins games when he's better from the opening his opponent like in this game he had to find a second life against me you know he had to get like a whole new breath of air and then keep playing he's really good on time he's good defensively he plays simple straightforward positional chess he's like 3,000 on chess.com and he just finished higher than magnus and hikaro with n and a half out of 11 and tied for second place and those guys only got nine would they beat him in head-to-head matches yeah but magnus is like the goat and hikaru is like number one number two on any given day in rapping and blitz chess and bullet chess but this kid is 10 years old it's absurd that's all i have for you today get out of here
