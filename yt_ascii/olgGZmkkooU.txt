i've been doing work recently in myths and misconceptions related to cyber security and i thought i would discuss one of the biggest myths that we don't really understand what cyber security is if we look at characteristics of a common field and let's think of something like chemistry or medicine or psychology these fields have a history associated with them there is an accepted body of knowledge that everyone practicing in the field is generally aware of some generally accepted references books standards other things and common terminology that they use now when those aren't fully developed we end up having myths and misconceptions and folklore that people fill in to explain what they're using and how they're doing things and again to sort of go back and look at chemistry for instance very early on the alchemists who were the early chemists talked about finding a philosopher stone or other kinds of things that now we view as as well i won't say nonsense but certainly uninformed and in medicine the going back to the ancient greeks talking about the four bodily humors and how they had to be in balance and that was the cause of disease so so once science advances beyond a certain point we are able to dispel these myths but some of them tend to hang around for a while i'm going to say cyber security is not a new field it is not the same as computing cyber security involves other things but we have a history that goes back into the mid 1960s which is not that long ago when you compare it to other more established disciplines but one of the very first items describing cyber security issues although not by that name was the wear report cheered by willis wear project multic that was started a couple years after that to explore operating system architecture and security issues the anderson report by jim anderson that was a follow on to the wear report and then an early series defining secure computing system systems the rainbow series that included what was known as the orange book in the us the trusted computer systems evaluation criteria that came out in 83 and thereafter similar kinds of standards were issued in other countries but these are all the early precursors of the field that define that we really did have a history and an organization not only that we have developed over time a number of standard common bodies of knowledge we also have organizations government organizations and others setting standards of behavior and standards of compliance in the us nist created the cyber security framework and that's been widely adopted around the world by a number of countries as a set of controls and standards for how to protect systems we have international organizations like isaka and isc squared the british standards organiz ation the iso all have set various standards relating to cyber security practice so the field is becoming more defined we also have a number of standard references and textbooks in the area matt bishop's very definitive work on computer security the textbooks fleer bivan anderson's wonderful security engineering book that he wrote as a professor at cambridge william stallings book so we have standard textbooks and these are used not only for teaching but as reference items we also have common terms of art that are peculiar to cyber security for instance when we talk about a virus we're not talking about the biological virus we are talking about something that alters and embeds itself in computer software on our computers ransom is a term of art that does not get used anywhere other than in cyber security when we talk about return oriented programming or r that's another term that has become unique to cyber security and we have other terms like side channel and and others that are there so if we look at this set of characteristics this really matches what i said about defining a field cyber security as a field is becoming more defined over its 60 or so years of existence and i'll note here that it is much more than just computing which is why i said it's not really a subset of computing because it also involves issues of psychology economics law communication theory and other kinds of issues that are outside the realm of traditional computing the word cloud i have here actually is related to that we look at these and we see these as things that are related to cyber security but these terms are all more oriented towards relationships of people and organizations well given all of that context we can say okay cyber security is a field good why do we have such problems with it and i'll say it's because of one myth that we've sort of glossed over with all of this in the idea that we have a clear definition of cyber security and i'll show you why that really isn't true and i'll do that sort of walking through some some analysis of potential definition really part of it gets to the root of what is security we use the term security in a lot of ways we talk about national security we talk about personal security data security and others if we're a company and somebody does something wrong we tell them to call security but what does it really mean in the 60s when some of the experts were doing the initial work and they were analyzing computer security they realized that it's an unattainable goal and i'll show you that in a moment so they then started talking about trusted systems rather than secure systems the idea of building computers that we could trust to execute according to of policy well that also turned out to be extraordinarily difficult and actually unreachable and so they switched terms to the idea of trustworthy systems that lasted for a while became also difficult to justify and the terminology changed to the idea of resilience systems so in the early part of this century many of the people working in the film in the field started talking about computer system resiliency of late we've now moved away even from that because that also seems to be a somewhat vague term and we talk about risk risk factors risk reduction risk abatement is this where we'll end up as a definition area not sure but i will say that without a clear definition of cyber security or some one of these these terms we can't build appropriate metrics and without metrics it's very difficult to determine if some new development advancement or configuration is both an improvement and worth the investment metrics are critically important for defining any scientific or engineering field and are very important for making progress it's also the question here about whatever definition we have how is it related to safety and to privacy both are concepts that repeatedly appear whenever we talk about security so where we are now is basically with folk wisdom old concepts and sort of vague notions let me give you an example here if we start with an intuitive definition that a system is secure if it's protected against all forms of threat that would seem to be what most people would nod their heads at and say yes that's a good definition not being away then where does that take us well if we start examining that and we start thinking can we achieve it can we protect against random hackers oh yeah i think most trained cybercity professionals with available tools and technologies can keep the random individuals out of their systems almost all the time malware things like computer viruses and ransomware probably if you have people who are focused and paying close attention to what's going on how about nation state hackers this would be in the area of espionage or conflict and they're probably not the the countries that are practicing cyber warfare or cyber espionage have a lot of resources and many talented people and have shown time and again that they're able to penetrate even good resources so there there's an example where our security perhaps isn't quite so good but it's even worse than that can we protect our systems against the ufo invasion no now here's a threat picture a threat model that we don't understand it hasn't occurred before that that we know of and therefore we don't know what we need to protect against what defenses what indicators and warnings and so we're effectively not protected at all against something like this we could send in jeff gold blum right if we had jeff gold blum with a properly configured macintosh yes if we plant a virus into that mother ship yeah but that's exactly it how about an extinction event meteor impact yeah there's no way that your it staff is going to protect against that and and that wouldn't be the first priority in any event if this were to occur effectively all of our computing resources would be disabled and destroyed although we wouldn't necessarily have a population who wanted to use them but you're thinking how about if we set up some mars colonies and we send them backup tapes of all our data and our cat videos will that preserve them and well that's not a bad idea for a number of reasons but eventually the heat death of the sun when it expands into a red giant will consume all of the inner planets including mars and that's the end of that strategy but if you're again sort of thinking ahead here you sort of say well we're not confined to the solar system best projections now is that there will be a heat death of the universe eventually and all computing will come to an end and in that regard we've also lost the security battle what this illustrates is a couple things first of all that it's not a helpful definition because we can never actually achieve it and second it also shows that that security generally is an economics issue more than an engineering task or at least as part of an engineering task because engineering requires an investment and we can build in safeguards of increasing complexity and and difficulty of penetration given a threat model we can never reach 100% and that the increase in what we have to spend may not be worth what we're protecting so as a definition of cyber security what i just showed you doesn't really work very well let's try a different approach and look at system design rather than protecting an existing system can we do something better well research in the 1970s 1980s when some of this was originally done looked at the idea of system state and any of you have looked at computing a little more formally know the idea of state that's the value that's in memory and registers on a system and if we start off by saying we're going to define a set of states as okay or secure and we can do that according to a formal model and i mentioned a couple security models here bella laula or bba you don't need to you don't need to worry about those unless you've studied them but the idea is that we can have a policy that says what a safe state is as the system executes as the computer runs through its instructions it changes state it goes from one state to another and as long as valid operations result in the system still being in one of those allowed states it's still secure but that implies and in truth there are bad states or unsafe or unsecure states and those are ones we don't want to occur we don't want to enter one of those bad states and we especially don't want remain in there so we enter a bad state and stay an operation in that bad state or cease operation entirely so the notion of allowed states is a match to the concept of system specification in software engineering the execution of a state that's not in a specification is a fault that can result in a failure a failure in a protected system is a security failure and i note that security was a driver in the development of software engineering but we're not limited to just non-secure and secure states we also have undefined states because in a computing system with any appreciable amount of memory not to mention multiple uh processors that are involved we're going to have so many states we can't define all of them and some of them are undefined those are not part of the specification if program execution enters one of those undefined states that's an error and it may or may not be a fault it could possibly lead to abnormal behavior or a security problem some of those undefined states we may enter and they'll lead back to an okay state but they're undefined so we don't know well this is what program state space probably really looks like is we have a small number of specified secure states and a larger set of specified unsafe unsecure states but a huge universe of states we have no idea what is going on in those systems so this is what it would look like if we had specifications but the problem is that very few bits of software reuse have been formally specified the programs that we download or that wey buy from major vendors generally are not specified they're built according to an informal ad hoc specification and very often they're modified on the fly without any kind of careful design and consideration for what the system should be so one of my favorite quotes a program that's not been specified cannot be incorrect it can only be surprising this is the current state of cyber security really if we're going to be accurate most of the behaviors that we say are security problems are not really a failure of design or a failure of building they're a surprise because the software is behaving in a way that we didn't anticipate it's a surprise it's not a good surprise in many cases but it shouldn't be a surprise because we haven't built the software carefully to begin with so that's in summary a little bit of where we are now with the whole idea of cyber security we have surprises we don't know how to build systems correctly in the general case and we don't invest enough to build them correctly and we don't have the personnel necessary to build them correctly so we're still searching for that alcher the alchemist stone to try to buy and add on to our systems or trying to apply leeches to get the systems to behave appropriately but that isn't really the the underlying solution we have to go back to first principles and do a better job on design if we do that if we can come up with that better definition of design it will help us in future generation of systems of architecture of software it will enhance our communication across disciplines support development of better tools and of course metrics which will allow us to decide appropriate investment so all of this requires that we really understand what we're doing and get away from the myths and the misconceptions and the folklore that we've been using up to this point and with that i'll i'll state this has been part of an ongoing project where i've worked with some others to try to document some of these myths and misconceptions that we've been applying over the years and cyber security in particular here's information where you can find out more it made me think actually the idea of going back to first principles i mean there are so it's so complex isn't it we've got hardware we've got operating systems we've got user experience we've got software sitting on that that you know if we're still at the stage of if the witch floats she's witch if she thinks she's not a wit you know do you see what i'm saying how how do you return to first principles in a system that's already so complicated this is related to the economic issue of sun cost we have such a huge investment in infrastructure training software that people are loathed to throw that out and go back to first principles part of what those of us in academia and some industry are doing in research is trying to develop better systems there's probably not enough attention being paid to that area of research i've certainly run into issues where talking to people they're not interested in research for better security unless it works on linux or windows on an intel processor well right there we've set constraints that may not be appropriate if we develop something that works better then demonstrating that in isolated environments is helpful now we do have some better secured systems that are in use in nuclear power in avionics in space but they're expensive and without good metrics it's difficult to justify using those solutions in the commercial marketplace like at banks or or online vendors so it's it's a it's a complex ecosystem here government is getting involved now in various venues around the world the the eu great they're they're in the uk in the us we're seeing more pressure on building secure systems and better better accounting for what we do and that may help change the economic balance a little bit but it's evolving and we have to keep in mind it really the field is young and it will take some time before this all settles out you mentioned there the kind of leg legislation side of it but while we're still in this period of effectively running around plugging holes and writing spaghetti code to fix problems that we find that we didn't anticipate we were going to find there's there's always got to be that balance between convenience you know practicality and you know cost as well as kind of security hasn't it because you know you can make even modern computer relatively safe if you disconnect it from everything but then you lose the convenience right right and again this comes down to not being able to evaluate the trade-offs well if we can't measure the difference in how secure safe price private our systems are if we connect or if we connect in a certain way it's difficult for anyone to make a judgment about is it worth it to me to do so so right now we have lots of people making that decision on a feeling that it's a it's it's an acceptable kind of risk or that we have to do it this way to be able to be in business and if they don't know what the alternative are and they don't know how to measure it they can't really make a fully informed choice and the other thing i was thinking was can we use existing technology to bootstrap some of these ideas to you know use some kind of machine learning system to say right okay if we started from scratch you might the system that's designing it might not be able to run on it almost like the blacksmith who makes the sharper tool from the sharp tool is that something that maybe maybe something you are researching or how do you come up with this specification i suppose some people are looking at that we actually have developed techniques over the years and architectures that work well it's a matter of can we convince people to use them the i i mentioned sunk cost as one of the issues probably the biggest issue we have is complexity that because of sun cost what we do is add on new layers we put in new tools new boundaries we move things into virtual machines we move things into cloud environments all in an attempt to address a certain set of problems but what they actually end up doing is add to the complexity and complexity is where unanticipated unknown failures occur where because we don't understand whole system design well attackers can find flaws and seams and we have to get away from that idea of just adding more even in the the environment where we have the the free software environment or some of the new popular programming methodologies the agile programming none of those are really oriented towards removing old code they're they're more towards adding new features and all of that just leads to greater complexity at at the time of the of the wear report and for 20 years after any of us graduating with with an advanced degree in computing and some who just on their own we could teach someone else everything from the bare circuitry up to the human computer interface and how it all worked and how it all fit together i would contend there's no person alive who can do that anymore because the systems have gotten so complex and that means that no one really understands how the whole system works and where the problems are so that's another aspect of the the misconception is the idea that adding more makes things better or that patching is somehow security those are real enemies of security because they add to complexity because what these languages are doing is they're allowing you to express a problem and a solution to the problem that you have in terms of a computer binary now for our second counter let's record whatever the value of the tape head is which is either going to be zero and one but we can use
