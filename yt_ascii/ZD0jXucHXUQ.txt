today we're going to be looking at the national video game museum which is where i work my name is connor clark and i'm going to give you a tour of the museum today it's kind of like cribs isn't it it's like gaming cribs museum cribs i suppose the museum isn't open yet so it might look a little bit quiet but it's gonna be very loud because well video games are quite loud first thing you see when you get into the museum is this machine here which is raquette okay this game raket is a rocket ship flying game it's quite quite simple but it's slightly complicated in how you control the rocket ship so if you have a look here instead of using a normal controller we've employed a makey makey to turn various fruits and vegetables into the controller we feel this exemplifies what the museum wants to do which instead of having a kind of a chronological look at video games from the start to the end which is great we actually want to kind of deconstruct and kind of explode what people might expect from video games so this is playing around with what we think a controller can be so we press the spoon to start and then we can use the banana and the orange to actually fly our rocket and see if we can land on the blue platform there we're going to crash but we've got way more to see so let's not dwell on this too much so the way the museum is constructed is that we have different bundles of video games each tied together by a certain concept this could be anything really this first bundle is called you are here which are all games that have been made in sheffield and kind of become super super successful the first one we see is tangled which is made by matt phillips this is just a small demo i use to teach programming a few other games on the you are here bundle are some games from sumo digital which are one of the biggest uk game development studios and are literally based just down the road but also we have zul which are from which was made by gremlin graphics which obviously a highly highly influential video game company so there's a few other bundles you might be able to see such as words per minute which is about typing video games there's the tough bundle which is all about really really hard games there's a brilliant bundle here which is actually done in partnership with special effects a special effect or a charity that create controllers for people with perhaps disabilities physical disabilities they might not be able to kind of play games using traditional controllers so they worked with xbox to create this thing right here this is the xbox adaptive controller essentially you can use a 3.5 millimeter input just as you would for kind of any headphones audio and you can plug anything in and show all of the different buttons we've got kind of the the right d-pad button the up d-pad button and the downloader button all across the kind of the y x and b buttons as well so essentially we can play forza horizon using just this joystick it controls every aspect of the car and you can basically just fly around the the wilderness of scotland it's brilliant for people that might have kind of disabilities and aren't able to play games in traditional ways alongside our bundles we also have other kind of games that are really cool and often you can only play here in the museum one of them which you can explain at home so i think it's only the app store but not in this way it's called inks now this is a very large digital pinball machine so using inks you can play pinball but it works with paint and we can kind of digitally paint on the screen whilst playing pinball it's really really cool how it works is it's a very very large ipad you can even see the top of the screen there and it's put in this huge kind of built pinball machine with buttons on either side and it's it's amazing it's really really cool i'm not good at pinball there we go so one of the missions of the museum is to collect and preserve gaming ephemera and gaming memorabilia from all across kind of video game history so we have our kind of quite traditional museum things and we have the big glass cabinets where we have all of our what we think are really kind of influential gaming objects such as the magnavox odyssey which is the first ever video game console it was actually released in 1972 and was made by ralph baer we have some special editions here the the master chief helmet is a kind of particularly favorite one of mine but stuff like this the fallout pit boy and the call of duty special editions we have a hand-held gaming exhibit here with various game boys also kind of other things such as the barcode battler astro wars smaller kind of video game consoles we also have a very very pretty playstation portable that is probably one of my favorite items in the entirety of the museum so this is all but kind of a small part of our collection really we have a lot of other things that we're storing in nottingham in one of our big kind of collections that we're hosting with the universities over there this is our versus cabinet which is all about kind of mortal kombat or street fighter ii which one were you were you super nintendo or master system or mega drive i personally was a super nintendo the snares with street fighter ii however i get a lot of stick flat here at the museum but you know and then we have a controller section as well all about different controllers we have including some wireless atari controllers which is is really really cool and from the kind of the 70s one of the big flagship exhibits we have in the museum is platform 14 which is the all of these kind of huge screens we have along the side here this exhibit explores the concept of porting a video game and the video game we've chosen to start with is donkey kong so we have the original kind of arcade version of donkey kong right here it's a very pretty looking game released kind of in 1981 in the arcades but it was so successful that everybody wanted a piece of it and they wanted to port it to each one of the different consoles so what we've done is we've got other versions of the ports of that game playable along these screens so alongside the original arcade we have the nez version we have the commodore 64 version we have the game boy version the atari 2600 and 7800 as well and my particular favorite is this one the trs-80 version when you compare this to the original arcade it is vastly different in regards to kind of graphics and also in regards to the sound but it still plays and feels like donkey kong which i think is a testament to the nature of the port i don't want to show myself up because i'm actually not very good at donkey kong it's incredibly difficult game so i know she got them all running on the same kind of controller i mean was that is that a tricky thing to do not particularly no so they all the these versions are all emulated we actually have a mixture of emulated games and games running on the natural hardware such as the mario and sonic exhibit right here the reason we do that is because we're able to play around with games a little bit more for example with this kind of screen here if we were to have each of these running on their original hardwares they all have different resolutions that they play at and it's not easy to kind of compare the differences so if we emulate them we're very easily able to compare what are the graphical differences of each game this cabinet kind of explores why we need a video game museum for example we do have the pre-owned prices of some fifa games here that obviously last year's installment fifa 19 is worth 25 pounds but as soon as you get to the next one on flat for' it drops significantly and by the time we get to 15 they're worth pennies we don't think video games even old video games are worth pennies we think they all should be saved we also have a lot of our broken stuff here obviously because we have lots and lots of people coming in playing all of our games we go through a lot of controllers and a lot of hardware very quickly oftentimes we're able to recycle those or users in other ways but sometimes we just keep the broken ones and then we exhibit them as well on this back wall we do have a bunch of arcade machines as well wouldn't be a video game museum without a few kind of classic arcade cabinets such as space invaders we have miss pac-man and another donkey kong just for good measure one thing we really like is this cabin over here which is dancing stage fusion or it was known as ddr in other places outside of the uk so what's really fun about this is that one time it broke and we had to get inside and kind of play around with it and make see if we could fix it and we found as we're playing around with it that there was a slot for a playstation 2 memory card and upon closer inspection we actually found that this entire machine is essentially a commercial ps2 running inside of it it's no different to normal ps2 you can put controllers in you can plug in other memory cards with your high scores from other machines yeah but then we get over here which is probably my favorite part of the museum it's called the lab because it is about exploring what makes a video game and kind of distilling it down so we do have a lot of old development units which you might have seen before but they're all really interesting there's an old nintendo dolphin and the gamecube test kit there the ds kit we do have the old playstation 2 development kit as well funny story behind this one this was originally from free radical which is a studio that was based in nottingham in the uk this machine itself actually was used to make the original time splitters game on playstation 2. so i took a picture of this unit and posted it on social media from the museum because i thought it was really fun and it's a cool little looking unit and we had someone that used to work for free radical comments on that tweet saying oh was that one of the units that was stolen it was like oh what stolen really why i didn't collect this this machine so i had no idea if it was stolen or not but there were a few development kits that were stolen around a similar time this isn't one of them i made sure of it but there was a panic in my chest that we were holding stolen guns at the museum for a split second but fine now as well as exhibiting the past and presence of video games we also want to have a quick peek into the future of games here at the museum as well so we have this section here which is all about in development and currently unreleased gains essentially we as a museum reach out to independent creators of video games small teams and we say we really like your work how would you feel about us exhibiting it in a museum so people can see a game in progress these include games such as aerobat super lunary which is a fascinating little game one of my favorite ones of these in development games is something like drink more glur which is this fun little olympic style party game which is really fun and we get so many people coming in and playing these games having such a fun time and what we can do is is ask those people about feedback on these games so if they really like drink water or or maybe they didn't like to know about drama club we can take that on board and then we can even feed that back to the creators as well the y velocity to eight and then we're going to enter this infinite loop here so we're going to add the player's x velocity to z zero we're gonna add the player's y velocity to d one and then we're gonna jump back up and we're gonna the problem is there you have to go right from the very end of the game which in chess you you can't do there's just too many possibilities [music]
