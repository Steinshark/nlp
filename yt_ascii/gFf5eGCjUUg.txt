hi everyone in this video we're going to be creating a simple walk animation for our character i'm going to start by splitting the view into so that i can has a animation window open at the same time so i'm going to left-click drag on these little diagonal lines up in the top right here and so let me drag out a separate window and we'll change the editor type to dopesheet and change the mode here to action editor i'll then click to create a new action and i'll call this action my walk i'll also press this f key to make sure that that action gets saved and we can then go into pose mode on our armature now i've created this little reference sheet showing the five main poses of our walk starting with the contact pose then the down pose the passing pose the up pose and finally the you reverse contact pose so let's begin by creating our first contact pose so from side view i'm going to grab one of these ikea bones and just bring the leg forward a little bit on the y-axis and also rotate it so that the foot is pointing up and then i'll grab the hip bone and just move this down on the z axis until the heel of the foot is touching the ground and until the leg also has a slight bend we can then also bring this other leg back rotate the foot a bit and rotate the toes so that there are sort of flat with the ground all right something like that i also like to grab the hips and just rotate the whole body forward slightly so the character is leaning a little bit into the walk and i'll rotate the head back just to keep the eyes facing straight forward i'll end you into the front view and here we can see that the legs are spread quite far apart so i want to bring them in a little bit on the x-axis but i want to be careful that i move both legs in by the same amount so i mean should pay attention to the number down at the bottom left of the screen you can see how that changes as i move this in and so it looks like i'm moving it in about negative point zero five five five so let me actually just type in negative point zero five five and i'll enter that and then i'll grab the other one and this will be moving in the positive x-direction so i press g x and 0.055 alright i'll then pose the arms so i'll bring this in a little bit closer to the body and i'm going to loosen the hand a bit like so and this arm is on the same side as the forward leg so it's going to be rotated back at this point and i'll have you rotate the shoulder back a little bit as well like so all right and i'll just copy those bones press control-c and shift ctrl v to paste it over on to the other side of course in this case the shoulder will be rotated forward something like that alright and ready want to press r twice to enter trackball rotation and just swing the arm and the hand in front of the body a little bit now we need to think about the rotation of these three bones here so because this leg is currently forward the hips are going to be rotated in this direction away from the currently forward leg but because this arm is forward at the moment the chest is going to be rotating along with it in that direction so let's grab this hip bone i'll press r and enzi little down shift to make the rotation as quite gradual i'll just rotate this a little bit like so and i'm going to grab the spine bone and it's going to rotate counter to that sedative remains forward and then the chest bone will be rotating with the arms like so just a little bit like that now the neck is going to try and keep the head as stable as possible something to rotate that back just so that it tries to remain pointing forwards all right all of that rotation is changed the arms a little bit so i'm listening to tweak the pose slightly bring a little bit further away from the body something like that i think is fairly good for our first pose so i mean to select all of the bones then i just want to make sure that the playhead which is this green line here is on the first frame so i can press shift left arrow to jump to frame one and then with the cursor of a 3d view and we'll press i to bring up the insert keyframe menu and we'll insert keyframes for the location and rotation of all of the selected bones now or to save having to deal with that pop up menu every time we can just set our keyframe type here to location and rotation and then when we press i it will automatically insert frames for location and rotation all right i now want to create the reverse contact pose so a misra press control-c once again with the mouse over the 3d view because when you're working with split for you you do have to be careful where the mouse is when you're pressing these shortcuts because shortcuts mean a different thing in the dopesheet than they do in the 3d view a lot of the time so ctrl c to copy the pose and then this is going to be a twelve frame walk animation so i'm going to skip ahead twelve frames to frame thirteen and i'll press shift ctrl v to paste the flip pose and press i to insert keyframes for that since our animation is only 13 frames long let's err zoom in a lucha so it can use the mouse wheel to zoom and middle mouse drag to move the view around alright so that's a little better and we can scroll through here to get a feel for animation or we can just press alt a to actually play it now currently it doesn't look terribly interesting so let's come to our middle frame frame seven and create the passing position so in this pose the leg that works forward so the characters left leg here is going to be sort of directly below the body and it seems to be flat with the ground so press alt r to clear the rotation and just bring that down we set axis here and also clear the rotation on the toes the back leg will just be sort of swinging past at this point now clear the rotation on the toes there as well and the hips are going to be a tiny bit higher up something like alright i'll select all of the bones and press i to insert a keyframe once again and that's starting to look a little bit more interesting we will now go on to frame 4 which is a force halfway between our first contact pose and the passing position and here we'll have our down pose so in this pose the front foot is going to be down on the ground the hips are going to be at their lowest point in the walk something like left maybe and this leg is going to be still back and the toes are going to be just about ready to leave the ground i'll select all the bones press i trance at a frame and that's play through that it's looking ok elango should frame 10 for our a pose so for this pose i want to bring the hips up a little bit on the z-axis like so and i'll flatten this foot out a bit something like that i should set a keyframe and let's have a look so i think that's looking quite nice let's go into front view and have a look from there to get a proper idea of what it looks like though we're going to need to actually animate the second step now since the second step is of course just a mirror image of the first step we thankfully don't have to animate it by hand what we'll do is first make sure that all of the keyframes are selected here in the dope sheet so it should all be highlighted in orange if they aren't then it's as simple as pressing a and we also want to make sure that all of the bones here in the dope sheet summary are selected as well so when they're selected there will be highlighted in white as mine currently are so to select them you just put your mouse over the dope sheet summary and press a so now i've deselected mine obviously but i can press a once again to select them and then with the mouse of the dope sheet view of press ctrl c to copy all of these keyframes and then when we paste them it's going to paste around the playhead so make sure the playhead is here on frame 13 and i'll press shift ctrl v and it's now pasted in all of the reverse keyframes so our animation now ends on frame 25 but frame 25 is of course just the same as frame 1 so we actually want our animation to end on frame 24 and then you loop back to frame 1 so i'm going to set the end frame here to 24 and i can then press alt a to play the animation and here we can see our trap walking now we decide for you and have a look here and i think it's looking relatively okay all right now there's a a little bit of tweaking that i want to do so before i go and make any modifications i want to delete the second half of the animation that we copied over so that we're only making changes to the first half just to avoid any duplicate work and then once we've done that we can go and copy the changes over once again so i want to delete these last four columns of keyframes so i'm going to shift right click on the top keyframe over here to deselect that whole column and i'll press x and delete keyframes the first thing i'd like to do is just have this front foot slap down on the ground a little bit faster to help emphasize the weight of the character so country is taking three frames to become level with the ground so what i'm going to do is come on to frame two here and make it almost already level with the ground and maybe have the toes trailing behind a little bit all right i'll select those two bones i've changed and insert a keyframe for them and then on frame three are the i cable is going to be completely flat so press alt r and the toes can still be trailing behind on such a frame hmm maybe the toe should actually flash as well at this point so i'll change that okay and then i'd like to apply the same floppy toe idea to this other toe as it as the photos were being dragged forward the token maybe bend back a little bit so i think you add a keyframe on the toe here where it's just being lifted off the ground and on the next frame it can maybe be bent back a little bit like so and i'll make it still bench here on frame seven and then it slowly straightens out by frame ten all right we can perhaps apply the same idea to the hands so as the arm rotates back the hands can sort of trail behind a little bit like so so insert a keyframe on that and in such a key frame on this so hopefully i'll make it look just a little bit less rigid so i know i want to go ahead and get my second step back so i need to press a to select all of the key frames here i'll hover over the dopesheet summary and press a to select all of those and then ctrl c put my playhead on frame 13 and shift ctrl v and let's not play this alright i'll hide the bones so you can get a proper view of our character here and this is looking fairly okay of course i encourage you to continue tweaking things your heart's content but i'm going to be stopping here in the next episode we'll be doing some more animation in particular creating a run cycle so until then cheers
