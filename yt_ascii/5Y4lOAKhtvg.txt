this is the galaxy s 10 plus it's new and sophisticated and one of the biggest questions is going to be how does it stack up against the iphone so let's find out i'm also launching a mega galaxy s 10 give away with everything up or pro rules will be in the description below so both phones are structurally sound solid with no flexing but the iphone feels comparatively bulky the thickness is almost identical but at 208 grams the iphone almost feels a little awkward in contrast with the 175 gram s 10 plus and samsung's curves are a little more palm fluttering so if it's around at the hand both phones are ip 68 rated against water and dust but samsung wins a few points here it keeps the headphone jack and still offers microsd card support up to an extra 500 gigs if the display is important to you and let's face it it probably is that i think s 10 plus beats the iphone in pretty much every category its screen is a fraction smaller at 6.4 inches versus 6.5 but it wins in a lot of key areas it has a screen to body ratio of 93.1% higher than apple's 80 4.4 and has an even higher peak brightness of 1200 nits which by the way is one of if not the brightest display on a phone ever so even broad daylight is not going to cause a problem the spin off of this is that the new s 10 phones all support hdr 10 plus which is kind of like a new standard for contrast and so even though videos do look fantastic on the iphone this is another level it's also a quad hd plus panel which gives it a pixel density of about 530 over the iphones 458 whether the average person will be able to tell a difference is a different question but what you will be able to tell is that samsung has replaced the knotch with something i think is a little sleeker the hole-punch camera now it's worth bearing in mind that the iphones notch isn't exactly there to look pretty it contains a whole bunch of sensors that scan your face in three dimensions making it pretty much the most to secure way to unlock your phone it has kind of a ridiculously low one-in-a-million chance of failing compared to samsung's roughly 50,000 it's kind of personal preference which one you prefer but just bear in mind that with the iphone no option for fingerprint and locking and with the samsung you don't have the option for any kind of 3d face unlock including iris scanning which has been dropped for these phones this is the first time we're seeing an ultrasonic can display fingerprint scanner though which means it will be more reliable than most equivalents and even work when your hands are wet cameras the iphone tellus max has very recognizable looking images because of apple's implementation of smart hdr pictures almost look a little artificial but consistently good samsung's is different the stm plus introduces a triple camera setup which has a standard wide angle and a telephoto lens just like the iphone but with a third poultra wide lens and with a 123 degree field of view this is one of the widest ultra whites i've ever used you can fit a lot into one frame it's a little early to say anything conclusive about camera quality but from the time i've spent with it the image quality and the image processing looks pretty similar to last year's versions but the live focus portrait mode is noticeably better neither phone has a dedicated night mode that you can switch on at will but the s10 can take long exposure night shots you just can't decide when you have to wait for the ai to decide when it thinks it's dark enough samsung also mentioned that the s10 is their first phone that can shoot super steady video but what exactly that means we're gonna have to spend more time with it to find out you've probably noticed by now although the s10 plus has not one but two cameras on the front which theoretically means more reliable portrait selfies but the iphone does already do this pretty well with just one in fact the iphone has the ability to capture high dynamic range better than almost any other selfie camera and from what i've seen so far that remains true compared to the s10 plus as well but again need a bit more time with that depending on which region you get it in the s10 plus is going to be powered by eight gigs of ram and either the snapdragon 855 or the xc90 820 both powerful chips but the comparison with apple isn't exactly one where people reach a consistent agreement on the benchmarks will tell you one thing but they're not really built to compare scores between ios and android essentially it's close i've used devices with all these chips and probably the safest conclusion is just that whether you go for the i-4 or the samsung you're getting a bleeding edge mobile performance samsung has got a vapor chamber inside for extra cooling but to be honest in my opinion the most underrated feature here is support for the next generation of wi-fi wi-fi 6 which is not just faster but can keep up even in congested areas like stadiums or conferences as well as the standard s 10 plus there's also an ultimate performance edition which will probably also be the ultimate expensive edition with 12 gigs of ram and up to one terabyte internal storage so you probably know that the open tennis max is running ios 12.1 and the galaxy s 10 plus is going to ship with android 9 you've probably already made up your mind over which operating system you're into android is open and customizable and ios is very slick but tightly controlled i do like samsung's new one ui skin much cleaner and more intuitive and the phone comes with a new and improved bixby smart assistant which will go head-to-head with apple's siri the one unambiguous thing worth mentioning is that the iphone is going to stay up to date for longer judging by their past history you'll probably be getting the latest ios updates for at least five years but more like two years if you get the s 10 then again i imagine people who are spending this much money on a phone are probably going to be upgrading every two to three years anyway so not a deal-breaker but realize it is a massive win for samsung both phones charged wirelessly but the samsung can be placed against another phone and start wirelessly charging that one i'm a little disappointed that they haven't upgraded the charging speeds for years now the s 10 plus still charges up fifteen of watts which is kind of weak compared to phones that now charged with 40 or even 50 but it still wipes the floor with the iphone which comes with a 5 watt charger in the box and takes 3 hours to fill it up in an age where most phones will fully charge in one even in terms of capacity the s 10 plus is four thousand one hundred million power cell is nearly 25% larger than that of this phone but in real-world usage the gap probably won't be that large iphones make very good use of the battery capacity that they do have one thing apple has really started focusing on is audio and the iphone tennis max is hard to beat it uses both the bottom firing speaker and the earpiece for or audio with some of the widest soundstage and separation you can get on the phone samsung's is really good too though you've got a similar dual speaker setup and it's got dolby atmos support so very cinematic sound experience ok but maybe the most important thing is pricing the samsung is also cheaper the tennis match starts at 1099 dollars and i'll drop the final samsung prices in a comment below but expected to start at around $900 going up to about 1400 ish for the fully souped-up version which is still funnily enough no more expensive than the 512 gig by phone so which phone do you think won don't forget to enter the giveaway and as always my name is aaron and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
