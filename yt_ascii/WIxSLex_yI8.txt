hey everyone how are you doing today i'd like to talk about wait a minute let me take this thing off today i'd like to talk about this thing virtual reality is still a niche market and mostly consists of gamers now i do like playing games on the met quest 3 i like classics such as beat saber but also love playing both the red matter games highly recommend that 11 vr for table 10 is also really cool and also really liked a fisherman still but that's not what i want to talk about today an interesting premise of an vr headset is that you can have an infinite number of monitors and as a developer i like that idea but is it technically feasible can you use something like the quest 3 for software development today we're going to find out but before we dive in if you want to learn more about how to design a piece of software from scratch i have a free guide for you you can get it at ion. codesign guide contains the seven steps that i take whenever i design new piece of software and hopefully it helps you avoid some of the mistakes that i made in the past iron. codesign guide the link is also in the description of this video now let's dive in so here i'm in the quest environment i'm currently in pass through mode so this is actually the view that i typically see when i'm recording videos that's the other side of the desk so i'm now in the quest environment you see this interface here i can move this around that's quite easy and if you want to do development in the quest i mean it's not like a regular computer right so you can't i don't know open a terminal or install vs code or anything like that so you have to do things a bit differently but what you can do is actually work from the browser so what i've done here is i've started vs code you can actually run vs code in your web browser directly by simply typing vs cod. def but what i'm actually using here is a github code space and what that does is that it actually starts a machine in the cloud that you can then run your code directly on so that's actually really cool way to work because that way you can also upload your settings to the cloud and it's going to remember those things so you can also start this on a machine and then you simply work from there and as you can see i have a temporary url here that i can start from of course you need to log in if you want to access this but that's basically how it works so now i basically have my vs code editor open you also see here at the bottom i have a terminal so i can actually work directly in that now you do have to make sure that you actually connect your mouse your keyboard to the quest so you can do that via bluetooth i have my mouse connected here it looks kind of huge i'm not sure why it's this big but it works just the same as any regular mouse on your machine it's just huge so next to the mouse i've also connected my apple magic keyboard and now i can simply type code directly here in the browser and this just works and because i'm running this in a code space i can actually run this code in the cloud like so i simply press play like i would normally do there are some settings that i still have to set up here like creating a virtual environment i haven't done that yet because i haven't used code spaces a lot but this is basically how it works and you can actually see the output of the program here so that's pretty nice now this doesn't work all that smoothly like for example if i want to move this thing here i have to be really precise with the mouse and it doesn't really work all that well so to me this is not really an ideal setup but there's still a couple of things that you can do in this particular setup so basically this is now a simple browser window but you can actually add more so if i add a second tab here and let's say i'm going to my discord server so right now i'm in my discord server which if you haven't joined this yet by the way it's totally free it's really nice community you can join via discord. ion. codes i've also put the link in the description of the video so you can switch between tabs this way but what's actually cool is that you can drag this tab and move it over here and now we have a separate window open here now it's the layout is not that great because it's kind of hard to read but let me show you one more thing so let's say next to this you also want to look up some things on stack overflow so let's also open that in a tab and then i can move that to the left so now we have a pretty neat development setup where on the left we have stack overflow so if any question i can write that here here i have my code editors i can start working on the code and on the right i have my discord server so i can bother everybody about the things that i'm doing which is really cool now you can actually move this around and change how you view this you can use your mouse for that but if you have the oculus quest controller then you can actually also drag it and put it further away it's a bit disconcerting if you have it mixed up with the monitor that they have here but this is basically how you set this up so you can just simply drag this now this is a bit better but but still this window and that window it's a bit hard to read so what you can also do in the setup is switch to a distance view and that's by clicking here and that looks like this so now these windows are a lot bigger i think this overall works better for me actually and you can still resize these so you can change the size of these windows here so you still have some control over what this looks like but the distance is basically the same you can change that so to be honest this is a pretty neat setup for coding so now if i work here i can simply just work in the code just like i would do normally on my computer and that works perfectly fine and this way since i'm using codespace i'm also not directly dependent on the speed of my quest three chip because this is all running in the cloud now of course you have to pay for code space that's not free so that's an extra cost that you're incurring if you work in this way so let me just stop this code space because otherwise this is going to be a very expensive video another thing that i'd like to show you is that it's also possible to basically work directly with your machine so you see my imac here in front of me and of course the code is hard to read because well the quest camera is quite low resolution but what you can actually do is use an app to connect with your machine and then use your quest as a sort of really fancy monitor and there are several options for this so the first one that i want to show you is virtual desktop and in order for this to work you need to have a little app installed on your machine so that it detects that this is available but when you open the app let me do that then normally it should detect the machine and then connect to it so here you see exactly what that looks like so now i basically have a huge monitor showing exactly just my desktop on my mac and i can use controllers to resize this like so so it can get like really big like this and also here as you can see i'm using pass through mode and now since i'm simply connecting with my desktop machine i can just use the keyboard and mouse that's connected to my desktop machine so i can just use the mouse here and i can just type something like this and that just works exactly as i expected to so this is actually also a pretty neat way of working because it allows you to simply use your quest as a monitor and the resolution is actually pretty okay this couple of other things that you can do as well in this setup so let me open the menu and show you what i mean so here we can see this is the mac that i'm connected to but what's cool about a virtual desktop is that they have a number of different environments so for example one that i like very much is the modern apartment and this is what that looks like and then it basically places my desktop monitor on this huge screen which well looks pretty cool actually it sometimes when i move my head it's a bit jerky but overall it's it works pretty well and well this is what it looks like during the day so there's nothing in the windows as you can see there's some artwork here behind me but i can also switch to an evening mode and then this is what we see yeah we have a pretty cool looking view there and i think there was an issue with the view during the day yeah that looks a lot better so now we have a day view and you can see that behind me there's a nice couch i wouldn't try sitting on that couch because that doesn't really work obviously but this gives me a cool looking setup to work from and there's more options here like this gaming room is also pretty cool i have a really cool gaming machine there and some nice artwork on the wall so that's really cool and there's a couple of other ones as well this one is also kind of funny it's there is a interesting poster to the right of me and i i have some playing cards here so you can i don't think you can redo anything with this no you can can't but it's still pretty cool that this is possible and then when you close this well now i basically have my monitor and then i can start working now the problem with this setup is you can already see this is that i can't see my actual desk anymore so there is a fake keyboard here but my real keyboard is somewhere around here so i have to kind of guess where i have to type and the mouse is also here i can't really see that there's no way to let's say cut out a portion of the desk so i can actually see my keyboard and mous so that's to me is a bit limiting and that's why typically if i use virtual desktop then i prefer to use pass through mode so then i can actually see what's going on on my desk and i still have my nice large monitor view that i can resize as i please so i would normally put it i think something like this seems decent to me so that's virtual desktop so this is not a free app it's paid it cost $20 i think but to me $20 that's worth it i think it's a really cool little app to have on the quest and be able to connect with my machine in this way so one thing that i mentioned is that you need a virtual desktop app installed so that it can connect with your machine so that's just something you need to take care of there's another option that i want to show you as well so let me first close the virtual desktop app and then show you what i mean so next to virtual desktop there's also a meta horizons work rooms app and this is in better and you can also use this and let me show you what that looks like so it works in a very similar way so you also have to install a simple application on your desktop machine so that metah horizon work rooms can actually connect with that but once you have that installed it's pretty easy to set up as well so let me show you what that actually looks like so it takes a minute to start up so the first step this app leads you through a little tutorial so that you can actually get set up so i'm going to say i'm ready and as you can see i already have something set up here so this is what meta horizon's workroom looks like and works in a very similar way as virtual desktop and of course just like with virtual desktop you can also change the environment that you're in for example here i'm in a lake you can't really see that because it's behind the huge screen in front of me but there's a couple of other options as well including a pass through option so that simply shows the screen overlaid on top of the real environment but let's go back to the lake because i want to show you something really cool that this has that virtual desktop doesn't have which is you can see here my desk and you see there's an area that's been drawn out here and what you can actually do is have a desk pass through simply by clicking on this item here and then this is what you see so this is something that i really like because now i have my keyboard here regular keyboard and have my mouse here and then i can simply use that just like i would in virtual desktop but i'm actually able to see my keyboard and mouse and to me that's really helpful because that means means that i can see where my hands are and that makes typing a lot easier so met horizon's workroom that's also an option if you want to have some sort of virtual desktop setup and then you can just work from your actual machine it's just connected just like with virtual desktop app and this works just like you would expect it to work so to me this is also a really nice option but there are some disadvantages to meta rizon workroom i found that the app is still a bit buggy i had several crashes while i was trying to set this up so this is not ideal and also it seems there is no simple way to actually change the size of this window i i can't really do anything with this so i'm not really sure how to do that there are some tabs here there is there are some settings you can see here is my avatar so this avatar doesn't really look like me except this avatar looks slightly like me maybe it needs more of a beard but but well doesn't matter but they haven't found a way to actually manipulate the size and position of this screen so i hope that comes in a future update but overall this is a pretty nice setup and they haven't tested that but they've also added some options for creating a work room where you can collaborate with people and then you can have meetings and things like that but i hate meetings so i haven't tried that okay so some final thoughts i've shown you three options that actually work that actually allow you to do software development on the meta quest 3 the first option that i showed you was just using the browser opening vs code in there and then starting a github code space to be honest i didn't find the experience great in particular the interaction with the mouse was a bit spotty and connecting a bluetooth keyboard didn't always work for example my key chrome k2 that i have here is the keyboard that i prefer to use actually didn't connect with the meta quest 3 for some reason so i was just spending a lot of time putting on and off the headset and trying to get that working which yeah that didn't really work all that well the second option that i showed you was using virtual desktop and then connecting to your machine and then actually having the meta work like a sort of monitor i found this worked really well except if you're not using pass through then it's kind of inconvenient that you can't see your keyboard and mouse the lag i found pretty reasonable i didn't really experience any major issues with lag between me moving mouse and seeing the mouse pointer so for me that worked pretty well the third option i showed you was meta horizons work rooms and this was also pretty nice but it also had its problems it was quite buggy it crashed quite a few times although the setup process on my actual computer was pretty simple what i liked from meta horizon's workroom is that you could actually cut out the piece of your desk and then you can see the actual keyboard and mouse this was really helpful when i was trying to work with vs code because i need to see my keyboard and mouse basically i know some people don't need that but for me it's really important one thing that i found lacking in meta horizon's workroom is that there was no easy way to change change the position and size of the screen that you were seeing in the office environment and this would have been nice to have so i hope that's coming out in the future updates overall in my opinion doing software development directly in the browser in the meta quest is not a great experience and you'll have a better experience if you use something like virtual desktop or meta horizons work rooms i have to remember the name of this pretty long but it's still pretty early days meta horizon's work room is in beta and it shows it's not very stable virtual desktop works but i did have some connection issues from time to time but i feel like these apps are still searching for the right mechanism for interaction virtual desktop does a pretty good job at that but meta horizon's work rooms is definitely very limited so if you do software development on a headset i think one of those two options virtual desktop or metal rizon work rooms is the best option for you is it ready for prime time not really it's too buggy too spotty to already be usable and on top of that wearing the vr headset for hours on an end is not really comfortable either so for the time being i'm going to stick with actual reality and an old-fashioned monitor but i'd like to hear from you what do you think do you think this is how we'll do software development in the near future are we all going to wear a vr headset whether that's a meta quest or an apple vision pro or do you think that's not going to happen at all and we just stick with monitors like we've always used to let me know in the comments something that i haven't mentioned in this video is using alternatives to vs code in the browser such as replate or code sandbox or if you're looking for something python specific jupiter notebooks i did a video a while ago covering jupiter notebooks and whether i think you should use them or not you can watch that video right here now i'm going to be off and play some beat saer thanks so much for watching and see you soon
