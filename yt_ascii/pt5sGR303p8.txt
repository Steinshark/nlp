- sometimes, you can't just review the tech. you need to be the tech. welcome, my friends, to building the ultimate ps2! do do not throw the ps2! today is a momentous day, because it is slightly
after the 21st anniversary of the playstation 2
landing in north america. yes, friends! the ps2 is officially old enough to drink, and it's also officially
old enough to be better. you know, we're gonna do today, what sony didn't do, which is improve on the ps2 with the ps3. - [crew] yeah, i don't know. i don't know where you're going with that, but they kind of already... - no, the ps3 was not as good as the ps2. - [crew] you know what rhymes with ps2? - ps poo?
(both laugh) - [crew] opera, (chuckling) the sponsor of today's video. - i mean, that doesn't rhyme, but what an excellent (indistinct) to our fine sponsor. hello, dear viewer, you clearly have chosen to change the default browser that
came with your device, right? oh, boy, oh, boy, have i got some great news for you? we have a brand new channel sponsor, opera. opera is a browser which
not only has a huge focus on privacy and security, but they also have an exclusive austin evans theme available if you download it from the link in the description. i've been using opera for a while and i really do enjoy it. especially when you're
using it on your phone, it makes a huge difference, especially if you're connected to a mobile network. over 380 million people have chosen opera. it didn't come pre-installed
on their device and it's not just because
it's that round browser that is from the same company who sells you all your ads and claims to protect your data, i mean, you know, if that's cool with you, sure. but for me, i would much prefer to use a browser which actually has a real interest in protecting my privacy. not only does opera have
a free vpn installed by default, but also has an ad block, which means they can help keep you safe and secure while also
improving your speed, especially when it comes to using opera on a mobile device. so, what are you waiting for? don't choose the default, choose the best. check out opera at the
link in the description for all of your devices. and of course, huge thank you to opera for sponsoring this video. (device thuds) okay, the eyetoy. so, with the eyetoy, this was essentially a webcam that plugged directly
into the ps2's usb ports, on the front,
- [crew] on the front. - i remember that. there weren't that many
games it supported, there were a handful. it was a very gimmicky thing, like this was well before kinect was actually properly popular. - [crew] well before the ps move. - yo, beyond ps move? yeah, yeah, yeah. ooh. you know what that is? that is a playstation tv. does it work with ps2? do we have the- i guess we need component cables? - [crew} there are component cables. - excellent. - [crew] but we upgraded and got composite cables. - oh! - [crew] it's the other way around. - what? - [crew] it came with composited, we upgraded to component.
- wait. - [crew] yes. yeah, yeah, yeah. - you know what i'm talking about, componentposited. it's the one we got...
- [crew] we got- we have the one that's capable of hd. - oh, my god. (box thuds) (equipment clatter) (chuckles) jesus christ. wow, these are disgusting. can you zoom in on it- here, here, here. dear audience, can you take a close look at this? - [crew] oh, wow! wait, where the sticks
going down? (chuckles) - what is this? (laughing) do you see this grip on (indistinct)? (controller thuds) (laughing) - [crew] i also hate to
break it to you, austin, but that's not all the controllers. - there's more cont- okay, okay, okay. hang on. so...
- [crew] i can't wait to show you my personal favorite. (device thuds)
(austin chuckles) - [austin] what is this? wait, wait, wait. what is this? do i put this on my hand? - [crew] yeah. - oh, good lord. - [crew] so, this is
the playstation version of the power glove. - no, it is not. - [crew] yeah.
- it's not- - [crew] it's not the power glove. - it is, it's got a big playstation badge on it, though. - [crew] back and forth like that, is up and down. - no, it is not! - [crew] and then-
- matt, stop it. - [crew] and then,
- no. - [crew] wave your hand left and right. (laughing) - who thought- okay, all right, all right, all right. you know what? that's fine. i'm gonna die so hard on whatever we decide to play. - [crew] shit, this one doesn't work. (laughing) - excuse me? - [crew] it doesn't work. - are you trying to tell me the 20-year-old piece of
garbage town technology doesn't work? you're going to show me it's going to clickbait me with this. you're gonna make this
the thumbnail of the video and it's not going to work? - [crew] i thought it was so cool. - what is this? buzz! it, a ps- this stuff is actually disgusting. - [crew] we have the
nicer version of buzz! it. - hold on, wait, wait, wait, guys, guys, guys, guys. we're trying to build the ps2 here, - [crew] eyetoy. - [austin] i'm drowning in accessories nothing is even plugged in.
- [crew] we have a lot of stuff to go through, austin. - [crew] we got to keep going, man.
- okay. - [crew] just keep going. - [crew] stop joking and just get to work. - memory card is plugging in. i have an eight megabyte memory card. i need friends. - [crew] hi. (chuckles) - [crew] wait. - [crew] i don't know if you have friends, but i just want to play. (chuckles) - [crew] your co-workers
will be more than happy to play with you. - [austin] oh my god. (people chattering) (alarm sounding) (sheep bleating) - this is fucking chaos. - yeah.
- i got to turn this down. (train hooting) (alarm sounds) - look, i had to take my glasses off, because i had the worst viewing angle. jason, you and me switch. this is what real power looks like.
- switching is like- - this is what real power looks like? (chuckles) - [crew] yeah, that was it, that was it, i lost. - [austin] so, i won? am i the winner? am i the ultimate ps2 gaming master? (crew member mimics relief)
look at this, look at this. that's the face of victory right there. is the hardware just been
on here the whole time? - [crew] yes. - [crew] yeah.
- [austin] okay. - [crew] so, i've got a story about that, i'll tell you later.
- [crew] yeah, we- like, not to make things a little more complicated, but we did have this whole kit, which i think has more stuff in it, including final fantasy 11. - [crew] i tried one that
was converted to sega. i tried a ssd, that didn't work. - can i ask a dumb question? - [crew] yes. - [crew] 1000's. - could you do anything
with the ps2 hard drive, besides play final fantasy? oh, linux.
- [crew] linux! - you got to install linux.
linux. - [crew] well... - oh god. wait, wait, wait, let me guess, it didn't work? - only certain models
of the ps2 were capable of running linux, and we couldn't get our hands on one that actually turned on. - [austin] taiko drum master? ken, do we get to do a drum? (drum playing) what's like a solo, but with two people? - [crew] a duet. - duet? (laughing)
- [crew] my god! (laughing) - i hope it's a double solo (indistinct) (laughing) you know, normally in building guilt, would i be like, how much do you spend on this? how much you spent on that? i bet you all don't even know how much you spent on half of this stuff. - [crew] this was 80 bucks for us. - okay. - [crew] i could tell you that we are probably close to $800 on this build. - on this build. i like the bill. - [crew] so far. - actually, wait. - please tell me there's the game. you all got the game, right? (crew chuckles) - [crew] feel like we're
past the return policy on this one too.
(drums banging) - edit team. can you just maybe tally this. this could be really
difficult to keep up with. can we please get a counter on-screen for how many items have worked for this ultimate ps2. - two.
(bell chimes) - looking charitable,
- three, three, three. - that's being very charitable.
- three. - are you out of things that worked today?
- [crew] we might be. - we might have to come back tomorrow? - [crew] we might be. - i think we should come back tomorrow. (gentle music) - how did this happen? - no. well, we could do one. - [crew] which one? - we do one. (drumsticks thuds) (gentle music) oh, my goodness. is that a ddr game where exercise gets fun? oh my god, it's a- two? is it duet time with our feet? - hmm. - is it- - i think it's a quintet. (jolly music) wait.
(austin laughs) god. wait, quin is f- no. - quar-
- four. - quatre? - [crew] quartet. - quartet.
- quintet! - [crew] no! quartet. - quartet?
- quartet. (chuckles) - you know, language, numbers, words, really not our thing today. - so, i had these kinds of mats where they were just flat, and there wasn't any padding in them. - yeah. - my friend had one of the ones where it actually had padding. it was like an inch thick. i broke like three of these. - i believe you. it is very basic. - [both] all right. (hand claps) (hands rubbing) (indistinct) (chuckling) (hands clapping)
- okay. - oh no!
(mimics shock) do we kill the ultimate ps2, and we haven't even gotten into the game? we've got all this setup done. - [crew] i'm just gonna... - can we just swap that ps2 in real quick? (string music)
thanks. - [crew] i don't know if that one works. (device whirring) - aargh! ken! put it back, flat, flat!
- [crew] jesus. that might actually destroy that disc. - you know, some videos just go better than others. and this one, not feeling right now. - [crew] i'm gonna cut.
- yeah, let's cut. whoa, whoa, whoa! don't touch it! don't touch a button. (string music) it's working.
(string music quickens) it's working. we got to get into a game! i don't care what it is, just give me something.
- [both] ymca, ymca! - let's go.
- wait, we're gonna get copyright strikes. - it's fine, whatever. (lively string music) we'll replace it with covered music, just go, just go, ken! - oh, what the- oh god. this is the saddest thing i've ever lost. oh my god, jesus. (feet thumping) i don't have that fast footwork no, definitely not. okay,i need to go down a difficulty.
(austin exhales) - oh, oh, oh! let's go! let's go! eyetoy. - watch me dance.. - [both] whoa! - look at us!
- oh! - let's go. (lively string music) - yeah! - i'm not sure why the
eyetoy was useful there. - [ken] jason. i need your gallon of water! (laughing) oh my god. (laughing) - [crew] jason's about to smack you, if you touch his water. - what the hell are you doing? i kind of need like at least half of this, but like, why are you hoarding? california is in a drought (indistinct). (austin laughing) - all right, friends. it's day two. time to continue with my very sad- (bag thuds)
- [crew] oh! okay. oh, that was violent. - you know, that's the way we're going to play this. that's the way we going to play this. that's fine! a little antagonism never hurt anybody. (gentle music) okay, that came out in a weird way. what is this? (laughing) (upbeat music) - [voiceover] not duncan! - do we have a game of street fighter for the playstation 2? - [ken] you get mad if i throw something at you.
- i was ready for that one. he literally telegraphed it, but he was like this, this. oh! so, this is a really custom control, since the l1 and the r1 are actually up with your (indistinct).
- [ken] so, this is a 15 anniversary street fighter controller. since you have a street fighter shirt, - yeah?
- and a street fighter controller...
- yeah? let me guess. copy of street fighter? - [ken] no, a copy of dragon ball z budokai, 'cause that is all we can find, because i can not find my
copy of street fighter. (chuckles) - are you kidding me right now? what is wrong with this video? nothing is working for this video!
- [ken] i'm sorry! but finding things that are 21 years old is not the easiest thing in the world. - it's more? i didn't put my shirt on yet. well, don't smash my playstation. - so, this is one of
my favorite accessories of all time. i want you to open this
- okay. - and keep an open mind,
- okay. - it is way ahead of its time. - oh god. all right. - [crew] but change first. - [ken] but change first.
- okay, fine, fine. i (indistinct) see me, will take my duck shirt off. (paper crumpling)
there is a shipping manifest and i immediately throw that away, 'cause i don't want to see what the ac- thrustmaster? the fighting arena. - [ken] yes. so, you see those two
sticks in the back there? - [austin] yes
- [ken] of the picture? - yes
- [ken] so, those two sticks (box thuds) have sensors on them that correspond to interface buttons on the playstation. - oh boy. - [ken] just keep in mind that the wii didn't exist yet, the kinect didn't exist yet. - i mean, this is cool. - i'm skeptical. it's an easy 19-step process. (laughing) (crew laughing) man, that smell of like plastic. like, you know what it smells like? like an inflatable ball. (loud sniffing) - [crew] what? okay. - wow! - [crew] you're dangerously close to a fetish here at this point. - wow! - where did my display go? - [crew] oh, so about that. (upbeat music) we didn't want to use the other one again, just because... - [crew] we were afraid
you're gonna break it. - [crew] so, we got you an even more expensive one. - okay! the 5.4 gamescreen for ps2, a high resolution color display. now, if you've ever seen the ps1 screen, it was cool, because it made your ps1 very portable. this is (beep) piece of sh- - [crew] what? - do you see how small that screen is? you think this thing is portable? why is it this thick? that seems huge. (laughing) - [ken] looks like you made a ps4, dude. (crew laughing) (laughing) - wow. wow. i am in awe of the enormous display
that's in front of me. - [ken] can you believe, that one year after this was purchased, they invented this really awesome thing called the psp. - yo, but actually though, the psp is the actual portable ps2. all right, friends. so, i'm about to experience the spectacular story of dragon ball z. so, to explain what i'm looking at here, i have my directional keys on the mat. i have triangle as the top. i have square in the middle and i have o and i have x on the sides. please tell me this is tutorial mode. (device thuds) okay, well that's- - [ken] you don't hit it. - okay.
- [crew] careful. (laughing)
- [ken] wait, wait wait. are you- did you kind of- did this kind of work? - [crew] oh, wait. this is actually- yo! - [crew] so, if he started using this now for broke versus pro, you might be- - [austin] what's up? what's up? what's up? what's up? so, i'm finally learning the controls a little bit. oh god, wait, wait, wait. i'm supposed to be rotating my thing. i don't have a rotating- - [ken] you do. you have to slide your feet. - [crew] i will say that
this was the achilles' heel of these games.
- [ken] the achilles' heel? (chuckles) - [crew] oh, it's overheated. - [ken] oh no. there his playstation died. - hello again, friends. hopefully you're finding
this ultimate episode of the ps2, enlightening. (dramatic music) oh yeah. the slim ps2, the actual superior ps2. we could just start it with this you realize, right? wait, this is the end of the video? there's no more items? - [crew] no. - but where is the ultimate ps2? (dramatic music) - [ken] this feels like
some sort of phone. - desktop or cellphone? - [ken] here is the ultimate ps2. - a laptop with an emulator? that is the ultimate ps2? - [ken] yeah. - [crew] or better yet.
- you really.. (devices colliding) dear audience, i would like to sincerely apologize for the disappointment of the fact that we did not build the ultimate ps2 today. believe me when i say, i am just as disappointed as you are, but i would ask you to
still subscribe anyway, because hopefully you enjoyed the journey, because it's not always
about the destination. sometimes it's about the fun and friends you make along the way. - [crew] i can't wait til you find them. (dramatic music drops off)
