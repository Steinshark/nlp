18 months ago i made the unprecedented decision to invest in a fledgling laptop company called framework they promised upgradeability they promised sustainability they were going to change the industry and all they asked for was a small loan of a quarter million dollars i was so impressed with my first hands-on experience though that i not only bought a laptop for myself for the first time in 16 years i also invested my money in their company but looking at what they're announcing today it's clear that i made a fundamental mistake i should have bought more of their company we have got amd frameworks we've got larger frameworks with even more customization and upgradability and if your mind isn't blown yet dedicated gpu module is this a gaming framework the best part is we've barely scratched the surface so we are going to sink our teeth into these and go as deep as we're well allowed to go given that i'm being carefully supervised just to be clear i can open this up all the way no i can tell them what chips are in the jeep can i at least tell them about our sponsor sure you green do you primarily work on a laptop increase your productivity with ugreen's docking station you can connect all the peripherals you want such as multiple monitors keyboards mice all through a single hub check it out at the link below the amd edition of the framework laptop is a thing of beauty it comes in the same elegant and upgradable 13-inch chassis as before but inside beats the heart of pure diluted ryzen 7000. a team-red cpu option has been often on the most requested feature for framework to offer on their machines trading places only with a larger battery so they did that too they've gone from 55 watt hours to 61 watt hours but if you own a previous generation framework like me and you worry about intercompatibility fear not the size is actually identical and the bumping capacity comes purely from chemistry improvements that's really good news but wait there's more the same 13 inch chassis that i've been using not to mention upgrading ever since i got it at launch is getting even more options intel 13th gen core processors are also being announced for both brand new builds and for folks who want to reuse their existing systems so if you're on previous gen hardware you're going to have to make a hard choice do you go intel or do you go amd which actually leads me which one's better it's a personal preference right but okay how do i ask this again which one should i get whatever you like which one will you get whatever i like oh this guy clearly doesn't want to make either intel or amd mad they've also been addressing some of the pain points that have been discovered now that thousands of frameworks are out in the wild i'm talking upgraded stiffer hinges louder speakers not to mention we'll see that now you don't a matte screen option ah are we getting a touch screen too that i can't comment on but we will not have it in this release okay i'll wait one thing you don't need to wait for is our new 3d down jacket it's lightweight worn and only from lttstore.com now hold on you might say i thought framework's whole schtick is sustainability well that old board you pulled out is still good what do do we scrap it now ah i'm so glad you asked we showed off a cool 3d printed case last year that you could set up for yourself to turn it into a little slimline computer but for the folks without access to a 3d printer there's a new better solution framework has teamed up with cooler master to offer a motherboard case also known as a case by the way in case you guys were confused meaning that your old board can effectively become your new media center now enough about that let's get to the really exciting part look at this look how much bigger it is and bigger is just the start there's only so much that i can say about the all-new 16-inch framework laptop at the moment but there is nothing stopping me from demonstrating its biggest party trick a removable dedicated gpu while the mxm form factor has died more deaths than kenny mccormick framework developed their own solution and easily swappable expansion bay that is wired up with a custom pcie by 8 interface fun fact by the way it actually uses the same connector as dell developed like back when a couple years ago i guess it was but since dell isn't framework and didn't publish their pin out framework had to develop their own pinout which this time around will be published to allow board partners or realistically anyone to use it is that right yeah absolutely if another laptop manufacturer said you know hey we really like this thing we're gonna have a thing don't you love this attitude i can't tell you who they partnered with to build this and they won't even let me take the cooler off it to take a look i don't even know if it's amd or nvidia at this point but what i do know is that with all the data sheets that they're creating and aib like an asus or an msi could easily develop something for it now a gpu and a framework laptop is pretty high up there on my personal wish list because that power turns these things into something that's actually a viable option for us to deploy to our team a writer might be fine with a 13 inch but engineers and editors come on they need a gpu and the best part it's not just for gpus the idea for the expansion bay here is identical to their i o modules that they have on the regular framework laptop open source and completely customizable this space here where a gpu might sit could be anything a pair of m.2 ssds and ai accelerator even an extended battery that's right removable batteries are back y'all and there are even plans to offer an external caddy so that you can use their old batteries like the internal ones as portable battery packs and you don't even have to be limited by the exact shape of one particular expansion module in fact if you look closely these two are slightly different because a gpu needs a little bit more space than say a couple of m.2 ssds so if you're willing to accept the compromise of adding a little bit of extra you know z height to the back of your laptop i mean you could see conceivably just about anything thrown in here let's say you wanted to swap out your gpu for something like a capture card part of the spec is external facing i o and then oh this phrase is an uncomfortable question again with the e-waste what do we do with this gpu like slap it in a desktop well yes actually nothing would prevent the development of a simple carrier card the same sort of thing we've actually seen for mxm gpus in the past but also no gets even better in the future framework wants to give you the option of taking this and putting it in an external gpu dock which they have already mocked up and are going to be showing off very soon so that a friend or someone could use your old gpu with their laptop one of the things that framework learned in the development of this product is just how divisive numb pads are on laptops personally i don't care for them i'd rather have these leds on the side as it turns out nearly 50 percent of you do want them whether it's for data entry or just extra keys for gaming inputs fortunately this is framework david i'm about to blow your mind check this out i pop these out right here and here slide these off these modules no no no no no no these modules replaceable okay so we can put in wood grain accents or something like that okay if you want like carbon fiber they've got all kinds of different ideas for this but but wait but wait it gets even dumber check this out trackpad comes off keyboard oh oh oh wait numpad on the right wait wait numpad on the left oh wait oh but i hate it when my trackpad isn't centered and my keyboard oh no up it's right under the keyboard are you kidding me right now oh yeah oh yeah this is wild you know those niche keyboards that you've seen with a second screen or whatever well framework has been paying attention that's right if a numpad doesn't offer quite the functionality that you want to see how about a power sipping memory lcd that might be more your thing now this one might never see the light of day i mean they'd like to cram a touch screen in here or you know different types of display technologies but that is a lot to pack into something at this height while retaining durability but at least you know that it's something that's on their radar the best part is that this modular input system doesn't end at just being able to move the keyboard back and forth and stick on a numpad in addition to all the same languages that they already support on the 13 inch framework there's four more languages that they're adding to 13 inch that will also come to this down the road and linux users rejoice on the 16 inch they're even going to build a keyboard option that replaces the windows key with a super key i guess the windows logo is that offensive yeah i don't know how many of those you're gonna sell we're going to see so while in theory you could put a 13 inch board inside the 16 inch chassis it would be a total frankenstein job and it wouldn't make a ton of sense since you wouldn't even be able to hook up some of the new i o oh wait did i even mention the new i o because of the larger size there are six packs now of their hot swappable i o modules instead of just four they've also got a new retention clip down here that's i don't like the red i like green for okay to remove it's a hard ux problem yeah they like red for not the default state right so i'm like oh yeah okay i guess i guess i get it oh wait we didn't even talk about the new module they did remove the three and a half inch jack from the 16-inch laptop but they developed a 3.5 millimeter module so you can have as many three and a half mil jacks as you want could i configure these for like surround sound or something you could theoretically wow wow so you get more ports on your laptop for everyday use and it also means that the community who supports framework either by buying these things or by building modules are going to be having a field day with all the new ideas that are going to come to light and that community is only getting bigger and better you guys might have noticed that frameworks webshop is called the framework marketplace that's because it's going to be expanding to allow third-party manufacturers to sell directly to consumers as well as offering a space for consumers to sell and trade used components with each other and for that i owe everyone involved a massive and sincere thank you a modular laptop like this is such an important mission and it only works if everyone agrees it's time to move beyond disposable electronics and focus on repair and sustainability and framework has committed to that in more ways than one from things like choosing to use cast magnesium alloy for their shell instead of machining it i actually saw this thing realized there's not a single screw on the bottom which is cool right but that means that there would have been pounds of wasted magnesium alloy from a traditional cnc routing job to remove all that material no it's cast that's freaking awesome they're also using paper-based packaging and post-consumer recycled materials wherever possible those of you haven't been paying close attention probably noticed that we weren't allowed to spill the beans on the exact hardware in this thing but come on i'd hate to totally spoil the surprises when it comes out later this year just

check out the last time i updated oh where is it my framework from 11th gen to 12th gen i went from what was it like eight cores to 14 or something stupid like that same chassis and now i could put 13th gen in it or amd and if i broke it doing this i could replace all those pieces look he's not even stressed yeah no problem speaking of which i need to replace my my fingerprints i mangled the keyboard here yeah well i was not being careful when i did something and so it's deformed so when i put it on it cracked my fingerprint sensor so we can send me some parts yeah well we'll figure it out
