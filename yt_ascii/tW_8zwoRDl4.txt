if you're a 90s kid you probably recognize this [music] that's enough most of you already know that faster than youtube's copyright system does it's the theme song to drake and josh and i like many people grew up as a minor watching it little did i know drake bell one of the stars was returning the favor for some of us now i'm not here to comment on some of the legal issues that have arisen since then because ultimately they're not my business and i've heard that they're actually not that major of issues they're minor now instead the reason i come before you today is to warn you about a major issue if you're following drake bell still he's been secretly getting paid to shill nfts now i know that's a shock right but even more shocking is i confronted drake bell on twitter about this and he lied to me and i'm here to expose it to you guys today just to prove once again the blockchain doesn't lie right and you can run but eventually we will catch you now for a little background before we get into this drake bell i can't believe this is a real story it's insane he's turned into something of a sam pepper type figure you remember guys remember sam right from save the kids he's washed up social media figure pivoted into shilling altcoins twitter and behind the scenes was getting paid now drake bell sort of joined that playbook guilty but i didn't know about that at first as we'll get into but he thought he could get away with it but like all social media stars they don't actually understand how crypto works and so we caught him we caught him doing some very naughty things to his fans let's get into it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective and this is a bit of a weird one if you guys asked me at the beginning of this year the weirdest things that were going to happen to me drake bell dropping into my dms and lying to me was not in the cards right him getting caught red-handed 4k not what i had planned because he's a real celebrity and we are on the internet you know not disparaging youtube but i just thought it was sort of out of our you know thing so for a little context drake bell has been running this nft shill game scam game i don't know what you really want to call it you can call it all of those let's bring down the board and show you what i'm talking about and i know most of you guys are saying steven you got trolled by a bot account but no no it's really him this is his profile right here drake bell at drake bell follows you 4.5 million followers and his entire twitter timeline is these nft scams and again not all nfts are scams but the ones that hire these ridiculous influencers to promote them all the time let's be honest right good morning one nft should i buy today share some cool projects and then you look at his actual timeline and it's just him promoting a bunch of these projects things like this metamods dropping in six hours public mint and he promotes this thing you guys have probably never heard of for the past several months he's been doing this and people started to wonder if he wasn't getting paid behind the scenes in fact one of his fans came to me and told me that he was now i didn't think anything of it you know a lot of these guys are promoting this stuff but it wasn't until drake bell himself dropped in my dms and told me basically hey man i'm here to set the record straight if you have any questions let me know that i thought something was definitely weird because generally i mean i'm not saying you you're guilty if you come to me but i hadn't tweeted about him i hadn't said anything and so for him to come come it's like someone knocking on your door and going i didn't do anything you know you're just like wait wait what you know you'd show up at the police station look i just want to clear the record i didn't do anything and be like hmm wait tell me more about what you didn't do so he told me that and i look i said look i don't know anything just tell me here's what he said that your accuser said hear the allegations you've been promoting a bunch of these things and being paid behind the scenes and while i was doing that since my curiosity was peaked at this point i decided i'd investigate this man a little bit and so what do you know guys i go to the blockchain and i found his profile drakebell.eth now right away i noticed some problems if you scroll through his transaction history occasionally you'll notice stuff like this 200 keys.eve paying drake bell 0.25 ether which is about a thousand dollars and they paid him the same day as he promoted an nft called 200 keys here's the promotion he did the same day he got this payment 200 keys is a collection of nft key chains that unlock trades in nfc collection blah blah blah you know what i mean they're having 70 thousand dollars to give the giveaways blah blah blah and there he is shilling it on october 10th that's the day that he got paid now i was pretty concerned about this because obviously does he say anywhere that it's an ad that he's been paid to do this no and this is an increasing problem in crypto nobody discloses anything because it's bad if you say you're shilling instead people just do it under the radar and hope that nobody ever finds out but of course we do so i actually end up confronting drake about this and i say i send him the screenshot of the thing because he's asking me look if you want to clear it up whatever so i send him this and i say you know what do you want to comment so i sent him this i sent him the payment i say example you promoted 200 keys but got paid a thousand bucks behind the scenes this is a problem drake drake responds i didn't make a thousand bucks i got free nfts buddy now this was a bold move i hadn't thought of this he told me he got paid enough seats and sure enough if you go to his nft collection it does say he has three 200 keys and a piece so i think to myself huh that's weird maybe the .25 ethy got paid were fermenting as you know sometimes you have to pay minting fees when minting these things so i say minting fees he says what i said the 200 keys they paid you 0.25 eth the day of your tweet he said no i received two free mints try again i thought this was a bit condescending but i was like all right whatever so i say is this your wallet we're back to this guys so i say is this your wallet and i show him the transaction id where he got paid and so he responds now now watch this yes he gave me two keys and i used the eath to mint more now again this is different from what he first told me which is all i got was three nfts but i think to myself well maybe i just misunderstood maybe this is all really on the up and up maybe i'm the one in the wrong here but i don't think so i got a weird hunch about this so he said oh she did get paid 25 eat 0.258 like i said and he said no i didn't get paid i minted keys with the eth he sent very clear statement here what do you want from me exactly well now at this point now that we have a very clear statement from him about what he did i go to the polygon transaction that's where all of this occurred was on the polygon chain and i find those transactions now guys according to the the 200 keys website these nfts cost 50 matic to mint so i go to drake bell's polygon address and i find the 200 keys and i go and i look how much he paid for these and the first one he paid zeromatic for the second one he also paid zeromatic for but that should be expected remember that's what he told us happened remember he said he gave me two keys and i used the eath to mint more he has three of them so he must have paid for the third one however when we look up the third key he also paid zero so he he's just lying and just like lying about something that's so publicly verifiable it's shocking guilty so i responded you did not make keys with the eighth 200 keys that it sent i could see the transaction history you did not pay a fee for any of the three you meant it and he responds this is my favorite part they were gifted i yeah i'm confused i can't get gifted in fts i'm confused what you're so upset about dude it's just lie after lie after light it's like drake what happened bud drake drake and josh the payments weren't enough you broke what why are you doing this for a thousand dollars you're lying to a youtuber for a thousand dollars it has gone too far it's just such a dumb thing to lie about by the way just say like yeah i showed it they paid me a thousand bucks i didn't say ad i'm sorry instead he's like what no i didn't do it and now that's even funnier that's a better story that's it funnier than you just got paid a thousand dollars which is kind of sad to be honest but i think poor judgment seems to be a recurring theme here that's basically the story i don't know that's basically it i caught drake bell in a multiple lies let's count them first it was oh i didn't get paid at all then it was oh i'm just i used it to mint things then it's oh what i can't get a gift i can't have a gift from an artist what's the big deal guys the crazy thing is is that never during this entire conversation with him even after that did he ever show any remorse or think that he was at all in the wrong and it just goes to show like when everyone's getting away with it at this scale because obviously drake bell is not the only one who who's doing this right now not disclosing that he's basically advertising for these nft companies shilling them to his fans so they buy in and get wrecked he's not the only one doing it and he even brought up to me well hey why are you calling me out dude everyone's doing it right now dude you should call out him he's getting paid more he actually pointed out some people we're getting paid more that we're probably going to talk about soon but he basically said what why are you picking on me and i've had that experience multiple times recently guys i want you guys to understand these influencers they don't feel bad ironically they feel offended when you call them out you go hey you have to disclose that per the ftc they go hey why are you picking on me guilty if just any kind of regulation came in all of this would stop the problem is right now everybody's getting away with it so these guys rather than being ashamed of what they do well they do lie about it they are ashamed but they are just so flagrant with it where even when you do catch them and you do call them out they go why are you picking on me it's like it's crazy man so this is my plea to the ftc to all these guys watching this space right now listen to me right now i know these guys i talked to these guys these guys showing these projects right now they've never been more flagrant they've never been more willing to do this because right now there are no consequences the biggest consequences to drake bell is me making a video about him that's the that's the highest form of punishment right now and that's no punishment at all i'm sorry sorry if i seem like i'm getting upset at the end here but i'm a little pissed cause i'm like yes it's drake bell's fault but also isn't it the fault that none of these guys are getting in trouble like of course people are going to continue doing it because nobody ever goes down for this stuff so i'm just saying if this is such a if this is a rule right this is an ftc guideline the ftc themselves say that you have to disclose this stuff in their disclosures 101 for social media influencers how about a little consequences right ftc right i mean i think that's fair to say right how about a little consequences for these guys in the meantime i will continue calling them out you cut you guys can rely on that that's maybe the only thing you can rely on and please guys if you like the show please support this work by pumping the stock i am but a man and i need your help we are at 800 000 subscribers
