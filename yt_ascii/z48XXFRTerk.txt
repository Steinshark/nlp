so here's what happens people read beowulf they come across things that don't seem like they belong to modern christianity or even like let's say late medieval roman catholicism and so they say well this must be a pagan leftover yeah so my question is well is it a pagan leftover which would be fine i wouldn't really be bothered by that but is it a leftover or is it is it the beowulf poet using his christianity anglo-saxon christianity right which was his framework to try to make sense of the world that he had had inherited from both his christian and his pagan forbearers [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world it's good to see everybody i'm really happy that we're kind of back into the the schedule with richard it's hard because now he's becoming so busy and and sadly i'm busy too but i'm really excited we're going to talk about beowulf i've been looking really forward to to this episode and so richard thanks for coming and you have a few things you also want to announce because as if you you don't if there are too many things you're doing but that's cool go for it that's right i just want to announce a couple of pretty cool things one is some of some people know that i am publishing a tabletop role-playing game it's actually set in a fantasy world that i've been working on for about 20 years now and so the role-playing game is called emborea role-playing in the world under starlights coming up from strange owl games in the spring there will be a kickstarter in april and you'll you know you can go and you can back it you can get hard copies pdfs all this stuff there are going to be some levels you know where if you back it like we'll play a game together and and you know like i'll run a game for you and yeah and all this kind of stuff so the kickstarter hasn't lost yet but if you want to keep up with the project and also get in on like the play test packets as they come out there's a patreon that it's it's you know it's not my patreon it's strange owl the publishing company's patreon i do get you know some of that but it's it's their patreon and it's um so we'll put a link to that down in as they say and then and so if if people want to follow along with the project find out more about like what even is this world is this a project that i'm interested in at the higher levels like i said you get play test packets character sheets adventures setting materials things like that as we develop it we just got a bunch of stuff from back from our layout artist and it looks really cool and official cool so people will want to check that out the other big thing that i do want to announce is that sometime hopefully around when this video drops or maybe maybe a little bit later we'll see we're going to be launching a small crowdfunding campaign for finding the golden key so this is yeah this collection of essays i know we've been talking about it for a while it's finding the old golden key essays towards the recovery of the sacramental imagination or i'll probably just call it recovering the sacramental imagination because that's a little easier to say and the crowdfunding campaign is going to cover a couple of things i'm not making any money off of this book i'm just doing it because this is a really important thing to me obviously jonathan you've got a an essay in this book and a lot of other people in the symbolic world community do as well we're going to be starting a crowdfunding campaign basically to cover the cost of cover art which is going to be done by hugh rose and he's got some insanely cool ideas for how we're going to do this so he's going to be doing the cover art so we want to make sure that we can pay him what he's worth and then also raise money to handle things like copy editing and type setting so so it'll be like a small crowdfunding campaign and hopefully this symbolic world community can kind of rally around we can get that knocked out so that's the other thing that i wanted to announce today i'm sure i'm doing other things that are also fun but those are the two that i'll mention so we'll have links to both of those hopefully we'll get that crowdfunding campaign i got to figure out a whole bunch of questions a whole bunch of things that i don't know about crowdfunding that i need to figure out between now and whenever this video drops but all right yeah well we we can help you like well it's like i can give some advice nick this cotar is also good yes yes yes yeah fortunately we have people in the community who know these things now so and my my project is going to be way simpler than what nicholas just did so yeah yeah all right so let's go beowulf because you know i'm i'm excited oh should we announce the other thing that we talked about uh just a minute ago the which thing we talk about some we talk about so many things which one are you gonna announce the class do we want to go ahead and announce oh yeah sure go for it yeah definitely okay so sometime this spring depending on you know when we get the new website up and all that stuff we're going to be offering a beowulf course through the symbolic world i'll be teaching it jonathan will be involved as much as i can rope him in probably but the plan will be that we'll actually read through beowulf together as a group it'll probably take about six weeks to do this i i have a actually a class and a curriculum that i've already developed and taught several times but i'm going to be adding in a bunch more of the kind of material that you're going to be hearing today so if you're interested in the idea of a sort of a book club where we read through beowulf together and then discuss it and this will include discussions of the original language i can't teach you anglo-saxon in six weeks but but i will do some reading from the original language so you can get a taste and kind of like a sense for how it sounded and and the rhythm of the poetry and these things so that'll be and we're gonna do it and there will be like a live class and then at the end of that the lectures will be i assume available for purchase so yeah it's all going to record them and then we'll and then we will sell it as a as a course that will be on symbolic world permanently so yeah so this will be on the new symbolic world site and i'm very excited about it so just stay tuned for more information about that i wanted to imagine okay cool so last time we kind of teased this relationship between anglo-saxon culture right as we're making our way through the through universal history in the symbolic world we tease this relationship between anglo-saxon culture and literature and christian apocryphal jewish and christian apocryphal literature so i wanted to talk a little bit more about that today and give some specific examples because it's very clear it's very clear that the author of beowulf first of all is a christian beowulf studies is i mean beowulf is the in some senses it's like the most overstudied poem in history because it's got so many people who have written about it and studied it and things like this and the thing is once you get into it you start to realize why it's so attractive why it's so interesting in this in this way because it's a it's a it's been described by for instance professor michael drought as a textual ruin right it's like coming across these rune these ruins a tolkien used this analogy as well coming across the ruins of this tower right kind of you know and and you wanna you wanna just like pick it apart and try to figure out why did they you know and what's this about and and you know you pick every stone a single stone you pick up right every little every little crux that you come across in the text every little like clearly this is not the right word the scribe got this wrong so what did it say every single example of that and there are quite a number of them in the beowulf poem is just sort of endlessly interesting and fascinating and it's the kind of at one point in my life jonathan and i've i've totally utterly failed at this but i really aspired to be like the man of one book i forget who's i forget who it was that had this concept but it but basically it was the idea that instead of like trying to read everything you should just like study one thing yeah go as deep as you can possibly go into that thing and for a long time for me beowulf was that yeah like i said i've i've you know tremendously failed at being a man of one book as my as my my office yeah which is mostly bookshelves at this point uh can attest but there's something that's really deeply fascinating and beautiful to me about this poem i'll talk more about that in the course but what i want to kind of argue is that the beowulf poem is a sort of rosetta stone it's a rosetta stone for it's a rosetta stone for medieval christianity and the ways that they interacted both with this much older weirder christian and jewish tradition inheritance that they that they'd inherited and then also try to figure out how do we fit that into the things that our ancestors believed about the world our pagan answers ancestors the things they believed about the world and if you kind of look at the beowulf poem it's really got all these things in miniature you have the conflict of christian and english and like germanic values you've got the conflict of of you know the religions is kind of their underlying things as well one of the interesting conflicts that i probably won't talk very much about today that seems to be going on in beowulf is actually a memory of an even older pre-christian conflict between kind of the older let's say like fertility cults which were focused around the the bogs right the bogs and then the the newer kind of odinic religion which is focused more around the hall right and focus more on like war as opposed to as opposed to fertility so there's a bunch of different interesting things going on in beowulf and it kind of just soaks them all up into itself but as i said the fact that it's like this makes it because it's kind of overstudied in a way makes it an incredibly contentious field so there's almost nothing in beowulf that's not up for debate by somebody but you're gonna have beowulf scholars like arguing in the in the comments and yeah actually famously at the university of toronto there was a fist fight over the dating of beowulf this isn't canada of all places so so there you go there you go and up and up there in canada land so there's there's there's almost nothing about the poem that's not debated but one of the things that isn't debated is that it that the beowulf poet was a christian yeah probably a monk i mean certainly a monk and then depending on when you think the poem was written like i said very contentious question maybe in the seventh or the ninth or sorry the eighth or the ninth cent or tenth eleventh century somewhere in there a lot of different theories i tend to follow the kind of the more conservative age of b dating which uh which for instance which was the older belief and then it fell out of style and now it's back in style but anyway i like it for metrical reasons and other things that i won't get into today but it's not hugely important to our understanding of the poem so you've got this christian author but then what people don't really necessarily agree on is to what degree was the beowulf poet just telling his own story making it the story and then to what degree was he taking older stuff and kind of synthesizing it working it together and what i would basically say is that that is a that's a weirdly modern question yeah about a pre-modern work right you know people didn't think think about originality the the way that we do today in the middle ages they certainly didn't prize it the way that we do today so this is you know so this is really kind of the wrong question to me but the the the better question to ask is when we when we come across something that doesn't seem to match with let's say for instance so so here's what happens people read beowulf they come across things that don't seem like they belong to modern christianity or even like let's say late medieval roman catholicism and so they say well this must be a pagan leftover yeah so my question is well is it a pagan leftover which would be fine i wouldn't really be bothered by that but is it a leftover or is it is it the beowulf poet using his christianity anglo-saxon christianity right which was his framework to try to make sense of the world that he had had inherited from both his christian and his pagan forbearers yeah so that's i that's what i want to kind of show some examples of today because it's a great like i said it's kind of a great test case for the way that this was done in in the middle ages yeah so we talked about this uh a little bit last time about how the christian apocrypha apocryphal literature was preserved in anglo-saxon england in a way that in a way that maybe it doesn't hold on so many other places in western europe part of this is because of course england and by extension ireland is way out on the edge of things so even though something like the book of enoch had already been sort of i think officially banned by the pope by this point in time in history you know that this sort of like they might not even have heard about that band let alone there have been any way to enforce it you know in in in seventh century yeah seventh century 8th century anglo-saxon england it's interesting because there are there's a like what you're saying for example the legend of saint christopher has a dog-headed man it exists both in the east and in england and ireland because it's as if they just have access or they have kept certain traditions that have been kind of forgotten and and left to the to the wayside yeah and this includes things like names of archangels and other other things that that you know that show up in like old irish and english accent prayer books i talked a little bit last time about the saltair and the rain right the psalter of the quatrains which was this collection of 150 poems basically giving the irish version of medieval universal history starting with the fall of the gods starting with the fall of the devil and his angels and how humanity is intended to take their place in the heavens right that they're these empty thrones that we are destined for right that's you know right there at the very beginning and by the way that same understanding of the fall of the devil is in the anglo-saxon genesis so there's an epic poem retelling got it right here on the shelf there's an epic poem retelling of the book of genesis the the the the old english were were real they were real keen on the old testament i think that they found a sort of kinship in the stories of the old testament in the not just not just because like there's a bunch of violent stuff that happens in the old testament but but really because i think that there you know this this idea of there's something really fundamental specifically about genesis that that this this is this is how it all came to be right in fact in the in beowulf this is the song right this is the song that the shop sings the scald or the bard this song that the show sings in the hall of herat which anger is grendel it's the song of the creation of the world it's the song of genesis right well you can think about how did they tell the story of genesis right how did those accents tell it well it starts out with the story the tale of the fall of of the devil the devil falls and now there are these empty thrones and that's the story of the creation of the world that's the story of genesis that's why we're made is to is to sit on those thrones right so then you can start to see why grendel who as we're going to see in a moment is somewhere between a demon and a man you can see why he would be angered by that kind of a song right so there's lots of really interesting stuff like this and of course there's an old english poem called solomon and saturn which has a bunch of details for which the book of enoch is probably the ultimate source maybe maybe or maybe not the original source but i'm just saying all this to say i think there's every reason to believe that the author of of the beowulf poem either had access to the book of enoch or just a kind of access to this homiletic tradition based on enokian and apocryphal literature that was really common in really common in england during the middle ages so i'll give a couple of examples of that right so first of all we've got grendel so for people who don't know the story of the beowulf poem come come to my class but for people who don't know the story there are three monsters there's beowulf or not sorry there's actually beowulf is the fourth monster that's kind of the actually the the hidden yeah story but he's the fourth monster but but he's the good monster right yeah in fact sometimes the the poem will in old english will use the same language to refer to grendel on one page and then you turn a couple of pages and now that same monster language is being used right um i should say that beowulf himself probably has an origin in something like a fairy tale or folklore as a character there is a there's a very kind of common folkloric trope in european stories called the bears sun tale right and so the bearish sun tale is basically the idea that this woman has relations with a bear and the resulting child is mad is a man but also kind of bear-like right he's way too big he's a little too hairy he sleeps a lot he eats too much and basically he's just a nuisance to everyone nobody likes him nobody wants to you know and he sleeps too close to the fire and you know just this idea of this big slow stupid hibernating bear and then and then one day a monster shows up that nobody else can can kill nobody else can fight and the bear's son saves everybody and then they they're like oh now i kind of i see your worth i understand your worth now and there are relics of this kind of story in the beowulf poem so after beowulf has killed grendel and gretel's mother for instance he goes back home and we're told and this is the first time we're told this because the beowulf poet doesn't he doesn't give us information in a linear fashion he's a he's a very careful storyteller and so when he goes back home we find out that actually before he left everyone kind of thought well you know glad we've gotten rid of him like you know because because he was such a nuisance and now he comes back and he's this big hero and everybody kind of realizes maybe we were wrong about this guy no there's there's that kind of a thing going on in the story hence all the kind of monstrous language that's used about beowulf interesting but go ahead but there are three three months you said there are three monsters like yeah so they're three monsters three monsters the first is grendel the second is grendel's mother and the third one is the dragon the dragon now modern retellings i'm looking at you grant morrison this no it's not grandma neil gaiman neil gaiman wrote that why did i confuse those two weirdos i don't know like how could you yeah how could i yeah yeah so modern retellings look here's a look at you neil gaiman but not just his others as well have tried to connect these monsters by you know like saying oh there were relations and then the dragon is bit with sun or hothgar son or like you know all this stuff but it's not like that in the poem and i don't obviously i don't like that retelling but but for a couple of reasons not just because it's not you know the original or something but because it really mistakes what the monsters are and what they do in the story but in any case so the three monsters grendel grendel's mother and the dragon grendel and grendel's mother are probably the one of the closest connections that the beowulf poem has to the book of enoch so they're they are first of all giants they're referred to frequently throughout the poem as as being giants like normal words for giants you know illen which is normal anglo-saxon word for giant fierce which is kind of like means like a troll or a marsh troll or you know like what's the difference between a troll and giant well not not really a whole lot for purposes of the story that we're talking about here yeah but also grendel is frequently referred to as a demon the language that's used for him is the language that is used to describe that's the language that is used to describe uh demons and evil spirits and other english acts in literature grendel of course is a he eats humans but he doesn't just eat humans he drinks blood yeah right so he likes to rip the head off of uh rip the heads off of people famously beowulf's retainer han show which by the way means glove a glove is a hand shoe so anyway some guy that some guy with the name glove he gets gets his head ripped off and grendel drinks his blood and and this but this this sort of cannibalistic blood drinking activity is one of the the attributes one of the things that is described about the giants in the book yeah so uh so there's there are similarities there but the similarities go beyond this so when when beowulf is is meditating on the fate of grendel and the doom that he's going to you know the eternal torment that he's going to experience he quotes this passage that is basically just a few lines which are basically a line from the book of enoch para uh paraphrased into anglo-saxon verse right talking about talking about the the uh the eternal judgment that will fall upon this evil soul and so it gets even a little more complicated because first of all in the book of enoch or sorry in in the beowulf poem we're told that grendel is the descendant of cain but one of the major themes of the poem is this idea that the flood this is also an idea very clearly found in the book of enoch for instance the idea that the flood was sent to to the world primarily to destroy the giants right everybody the the old scandinavian old germanic peoples had this memory as well this memory of the war between the gods and the giants right and and so the the bill of poet is able to take this this knowledge that as germanic people they have that there was this war with giants and is able to take that and combine it with his his knowledge of the same war with giants from the scriptures but of course it's not explicitly spelled out in it's not in genesis it's it's like you said it's in the enokian traditions and right yeah yeah and so you you get the question and somebody somebody sent me this question in an email recently and i said well i have to listen to the next episode and the question was well if the giants were destroyed by the flood then how is grendel the descendant of cain and how is this is grendel a like how is he like a giant how is he like one of the nephilim or whatever like if he's if he but there's a harder question than that which is why in the bible like right it's there's two places where the word nephilim is used one is used in in genesis and one is used in in the i think it's in deuteronomy when they come up to the land of of the of the of the at the when they come up with the two spies right yes right yeah in front of jail and they it says they are of the nephilim those are the two places so it's like the same question the anakim and all these other giants are said to be nephilims or how do you it's the same question like how do you how does this work why are there still giants after the flood why are there still giants over the flood and then are the are the descendant of kane thing is the descendant of kane thing is that mutually exclusive with the idea of being like a nephilim or a giant like you know like the two like the the hypothesis versus the nephilim hypothesis or whatever so we actually find pretty good answers to both of these questions in the beowulf poem oh really okay so first of all first of all we're told that all these different monsters descend from kane very common kind of a uh medieval theory about the origin of like fairies elves orcs goblins you know all these things they're all bad guys as far as the beowulf poet is concerned he's a hardliner as an old professor of mine might say he's a hardliner when it comes to fairies but the the way that they but the way that then that this this similarity to or this dissent from cain is used in the beowulf poem if you start to pay attention to it you start to realize that it's not really a question of like lineal let's say genetic descent yeah right but the the way that it's used and the reason that it's important to the poem is because kane was a kinslayer yeah so in anglo-saxon society and like the society let's say the germanic iron age to be a kinslayer is the worst possible sin right in a in a very similar way and i think for a very similar reason that for dante in the inferno the worst possible sin and i i mean i lead a book club through inferno every friday night for like several years now or not necessarily through inferno through the whole comic comedy and we just finished inferno a couple of weeks ago and what we see for dante and inferno is that the worst possible sin is betraying your lord betraying your master and what both of these things have in common is that for their respective societies for dante's and for the germanic iron age these relationships are the are the relationships through which society coheres if you cannot trust the bonds of kinship right if if you can't even trust your brother or your cousin or your uncle right if you if you can't even trust the bonds of kinship then really how are you going to survive as a people how are you going to survive as a civilization this is actually one of the big questions you know that is raised at the end of the poem as beowulf is the last of the yeah it's right he's the last king of his people right and and you know the the the woman you know singing his funeral dirge one of the things she sings about is like well now who's going to fight for us who's now now who's going to uh you know defend us and so if you don't if you can't trust a kinship and then what that does is it makes like things like succession and things like that really unstable and really uncertain and society human society simply ceases to cohere so for this society that and then on generosity being ungenerous you know hoarding in other words like a dragon this is why the dragon is dragons don't always hoard gold they hoard gold in anglo-sax in a germanic society because gold is the thing that you need to you give to your retainers right a king gives gold to his things and his things give service to him in return and it sounds the same as saying i'm paying you for a service but they didn't think of it that way yeah and actually the thought about it very differently than that right it was always the idea that you know the king is in the english accent language he's the ring giver he's the one that you know breaks off the gold rings from his chain and gives it and the idea is he's supposed to be giving it with an open hand and if he doesn't if he starts hoarding the gold then society starts to collapse so these are kind of the two worst things and these are basically the two kinds of evil that we see exemplified by the giants or by the monsters right we've got the giants or the trolls or whatever you want to call grendela's mother who exemplified this kinslaying right and also the the kinslaying and the idea of the blood feud which was just tearing through germanic societies at this time and then with the dragon you have the idea of hoarding right the hoarding the event so in grendel how are they you mean in the sense that they're cannibals is that what you mean by their kinslayers like do they do you say kin do you mean that they're killing humans like in that way so they're they're they are called the kin of cane and then they're compared to and sometimes explicitly sometimes in a subtle way to other famous kinslayers in the story okay so there are a number of human kin slayings and also you know men betraying their masters and things like this in the background that that are so that when we read those stories and when we see these things happening sometimes it's foreshadowing hrothgar is the king of the danes his hall is eventually going to be destroyed by by a civil war and which is a thing that really happened and people reading the poem knew it had happened but this poem is set before it happens and so there's like all this ominous foreshadowing later on there's this awful you know war that involves kinslaying and betrayals of alliances and all these other things with the swedes and the and the yates and all these different people so the the point is that you know c.s lewis when he talks about fairy tales he says that they wear their insides on their outsides right and so grendel and his mother are in a way they're they're manifesting they're making they're bringing to the surface the the kinsling the blood feud and everything else that's really like the big evil or or represents one of the great evils that has to be dealt with in germanic society yeah and so when we look at this you know the other question is well how are there more so so so to answer the question like how is there still a line of cain after the flood right well it's very simple if you the way that you become a you know from the line of gain the way that you become a monster is by doing what kane did yeah like him right be you know becoming a monster right the way that you become like demons is to participate in their works yeah and it's really interesting because there's other germanic literature for instance old norse sagas in which you literally have people actually become a monster in a like a very literal transformative sense yeah by you know for instance this one guy abandons his comrades because they're being attacked and so he just takes all the treasure and he jumps overboard and they never see him again but there's this big sea serpent like a dragon like that haunts that bay from that point forward so it's like well that's that's him yeah yeah yeah yeah so so that kind of a thing as far as what's interesting about about this like and i've been because i've been pondering that i knew the the some of these traditions like i know the baby poem well enough not in any way close to you but because i was always interested about the way in which because kane is both is a kinslayer but he's also a civilizational figure like he brings civilization and so there's a there's an interesting there's awareness about kane and there's also awareness about giants themselves which is that there's a duality to the giants one is the jide as an image of the of the civilization the tyrannical civilization or the you know the this this kind of oppression from above you know the demons kind of come and rape women or or or impose their order but then there's also the degenerate aspect of the descendants of cain which is the hybridity monstrosity chaos cannibalism you know broken causality you know in some ways it does represent in general when i talk about how the modern world is it is like a separation of heaven and earth so the extremes manifest together right this kind of extreme of tyranny and the extreme of chaos and broken reality happen together but in the grendel poem there isn't a sense that the that the giants represent an old civilization or that they represent you know a civilization that was there before us or something like that i mean that's definitely there it is there okay when when when beowulf goes to goes goes into hell actually we'll maybe talk about that in a moment but when he goes down into the the the lair right the underwater of of grandma's mother the troll wife of grendel's mother he finds in there he finds this sword and the sword was forged by the giants okay and it was like this it's like this huge sword it's better than any sword that bill has one of the one of the sort of tropes of the bear sun tale is that the weapons always like his weapons always break because he's too strong yeah and beowulf like throughout the the story just constantly breaks swords it's like three or four times but it's but it's bigger than any sword that he's ever held and but what's really interesting is that is that actually sort of inscribed on the sword right are is the is the actual legend of the the giants in their war with god from the book of enoch so so it's the idea that you know this is a technological marvel a technological wonder which is actually a result of giantish civilization but that's what actually allows beowul to kill grendel's mother is when he uses that sword which himself had made he uses it to cut off her head whereas his own sword what hadn't been up to the task yeah i mean that's interesting also because it's interesting because if you think of the whole problem that i always talk about this problem like the idea of how death how death fights death and how death kind of stands at that limit and to understand noah as also a civilizational figure right know it build the ark and so it's like if if technique comes through kane's descendants noah appears as this strange figure that seems to be able to bridge kane and seth because he takes techne and he uses it to survive the the flood and often it's there's all these weird ways in legends that you find that they try to bridge it you know they'll say that he married nama triple kane's sister like there are ways to try to show that noah bridges the two sides in some ways and he has to in order to survive but it's interesting to think that he uses the the giant sword to kill grendel's mother yeah yeah so that's what he uses and then of course like her blood eats away at the blade so there's nothing but the hilt left yeah when he when he comes back up to the surface so this is i mean there's there are a lot of other interesting similarities that go deeper on the connection between grendel and his mother and the giants of the old testament so maybe one question when you sound the sword it says that it is the story of the giants revolt against god as in the book of enoch how close is it to the book of enochina so glad you asked jonathan i'm so glad you asked because i can reach up and get grab this book so actually this is my own translation of beowulf oh wow i wrote this out by hand along with the it's actually that's the see if i can show you here i mean this is how a fanatic i am about studying this like basically it's like it's like an inner linear thing but then i have like notes about a facing page because there's like two different passages i should have had these ready to go but in one of them crothgar kind of like contemplates he's looking at it way after the fight and he kind of like looks at it and contemplates the blade and like remembers the the blade yeah yeah so it says on them west so on that sword was uh was the origin in written or engraved of ancient strife when the flood slew when the flood of when the flood destroyed with with the rush of the ocean the race of the giants they terribly they fared terribly that was an estranged race that race was estranged to the eternal lord that was their final reward when the waters surge the ruler gave so like the the the the the ruler of heaven that is god gave them their final reward with the surge of the waves so and there's some references to it elsewhere in the poem i don't want to like spend the whole day just playing around through this but i mean i do but not on camera but you know the point of this the point of this is that the the beowulf poet very clearly understands the flood as being mainly god's judgment against the race of the giants which is a very common ancient christian understanding pretty much everybody regardless of whether or not you believe in a satellite hypothesis yeah you don't know they need the book of enoch to have that yeah you don't totally need the book of enoch to have this to kind of to kind of show out like like draw out a couple of other similarities though i think the really strong linking there are a couple of strong links to to the book of enoch from the beowulf poem either either proof of a direct link or maybe as i'm going to talk about in a moment this may be like a case of vernacular apocryphal literature which the beowulfport had access to that doesn't survive but the bill poem does there's some other example examples of this i'll talk about in a sec so there's a couple of things there's the name of grendel himself so the grand is a pretty easy thing to explain it's a perfectly good germanic on sounds like grind not hard to understand the l at the end of grendel's name oh right that it's michael it's gabrielle grendel yeah it's not just them i mean like you've got every pretty much every single one of the the the the the leaders of the fallen angels who mate with mortal men in the book of enoch they're all like uh tamiel and ramiel and daniel and ezekiel and barack yeah lcl and you know all those different yeah so i mean that's that is a difficult there's no way to prove that association without like a bit of linking like a missing link that doesn't exist for us but it's not a normal english accent ending for a name it doesn't yeah and in some ways without without the without the notion of the book of enoch where the names of the fallen angels follow the structure of the biblical names for the angels it's like there's a bit of a there's a bit of a missing gap where you would be hard to jump from naming your fallen angel with an l and understanding that this is related to the archangels or the different names of angels in the in the bible so this is a this is a connection which it would be difficult to absolutely prove yeah but but i think like my intuition is that there's something here but the even stronger association is probably grendel's mother right so if grendel is associated with the old testament giants we would sort of maybe reasonably expect that his his mother is going to be associated with like the daughters of men right what's really interesting is that in the greek translation of the book of enoch we are told that the the daughters of men who interbreed in this way are turned into sirens right well a siren as it was certainly understood by people in you know the english accent world is a water monster right a solitary monster who you know this is probably related to like the the the the hebrew word that's associated with lilith you know that's king james translates it like a screech owl it's that kind of a word but in the sort of understanding you know of you know let's say medieval england by the time by english accent time this the idea of the siren was this sort of uh cannibalistic solitary female water monster the siren is yeah and you find this you find this like for instance you know some of the church fathers reference sirens in this in the same kind of a context right so there's a there's there's some support to this in the beowulfone because in the beowulf poem she's referred to as meru with like a mere wife literally a c maiden or a c woman right which is exactly how you would try to express the idea of a siren yeah anglo-saxon and so there is a yeah for sure all our image views related to water he has to go down into the water and so you can you can like you can kind of keep teasing this thread and chasing the thread and maybe we'll look at this more in the class yeah but there is a very strange there's a very strange passage that refers to you know the danes get really desperate they can't fight grendel they can't get rid of him they pray to god nothing seems to be happening and so they revert to demonic sacrifice they start sacrificing to the demons they fall back into idolatry which is a very interesting thing because of course the bill of potent is perfectly well that this is happening in pre-christian times christianity hasn't come to the north when this homicide prothgar is a historical person we know pretty much right where he lived where he lived all that kind of stuff so and and of course the the beowulf poet knew that as well so to set the events in his chords right that's you know that's kind of nailing down a a date to when this story is supposed to be happening and and it's before way before any of the germanic people started to convert to christianity and but what's really interesting is that the the bill of poet wants to present them as kind of virtuous pagans right in this in this way that there's not going to be room for in western christian theology later on but maybe at this early point there is this idea that that you know there there were sort of virtuous you could say like monotheistic pagans who were you know or they're before the time of christ but they're still worshiping god you know they're they're trying to you know trying to seek god trying to worship him in the best way that they know how yeah right i mean you see images of that in the early christian apologists right that's how they talk about right yes i mean yeah this is this is a pretty it's a pretty common christian idea and this is how the beowulf poet tries to portray frothgar and and the danes except that as a result of this they fell back into idol worship and sacrifice to demons because they can't beat randall basically yeah because they can't be grendel and the interesting thing is that in the book of enoch this transformation of women into sirens is immediately followed by a prophecy that giants would somehow lead men or cause men to start sacrificing to demons in this way so this same kind of a pattern that unfolds in in beowulf is is established there in the book of enoch but it's not explained how it's um you know i have a question like when before they fall to demon worship you know it's at the a pray to god and nothing doesn't work what is the term they're using for god in this case like what is the what what is what do they what's the god what's god to them there's a really robust vocabulary that's used to refer to god in anglo-saxon literature i'm typically speaking he's usually called like the lord the eternal lord the lord almighty almighty god you know there's there's like there's like this is pretty robust vocabulary but but it's it's very you know it's you you can look at that he's using church words basically it's unambiguously okay of the of the scriptures and of like like the old testament scriptures in particular they like they like using old testament terminology to refer to god even when they were talking about christ especially like lord of hosts lord of ours right that kind of stuff very unambiguously cr you know christian language yeah so this is this is just something so there are some some ties here now there are some other examples of of apocryphal literature coming up in the beowulf poem the other one that i'll just kind of talk about real quick and maybe tease a little bit comes up in comes up in the depiction the description of hell or or really the lair of the of the of the mirror wife the layer of the the she troll of grendel's mother and it's very famously there's this description of how it's a really graphic it's really scary it's really it's really you know dark a really beautifully written out in really really beautifully kind of written out in alliterative verse in a beowulf poem and people have noticed for a long time they've noticed that this description of hell is almost the same or identical to the one that's given in one of the blickling homilies so i talked last time about the idea of a homilary right that most people most priests in medieval europe were not expected to be great homeless or great preachers themselves i sometimes think it'd be maybe good to go back to this model like take a little pressure off of of the priests you know and and this will sound weird to protestants who are listening to this because like your pastor's main job is to prep a sermon but actually that wasn't the main job of the priest the main job of the priest was to say the mass and comfort the sick and the dying and you know he had you know presided over baptisms and weddings he had a lot of sacramental duties uh and and so for him the the you know you being a great preacher was not the main thing you were looking for in a pastor and and you know many of these men didn't have a very high level of education and so what they the way that they handled this was that they had there were called homilarities and homilary was basically a collection of homilies structured usually around the church here so it'd be like a homily for every sunday that you'll have to preach this year and then also a homily for like major feast days when people would be coming to church and you would want them to hear a good sermon and in one of the blickling homilies there are a bunch of beautiful ones i'd love to mention i probably mentioned it before but it bears mentioning again for instance one of the blickling homilies refers to the mother of god as god's own arkenstone which if you've read the hobbit the arkenstone right is this precious stone at the the center of the mountain but in in old english means uh it can mean a pearl it's very often used to translate latin margarita you know pearl and then also sometimes used to it's also sometimes used to refer to religious relics right so the idea of the mother of god is like a pearl you can understand but also the idea of her as like a reliquary right or god's own reliquary right yeah which you know so like it's easy to understand that pretty beautiful but it's a beautiful connection to the hobbit so anyway so yeah so but in one of these homilies homily number 16. you get this description of hell i'll read it real quick because it's not very long that well i mean the po the homily is kind of long but i'll just read the end yeah but now let's bid the high angel st michael so this is a it's a homily for michaelness the for st michael's day now let's bid the high angel saint michael and the nine orders of the holy angels that they may be an aid for us against hell foes hellfo by the way very common term that's used throughout the poem for grendel and his mother they were holy ones they were the holy ones for the taking of the souls of men so saint paul was looking in the northern region of the world so this is now referring to an apocryphal work known as the vizio poly the vision of saint paul or the apocalypse of saint paul so saint paul was looking at the northern region of this world where all the waters dropped down and there he saw over that water a certain horror stone remember that they put the they put the germanic people put hell in the north in the extreme north first sort of obvious reasons over that water certain horror stone and north of that stone very frosty woods had grown and there were dark mists and under that stone was the dwelling place of nikors and weirs nikor is a kind of a sea monster and bill fights like a bunch of nikors in the beowulf poem i said there were three monsters there's really like three big monsters and just a bunch of little ones and he saw that on the cliffhung on the icy trees many black souls bound by their hands and their enemies in the likeness of nikors were grasping at them just like the greedy wolf and that water was back was black down under the cliff and between the cliff and the water was about 12 miles and when the branches broke then those souls that had been hanging on those branches fell and the nikors seized them these then were those souls who would unjustly sinned here in the world and did not wish to stop before their life's end but now let's bid saint michael eagerly eagerly that he lead our souls into joy where they might rejoice always without end in eternity so what's being referred to here is that individual poly at least in this particular version of it there's actually a few different versions of it circulating and ultimately it's connected to the the life of adam and eve and all this other literature but in the visual poly saint michael the archangel is the one who's leading saint paul through the afterlife right and it's actually i mean this is a proto text for the divine comedy there's no divine comment about this kind of literature so the so st paul is or the archangel michael is leading paul through and showing him hell and showing him the tortures that await the wicked and you'll notice it's not fire here it's being frozen and falling you know and frosty icy cliffs and being eaten by water monsters and all these different things right this is a very distinctly kind of northern germanic vision of hell so what's really interesting about this is that in this and in a couple of other places the beowulf poet will reference this homily or reference other things about saint michael the archangel and never explicitly because of course because of course the the people he's writing about the danes at the point they're not christians they don't know anything about archangel michael and and the bail foot is pretty careful about not allowing his characters to know things that they wouldn't know if without without the revelation let's say yeah right and so he's like very careful about this even like very mundane things right he's very careful about the flow of information he's he's i mean really artistic really really good storyteller but so so this is the thing there are these little archangel michael references throughout the poem but but he never can can mention him specifically and so for a long time people thought just thought oh well he's doing this thing here where he's referring vision of hell from a homily he'd heard and now he's putting it into his poem well maybe that's what happened but actually the more recent evidence for reasons i won't go into right now they have to do with textual findings and things like this is that is it actually probably both the blickling homily and the beowulf poem are referencing the same vernacular translation of the vizio poly so there was an endless action translation in the vernacular that they were both borrowing from and later on later on it's lost and so all we have is these borrowings but we don't have the vernacular version itself but you can go on and look at the uh the connections that are being drawn and there's a really brilliant essay that basically posits without you know just reading the whole essay to you here there's a recent essay that's come out really beautiful that basically suggests that the reason that the beowulf poet poet is used is making all these subtle archangel michael references in the poem which his audience would certainly have understood so at the same time that he's making these references to the archangel michael he is also making references to to the the the dragon slaying of fafnir which is like the great prototypical germanic dragon slang story okay so he's consciously drawing this connection between the great christian dragon slayer which is of course say michael or at least he's one of them and then the great pagan dragon slayer right the which varies a little bit depending on the vision of the story sigured or or siegfried depending on how old the story is but point is point is that he's he's drawing these connections between a great christian dragon slaying story or serpent defeating story and then the great pagan serpent defeating story and he's com he's drawing connections in the minds of his audience to beowulf to the to his main character to his protagonist who is not quite a pagan yeah but also not quite a christian you know and he gets the end of his life beowulf has this sort of a speech where he's you know at the very end of his life he's he's been you know feist the dragon spoilers kills it with some help but it's poisoned and is about to die so as he's as he's dying he kind of he's talking to weglaf his his young kinsmen and he's kind of going over you know his life and talking about the things that he did the wars that he's fought the monsters he's killed the way that he's ruled his people into his old age all these different things and he's kind of like contemplating basically whether or not he's gonna make the cut right he's got no certainty of salvation you know through the sacraments or through christ or through the confession of his sins but what he says is i never fought against my kin i never betrayed any of my loyalties i never right you know i was never stingy with my things right all these things that we talked about that are like these are the worst possible sins in this context this is the work of cain beowulf who is you know sometimes the sort of monstrous or ambiguous figure especially early on in his life comes the end of it and says he rejected all of those things and so because of this the king of heaven will have no need to uh to punish him right so it says the king of heaven it's the king of heaven or lord of heaven i mean yeah something like that yeah like i said there's there's a lot of but i mean it's it's very clearly you know for both the poet and the for both the poet and also for the audience yeah they know who they're referring to yeah it's very clearly yeah and it's an interesting it's an interesting like if you understand it subtly like this this this subtle poem where people could both let's say nostalgically participate in the ancient story but then also have a kind of a grip of sadness to see like he's not like he's he's on the and because of the lack his lack of because he's not a christian it's like what does it mean you know how what how do how can we understand this like there's a there's a kind of a deep a very a very deep sentiment there that's happening so this is what's so interesting and complex and beautiful to me about the beowulf poem and i think why i'm so deeply attracted to it is because the beowulf poet is i mean the story that he tells is very sensitive it's very it it handles this question of like our righteous pagan ancestors and all these different things right handles it all with a great deal of delicacy it seems like sometimes maybe he's trying to make a like to censure or condemn certain aspects of like the old germanic paganism right the the blood feud and the where guild and all this different stuff but he's ne he never comes out as far as like totally condemning it to and to this day peop you know students read the the poem like if they really read the poems half of them will come away thinking this is a celebration of these old heroic ideals and the other half will come away thinking that he oh no he's condemning these things actually he's not really doing either he's maybe kind of pointing out some of the problems but also it's clear that he's passed the test of love that he loves the thing that he's writing about and he loves the the kind of story that he's telling and so he's he never he never comes out quite as like condemning the old ideal of northern courage but maybe also ultimately says but this isn't really it's not enough you've gotta you've got to move on from this now so it's a really beautiful poem and i think like i said you know i've given just a few examples here there's a lot more and if some of the stuff is murky i apologize to the audience some of the stuff is like well if you gave me two hours or i could give you like 20 pages to read then then then you know i could i could get you all the way there but hopefully this will be enough to kind of tease connections for people and they can start to see a way in which you know a lot of the stuff i'm saying is only groundbreaking in that in the past when people have read the beowulf poem they come across things like sort of like a plurality of divine beings you know which you find at the beginning of the poem mentioned in the same breath as kind of this idea of a monotheistic biblical god and this is the come across stuff like that and say well christianity doesn't have anything like this in it because they're thinking in terms of modern christianity or maybe sometimes like really late medieval catholic roman catholicism christianity and so they they say well christianity doesn't have this terminology and it doesn't have this vocabulary it doesn't have these ways of thinking about the world so this has to be paganism that's still like lurking somewhere in the poem and in if you believe that then basically the poet doesn't know what he's doing because because then it's just like a really bad stitch job and my argument is that that's not the case that the poet is actually a supremely careful and gifted poet he's striking this really delicate balance between you know paganism and christianity this apocryphal literature the old testament scriptures all those things come together beautifully in this poem so if that sounds like your thing and you'd like to know more about it and specifically to hear the reading available from this particular perspective which really not a little there's scholarship out there but as far as like in a classroom setting you're not going to get that pretty much anywhere sign up for our class yeah definitely i mean i definitely i want to be for sure i wanted us to do it together if we can because yeah i find it very exciting you know i read they were for a long time ago and i remember exactly the problems that you're saying which is you know because you can't it was hard and you read it in your 20s you always start to read it with a commentary because it's so difficult and so you end up with that perception which is that this is some but i remember when the very first time i read it and i read this idea of description of of cain and the giants and the flood and thinking you know what i think this guy he knew what he was doing and so it's like as we kind of understand more and more you know the the mythological language of christianity and we're kind of rediscovering it i think that that that it's going to be clear and clear so thanks thanks richard thanks for doing the work man it's just so amazing thanks for having me i like i said i i sometimes i come to the end of these things i'm like man that was kind of muddled and i hope people you know are able to kind of piece that all together because in you know i've i mean i literally this whole shelf right here to my right is about half just either commentaries on beowulf or translations of it or or like different versions of the original text like i just you know for years and years i've just collected the scholarship on the poem and deeply interested in it and sometimes my my brain gets ahead of my mouth and you know i don't say everything i intended to say but hopefully this is a good introduction to the poem and people will check out the class so yeah definitely so everybody pay pay attention and and of course our discussion with richard will continue so thanks richard all right thanks jonathan thank you this episode is part of a series of discussions i've had with richard roland on universal history you can find a list of all these episodes on my youtube channel where you can find them also in my podcast stream from the symbolic world on your different podcast platforms make sure to check out richard's second podcast which you hosts in collaboration with father andrew damick called amen soul which looks at the relationship between tolkien and orthodoxy this podcast has also inspired in me some ideas for creating some images whether it be the king under the mountain whether it be the grail or beautiful ethiopian traditions i've created some products which you can find on my store the symbolic world.store and it will probably be more of those to come very soon so stay tuned this conversation is ongoing and there is still very much to explore in the universal history
