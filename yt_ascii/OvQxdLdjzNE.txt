in this lesson we're going to be looking at a very neat inbuilt package in python and this is inside the collections package it is a counter and what this allows us to do is count the elements in an array with some added functionality so for example i'm going to go ahead and paste in the list i had from earlier and i'll do this in here so my list is going to have all of these letters and usually you can create your own functionality to count them of course but it doesn't give us the added functionality of this counter so if we go ahead and first create the counter because we need to create a counter and inside the counter we need to insert the list and as soon as we print the counter we should get a counter with the count of each one of these elements so there are seven a's five d's three b's and one c so that was a very quick way on how we could count the elements in the array but other functions we can do but there are also other functions we can perform such as updating the count so if we want to update the count of e we can go ahead and do that by typing update and if we print the counter now we're going to have e added to the counter and we can multiply this and we're going to have two e's added to the counter so it's that simple to keep track of items in this counter but let's go ahead and remove the second counter and something else we can do if we don't really care about the amount of each element is go ahead and create a list of the counter dot keys and if we print that we're going to see that our list contains a b c d and e and that's a lot like using the set in python now just like we updated the list we can go ahead and remove from the list so we can go ahead and call counter dot subtract and here we can subtract any element we want we can subtract a and from seven it's going to go to six so if we go ahead and say print the counter we're going to notice that a is going to drop to six and we can do this as many times as we want so if we run it now we'll even go into negatives it's going to keep track of everything but let's remove that and it also comes with some other methods that are really cool such as counter dot most common and we can decide how many elements we want to get back and if we just want to get the first most common we'll insert one and it's going to return to us a because it has six which is the highest number if we decide to insert two we're going to get the two most counted elements so that will be a and d and finally we can go ahead and get the total count of all the elements if that interests you just by typing in counter dot total and here we have 16 in total 16 elements in total including the update here and the subtraction over here but that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's lesson counters are really cool and very easy to use and they are built into python so you just have to import them from collections and you can start using them immediately in your projects
