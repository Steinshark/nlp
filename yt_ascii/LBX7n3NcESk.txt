is that better ah shoot sorry how about now ugh thankfully this is the last time i'll ever have to do that obspot sponsored this showcase of their offspot tiny a webcam with pan tilt zoom functionality built in that uses ai to keep you in the frame let's get this thing swapped out there we go well definitely looks better but what about the tracking okay tracking light went green hey i'm over here buddy over here buddy how you doing yeah there's your box right there so we're gonna we're gonna check you out right now [music] let's start by opening this thing up pretty straightforward packaging that's a really really nice soft phone they do not want this thing getting damaged which is obviously a much larger concern if you've got like a gimbal mounted camera right so you can see it's got one two axes of movement so it can track its subject around like that it actually has i think it's about 270 degrees not that you should theoretically be moving around that much it's got a dual microphone well it's hard to hold on to be careful it's got a dual microphone array mic non-slip thing on the bottom and then it's actually also got a quarter inch interface so you can mount it on a little tripod on your desk or i mean really any anything else you want other than that you've got interestingly a dc five volt one amp power jack and a usb c input which would normally provide power you know what that's probably so that you could use it with something like an optical usb cable which wouldn't provide power in some kind of like machine vision application that's something i yeah i wouldn't have initially thought of but that's kind of a cool application for something like this as well also in the box we've got a usb a to c cable that hopefully was repackaged by our logistics guys because i would think it doesn't come like that either that or i can blame ploof who prepped this episode oh okay this appears to be some kind of weighted or magnetic mount or something is this are you a magnet you're a magnet and then i guess you could also use this to oh wait oh hey there you go all right so the magnet part is for the base of the obs bot so you can quickly take it off and put it back on this is like a like a grippy pad and this would allow you to put it on top of i don't know if i would put this on a laptop so much oh okay yeah i don't know if i'd put it on a laptop so much but definitely on a desktop monitor i would expect that to sit pretty pretty well let's hear andy you you got the camera behind me right let's throw it on a desktop monitor i think is more reasonable there you go yeah okay yeah that's more that's more like it all right let's put it on the stand idea that andy came up with though and let's give the motion tracking a try let's just go ahead and plug in our type c cable and this it's power and data because it's a copper cable you get this little startup animation and then boom it's on so let's open up the software and tell it tap lock now it should start tracking my face once it's detected that there is a face hey obspot how you doing so one of the main applications of something like this is not that you are too incompetent to point your webcam at your face like i kind of implied at the beginning of the video the main application is if you're someone who might have a tendency to lean as you talk or someone who kind of likes to shift in their chair and get more comfortable and making it so that whoever you're talking to is always able to see your face always centered in the frame one of the other applications that obspot has talked about is if you're someone like a twitch streamer for example if you were to crop your camera into just a little square that's like right down on the bottom of the frame of the game you're playing then any small movement could start you know cutting off the side of your head for example whereas with this it can track you if you move and make sure that you're always in the correct part of the frame so that's that's actually pretty darn cool it's got a few different modes so we can try that out this is also pretty good yeah if you're if you're a lecturer who needs to kind of walk back and forth across a whiteboard and point at different stuff this would absolutely be an excellent way to handle that i mean we can even try why don't i why don't i just stand up first oh were you were you ready for that okay well here i'm not gonna stand up just yet but let's just kind of slide over here and all right i'll give you guys a little geography lesson here all right so this right here is where linus media group is so this is the center of the known universe right there oh it's pretty responsive so the thing that this reminds me of most so far is actually center stage which is a new feature from apple that well basically does this except it's actually using digital zoom so it's zooming in and then moving around the kind of doing a digital pan in order to track you whereas this you're actually keeping the full image quality of the camera no matter where you move so that's up to 1080p 30fps 720p 60fps there's a few different modes though so tap on lock seems to make it not track you tap lock seems to make it track you hello yep okay cool you can digitally zoom it how granular is the control okay cool and more importantly there's a few different modes so standard mode then there's headroom mode headroom mode is more designed for tall users if they want more tight framing to make sure that their head won't constantly be cut off by the the edge of the frame and then they've got motion mode which is more designed for like really dynamic presentations where you you want to always be in the frame so if i oh yeah so it tracks you way faster so if you were someone like a fitness instructor and you're like yeah now we're moving over here yeah now we're moving over here yeah now we're moving over here it's like hey okay i'm gonna keep up with this guy now we're gonna we're gonna stand up here hey we're we're doing the shaken dance the shaking bacon dance i'm going to head over here hey obsibot what's up all right cool oh it's actually it's actually pretty good now i'm just curious let's see if it can follow me if i manage to get out of the frame okay i'm going over here why is that feels like playing peek-a-boo with like a baby i'm here it's like where'd he go where'd he go hey i'm over here hey you got him okay that's that's pretty cool oh interesting so you can switch between multiple devices yeah like i said okay they're apparently planning ahead for this being used in machine vision applications so they expect you to have multiple devices so within the software you can switch between them zoom it in and out with software hotkeys put it into preset positions okay that's pretty cool and then you can actually put it to sleep so you can either press sleep or you can do this and that will actually put it into sleep mode and then the gimbal is just right here so you can reset it and then you actually just have like a little controller data majig and then yeah absolutely you could do you could do like a multi-cam live stream type thing the video quality is like it's fine it's it's a webcam like you shouldn't have unrealistic expectations but it's fine i would like a way to have more granular control over things like the auto exposure it's very aggressive it's all about making sure it's capturing what it's seeing versus making sure that the colors are pleasing to the eye you know so my skin in particular ends up looking quite washed out sometimes as it sort of quickly adjusts to different lighting situations this is a very challenging lighting setup to be very clear guys yeah like i'm i'm backlit by studio lighting right now now there's a couple gestures you can put your hand up to start auto tracking or you can go like this apparently for 2x digital zoom oh interesting oh so now zoom hey hey hey there we go and that's pretty much it it does cost 200 but considering the price of pan tilt zoom cameras in general and webcams as well it's honestly not totally unreasonable oh actually there's one last thing andy they boast about their low light image quality so do you want to just like kill this light in front of me and let's just let's just see i'll let you guys be the judge so we're gonna be this is a very challenging scenario where i'm backlit and we turn off the studio lighting but let's see how it handles it all right obs bot show me what you've got yep it's a webcam all right but with pan tilt zoom so guys if you need something a little like this we're gonna have it linked down in the video description thanks again to obspot for sponsoring this video and to you guys for watching it
