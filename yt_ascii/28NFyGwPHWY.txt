spelt is better for beginners bold take this is a bold take right here okay this is a bold take because you know what you know because when i when i hear that you know what i think what is hdmx good for if spelt is for beginners is hdmx for big brain high iq end of the iq chart or is it even worse is it just for mid wits am i a midwit htx is for boomers and senior engineers senior engineers as in like really old engineers i get okay come on enough with the boomer talk okay i'm only 37 okay i'm not a boomer yet your definition of a boomer hurts my boomer feelings okay hi i'm cameron and welcome to my tad talk i'm here to shout my opinion about frontend frameworks into the endless void of hot takes and terrible opinions i love the starting of this this is great cameron you have my respect already i firmly believe that anyone learning front-end web development should start with spelt rather than react i always knew i liked cameron i could always tell i could tell from the beginning beginning of this article that i liked cameron i could just i could feel it in my bones okay i could feel it deep down what is spelt the word spelt is from french okay i don't like cameron i thought i liked cameron but now i don't like cameron spelt meaning slim slender which is a perfect description for a framework that prized itself on minimalist design spelt was first released in 2016 and recently updated to version 4 in june of this year i first discover spelt around a month ago after seeing it featured on a youtube video by the prime j let's go oh gosh pre-read pre-at let's go let's go oh yes yes oh i knew i liked cameron let's go cameron my first application in spelt was a website that replays a competitive programming competition leaderboard on ctis on the same day that i started that project i also finished it nice that was a long ass day was it like a 37h hour day usings felt that day made me feel like a superhero i had informed my competition team about the tool i was going to make for us and i was able to release it to them on the same day something i don't think would have been possible if i started out learning a framework like react okay fair i think that's actually a fair take my experience with react let's go man this okay clearly clearly cameron cameron you wrote this just for me to you wrote this for me to read i could tell i could tell you little you dirty dog i can just feel it my first experience with front in development was using react for my university's competitive programming club website nice job let's see it let's check it out i did competitive programming by the way it's one of the best things you can do if you haven't done competitive programming honestly you are missing out heavily competitive programming is a fant fantastic thing to do at least once in your life got regionals first place regional acm didn't qualify for worlds though got pretty dang far though huge fan of that type of stuff anyways jumping into the code base was quite the cold shower when oh cold showers are good for you are you saying it's positive for you you're having a nice adrenal response in a healthy way when searching for help on the react website you can find some pretty good tutorials to help you learn after a week you should have a firm grasp on most the concepts that react offers state management still quite tricky sure react's fundamentals aren't impossible but its approach to building ui dev at significantly from traditional development this is something i feel like spelt stays close to okay okay i like this i like this what's the difference maker there are two points i would like to raise on what makes felt so much better for beginners i would say that if you can finish an entire project in a singular day maybe it's not better for beginners maybe it's just better i've always enjoyed spelt oh my gosh the way spelt has structured their tutorial website and documentation is top ti you also get hit if you go through the felt documentation or the the tutorial one of the first things you get hit with is quite the classic it's beautiful it's almost like a layoff for le code nice nice yeah it's it's great welcome to felt all this kind of stuff you get to go through everything sure react also has a tutorial on their website in no way is that tutorial better than spelts react has structured their tutorial through documentation rather than interactive layout like spel yeah i think go did go went with this approach right your little learn go where you're doing these small interactive websites i think this makes a huge difference it makes a huge difference to have interactive tutorials i mean for me at at my stage in life all i want to see is an example and like a one sentence describing the problem that it solves like that's what i want to see maybe that's in incorrect but i often don't want to have to read the entire documentation just to understand how to use something right i just need i just need the 0 to 60 really quick move on with my life this may be a personal preference but when i was learning react i would have loved something like spelts tutorial where every concept could be treated like a leak code problem that i needed to solve it's just how my brain works i believe this style of learning is the most productive when it comes to teaching something new in programming actually i i would agree with this take doing it with your hands rather than reading is huge reading through docs and seeing examples and stuff like that is really nice after you have a concept right like after you know what you're doing then reading through stuff is like it it it just like you can gain so much understanding but just cold like just cold water reading through something i feel like it's like it's it's difficult doing it with the hands is huge absolutely practice is always greater than theory on the initial learn you need the theory though you need the the theory ah i can't get over the simplicity of this framework everything just makes sense you want to make a component that adds two numbers together script a b input a b bind value let's go a plus b boom there it is now switch to react export default oh default oh i can't tell if i like default or or not every time i say i hate default i think i actually like default and then i just never know all i know is that export default is the reason why things feel like they can't never played together nicely anyways okay you got to use a bunch of states there we go set target there we go we got to set target to this there we go parse in plus parse int plus i don't know about this parse int business you use i don't know about this this whole parse in business is that because you're using target. value and it's not it's like a oh no it's type number so it should be a number i'm not really sure about that parent you might have acally made it a little bit too complicated there your explicit returns kind of person so it makes sense i am an explicit returns kind of person my brother and sister in christ there is no debate from someone who used to be a react fanboy to the felt code is easier to read more enjoyable to write simple agreed absolutely agreed to this statement as a beginner starting out with react my first thoughts when reading code were what i think the thing that makes react so hard often is that i mean whenever like whenever i read tutorials everything's really nicely aligned and it's really really nice and easy but when i read actual code that somebody has written it's not by someone who's like a react perfect oran organizer of code and life and logic instead it's 400 lines of use effect and other crap that go into it and you're just like what am i reading i have to like i have to learn the universe before i can learn what's happening here it's very very difficult cameron i'm taking this i'm taking it it's mine open source open source i just open sourced your article open source that there you go i gave you a little you got you got that you got that that all right let's keep on going sure at times verbosity is needed no not you java i have three years of pain with java i have quite a few years of pain with java i understand it when learning something like front end for the first time the verbosity can be overwhelming at times and that's the last thing you want when trying something new fair i mean there's a lot of complication whenever you're doing any of these things the tool chain is such a huge pain in the butt when it comes to working with the front end you know when you when you don't even have a concept of what typescript is let alone that typescript is a superet of javascript that has to be compiled down and that some of your types actually have you result in real code and and you know like all the things that go into it and then you have to know like that all comes together and then that all gets loaded onto a website then something has to transfer down the scripts like the amount of stuff you have to know when running it's a lot and people often forget how much knowledge you have to have and i always say that i feel so bad for people learning to program today cuz when i learned a program i had to launch net beans write a program and press play like that's it it you opened up a directory you created a java file and that's like it that is all there was to it now it's like you have to know so much before you actually get to the point of understanding anything that's happening it's wild oh god grandpa telling war stories again i think you just forget how simple life was right cuz like needing to know about http it's a lot whatever from the trenches i've since gone on to rewrite this website in felt and i love it as a beginner being able to learn even more about this framework has been exhilarating for me some of you argue that spelt has a smaller community and smaller job market to that i argue not everything you'll learn will help you get a job and the community is ever growing along with the ecosystem you will learn a lot more about how things work just in basic javascript css and and and the htmls you'll learn a lot more so this is a good point be fun and learn spelt to help you understand the basics of front end development with components and reactivity spelt has a lot going for it and a proud adopter i'm excited for the future spelt this was a good enough article my boy cameron you got the follow i'm number 11 thank you for such a wonderful article this was really good this is actually a really it's a really good article and i hope that people take a moment to check out felt especially if you're new cuz i know there's a lot of you that are super new that just you're just trying to figure out life take a check i mean you know me i'm going to i'm going to always be super into hdmx but you guys don't have to be you guys can check out spelt you can like it you can enjoy yourself should be a good time the name spelen
