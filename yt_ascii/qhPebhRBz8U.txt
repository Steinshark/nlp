ladies and gentlemen in this video i am super excited to share with you the fascinating story of the golden boy of argentina i am speaking about faustino oro you probably haven't heard his name but that will change today he is nine years old he is rated 2 800 on chess.com he is the youngest ever person in history to cross 2200 elo and he is 12 points away now just a month later from crossing 2300 fide elo in this video i'm going to show you four of his games three that he's played on chess.com where he's crushed grandmasters and one where he beat an international master over the board he is the pride of argentina and as they say in argentina muchachos and before we jump into the games i want to thank the sponsor of today's video quite fittingly babel folks why do you watch me chess

you're interested in learning or where in the world you're watching me from now let's get back to the video so game number one faustino's got the white pieces and he's playing against mr tataglia which is not anybody's legal name that's not what it says on his passport i believe that's grandmaster kozak from from hungary and a lot of faustino's online games and practice come entitled tuesday i've actually never played him thank god but he gets to play a lot of grand masters and when they play online grandmasters especially entitled tuesday when they see that you know they're like a 200 point favorite they're gonna play offbeat sicilians now what i've noticed about faustino is his repertoire is very good with white and black but he's got a very sophisticated playing style so if you play nonsense against him he's gonna punish you if you play play good stuff against him he's not gonna melt he's a very good attacker and defender he knows when to be tactile he knows when to be positional and he keeps his nerves i mean he's literally the perfect prototype chess player so this sicilian is off beat and not very good because it allows white to hit the knight it allows white to occupy the center is it losing no but faustino like i said if you play a stupid line against him he's going to know how to take advantage and this is how you take advantage against the nymphs of each sicilian and then you can choose which way you're going to castle your king so knight c6 bishop f4 and kozak plays e6 temporarily blocking in this bishop and this bishop will probably go to e7 and black will castle so now we have queen d2 queen c7 and you'll notice that white is not committing the king yet white is finishing the development could he have gone long here probably all right but bishop d3 a6 and instead faustino plays short castle so he's not going for long castle like folks you don't have to invite me twice to play long castles in this position i am an aggressive chess player like if i can cast along i'm going to do it right he doesn't though he just plays short castle like i said he's got a very sophisticated playing style black plays h6 maybe in the future black is going to play here he doesn't bring his rogues he doesn't over commit any pawns he just plays bishop g3 he just waits he's just letting his opponent play a move his opponent plays b5 that's a pretty big commitment rook d1 like you know what i would play if my opponent played b5 i would play b3 which is not a good move like i mean it's not a bad move but you don't need to place rook d1 because he's not afraid of c4 he's not afraid of this move because he's just gonna play bishop e4 so bishop b7 played by black and now queen e2 do you know what the idea of queen e2 is queen e2 looks unbelievably what is the point of queen e2 the point of queen e2 is that in the future white can play this white can he is sliding his queen out of the way to make room for his knight in the future maybe c4 i mean i would never in a million years play them with queen e2 and like this dude he's nine and his positional abilities are really really strong notice how black is also trying to get aggressive without committing his king now we have bishop e4 like at some point black is gonna have to commit the king he plays h5 faustino right on q h4 stops the attack and now drops the knight back to h2 so that he can reroute it this way in the future if necessary now we have long castle and the position is locked but white is better why is white better because black has run out of pawn play black is really struggling to move he's really overextended a lot of his pawns are too far and at some point he's gonna have to do something here and it's going to be a a rough position he lashes out with d5 and faustino like like ultra precise trades trades everything and just comes back doesn't rush notice how he he's only moved one pawn two two ranks forward in the current position he's going to g3s just once h5 black just has too many weaknesses so black tries to force the issue again i've seen trades bishops trades bishop brings the knight out not rushing patient slowly removing his opponent's play queen to d4 rook slides out of the way he takes the pawn he's done all this without moving a single pawn it feels like he moved one pawn to freeze his opponent's pawns queen back knight back and now he plays one pawn move which is to kick the knight out brings the king up a square pins the knight to the queen and he ends the game with surgical precision rook takes e5 and black resigns because whatever he takes with knight d7 is coming if queen e5 knight d7 if rookie 5 queen e5 queen e5 and the knight d7 i mean he made a 2900 rated gm looked like it wasn't even a close match hey he barely moved his pawns it's just a a perfect positional game i was just absolutely floored at this and the thing is he was doing this against some of the best grandmasters like i struggled to beat these players you know what i'm gonna open up dimitri i mean i've played dimitri a handful in bullet i've beat him in bullet i'm 9 and 12 against them in blitz it's like six nothing him i mean i don't beat these guys in title tuesday so this is a game where faustino had white it was an advanced caro okay it wasn't a sicilian h4 tile variation beautiful stuff a main line knight d2 knight f3 this has all been played many many times before and you'll just notice like in this game white has to move his pawns a lot he's playing just good solid balance position rook d8 a4 taking some space bishop a3 training the bishops and positions just equal i mean it's nothing special what's special is like how the game proceeds from here all right it's rooks and knights rooks knights and pawns no queens no bishop faustino centralizes his knight it's a very tense fight rook d5 you know black black plays rook d8 very very intense position and now dimitri starts doing what a lot of grand masters start overtaking the game right so he's gonna start overtaking his young opponent he takes on d4 take take take and just looks like white is a pawn down i mean it just looks like dimitri's one upon okay he stockpiled pressure on on the on the d-pawn and on the rook and a lot of people would panic here myself included faustino just moves out of the way all right gives up the pawn on d4 and he's not even worse i mean he's just not even worse the night is bad the b6 pawn is weak the a pawn will be an asset and if this falls this falls and if that falls that falls how did this happen how did it happen now here faustino plays a move that makes me think he will 100 be a grandmaster what would i play in this position i might play a5 i might play rook a one you know what he plays here down upon he trades the rooks why because this end game is not losable it's just a5 he correctly evaluates that despite temporarily being a pawn down his king is further advanced than black's king and black skin can't even get close so he's just gonna go here and take and despite being a full pawn down he's playing for a win in an end game to be a pawn down in an end game is bad to be a pawn down in an end game against the grand master is very bad to be a pawn down in an end game against the grand master and be playing for a win is unheard of it doesn't make sense king d3 and it's still equal according to stockfish but give it a few moves and suddenly black might lose his second pawn and he still has drawing chances but faustino sophisticated cool common collected wins the pawn from two point from a pawn down to upon up it's still not over but he defends everything brings his king now all the way up as black is trying to run his king around king d4 king c5 we're going in this is unbelievable i mean again it's a second game that i have shown you he's just completely from start to finish out playing a grand master this time he's out playing him from a position of weakness i mean like i was looking at this game my jaw was on the floor now black did not resign never resign when there's a knight also black is tilted faustino very clean gets to an end game and he simplifies in a way that you should simplify he goes here king e4 look at this sacrificing his queen i mean this is just flashy stuff no need for this but he's winning the king and pawn end game and they play till mate actually which is kind of funny but and also obviously white only has two seconds so it takes a little while don't worry he knows how they're not stalemate and he he wins here you can have a debate as to whether or not it's you know the black should have resigned but you see white only has one second on the clock basically so it's okay it's okay to play for a flag and blitz i mean folks this was unbelievable when i saw this game i was like i mean he lost the pawn and he was not even worse and he was clever enough to trade into an end game where his king i mean this is i would have never played like this i mean this kid has more poise and patience than i do and and he's one-third my age he's nine i'm 27. like i'm still gonna be like three pieces and he just well actually i would not trade pieces he trades the pieces and effortless and you know like i said he does this with white or with black like he doesn't mind you know he was playing french grandmaster etienne bakro also online and he you know they they had a they had a very very locked opening position and in this game faustino did not do very well in the opening all right he was not super familiar white got a very active aggressive position and as you can see black is you know being being pushed backwards and black only has 30 seconds on the clock i mean i mean i would lose this position in the next seven moves i would play here okay already he's much better then i would play knight d7 stopping f6 you know then then back crow would go here then he would like sacrifice on on h6 look at what this kid the way this kid defends this position is otherworldly it's 30 seconds on the clock nine years old please h5 uses his own king's pawn to defend but crow plays bishop f4 the queen goes back now the knight is still hanging back rule plays f6 so if you take the knight of course i go here and i win it's defended by the rook right he just opens up his king now he's losing black is losing but only if white plays the absolute best move like if why does stockfish black is gonna lose so he sacrifices his rook if you take knight f6 is a devastating attack so what does faustino do after take rookie seven with 15 seconds on the clock he takes the knight he takes the knight in five seconds now white is like wait a minute can i take the rook can i take this rook what do i do he takes this rook now queen d8 take take and when the dust settles black is better somehow he managed to completely fend off like look at the assault coming in and he manages to completely just did white miss a win of course but that's that's chess that's life it's just insane and and now now everything is fine now everything is fine but you know you know everything is not just fine because faustino takes a pawn he has seven seconds on the clock he's gonna play this for a win many people including myself would be fine with a draw at this point he brings his queen forward he brings his knight forward he doesn't wear a queen block king g7 white is still trying to open up the position king is safe knight centralized and here comes here comes black's knight and black's bishop and whites only got two seconds on the clock so of course the rest of the game is pandemonium with queen e5 and he goes to an end game again he is comfortable in the end game here comes his knight king g6 knight d3 check and of course it's still it's still very complicated but in this position white's clock ran out white had to play knight t8 and try to continue eating the pawns but he went on to win this game i mean a game where 15 seconds on the clock and just a monstrous attack coming towards his king and he just defends it like perfectly i mean like to the just i was floored when i saw this game but that's online well you would be happy to know that this success carries over to games that he's played over the board he recently played a tournament in argentina there's a lot of tournaments in south america in argentina and chile in brazil i think peru has some chester south american continent is a very rich with chess culture so you know they they love their achhadres and he i mean he gets a chance to play some very very good title players and this was a game that he played in january and the beta is open and his opponent is named jaime romero barretto from venezuela and you'll really enjoy this game because again it just shows you the poise like this kid is just playing normal boring chess understanding that like sometimes you can't get all the tactics a lot of kids love tactics this dude doesn't mind he's like all right take the pawn knight g5 all right we got a trade i gotta play a little bit of ugly defense against knight f6 check and bishop b7 queen c8 no problem absolutely no problem at all white plays rookie one black continues developing b3 and now bishop b2 and here is the most impressive thing i mean by far so white is going to play bishop here f4 queen h5 in this position faustino starts over playing out playing his 2400 rated opponent first he puts a pawn in the center then he attacks with his f pawn too and then he trades the bishops and centralizes the bishop on f6 now it's a very tense position white would love to play queen f3 you cannot rush with queen f3 because e4 is winning right that's not how he won the game but after bishop f6 white played rook b1 so now that's no longer going to be a thing so black plays queen b7 check we have queen to f3 we have e4 and the players enter a forcing sequence after takes bishop takes b2 rook b2 and now faustino plays knight e5 okay very tense moment in the game he has not taken back on e4 he is attacking the queen trying to remove it so that then he can play like this now if the queen goes to c3 fe4 you cannot take the knight because e3 is discovered check and then this comes in and white is losing everything but 95 is a very very tense moment you can play queen f4 queen e3 queen c3 they all seem okay white plays queen f1 black plays rookie a so faustino enters a forcing sequence of moves against the player 200 points higher than him on elo probably not by skill i think by skill this dude is already like 23.50 2400 strength very tense position right so here white has to just not rush stay patient and apparently play a move like rook bb1 so that then you can bring the rook here and try to like it's like knight c4 just try to kind of neutralize the black position instead white makes an inaccuracy white plays the move f3 now this move is inaccurate because it's actually a weakening of the position you would think that you're putting a pawn some words defended three times it's not true the reason it's not true is that it opens up the second rank and faustino like a surgeon queen c6 what is the idea of queen c6 i don't understand well if you take on f5 knight g6 i hit this i hit this so you cannot do that okay since you cannot play e takes f5 what can you play why can't you play c4 fork okay why can't you play i don't know rookie three knight g6 queen g5 h6 queen h5 f4 the knight is defended and black is attacking if you try to get out of the way i have queen c3 and i just win the game okay i'm gonna win everything over here i probably have something even better rookie five first and then queen c3 so the point is in this very tense position with the snap of your fingers this little man plays queen c6 takes the pawn on c2 because white needs to defend himself place queen to d3 and the second that white takes it doesn't take back he slides out of there and white cannot stop knight d3 this is completely ridiculous this man just infiltrates with his queen and slides out there's nothing you can do the triple fork is coming i'm i'm gonna make a move that that forks three pieces you can move your queen it doesn't change anything because i'm gonna take the knight you can move a rook doesn't change anything because i'm on a fork crazy the mechanics of the position all favor black he plays knight d3 he trades he trades rookie to check and he takes on f5 and he's just up a rook for a night and look how clinically he converts this he hunts down his opponent's pawns starts bringing his king white can walk in a little bit all good king g8 has to defend himself trades blocks the white rook from coming in a5 rook b5 a4 rook d4 and just walks down with the c pawn and the game is over sacrifices his rook rook d1 c1 and this was his highest ever over the board win he defeated a 23-67 player make no mistake i will tell you when he beats a grandmaster he hasn't played many grand masters over the board yet i think he's played like one or two max this dude is going to be a problem he's he's so good like he is nine years old the youngest ever player to reach 2200 feet a he is currently 22.88 okay so he will probably be the youngest player to ever reach 2300 he very well could be the youngest player to ever reach 2 400 and i don't know argentina might very well have a a messy of chess pretty soon too early to tell but incredible to see and he this this kid is so strong maybe i'll play him in a few games i hope you enjoyed today's video get out of here
