hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the best engines it's the show where i talk about award-winning engines and today we have something stupidly powerful it's the 6.2 liter dodge hellcat and it won awards auto 10 best engines award in 2015. so we're going to talk through the specifications give an overview of the engine bay and talk about the airflow and then get into some of the cool features of this engine now this is a 6.2 liter supercharged 90 degree v8 engine producing 707 horsepower at 6000 rpm and 600 pound-feet of torque at 4 800 rpm and at 707 horsepower this was the most powerful production car engine by chrysler group when it came out until eventually being surpassed by the dodge demon now 650 pound-feet of torque is certainly incredibly impressive at 4 800 rpm but one of the cooler lesser known facts is this engine produces 411 pound-feet of torque at just 1200 rpm this big massive v8 turning at just 1200 rpm producing more torque than most cars out there on the road redline comes on at 6200 rpm the engine has a compression ratio of 9.5 to 1 and the bore by stroke is 103.9 millimeters by 90.9 millimeters giving it a true displacement of 6166 cubic centimeters 6.166 liters at full throttle the supercharger is churning out 11.6 psi of boost the engine has a cast iron block with aluminum alloy cylinder heads and because this thing is making crazy power you've got forged steel crankshaft you've got forged alloy pistons and you've got powder forged connecting rods it uses sequential multi-port injection recommending 91 octane fuel or better now this is a v8 engine but it only has 16 valves and what's interesting is it also has 16 spark plugs so because it has a two valve design the spark plug can't go in the center of the cylinder head so they have one on either side of it checking out the engine bay here quite an awesome looking engine bay this engine actually isn't all that wide and of course you have to leave plenty of space for those massive 305 tires you've got this prominent supercharger up on top which is looking great i also love that it uses the old school orange paint for the hemispherical cylinder heads today not quite as hemispherical as they used to be but still you know a neat touch there as you can see the battery is actually placed in the trunk of the car along with these two subwoofers so very cool that they've taken that weight placed it on top of the rear tires helped give a little extra traction to those 700 horsepowers trying to fight their way onto the ground now as far as the airflow this is actually pretty cool they're pulling in air from the inside marker light on the driver's side so it comes in up front travels through the air filter passes along travels through the throttle body into the supercharger after traveling through the supercharger it passes through an intercooler which is housed on either side that's what's in this rectangle right here so it's got an air-to-water intercooler then travels into the cylinders out the exhaust on either side of the engine out to the back of the vehicle coming out of dual exhaust in the rear of the vehicle of course your question is what does it sound like well i will happily demonstrate so let's talk about some of the cool features of this engine starting with peak cylinder pressure which at full tilt is 110 bar or about 1600 psi that means every piston has about 21 000 pounds of force pressing it down or about five or six cars sitting on top of it every time that piston fires the engine also has sodium filled exhaust valves to help keep them cool and it has hollow intake valves to reduce reciprocating mass the intake valves open 14.25 millimeters and the exhaust valves open at 14 millimeters the supercharger alone is 2.4 liters in volume and it takes 80 horsepower just to run the supercharger which winds up all the way to 14 600 rpm there's a one-way clutch decoupler for the supercharger which has a drive ratio of 2.36 to 1 so the supercharger spins faster than the engine and the drive gear is sealed for life with a synthetic oil now it is accurate to say that the air-to-water intercoolers in this engine are very cool so after the air is compressed from the supercharger it's coming in at 120 degrees celsius then passing through these air-to-water intercoolers where it drops down to just 60 degrees celsius before entering the engine the intercooler is designed to allow for 30 000 liters per minute of air flow while also keeping air temperatures under 140 degrees fahrenheit in extreme conditions with temperatures around 100 degrees outside with your foot to the floor the 600cc fuel injectors are capable of emptying the fuel tank in just 13 minutes the engine went through about 2 million hours of dyno testing in order to prove reliability and performance and every single customer engine gets a 42 minute shakedown before it's put inside the vehicle now i know the question on most people's mind with these big v8s is what kind of fuel economy can i expect is this a nice efficient vehicle to take around town well regardless of which transmission you get you're going to be getting 13 miles per gallon in the city if you get the manual you'll get 21 on the highway if you get the automatic it's rated for 22 on the highway so if there are other engines you think would be cool to have videos on please let me know in the comments below as well as any other questions or comments you may have thanks for watching
