hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about porsche's innovative new brakes they call these porsche surface coated brakes and they have a tungsten carbide coating on those rotors which porsha claims is a worldwide first and it's not just the rotors that are unique it also has specific brake pads that go along with it looking at it visually it's already quite different it has a mirror-like finish and porsche has boldly chosen to use white brake calipers to show off how little dust it produces so what's cool about these brakes well compared to iron rotors they have better braking response and more resistance to brake fade they have less brake dust without reducing braking performance the rotor's service life is about 30 longer and unlike iron which you can see here starts to rust this surface won't rust so you know after a day driving out in some rain you come home the next morning you look at your car and the rotor is all rusted not with these so how does it do all of that let's break it all down hold up stop it slow down i'm sorry if your ears are bleeding all right so you've probably heard about cast iron brakes it's the brakes that you'll find on most cars out there and perhaps you've heard about carbon ceramic brakes they're super expensive they're lightweight but they're extremely fade resistant which makes them great for racing on tracks these surface coated brakes are trying to fall somewhere in the middle they're not nearly as expensive as carbon ceramic brakes but have performance benefits over cast iron brakes for the brake rotor itself you start with a cast iron rotor and then the surface is thermally treated galvanized and then you spray on a layer of tungsten carbide it's a wild process if only there was some tool i could use to help explain it i'll put a white board anywhere so the process is called high velocity oxygen fuel spraying hvof so the basics of how it works is you mix oxygen and fuel you have a little combustion chamber here and then you have a carrier fluid bringing in your tungsten carbide and so you're combusting and then accelerating that tungsten carbide so it's getting really hot and then you're accelerating it to supersonic speeds above the speed of sound and slamming it onto that brake rotor and so you're going to have this super dense layer of tungsten carbide that forms on that brake rotor and this is only millimeters thick here's what that looks like on a set of calipers it's barely measurable it's about the width of a human hair and that's all you have until you have to replace your rotor so once you wear through that point one millimeter layer you've got to replace the rotors and i know everyone's head just exploded in anger because what i have to replace the rotor after this barely measurable amount of wear occurs but here's the thing because this surface is so hard the wear rate is extremely slow porsche says these surface coated rotors are 30 more durable than cast iron rotors meaning they'll actually last longer this is actually something i have unique data on so i did a video with nrs brakes where we looked at multiple brake pads to compare them and when i look at the wear data from these tests one full round of testing saw about 1.3 millimeters of the brake pad worn down whereas one full round of testing saw about .00083 millimeters of rotor wear and this was on iron rotors in other words under this testing in which case the scenario was pretty severe high temperature breaking the pads were at a rate about 1500 times greater by thickness than the rotors and when you think about how hard rotors are and that they have a much larger surface area to spread out that wear that makes sense and the surface of these rotors the tungsten carbide rotors is about 10 times harder than gray cast iron rotors so let's talk about tungsten carbide for a moment it's the same stuff that's used to make cutting tools because it's so hard so if you look at the mohs hardness scale you have one which is like talc which is something super soft you could scratch it with your fingernail fingernails at like two and a half and then you have the rating up to ten which is a diamond and so tungsten carbide is about a nine nine and a half on that hardness scale extremely hard so because this rotor surface is really hard there's not much rotor wear and because there's not much rotor wear there's not much brake dust produced according to car and driver in an interview with porsche porsche was claiming that 70 of brake dust actually comes from the rotors and so if you think about the gray iron rotor on a porsche cayenne it can wear one millimeter on each side of the rotor this can wear 0.1 millimeter on each side of the rotor so because you have significantly less of that rotor material actually being removed you have significantly less brake dust in this case about 90 percent less they also require specific pads that were engineered to be able to work with the carbide surface if you look at it if you touch it it's extremely smooth so they had to develop a pad that could dig into this very hard surface and still provide smooth breaking porsche describes the pads as having microscopic anchors and these are 10 piston calipers up front to ensure that you have a good distribution of pressure across the pad seriously these calipers are massive now on the front brake rotors you'll notice these little cracks and dark spots and stuff here on the rotor surface and this is actually normal this isn't affecting how the braking works the reason why this happens is if you start to brake very aggressively if you're driving this thing very aggressively you'll start to see these marks on the brakes and as this is a press car driven by a bunch of automotive journalists yeah they're going to be a little hard on the front brakes so actually if you were to drive this thing lightly over time it might come back it'll smooth out that surface and it could go back to looking like those rear brakes with that mirror-like finish so what about braking performance well what's really impressive about these rotors is that they maintain much more stable braking pressures than cast iron rotors porsche provided a graph showing the increase in pedal force required as the brake disc heats up this is done with 0.8 g braking so very aggressive braking and you apply stop after stop after stop after two hard braking instances the brake temperature is at 330 degrees rising all the way to 640 degrees by the 13th braking maneuver and as you can see the cast iron rotor the black line continues to increase as you continue to apply the brakes each time this means the pedal effort required by the driver to maintain the same deceleration 0.8 g increases so the driver has to push the pedal harder and harder each time the pscb rotors on the other hand allow for fairly steady pedal effort this will lead to a more intuitive feel for the driver and it won't give you the sensation that your brakes are getting too hot because they can actually handle these hot temperatures so what do the brakes feel like to drive well honestly i wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and cast iron rotors in normal driving conditions and that's a good thing and versus carbon ceramics sometimes you'll have where when you brake really hard with carbon ceramic brakes the first time you do it it's a little sketchy and a little uneasy and the car kind of squirms around but then once those carbon ceramics get hot the brake feel is really good and these don't have that so with that first really hard initial break when the brakes are cold it feels just as confident like iron rotors do you might reasonably ask is it actually necessary to have brakes that don't fade on a cayenne turbo and in most daily driving scenarios no absolutely not i suppose you could track your cayenne turbo however i'm not sure if you were aware but for the same money or significantly less there are much more track friendly porsches out there now if you do plan on towing and this has a towing capacity of 7 700 pounds then certainly having brakes that don't fade is a bonus regardless the reduction in braking fade is a performance benefit that these brakes offer now it's fair to wonder what do these brakes cost so the way porsche describes it these are going to last about 30 percent longer versus iron rotors however they're going to give you brake fade characteristics similar to that of a carbon ceramic brake rotor but at a third of the price so these come standard on the porsche cayenne turbos however if you get the base cayenne this is a 3500 option versus the carbon ceramics which is a 9 000 option now for fun i emailed a porsche dealership to see what the replacement cost is for the various types of brakes that they offer on the cayenne whether that's the cast iron brakes whether that's the surface coated brakes or the carbon ceramics so they provided me the total parts cost with tax no labor included for pads rotors sensors and i rattle clips and bolts for both the front and rear brakes so the standard gray iron rotors total replacement parts cost of three hundred forty three dollars and fifteen cents the service coated brakes that you see here eleven thousand ninety five dollars and ten cents and the carbon ceramic brakes were quoted at thirty two thousand two hundred six dollars and seventy four cents thirty two thousand dollars for a wear item now granted rotors can last quite some time but regardless spending thirty two thousand dollars on brakes that's a level of baller i'm not sure i can comprehend now there's a couple cool things to point out with the wheels off so in front of the tire right here there's a heat exchanger and so that heat exchanger is dumping out air through these vents which is trying to push that air out and around these wheels right here but certainly some of that hot air is going to enter this area so isn't that going to be heating up the brakes well there's a duct here at the bottom to bring in cool fresh air and then there's deflector plates on the suspension to redirect that air towards the brake rotors to cool them then on the rear suspension you can also see this arrow plate right here which is mounted to the lower control arm presumably to help reduce drag this is a quick bonus clip so i posted a photo of this car on the internet on the social medias and i got a lot of feedback about it not being safe so we're gonna discuss very quickly about safety someone in the comments even referred to me as a quote engineer meaning like not a real engineer which they didn't realize engineers don't have feelings so no feelings were hurt in that exchange but let's talk about what's going on right here so what is holding all of the weight of the right side of this vehicle well nearly the entire weight of this vehicle is just on this floor jack and you're wondering wait a minute there's a scissor jack right here yes but it's redundant if i were to remove that the car would not fall down over here that floor jack is holding it up this scissor jack i'm just giving it maybe like one more inch on this side but if i were to take it out the backside would just come down about an inch it wouldn't destroy the brakes and then well what if this floor jack fails well there's a jack stand underneath it that's going to catch it so if the hydraulics of this floor jack were to fail this jack stand right here would catch it so what has to happen in order for this porsche to ruin its brakes well first the floor jack has to fail then the jack stand underneath it has to fail and this scissor jack over here has to fail so if all three jacks fail then it will hit the ground but as long as any one of them works it will remain elevated so i'm not super concerned about it i'm not going to get underneath the car but certainly for filming the brakes i thought it was perfectly sufficient some of the comments disagreed i'm not doing any work underneath the car i'm not worried about it thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
