ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the elo this episode is absolutely nuts we have so many stupid moves we have some sensational brilliances as well i storm out of my chair on multiple occasions it's going to be absolutely spectacular put it up on your screen and don't look away for a moment i don't have anything else to say let's just jump into the games it's time for guess the elo game number one begins with d4 knight f6 knight c3 this is white trying to play e4 i would just go d5 but if you play a french you might do something like this okay okay c5 this is weird i don't know what we're doing here i don't like that there's already a blind spot in the center of the board a lot of newbies just forget they can take something here a lot of newbies just forget that the center pawns exist at all oh my goodness this is the only way to justify oh my god oh my god oh my god this is scary scary stuff queen to b6 already oh what what is what what why would this okay knight a4 you can give a check and then the knight has to go back i guess there's pawn here but then pawn takes and knight takes and all the oh oh what what is happening there's like two people who are just playing completely isolated from one another oh my god oh my god oh my god good yeah just oh my god knight takes bishop and the knight just comes back the only thing that white has in this position is the fact that black's king is still in the center okay just finish your development i mean i would just go queenie too oh oh yeah oh oh no oh no oh no no oh my god oh he thought he was sneaky black was like oh this idiot is gonna take my knight and miss checkmate and he hung his queen no oh my goodness he thought he was so smart and now he's just down a queen that's unbelievable man i like that black did not take on g2 though just trying to bounce back here oh yeah god oh the bishop no don't trade the don't trade the bishop dude why is the king being active oh you know the best part is black is like not even that much worse black is not even that much worse black has a bishop and three pawns for a queen i mean it's it's bad but at this level it's it's i i feel like black is still gonna win this game okay the way you play against the queen is you coordinate all your pieces and and then you just you try to take us you know as as many free things as you can yeah you don't want to let the queen in like this oh man what the f what bro he just he could have just why did he do that bro like what why did he do that there was no need come on man some stupid stuff man this is stupid man oh my god bro yo this is this is why you you all need the end games master class listen i hate to promote my courses i mean i love to promote my courses but on a guess the elo episode this would fall directly into the chapter of imbalance then games where it's like rook vs bishop and pawns guys there's no pieces left i mean you have to be able to see what your opponents are trying to do to you can two people lose a chess game at the same time well now it's just over i mean now white just takes everything just don't take on yeah knight c4 knight bc oh god oh my oh no no he walked into a fork oh my god now white is still winning because white has a past h pawn but there's no way right i mean white is not going to be smart enough to put oh no oh no no no no no white's just not pushing the right pawns white doesn't see the h pawn white's just not using the h pawn why he moving one square bro why is he moving it one square this is like hitting a home run and staying on first base can you do that in baseball can you hit the ball out of the park and then refuse to run can you do that like what if a baseball player hit the ball out of the stands and stayed on first base is that even legal oh my lord oh my god he lost the pawn oh now white's winning again nah bro ah now white's gonna win that's crazy oh he lost the pawn oh now it's a draw this is king and pawn versus rook this is also in the end games what nah now he gonna oh he could have taken you could just take there he could have just taken he'd just take night all clean [music] he didn't even checkmate he oh [music] okay well look if these two are around the same level which in guess the elo you know you you got to be around the same level i blind spots in the opening a lot of one move mistakes strong tunnel vision decent protect just too many blunder i mean it's got to be like 600 right like it's high five hundreds like the average of the players is like 620. it's just it's just no way it's a point higher i i i will be very furious if it's higher than that survey says 1057 and 9 30. come on man hey it's full screen gotham i'm really sorry for interrupting your guess

high rated how did y'all make that many one more how much time did how much time got spent on queen takes g2 man how much time got spent on queen g2 bro he spent 1.7 seconds but he's at 1.7 he had spent 1.7 seconds oh my god oh oh why why [music] okay next game all right next game man next game e4 all right all right nice and this person ping me this person pinged me they tagged me in the discord to get my attention to this game this better be the best game of all time it's an italian okay castles c3 so far so good nice stuff here good stuff develop the knight and pin the night to the queen nice spend the night to the bishop e3 is good ah that loses a pawn that's not good you're still doing ah you're not doing fine anymore i was gonna say this but yeah queen d1 okay bishop g5 yeah now now what was the mistake there y'all want to know what the top engine move here is to get the 0.4 advantage you wanna know what it is a4 ponte a4 don't ask me why this is what i would play knight d5 let's go knight d5 oh knight d5 knight d5 anyway knight d5 right now oh okay that's not a good move because the bishop is kind of dead now okay knight t5 a little bit late oh i see the idea oh he also saw the idea how do you how do y'all do this just for no reason for for what why how do just no reason at all y'all just move the queen to beat the region oh my god no one asked you to hang a queen are you being bribed is somebody getting you on the phone is a hanger queen right now well i'll i'll pay you 10 grand now you're just losing for no reason you just played a completely normal game what what is wrong with you why are you what are you doing what what is wrong with you how did you what was the point of like playing 15 normal moves and just sacrificing all of your pieces and then just losing them i don't get i mean i mean i mean i mean okay okay okay i listen listen i this was very creative i have to say this was very very creative i i don't know if this was always the plan but white weaved a mating net that's what white did white in this position had their rook hanging and played bishop b5 losing the other rook if the rook was taken there is no way you can checkmate here but white understands chess simply at a higher level than black ever will so they they they yeah they they knew that they would not get captured and yeah they rook a8 mate wow that's that's i i mean look the opening was pretty reasonable like it was a very nicely controlled and and played opening i think both sides did did some things quite well you know i'm gonna say like can i say something insane i think it's i think it's high 1100 low 1200 this game that's what i think i i i i i think any higher than that black would have seen checkmate and i think any lower than that i i think i think the game would not have been that that that level of controlled so let's take a look i said 1100 to 1200 survey says 1100 1101 versus 1108 ah and black was a little bit low on time it's still completely unexcusable but yeah 1100 1200 yup yup yup i knew it i just had a feeling the game seemed a little bit too high quality to be to be but but but then obviously it was terrible yeah i mean i mean look it it happens it happens it happens yeah it happens it happens it happens it's bullet it doesn't really matter that it's bullet because they had 30 seconds like toward the end they you know it's okay it's okay it's okay all right e4 e5 hmm am i gonna post this this video right now no no this this video this guess the elo is just for twitch it's not it's not for you youtube is never going to see this video what what the whale king's pawn opening the whale variation well that's extremely disrespectful you don't know how much i weigh i i don't know why you would why is this the whale the whale opening dude okay this is a reverse vienna gambit kind of now except this move doesn't make any sense because if you're gonna play a gambit you want to control the center you don't want your center bro how he played c5 did he mouse slip that i don't think i don't yo how you gonna how you gonna how you gonna play f5 take the center and then no this is like a this episode is like is like a fever dream nothing makes sense now he takes now he can't castle bishop c five bishop f8 man come on man why he moved what is he doing okay now we're just back no this game is fake this game is fake nah i'm gonna look up if these two have each other on on friends or something i i the the the come on man what is this bro he's just losing all his peop listen there is literally nothing more insulting than me thinking that your game on guess the elo was a fake game you could be random noob and against the elo episode by accident but there is literally nothing more insulting than submitting a game to me and i legit don't think it's a real game it's just like it just doesn't make sense that it's a real game bishop b7 okay i don't think i don't think black is a real person i think black is an mpc oh oh no oh my god oh my what what is this bro what is this how did that happen how did that happen that is crazy this was a game played by like two literal earthworms and then all of a sudden magnus carlson sat down at the board and was like oh yeah this is just smothered mate no problem what i mean this game was literally played by two amoebas and then magnus carlson took over the controller i mean i don't even know i like what what am i even looking at this opening makes no sense dude played the whale then these two played some of the worst moves i've ever seen in my life i mean what is this what what white played well actually white played fine white didn't do anything wrong this might have been a mouse slip but then white defended the pawn and developed a knight and played normal moves for the most part took a rook like white played kind of fine a couple blunders but i mean black is an npc like i don't even i i don't know 500 for 500 i but how did you find smothered i mean i'ma say 800 level blitz game i i'm gonna say 800 but it's blitz it just doesn't make sense like this game just doesn't make any sense 800 bullets blitz ain't no way 800 but it's blitz 700 but it's rapid what are y'all doing man what that's a rapping game how you lose every all your pieces are shut up i'm done bro i'm done i'm done with all of you bro every single game was a mistake every single move was a mistake i just got every single move you made only bad moves that game oh my goodness white played fine okay white played pretty okay okay some blunders also you know there is a phenomenon in chess which is you play to the level of your opponent so like sometimes if you're playing somebody that's playing really ooga you're gonna make some mistakes yourself if you're playing if you're playing like if you're 700 you're playing an 1100 you're gonna be focused you're gonna be gonna be thin you're gonna be playing your best if you're playing as a person that's playing like a 400 [music] unbelievable wow incredible best course for starters i don't know probably the beginner course tough question appreciate it okay game number four of today's episode brought to you by the end games master class oh finally a normal opening oh finally okay open slav wow kind of hate kind of hate myself for not playing the e6 a6 qgd but it's fun okay hmm inaccurate i think by white a little bit 95 that's not a good move white has to play a4 okay b4 is actually a very bad move because there is bishop takes and if you take it's mate so you you just gave back the pawn okay so kind of a fundamental misunderstanding here of the slav defense what what is this brother how did you okay this is like an example of a person that spent like a hundred fifty dollars on a slav course by a super grand master and then immediately when turbo uga mode the move queen a5 has legitimately zero threats and this is not even a threat because the bishop blocks and then you gotta move i mean there is b3 and also knight c3 and then bishop d2 so but yeah i mean like for example you guys want to see something funny just just for example bishop c4 b3 bishop d2 queen a4 you lose your queen so you win the knight and your queen is trapped i'm just i'm just i'm just saying like you know you you can't it doesn't work it just doesn't work it's okay but it doesn't work it it was not also made because i because i played e6 but yes and also the king can go to d8 there's there is not made stop coaching me i'm the coach you are you you are the viewer thank you the the mate is only when the queen is on d8 i appreciate it though e6 cal yeah bishop dc yeah now white is just much better i mean white is just much better gotham i have a question thoughts about dingly rand is the new world champion i'm in the middle of a guess the elo recording i mean seriously what is this what what you want me to just stop this and just am i getting interviewed is this a paid interview you want my thoughts it's june i've given you my thoughts i'm gonna continue with the guess the elo episode please thank you i'm very happy for the guy i don't i don't get paid for interviews you're damn right i don't get paid again all right clean up oh god knight takes d2 queen f7 by the way people are gonna watch this on youtube right and then and they're gonna be like why can't you give a normal answer to the question that's what you sound like if you get offended anything on youtube so that's what that's what it would sound like like if you're the person that is watching a youtube video and gets offended that's your that's what you sound like oh oh boy oh boy oh boy this is crazy pawn takes no are you insane why would he do that why would he trade queens this is all you have in life this is all this is all you have why would this psycho trade the keys just oh my god okay [music] and oh oh no but why would you trade you're just bro bro oh my oh my god okay black was up like two pieces and and it black was up like seven pieces i where did every piece go it's a draw now oh my why does winning e5 pawn to e5 check oh my god oh my god pawn takes knight just ponte no more plot twists okay white resigned oh my oh a slav defense i i which was immediately misplayed which had like pretty complex game like it it was a complicated game to be fair i think we have to judge the degree of white's counter play too like i think black played very poorly here i think black had a lot more like black okay in this position black should 100 play knight a6 or knight d7 because black needs to prevent knight c5 i think black did a lot of mindless shuffling but then black played like again i mean you gotta go knight a6 here like what are you doing you have to trade these pieces the way you do it like this is you get really cramped and then like how do you not move your knight here this is the crazy part to me i mean rook 8 is a crucade is played simply with take take on the mind wow yeah and then the rest of i mean no no this is definitely four digit it's definitely not three digit i mean it was ah like 12 1300 probably i'm gonna say like 1300 1300 it's got it's gotta be like thirteen hundred i i don't i don't think there's no way it's three digit because i i think the but like if it was a three-digit game it would have ended like this okay like i i think i i think it's a 1300 game i i i think let's go see oh my god oh my god 1974. verses'05 nah how much time they had at the end yo they had five minutes at the end the work i i think this might be the the worst guess the hilo game ever submitted what combined 3 800 elo points and neither player saw pawn takes knight in congratulations bro i mean i guys i i'm sorry but but that's guys this is bad guys i'm very sorry but i i think you win i think that that i think that takes the cake bro i i are you in the chat i'm assuming zepto the guy that won is is in the chat i are you in the chat okay can you take accountability for this game i was black i blitzed out knight g5 bro congratulations that was a sensational i listen sometimes it happens sometimes bro that that was legendary that was a legendary game i legit thought y'all were playing a bullet or three minute that's wild dad i am i i i that should be the last game of the episode i i can't believe we have another one we we have one more game for this episode oh my goodness that was thank you for submitting that game you know i think when that person submitted the game in the discord they were like bro you gotta see this game it was a ridiculous opening it was a crazy end game and i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah whatever and then i like submit no he was right he was right that game was unbelievable thank you for submitting that game that was that game is getting a whole ovation standing ovation encore this needs to be on youtube bro i'm not posting this on youtube stop asking how many times do i have to tell you guys stop asking me to post guess the elo on youtube i'm not gonna post it oh my god that was an incredible game thank you thank you that was that was a sensational game i'm very happy i got to see that game i'm sorry i called you a thirsty [laughter] [music] wow scotch i'm gonna need a scotch after this oh god knight takes d4 there's nothing really wrong with knight takes d4 but it's just not the right move which all right triple digits for sure ah white is just like much better now just bishop here bishop here because the queen now just there's no knight dude so you're just doing yup you gotta go e5 e5 is crushing okay oh just slide back just slide back just slide back yup rook d1 rook d1 quick yup rook d1 rook d yup a rookie you gotta be a little careful here okay but now there's knight h5 you gotta now you gotta counter attack tonight oh that's wrong that's wrong the heat why did he not take okay but now yo this dude just played g5 dad nah bro he really played g5 who taught y'all chess why y'all playing g5 that's never a good move is that the top computer move no definitely not chief no what bro the bishop was j the bishop was just there man e5 if if knight d5 e5 good move yes no don't take the please don't take the please don't take the thank you it's still bad but f4 nice back in business okay which of these bishops is better to capture should you take the bishop on e5 should you take the bishop on f5 which bishop should you capture you gotta take the one on e5 because if you take the one on e5 you are opening up the rook that's it you do not for the love of god want to take the bishop on f5 because then you stack your pawns and get in the way of your rook now a lot of info here black just took the knight a lot of people with low elo would take this on autopilot because that's the thing that just happened and people who are beginners at chess only react to things they they don't take a moment to just appreciate the scenery okay so white of course takes on f5 and now loses all their advantage because they don't get to open the rook the bishop can now come here and clog the arteries and yeah and now white does not have an attack and now white is also down many pawns and yang's the queen in one move oh my god shut up dude he hung two rooks he hung this with check and he hung that rook too oh it's over just hit the resign button i know i say never resign but just just it's it's over it's it's yeah you're not gonna win that bro okay why you are up a queen a rook and a rook and you are moving the king where are you going where are you going where are you going why it's mate just made him dude just checkmate him oh my god nah he stalemated oh oh that's the most ridiculous stalemate i have ever seen white has four pieces on the board and he can't move a single piece he can't move a single piece the bishop has pinned to the king the king can't move up because of the rook and neither none of the is stalemate dude it's stalemate he stalemated him with a bishop and three pawns on the ball i've never seen no no no no no no no no cut the feed cut the feed we can't we can't have this this is this no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no i did not think that we were gonna top off the last game man i did not think like after i saw this game with the'00s i was like there ain't no way nope oh lord oh god oh oh and now i gotta get guess the elo too right i gotta get oh i gotta get i gotta i gotta guess the elo of this game i'm gonna say like 800. 800 probably high 700 low 800. let's see high 700 low 800 is my guess 715 versus 731 and white saved the game down' points of material with only three pieces on the board four i'm just you know i'm saying i thought ties i'm gonna do is lose it get this garbage off my screen man oh my goodness that was nuts i was sick what we
