hi everyone falutin down a 38 i made a game called space castle in which you try to guide a small world through a storm of comments this video is a sort of behind the scenes and post-mortem of that experience so i got a few quite a late start but easily began working on my first game concept of rescuing the inhabitants of a small world about to be sucked into a black hole as it turned out unfortunately the only thing flux into that black hole was my time and sort of good mood because everything went wrong i was basically drowning in physics and rotation problems so after gallantly suffering on for a while i rather wisely i think opted to throw in the towel somehow i was later however excited a game to try at least make something so with almost the entire day gone i settled to some rather an ambitious rock dodging gameplay so here i am beavering away at the pooling system which i used to spawn in spheres and send them hurtling towards the player i then wanted to attach a tiny world to the player with a rope so that the world would sort of sway behind you as he moved as i was try to do this using various physics components but i evidently still have a way to go in that department i then thought i would just animate the rope along with the turtle model so i set about creating a little turtle in blender and give it some simple colouring and an armature and i made three animations one for idle flying and the others for turning left and right but the rope part of this endeavor proved to be another failure i simply didn't have the sort of technical know-how to make a rig for the rope that wouldn't end up with all these weird kinks in it so i gave up on fancy rope physics or animations and instead created a simple system where each point in the rope maintains a certain distance from the next point joining up the points with a line renderer i had something that could sort of do the job not wasting any more time i stuck it on to the player and tried it out i think in the end it served its purpose fairly well even if it wasn't quite as dynamic as i had hoped i then brought in the turtle model and with a simple blend tree to transition between animations based on the horizontal inputs he was soon zooming about add some colours to the world make a few amazing rocks stick the whole thing inside a cylinder and i thought it was starting to look quite interesting taking a break from the gameplay side of things i began working on the menu scene where i wanted to have the turtle flying around in circles so i made a script to follow a path and set the turtle flying along a bezier curve i had some small difficulties at first ensuring that the world maintained the proper orientation but what i did in the end was calculate the direction between two points near the end of either rope as well as the direction from the wolf position to the center of these two points i could then take the cross-product to find the up vector and use the look at method to look at the target point with target up as the world up direction i then finished up the rest of the menu with a simple options menu and a high score list for the high schools by the way i used the free dream low server which is nice and easy to get working with unity next on the agenda was the game over condition which is of course if you slam into a comet i wanted a nice explosion effect so i drew some highly realistic flames and smoke and use these as sprite sheets for my particle effects i then split the world model into multiple parts attaching rigid bodies to each part and then applying a force away from the world center to make them explode outwards and likewise for the collage i couldn't quite bring myself to rip apart the churchill so he just disappears around this point i also made the decision to add little glowing pieces of maybe stardust or whatever you want to call them which serve as point multipliers if you can catch them the idea of course being to encourage players to take some risks i was now at the dreaded point of having to do something about sound effects and music i only really needed two sound effects though one for the explosion and one for getting a point multiplier for the explosion i simply went into the mic and then layered some pitch down piano chords on top to get this the music didn't go so well though i spent almost three hours of mashing away at the keyboard but just with horrific results so in the end i decided to use an online music generator called juke deck just to create some in a sense of atmospheric stars the last thing of interest that i did was paint a nice shiny shell texture for the majestic protagonist so in conclusion i'd say that i'm happy with other game turned out it's obviously very generic and simplistic but it's got some charm to it i think and it's fun to play around with at least for a few minutes for the next ludum dare i hope to have significantly up to my music skills and also hope that are able to come up with a more interesting gameplay mechanic time motel as a final note if you'd like to play the game there is a link in the description and if you participated yourself please do leave a link in the comments i would very much like to play your games alright cheers
