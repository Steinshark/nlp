so you want to play some pirated games but you're afraid of downloading a virus or getting locked up like gary bowser thankfully aliexpress is here for you look at all this garbage some of it's eye-catching a hundred thousand games plug and play hd big screen game console wait what's that kin hank super console xg1 a thousand dollars dual systems in one battle sarah 33 professional office entertainment what are you yeah that's right as soon as i saw this thing i had to buy it or rather jake told me i had to buy it so we could see if it actually comes with over a hundred twenty thousand games if it does i assume they've got to be retro games since you won't be playing modern aaa titles with a laptop chip from four years ago and eight gigs of ram or can you it has an nvidia gpu what else is there for us to discover here oh 4k output you say real and shocking picture effect wow i can't wait for a shocking picture effect this just looks like a very basic mini computer for a thousand bucks they better really wow me with the software it includes a big fat power brick does about 150 watts so it's about what you'd get with a mid-tier gaming laptop we've got the box itself a power adapter and an hdmi cable that's it there's controllers oh right the controllers oh the baton bat 2 wired i've heard of this maybe actually no of course not oh okay it's got a nice long cable oh wow that's actually not very long i'm how many of you are this far from your couch oh gosh it doesn't even have analog triggers but hey thank goodness there's a turbo button okay so it comes with a ps2 grade controller in the box did they have analog triggers okay so it comes with a ps1 grade controller the plastic seem all right and one of them is white ploof it doesn't look like you tested the controllers you're just leaving me to figure out how great they are on my own in this in this case yes not very i mean this one's cute looking at least batacera 33 plus win 11 pro really windows 11 pro oh how much you want to bet that's pirated well i'm trying to get this open we can talk about specs it's got an adopt i-9880h8 core processor i don't know what adopt means in this context maybe recertified either way supposedly it's an intel chip a 1650 independent graphics card eight gigs ddr4 with dual ram slots which sounds like a single channel out of the box hello how does this where are the seams in you i am extremely confused we found something you can't open maybe this is a good time to tell you about our sponsor xsplit looking to take your video streaming to the next level xsplit is a software company that provides simple yet effective broadcasting and video production tools check them out at the link below and use code linus for a very nice 69 off your first purchase or subscription okay i got under it there are clips wow that's a pretty good looking cooling system please tell me this thing's not running off of a mechanical hard drive though oh no it has a boot ssd this is one of those weird products guys where it would make sense to me if they were just using main boards that were destined for laptops but then you know the order was canceled or something like that but to actually engineer this board just for this product how many of these could they possibly be selling if it was cheap sure but it's a thousand dollars for a 1650 and an eight core chip and this ssd is very basic wow it's a good guy not to be confused with a bad guy i mean i always like it when the good guy is on my side ooh high-speed ssd i mean high is relative whoa whoa whoa whoa they say this is pcie gen 4. oh man well we caught them in their first outright lie on the spec sheet this is supposedly a pcie by 4 ssd it is not that it is in fact a sata ssd you can tell from the keying here not that being pcie would make this any faster really these are apparently available for as little as 9.80 in quantities of a thousand we've also got our memory stick here oh the puns are real from the markings these appear to be samsung chips but i'm not sure if i believe that because the brand is who disk we've got good guy and who disk hennas are both hooked up so you know that's good power button daughter board needs to be about what you'd expect the aisle was not terrible by modern standards gigabit lan quad usb 3s two usb2s displayport hdmi and usb type c this has gotta be just an existing mini pc that they used up with this aluminum plate and then filled with pirated games like wait okay we've already found some conflicting information depending where you look it's over a hundred and ten thousand or over a hundred and twenty thousand okay the host is more powerful and the loading speed is very fast let happiness come faster so that's what i'm always telling my wife oh wow the marketing for this is extremely bombastic and i'm not using that word lightly the performance of the gtx 1650 is more outstanding more outstanding than what as it can easily cope with large scale games such as league of legends pubg and playstation 2. yes when i think of large-scale games i really think of ps2 dual channel memory operation more smooth but we didn't bother actually giving you any of that to oh my god now it's 71 000 plus games the farther i scroll down the page the fewer games are included you know what i gotta wonder is the stuff just way cheaper in china because the thing is in china you can get great deals like better than we can get here on some hardware like used mining cards for example so you can look at a product like this and go oh linus you don't understand because it's for the chinese market and i'm like right it has to be more competitive what makes a worse product good for the chinese market i don't let's just let's fire it up wait where are you going you're not gonna help set this up no no no no no you said you'd set it up no come come on what the cable length is not a plus here and the rear io just flip it in reverse that eats up a solid foot of your definitely not seven feet oh my god now we got the pretty side facing us okay you just reach around to press the power but okay i'm turning it on yeah turn it on oh we've got to set it to the original boot in bios because it originally did boot into batasera 33. oh okay and it's like an arcade launcher yeah okay let's do that so we need a keyboard and mouse but another thing to note while we're in windows is look it's it's got a little power because you know it's connected to a power it's like it's on battery oh my goodness then it's like extent it thinks it's a laptop yeah with a missing battery plugged into the wall this isn't windows 11. oh yeah it lists windows 11 pro yeah this is clearly windows 10. yeah what the heck yeah check specs what else is in here and also what the hexan no wonder i stumbled over the name of the cpu so many times i-998 i-90 i didn't register why i kept saying it wrong there is no 98 adh oh it's a 9980 hk yeah dang it now mash f2 f8 f10 and delete because we don't know which one is the right bios key hey hey hey it dual boots by default windows is installed but so is badassera now normally it originally boots straight into badocera and he altered this when setting it up but yeah if you if you boot into our hard drive there we go yeah wait oh interesting so that's the other problems we installed some games on windows yeah but there was not much space so there's only a few games installed right and the boot manager is on the hard drive interesting seems like they have a lot of confidence in their ssd kid hank games retro all right hey well let's get this keyboard out of here this is yeah neo geo sony playstation quake two wii u i mean if they've got you know 100 000 games hey 122 647. sinclair wow zx80 whoa what's a gun okay use this japanese layout okay perfect so circle is accept and x is bad okay cool so i accidentally launched this game yeah this is real great i'm having fun look can you not be a debbie downer i don't think we're doing anything i spent good money on this gaming console and on your companionship today yeah i'm really not getting a great value on either of them i don't know what the hell this is i don't know how to play it this is like i've played some really old pc games this is even beyond my time but can you even figure out how to get it oh oh whoa there's a menu yeah great this is just retroarch yeah yeah pretty much it's just a linux distro 3d 3d game that you've actually played all right i will pick a game i have actually okay here we go nhl 94. let's go look at how many pixels that guy's face is made out of oh it's gretzky let's go everyone [music] a second i think i can make him watch the instant replay oh my god this is like rocket league where one guy doesn't skip the replay yeah except you're going back and then making me watch the replay it's even worse [music] and he can't stop me incredible you know what the d-pad is pretty usable it's not great it's not great but it's usable it's definitely usable in their marketing do they say that you'll spend so much time playing with it because you can't figure out how to turn it off maybe join a oh oh what'd you press back and start at the same time what i tried that i don't know maybe it's because i'm player one okay they got sinclair all games favorites 3do amiga at target i don't think we're gonna get through all these all right brett a g holy crap you're right we're still at ccom i'm trying to wait can i check the commodore oh yeah sure yeah oh wow are there for a lot of games for the commodore 122 000 games all at your disposal so you're gonna get a lot of just complete garbage you just hit d and you've been holding scroll for like a good 30 seconds or something this was such a bad time for games oh my god i like how they've actually done the like sidebars for the three by four original game supported only two players nostalgia gives you four player version you need to buy more friends crapped cracked from disc by certain steps i don't remember how it works really seems fine i don't think i'm doing anything but that's okay i didn't really want to play marble medicine no you try see if your joystick does anything oh it does what so we can mess with each other i mean that's kind of cool this must have been incredibly frustrating playing with younger or older siblings okay this is riveting but we should probably play more games what yeah you're not having fun i mean i am having fun but we should see how how much how much software are you not entertaining super xg1 comes with okay honestly it's not a bad selection though we've got like every game boy iteration color advanced regular game boy it's interesting to me that for super nintendo for example they don't just have the entire collection it's not like the roms take up a ton of space and it's not like they're licensing it legitimately so there's no cost to it i guess it was just easier to look wait we get a total of one xbox game i was gonna say this is really weird they've only okay to be fair they've got one of the best xbox games they've got jet set radio future but yeah i don't know why it's the only xbox game well probably because they want to advertise a huge library oh yeah and xbox games actually take up space that's true oh yeah this is great wow that fan is going boys the labs tested it briefly for thermals and stuff and it only maxes out on the gpu around 73 degrees on the hot spot more like 67 65 average but you can hear why fence just crank right up okay battle mode yeah we're not practicing that's lame okay what do you want to play graffiti wars it's got wars in the name oh yeah oh yeah gum beat yo-yo i'm yo-yo and corn i want to be corn this is a classic i have never played this game so i mean absolutely no idea what's going it's roller skating and graffiti that's all you got to know i want to fight how do we fight i mean we're trying but it's not working very well because i haven't played just left ow what's your problem let's try a different game okay the ethics of giving money to pirates aside if you are the kind of person who is not technical at all you're my in-laws the kids come over to your house and you've got something fun for them to do and a lot of games to choose from they're not going to say we've got nothing to play gamecast oh let me hopefully a power stone on here powerstone one and two nice okay so we'll play power stone sure so the funny thing about boutisera is it literally lists on its linux distro we do not endorse pirating you have to own these games and blah blah get your own roms and they're clearly not affiliated with the batasera team at all oh whoa this is like 3d yeah yeah yeah yeah it was like really crazy for the time because virtua fighter was out on but virtual fighter look looked like ass yeah what that is what just happened boom what is even happening right now pretty much yeah how do i pick up a sword i don't even know how to hit the pickup button well i don't know what the pickup button is i can't tell what any of the buttons do power stone this one's crazy good i haven't even touched him i know this this was like wild when it came out everyone loved powerstone and for good reason yeah you're just flying around so much nice nice yeah secretly i've played a lot of power still sure okay tell you what let's pick a game you think you can win oh my god oh tekken sure oh no another fighting game yeah oh what it didn't even load tech it just happened oh is this when is this when konami had loading screen games yeah they patented the loading screen game so no one else could do it destroyed an entire multiple eras of gaming hwarang is really cheap because you just do a bunch of kicks all the time that's what he does so you're gonna just be like that i'm just gonna kick it nina my wins like they're all good tekken was i don't know reasonably balanced i don't know what block is i don't know i think it's just back away also this looks terrible yeah this looks so bad low kick low kick low kick low kick low kick till you lose oh no dang it don't you don't use the chief low kick strategy against me oh that's it the cake oh i was in i figured out the stance okay how do i get back into the stance oh you know what's really funny is this is a lot like playing games with luke because the first time we play something i will almost always win right and then and then once he has about five ten minutes to pick it up he will annihilate me for the rest of the session yeah in conclusion for the price it's woefully underspect and all the software that is adding value to it is pirated and available for free if you're willing to pirate it which you are because you bought one of these with that said i think that it's worth following up this video with a look at some more aliexpress consoles that come preloaded with things because at a more reasonable price while i would never recommend them or condone them i could see how they might be attractive to some people yeah a hundred bucks or 200 bucks might be a lot more reasonable especially when you're getting a hundred thousand games with those ones too and getting this message from our sponsor motiongray do you experience back pain from prolonged sitting and staring at a screen all day well motion gray aims to
