so i went through and watched all these toothpaste videos and they all have basically the exact same life hack so we are going to test these life hacks and see if they're actually practical like this one from 5 minute crafts it got 16 million views and the thumbnail is a cracked iphone with toothpaste quick disclaimer the microphone on my camera didn't work while i was recording so i'm going to have to make all the sound effects manually with my mouth who now we just rub it on the phone and it should fix the cracks i mean it worked for this youtuber and this one and this one and this one i mean it's got to work and now we just rub a dub a dub dub a dub it off and what the hell the the cracks didn't go away wait so you tell me those videos were clickbait sorry about your phone mom the next toothpaste life hack involves you dipping a match in toothpaste and apparently if you dip a match in toothpaste you can submerge it in it will still work let's test [music] it wrong wrong wrong [music] wrong wow this match works even though it was underwater that wait wait what you don't care yeah me neither the next life hack we are testing from these toothpaste life hacks videos is getting crown off your wall with toothpaste all these viral videos claim that toothpaste is a good way to get crown markings off your wall so let's test it does it actually work so yeah i got rid of the crown marks but it just left an even bigger mark on my wall so whoever made these life hack videos can you can you apologize to my landlord for me that'd be pretty awesome and also i know it's pronounced crayon i'm just pronouncing it weird just to piss people off the next life hack we are testing comes from a video titled six awesome toothpaste life hacks and guess what guys one of these six amazing life hacks is rubbing toothpaste on a cd to clean it yes he recommended to almost 3 million people that they use toothpaste to clean their cds i call bs i highly doubt this works let's test it [music] [music] who would have guessed now my dis is unreadable thank you for these six awesome toothpaste life hacks man this life hack is insane insane i i love being able to break my video games that are worth $60 you know i paid $60 for it i love just rubbing toothpaste on it cuz some guy on the internet told me it would clean it toothpaste life hack number quattro or cino i don't whatever we're on is cleaning your headlights of your car with some toothpaste and this one did work not going to lie you know it did make my headlights a lot cleaner but there's also a thing called soap and like dozens of other ways you could clean your headlights but yes if you're stranded on an island with just a car and some toothpaste and you need to clean your headlights it will work but it was honestly kind of weird rubbing toothpaste on my car so apparently toothpaste in a water balloon makes like a stress relief squishy thing i don't know these life hacks are honestly stupid oh that's just oh and the final life hack is apparently if you're burn your fingers a lot you can rub toothpaste on it and i don't know that's just what the videos showed apparently it will sooth it it kind of helped i don't know how sanitary it is and i'm really hungry so thank god this video is finally over holy crap i'm ready to go eat some food this is what i planned on using for the intro needs to come over and clean off that table cuz i don't feel like cleaning the toothpaste off of it it's kind of disgusting
