i just bought every single playstation handheld ever released which is actually a lot more than you might think because you've heard of the psp but this was actually not sony's first handheld it was the pocket station released in 1999 in japan for the equivalent of just under $40 today sony marketed this little guy as a cross between a memory card for the ps1 and a digital personal assistant but what makes this their technically fir handheld is that it can also play its own games this thing is minuscule the buttons aren't even labeled probably because you wouldn't be able to read them anyways it's got some pretty simple clock and calendar functions that's the digital assistant side of things but then if you want to play games you have to download content from a compatible ps1 game like this so i believe you just click it up from the bottom hey look at that so it's going to go into the memory card slot and that is our game downloaded what a weird process okay so you flick right from the home screen and that enters you into crash world at which point you get three different games to choose from and they are all in japanese they have done such a good job distilling the platforming feel of crash bandicoot it's a 2d top down game with a 32 pixel whip and yet it's so clear at all times what's going on this pocket station definitely makes you feel the whole constraint breeds creativity notion and wow look at the jump kind of insane got a very basic speaker at the back just classic a bit sounds it's no dolby atmos hardware doesn't feel very hard wearing but it'll be interesting to see at what point in this journey the quality of materials picks up in terms of specs i describe the pocket station as cute it's able to run this dinky little crash bandicoot virtual pet game thanks to a very basic 33 khz cpu and 2 koby of ram with an lcd screen capable of 32x 32 resolution but what's actually quite cool is that since it doubles as your ps1 memory card it's packing 128 koby of storage which in these days is everything you could possibly need but what really made this pocket station a hit was the ir sensor at the top which granted it multiplayer capabilities with other pocket stations giving it the same kind of playground appeal as the game boy or i guess more aptly the tamagotchi the pocket station sold just under 5 million units in its lifespan which is actually huge when you realize that sony only ever released it in one country they never expanded beyond that because at no point did they ever manage to even keep up with the demand just from japan you can totally see how the pocket station was what laid the foundations for them to build their next console because if you didn't know about the pocket station the decision for sony to launch the psp in 2005 kind of looks insane cuz while they always been a raging battle for the home console space the handheld market was basically owned by one company and one company only nintendo nintendo had not just got the game boy i the most successful console on the planet at the time under their belts but had also then followed it up with the game boy advance which was a beast of a console that also broke records and had just recently topped that all off with the nintendo ds their nextgen hand held with two screens a stylus and proper 3d graphics this was a real david and goliath situation so sony had to make sure that they were offering something unique how did they do that well they took nintendo's own ad campaigns from their previous game boy advance that flaunted how the thing could do console quality gaming anywhere questionable claim but they actually delivered on it promising power comparable to a playstation 2 portably team nintendo and right from the unboxing you can see how serious sony was about this mission the psp came in this value pack absolutely jacked with goodies reams of manuals including a demo disc and a screen cleaning cloth of soft pouch a pair of actually branded psp earphones to plug into the console's 3.5 mm jack there's a strap i guess borrowing from the pocket station it came from and even a medor remote that can go in between the earphones and the psp to add physical controls to it a 32 mb memory stick duo cards and even a removable battery man how can anyone hate tech from this era and then the console which screams sleek understated performance and when you turn this thing on it was like nothing the world had ever seen before it's tough to state just how insane this 4.3 in lcd display was at the time with a 24-bit color depth and 272p resolution that's by the way 128 times the number of pixels versus the pocket station and way more than the ds it was very much cutting edge and actually very similar in quality to the first iphones display except 2 years even before that and sony really took advantage of that display do you remember when i said the pocket station had a 33 khz cpu well the psp had dual 333 mahz cpus on a very basic level that is easily eight times the performance of nintendo's ds and no joke 20,000 times the performance of their previous console not to mention the psp had a proper console controller es analog nub and that this was where sony announced their brand new media format called the universal media disc or umd and this was interesting while the competing ds game cartridges could hold an absolute max upper limit of 512 mb of data umds being basically like mini cds could hold 1.8 gb and that meant not just that developers could run wild with their games making the psp the very obvious real gamers choice against nintendo and racking up a ton of actually bigname console like exclusives but it also cemented the psp as one of the best portable movie players around honestly everything about the psp generation just excited me everything felt so tactile and physical and i love that about gaming fun fact this was my actual psp carrying case that i used for my entire lifetime with the thing these umd discs i thought they were the coolest thing like this whole ritual of flicking open the back of slotting in the umd and closing it back up it was music to my ears and also the fact that it could play movies meant that i so remember the feeling of browsing those blockbuster aisles just finding the perfect friday night movie to watch on my psp okay so you go into the game tab and you click umd it's been so much time since i've heard that one classic trope of the psp that i'm remembering now is this scratching sound that's the disc being red it was all the time but especially when you're on like a loading screen which also used to last really long so with subsequent consoles when they replace that with flash storage that was silent it was a massive quality of life improvement it's really hard to convey how much of an improvement this is from like the pocket station you can totally see how people at the time were just blown away by this thing cuz yeah this doesn't look quite as good as a ps2 game it's very much got the same feel it's got the same kind of scope in terms of the kinds of things you can do in it the audio is also miles ahead of the pocket station it's proper stereo sound i'm getting slaughtered here the analog stick as well is a massive quality of life improvement versus any other handheld that existed up until this point it actually makes big worlds like this natural to traverse you can also so tell when you're using this original psp that it was absolutely designed with the playstation 2 in mind to look as consistent as possible so it could be the perfect companion so yeah all the odds were stacked against sony when they launched but they just so happened to create the perfect cocktail of what the world was looking for at the time this thing far surpassed sony's small town sales expectations but it was still getting outplayed by nintendo's ds to which you might be thinking why we just spent two whole minutes talking about why the psp was more advanced and well i think it's partly the games nintendo had the behemoth that was mario which did half their job for them i can't tell you how many school coach journeys i had where the entire activity was just a massive 8ers mario kart multiplayer sesh where incredibly out of those eight people only one of them actually needed to own the game to do that and partly also the price sony's hardware launched at nearly $400 in today's money and that coincided with a pretty devastating nintendo price drop to to just $200 the very same year coincidence i think not so sony tried things they released a bunch of hardware revisions over the near decade of the psp's lifespan starting with the sleer psp 2000 or the slim model and this is the console i grew up with the number of hours i sunk into this machine right here unspeakable nothing even comes close and actually seeing where it comes from this feels like a massive leap it's gone from 23 mm thick on the original to'.6 and the weight of the thing is down from 280 g to'9 and you feel that trimming a lot more with a console that you hold in your hand than you ever would on a home console but it wasn't just slimmer the psp slim came with the one major upgrade of assuming you had the right cable being able to output directly into a tv this is literally nintendo switch functionality in 2007 sony was so ahead of its time you know what the quality faes really well well when translated even to a much bigger screen nothing about this looks in any way subpath oh this also reminds me one of the things i used to spend so much of my time doing changing my theme color tasty treat applies a cookie theme to your entire device kind of adorable look the sony wasn't done yet it's very clear that nintendo's ds light which had very quickly overtaken the original ds in sales was front and center of sony's mind they were clearly doing everything they could to try and bottle that magic into their console which led us to just one year after the slim the psp 3000 or slim and light i always just imagine this is sony grabbing a microphone and screaming yes we have light to notice also how the boxes get smaller each time as sony trims down what it's giving and then also figures out how to cram what they are giving into as little space as possible now i wouldn't call the slim and light a revolutionary console but considering it came out so soon after the slim these are solid improvements a brighter screen with five times the contrast ratio and an anti-glare coating plus a microphone you could literally skype your friends on your psp this thing was so advanced but it still didn't sell in massive numbers so sony decided screw it people clearly want something that is actually as slim and light as the ds light we're going to take that to the absolute extreme with the psp go and i so remember seeing this thing in stores for the first time unbelievably excited that handheld this cool existed unbelievably jealous of anyone who actually got one this thing inspired by sony's milo personal communicator is tiny it's even cuter than my milo communicator and the form factor it's just draw worthy this is one of the most robust satisfying opening and closing mechanisms to dat it's even nicer than most foldable phones even today but it did have a problem see playstation portable as a platform it wasn't designed with this level of portability in mind you know these umd discs were one of these plus just the hardware required to read it just that is nearly the size of this console so so they acted it the psp go couldn't play any kind of physical media and you had to buy everything from the playstation store to compensate they did give you 16 gb of inbuilt storage which with psp games it could go quite a long way but i mean if you think the world now is not ready for all digital gaming the world then was definitely not any real gamer hated the idea and as gamers we we like to let people know that this thing was such a commercial failure in fact that even a very dramatic hail mary buy a go and get 10 free games promotion by sony could not save it these were 10 proper games by the way in total worth more than the console itself but people just wanted nothing to do with it so to actually make sure they shifted the bulk of their psp hardware before the next generation came out sony had to do the one thing they hadn't tried up until this point getting the price down to the ds's level the psp street which apart from the go is i think the coolest looking psp with this slick matte finish and they've also done that while while shaving the price down by about $100 with the removal of stereo audio the brightness buttons and actually even wi-fi that sounds major but for most psp users including myself wi-fi was not really a big part of the experience so this was a smart revision it's just this price cut it needed to come much earlier in the console's life cycle when people were still forming their opinions about the platform as a whole i mean the psp at this point had been out for 7 years which is enough time that people were starting to turn their attention to what's next and so the idea of a cheap version of the last gen console with less features it's not exactly going to set the world on fire but clearly all of these console revisions while none of them individually spectacularly successful they did all pull together to push the pspe to a total sales number of 82 million consoles which for a company whose last handheld was little more than a fidget toy is impressive the stage was set and hype was building for psp 2 which ended up being called the playstation va and with the psp being my my favorite console of all time i cannot tell you how excited i was for this thing and when i eventually got it in my hands the hardware was every bit as spectacular as i had dreamed let me explain that one stubby little analog stick had become two much more substantial ones the entire back panel was a touch sensitive layer to add another dimension of interactivity into games it had six axis motion control brought over from the ps3 front and rear cameras with face detection and head tracking small cartridges instead of large discs full 3g connectivity to take the social features to the next level not to mention the materials they went from cheapish plastic to metal and glass in many areas the psp was already premium in my eyes and so moving from that to this was like my entire worldview imploding and then the screen the ps v screen was its single biggest asset a 5 in 544p resolution that's four times the number of pixels of the psp capacitive multi-touch panel at the time it launched it even felt ahead of many top-of-the-line smartphone screens let alone the psp and this was also at a time where the idea of touch screens on devices that were non-smartphones was still very new and very exciting so how powerful was it well take the psp and multiply it by 10 so yes 200,000 times the pocket station this was a technological behemoth so let's take it for a spin oh man holding this in my hands turning it on for the first time it really takes me back to that moment when i first got my hands on one i remember i'm boxing it for the first time and before touching the console my hand was almost quivering because i spent so much time just fantasizing about it watching this trailer again and again and again just dreaming about what it would be like to be able to reach inside and grab the thing okay as you turn it on with this really solid actually metal button oh yeah then they have this whole page teir unlock animation i just think that was so cool and one thing becomes very clear having just to use the psp this is nothing like it i think the ps v has paid very close attention to smartphones at the time and in a sense has tried to replicate the success of those i just love how bouncy and filled with personality the user interface is and one of the coolest things about this console is you no longer just had to do one thing at once you could have multiple applications open i remember being so excited by the idea of cameras oh wow zero processing what you see is what you get okay so now we're going to load up assassin's creed liberation which is basically the ps v's equivalent of what we just played on the psp well the speakers are much better too there was still good on the psp but here you notice that they have much more space for you to hear the different instrumentals oh wow yeah i mean the clarity on the character model the buildings the amount of texture you see on screen at any one time is very clearly a generation ahead but you know this also reminds me of one of the big problems i had with the v which is it kind of hurts me to say but i feel like developers were too ambitious i feel like sony when they were marketing this console they tuted the horn of this is basically like ps3 power on the go so you you know developers built their games accordingly like very ambitious massive worlds and it just couldn't quite handle it and so it was such a common ps v trope for games to be really pretty but just run up poor frame rates which to be honest you can even see right now the vita also had so many gimmicks like the back touch screen and the front and rear cameras which i think they came with a lot of promise like this idea of you'll be able to play augmented reality games and you're going to have some next level immersive experience but it never really like happened all of that stuff kind of relies on sony being able to convince developers to adopt it and they just didn't and so with any serious game like assassin's creed you kind of would have just been better off without it and having saved costs on the console if you could look past those compromises though then yeah the vita was a tasty treat of the console and a sub to the channel would be well handy and the best part is that it seemed like from the launch that sony had also worked out pricing compared to the the original psp which launched at the equivalent of $400 in today's money the v was 330 by the same metric so the stars were lining up as were the pre-orders from core psp fans the playstation vita was shaping up to be a firecracker of a console launch with even exclusive games from massive brands like uncharted ready to go day one but then as soon as this thing hit the mass market the vita fell flat something had clearly gone majorly wrong i would put it down to three things one that while the price of the basse console itself was reasonable for its tech the price of its proprietary sony made memory cards was not you pay a full extra $100 to get a 64 gb card which feels like sony's roundabout way of trying to recoup costs on the console two the vita had poor timing partly because it was beaten to the market by nintendo's shiny new 3ds partly because unlike the psp it was launching into a market where most potential users had just bought new smartphones and were enjoying the novelty of gaming on those and partly because it was cannibalized by sony's other products while the vita launched in japan in 2011 it didn't hit the western market till 2012 and this was not good cuz it's the very same year that the hype started overflowing for their next home console the ps4 which would launch in 2013 and so the vita had gotten people excited those who bought one love the hardware but then the stage was swept from under its feet almost immediately as soon as that happened the vita was already on the way down but what finished it off was three that the stream of games also followed because the thing was so unique it was a complicated expensive platform to develop for so who's going to bother doing that the second you start to see the attention moving on credit weare du sony did take one stab at revitalizing interest in the vaita and also correcting for the effective tax on storage and that's the fairly predictable at this point ps v slim which they decided to give its own internal storage so you didn't have to buy a memory card an internal storage of 1 gab what makes it even worse is that as soon as you start using an external memory card you're effectively locked out of using that internal memory rendering it completely useless as anything more than a buffer while you crawl your way to a computer to drop $100 and wait for your v memory card in the mail and while yes it's pretty cool that you could now have psv to power in a body that is way slimmer and 40 g lighter it's pretty clear that sony didn't exactly pull their love into this revision cuz that lightness actually came at the cost of both the size of the rear touch panel and the quality of the screen with the console's prized oled display being swapped out for a less fancy cheaper less vibrant lcd sony stopped releasing sales figures after a while which kind of tells you all you need to know like they just want to shut their doors and pretend it never happened but it's estimated that they only sold a grand total of 16 million ps vs in all and that put sony in a bit of a pickle because when a console doesn't sell well it doesn't make sense to invest millions building big games for it but then at the same time if sony did nothing and just let the thing die then that erodes trust in their future consoles this idea that they're only going to make them good platforms if lots of people buy them so they smartly pivoted the vita away from being its own major platform and more towards being the recommended companion for the ps4 through remote play and also set up this new indie focused initiative to get as many lower budget smaller developer made games as possible on both v and ps4 because a lot of these games were very simple both consoles could easily run them and you could have cross by with the abilities you pick up where you left off on one console on the other and for these smaller indie games the vub did actually become the perfect platform to play them on and it was such nice hardware that i know people still do to this day which feels like as nice of an exit that the console could have had but just before we get to the next generation of handheld sony had one more trick up their sleeves before the psb died out the weirdest handheld revision i've ever seen in my life the ps tv essentially the psv to handheld just without the screen and the controls and the fact that it's handheld so we'll stick that down you connect to it via your ps4 controller which is actually kind of all the more confusing cuz if you have a ps4 controller you probably have a ps4 and if you have a ps4 why do you want a pst tv cuz yeah it's a media box it plays games it watches movies but it's going to watch movies that are lower quality than the ps4 and it's going to play games that would really designed with the portable form factor and the portable controls in mind so yeah clearly this product was designed as a way to repackage the psv's proposition to try and shift some more units of the things hardware that had already been manufactured and to be fair it's priced really generously i just don't know what the exact use is and this is actually a really good example of that if i try and load up the same assassin's creed liberation game that i just played on my psv it won't open it's just not supported it must need some of the core psv hardware to actually function i definitely feel like sony also tried to borrow some of the things that made the wii really successful the kind of the way they frame the social features but they never took off in the same way but the writing was on the boardroom wall for sony and as far as handhelds were concerned it said don't bother so for literally a decade playstation fans retreated back into their living rooms with sony focusing all its efforts on the home console front until now enter the playstation portal the biggest box so far in the video really a completely new kind of handheld wow this thing feels like a beast and in so many ways this is worlds apart from son's other handhelds like the screen is four times the resolution of the already pretty crisp v they're no longer just good for a handheld they are literally one toone with your actual playstation 5 including the same adaptive triggers that can let you feel tension the catch is that well it's empty this thing doesn't play games natively but it streams them from your playstation 5 and while that might sound sucky which i understand and i know a lot of people online are saying this thing makes no sense in a way it might actually be my dream console okay so every other console that i've sat here in this chair and tested for this video i've played with at some point before in my life this is completely new to me so you press on that and it opens up a very literal portal and i guess when it finds your console you go through there that is awesome the thing that i'm trying to discern here is how much or how little does this feel like i'm just playing on a handheld as opposed to streaming it i mean as far as the quality of the home screen goes almost indistinguishable every bit of text is crystal clear wow i mean this looks absolutely insane it's really hard to separate the fact that it's not running on this console i mean all i have in my mind is the ps v as our kind of pointed comparison and compared to that this feels like not one but three generations ahead the latency between let's say when i move the joystick and the character moves is very low to be honest there's a tiny bit of lag but not necessarily more than even games that aren't screaming i mean just having like a wireless remote for example does introduce some latency the only thing that does remind me that i am streaming as opposed to playing natively is the dynamic resolution so it seems like what happens is every time you kind of turn around and it's got a okay oh do you know the the haptic feedback on that wow so it seems like it's programmed to make its top top priority to avoid lag but obviously when you're doing things over the internet naturally there will be points where you get high signal points where you get low signal so while the frame rate and the fluidity is pretty consistent the quality not as much i know that for so many people this makes no sense because you've already got the ps5 that can play the game you've already got probably a bigger screen and probably a better sound system too but for me handhelds just give this feeling of freedom that you don't get with anything else it does very much look like if playstation made a switch like it's it's the exact mirror of that massive tablet like screen in the middle and then big controllers on either side one thing i don't like about this is that it doesn't support normal bluetooth headphones apparently for the purposes of latency sony saying that you can only connect directly to sony headphones whether or not that's true it would still be good to allow users the option to use something else and i'm dead now when you're in a situation like this and you're relying very heavily on your home wi-fi there is a cool trick you can use to up your security i've spoken a few times about how you can install the surfar vpn app on your phone or your laptop but there's no surf shark vpn app for ps5 so what do you do well turns out you can just put surf shark vpn directly onto your router it is a bit fuffy to set up but all you need to do is to just follow the instructions once and it'll not just mean it'll cover every single type of device from your pocket station if that had internet to your portal with all the perks that has like being able to make your internet traffic anonymous but it also means you just never have to think about it again from that point onwards once you've set it up your ire home's internet traffic is automatically going through whichever server you decide you want to use that's just one of the reasons i like surf shark there's like 20 more like the fact that they do have legit 24/7 customer support like the fact that one subscription covers you plus every single person you know and the fact that they have ad and malware blockers baked into it and right now there is a
