welcome back my friends to goodwill finds this is where all the really good stuff that you donate goes instead of going to the actual store where you could treasure hunt it all went to goodwill finds and i'm about to snap it up a framed and signed photo of lyndon b johnson to eugene huit with best wishes lendon b johnson well eugene you're probably dead now does anyone want 19 copies of we fit and we fit plus it's only $510 now this is an original fat ps3 it's an 80 gig bottle this actually can still play n on ps1 games but importantly it has the hardware capability of ps2 games oh wait cons untested a so we got to really roll the dice on this cuz if this works this is actually a pretty decent deal this is neat right so this is it's n64 now it looks why is there is that literal feces on the back of this n64 oh no handy boy oh boy i'm finding the items now i'm going to get to things for this video maybe collection of pc games $15 playstation so with that my friends we've got all the tech we need from goodwill now if you excuse me i'm going to hit the big old checkout button before i get an angry call from mx saying hey why did you just spend 1,700 bajillion dollars on goodwill on random tech that you're never going to use and i don't have to have that conversation all right so i maybe ordered a handful of items from goodwill but you know it's fine cuz we're going to have a great time together right my friends you look like the neighbor from home improvement how the neighbor so first off we have a binder anyone want to take a whiff of this it smells like grandpa dude this was a smoker yeah it was yes sir unreal tournament 2003 which is this one starcraft what's up oh wait looks like wait maybe the paper art wait no this got to be the cereal right no there's no cereal what oh the cereal is on the disc okay cool cool cool actually some of our viewers might not even know what the hell they're even looking at right now these are just like pogs and you know what shout out to the person who kept this binder for actually putting all the cereals everywhere how much do we pay for this absolutely mint binder we paid $44 a steel steel absolute steel but the problem with a lot of these older games is that they're not all always super compatible with a modern system now some of these if you still have an optical disc drive you could get to work using dosbox or you know windows compatibility mode or whatever but for the real experience you need a period correct setup all right they really really packed this one didn't they well at least you got a free computer with your bubble wrap so this my friends is a period correct and by period correct i mean early 2000s dell i like how it's sort of like white and silver except for beige randomly which i almost wonder if it didn't used to be beige but dude there's this is disgusting so this would have actually been a relatively decent system for i'm going to guess probably like 2007 no 2008 also this ram is so sharp i can't get it back in without smashing my fingers ah look at my can you see my fingers look how much i was trying to push it in my fingers are literally like indented from trying to push on that like hard ram as cool as this is we're going to have to come back to a little bit later because we need to actually load up a copy of vista and find a hard driver realistically probably an ssd and get this guy up and running but i think this paired with the games is actually going to be a good retro experience next up we've got ourselves oh yeah boy this is a logitech cordless freedom mouse and keyboard combination this was designed for windows me and windows 2000 so you know wireless 25 years ago you're going to hit a key in 3 seconds later it's going to [music] type you warning some experts believe that the use of any keyboard may cause serious injury mentally or something about this doesn't feel as bad as like a modern keyboard well remember this is like the type type of membrane that was a little more premium compared to what came with your standard dell or [music] hp i think this is where the dongle to make this work with a liv this is brand new well my mouths will work and my comfortable wrist rest that's hard plastic will work unless i find some way of making these work which i don't think i can without the dongle i don't think this is going to be part of our setup but just bluetooth it bro so we have our windows vista system operational as you can see here we're running a copy of windows vista ultimate with a core 2 quad which actually is a pretty legit cpu and 4 gigs of ram i do like the fact that we're running starcraft 1.0 so proper original starcraft from 1990 something that cd audio oo yeah let's go oh that's the end of the map ha there's something so like just nostalgic and i is going to sound real dumb about playing on a crt swapping your discs in like it just to me it really brings me back oh it's vista don't forget you could fit so many so many memories in this bad boy so all right we got him yes me lord yes me lord so what are your thoughts on this windows vista computer i mean it's one of those things this is really cool that we got this working but there's so much that doesn't work for 36 bucks this is a cool little project pc if you want how much did you pay though in alex's time to do all this cuz that was going on for a hot minute oh yeah y oh i don't care about that one what it's a ps3 yeah you know the one that everyone liked oh no look it even says it on the box this product has limited backward compatibility with playstation and playstation 2 format software so this was a later model ps3 still the fat version but this was they had dropped the hardware back in pad and instead relied on software which means that i actually think that it was still playable you could play a fair few ps2 games but not all of them okay we got oh no can you see can you get a little zoom in on that just the just the the fur and the hair just hanging out oh no so we've got ourselves the rca which is really what this shipped with because it gmi was actually not that common at the time we got a usb and we also have an ie lead okay so that all looks fine the real test is going to be what does a ps3 look like i could see a little sver of it it looks okay i think it's actually quite nice looking no well little rattle but that doesn't seem bad honestly this might work i think this might work did it have the yeah well i'm going to grab a monitor and let's see if this thing actually works shall we oh hey yo shout out works definitely at least works to the point where we can get it up and running yes hdmi i think with just a little bit of cleaning this is in really good shape i'm not seeing anything besides very min scuffs and considering how old this thing is i don't think people used it much at all this drive makes good disy noises load that game boy let's go so yep there we go insomniac oh yeah this is when game data started becoming a thing install 45 seconds worth the date of my hard drive it still beats think about when we do this video in 20 years from now and we get a ps5 from goodwill and we have to wait 3 hours for it to download every patch and update the fan just spun up and a whole bunch of dust just popped out oh my goodness this is so high definition i feel good about this ps3 i think that it's actually a good pickup a little bit expensive but considering that with a little bit of cleaning it is an excellent condition and assuming that i don't know 6 hours of gameplay and it doesn't catch on fire or something this is neat good job us it's fine it's fine it's fine it's fine i'll catch it there we go we're good we're good i think this actually is just one item oh my god it's still in the box i forgot it's in the box okay cool cool cool oh my gosh this my friends is the 20in cinema display from 20 [music] ,3 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and 20 in of lcd power this was really really sick it's so cool looking look at on the back so it's like aluminum but it's like clear plastic around it you see this all right we're going to have to do a little bit of digging to see if we can actually get this thing up and running but i will tell you it is absolutely mint so let me run you through how we're trying this so we have our cinema display connected to this huge dvi to apple display connector or adc adapter which is going to not only provide power but also is going to give us a dvi out which goes into this adapter which then takes that dvi and turns it into mini display port now i'm going to plug this into my macbook i'm going to plug in my usb lead into the macbook so i'll also have an extra usb port being moved over here and then i need to plug in my giant power brick into the wall oh the max oh it works we have a successful display that we only had to purchase two and a half adapters to make work unfortunately that's as bright as it gets which i will say it might look okay on camera but is a little on the dm side i mean it's a little silly but if you want something that looks really cool i actually am not totally against it you know what though it looks so much much brighter than me i almost wonder because this thing is so old if the lcd hadn't turned on in like 15 20 years maybe it just needed a few minutes to like warm up honestly this thing's kind of rad you know what i knew ahead of time that the wireless mouse keeper wasn't going to work i just i was prepared so i got an extra mouse just in case and you know what lucky me this one i'm sure will work flawlessly this is the lamborghini mercy lago wireless mouse it is straight up it's actual lamborghini that looks legit how much do we pay for our lamborghini lamborghini mercy we paid $80 for this i we could have won 8 t like 80 80 but i will say i've seen some of these go on ebay for like 250 clickity click click click y that's a mouse and it is very much mousing go to sponsor austin.com if you'd like to place a bid for this lamborghini mouse or we're going to carefully put it back in the package now and it could be yours for the lower price of less than a real lamborghini mercy logo four miles on the odometer did you scroll that much next hey kat uh-huh a hand in what way well i just i've heard that you know i i'm a a handy individual please don't say that what what what what can i just want to give you i just want to give you a hand behold my friend the excellently named handy boy whoa by none other than std i'm not making this up the handy boy the all inone accessory for game boy it has the nintendo seal of quality on it and it is joy plus by st d the handy boy okay so oh you know what so i remember this so it's like a little like ablea adapter that actually works with ac so one of the main problems with the game boy even though it had good battery life compared to the competition it really it it still chew shoot do those the double a's are you trying to make the screen bigger by magnifying gross oh it turns the d-pad into a joystick and then what we do is we take this and we plug it in here power input and then you magnify and then i turn on the light so theoretically now if i can turn the light on off oh that's actually kind of loud wait those are two proper stereo speakers that sounds so much better how much do we pay for the handy boy completing box we paid $200 i can tell you that you can get other handy boys for cheaper than that okay we got a few things in here so we'll start out with our macbook i still think the macbook air 11 in was one of like the best form factors of a laptop ever cuz it stills like the fulls sizee keyboard but it was so little it was so nice to use oh oh my god look at that that's  just look at the grime on this system it is the most disgusting laptop we've ever actually seen and i'm not exaggerating wait you're actually having a hard time opening this youed whoa you want to come over here and try it with me oh no wait hang on oh it's it's you stupid idiot it's taped on the side oh that makes more wow so for 70 bucks if i can clean this i think it actually could be a usable system now i actually don't know the spec of this i'm hoping that they didn't take out the ssd but before i do anything we got got to cut through the montage of austin getting the elbow grease out and cleaning up this filthy filthy macbook but if i can get this thing working for 70 bucks pretty [music] good i've actually got to say i'm impressed with how much i was able to clean up this macbook even though it was absolutely disgusting coming out of the box with a little bit of cleaning i actually think it's in pretty good shape so if this actually takes a charge and works i think we might be okay oh oh okay so it only seats in one way but it now shows that it is taking a charge usually you're supposed to see something on the screen after you hear the chime i'm assuming that maybe they just formatted the drive and called it a day oh you know what it is so i tried my best the q-tip to clean out the port the actual mag safe there's still some gunk in there so the mag safe connector doesn't sit really well all right i'll give that another try i think the only real problem here is that it does not have an operating system which is fair they nuked it before they shipped it so let me see if i can get a fresh copy of mac os on this macbook and theoretically i'll be in business so the macbook air is now fully operational so after it's all been cleaned up i installed a fresh copy of mac os monteray which is the most upto-date version of mac os for this 2015 macbook air and it is all actually in pretty good shape so this is a 2015 macbook air and it is the base model which means that it has the core i5 4 gigs of ram and 128 gig ssd i think we got a good deal the only thing we're missing here was the power adapter but you can easily find those on ebay or amazon for like 15 bucks or whatever so like it's a little bit of a limited system and we absolutely took a big risk buying this thing just because it was in such terrible shape we got very fortunate that almost all of the dirt was just dirt that came off and it wasn't actually like properly beat up and we got it for 70 bucks man yo oh i got two of them i f so these our second gen ipod touches now ken and i have a very special attachment to this because i don't think it's an exaggeration to say neither of us would be standing here without this a fortun yeah i was going to say it has a camera they listen as a second gen back in 2010 when we were still making ipod videos austin was the king of jail breaking he was making i actually was all about jailbreak he was all about making state of jailbreak videos and back in 2010 i was on his channel that was before we really knew each other and he actually hired me dude how good is this hardware feel though it is unbelievably thin for both of them cuz it was a lot it was $32 woo these used to be $200 can i share with you the final item that we have to at least look at okay i found this and i was very curious this is an original xbox 360 from goodwill with a selection of games which i think will be a delight at your your party your birthday party maybe or oh well i mean good start it says not for resale so i already because it's skylanders and no one wanted to buy it oh boy okay so maybe let's go through it one by one so well the 360 is definitely seen better days we do have a copy of modern warfare 3 one which a little scratched up we'll find out if that works skyrim is also in the box here that looks much nicer and then we got skylanders who car and we got connect adventures remember we got a lot of 75 of these yeah and we have three more so the real question is does this actually work cuz we paid how much for the 360 in the games $52 so these 360s used to be dirt cheap like that was actually like a normal price a couple years ago but if you go on like ebay or back market or whatever you try to buy the original xbox 360s they've actually climbed up a lot in value a lot of these things are $100 plus now i don't know that this works it is in incredibly bad cosmetic shape but if this is an actually functioning xbox 360 60 gig for less than 60 bucks and we have some games we probably did okay so let's see if our xbox 360 actually works now i will say that it did not come with a controller or a power adapter so we're using ones that we already had so even though this is only $52 if you add the other stuff to actually get it to be usable it's probably like 70 or 80 blx but let's see if it works shall we very good xbox noises any minute now now we're going to try via av now if this works it is only going to be 480p so it's still not going to be great but maybe it's just the hd might oh it was just the hdmi port doesn't work let's try to play some skyrim and see if it actually works now everything else on this xbox even though like cosmetically it's in bad shape actually does seem to be work working [music] what you hear the the noise of the disc train that opening ah did i just get jump scared by the disc drive what the hell man so maybe not only does the the disc tray kn open and close normally it can't read discs either so well it was only $52 and it is technically functional i got my value in these amazing xbox 360 games which are worth at least $745 so i think we're just going to call this one a win thanks goodwill did this drive close by itself without me touching it huh how interesting
