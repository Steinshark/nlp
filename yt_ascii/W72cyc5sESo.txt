star wars a question emerges how quickly can the game be beaten the lego star wars speedrun has the precision of a 3d platformer combined with the glitches and tricks of a broken nes game and for the past few years a dedicated community of runners have been battling each other to take the world record lower this is the history of lego star wars world records [music] thank you and now a word from

lego star wars the video game was released in 2005 where you could play episodes one through three this was followed up by the original trilogy in 2006 with episodes four through six being playable finally in 2007 these games were combined into lego star wars the complete saga allowing you to play through all six episodes while the three versions are all speed ran today the most popular one by far is the complete saga the topic of this video now the earliest full game speedruns of the complete saga date back to 2013 but it's a bit of a hazy timeline see back then there was no concrete rule set the initial method was to play through episodes one through six in order on the game's super story mode which adds a timer to the bottom of the screen and doesn't have status screens between levels later runners switched to playing the episodes on replay story meaning you can use any red brick upgrade on any level since these records didn't have a standard rule set and also some were filmed with a potato we'll skip going over them in detail however serious props should be given to the record holders posh act and lexos the champions of the complete saga's early era for the next two years no records would be set but in 2015 the community began to form once again and for the first time standardized rules were created all runs would be played on new game instead of replay story all red bricks which are unlockables that give you a special ability were banned and you could only play with one player calling in player 2 at any point was disallowed these rules formed the backbone of runs starting in 2015. and the first record to abide by them was played by sm kirkey clocking in at 3 hours 44 minutes and 46 seconds now this might seem long for a speed run but lego star wars is a long game it has 36 levels most of which take several minutes to get through on top of that there are also nearly an hour of unskippable cut scenes between the levels so how did sm kirkey speed the game up well his general strategy can be seen in negotiations the first level in episode one he killed enemies and built objects needed to progress but beyond that he was running through everything as fast as he could often times there was no need to actually kill enemies you could just perform tasks and ignore them and if you die you quickly respawn and can keep going in level 2 of episode 1 sm kirkey showed off quick platforming jumping through the stage while avoiding slowdowns another simple strategy used was on bosses on fights like darth maul and jango fett sm kirkey used the jedi slash over and over the most effective way to drain the health of bosses so thus far it seems that sm kirkey was still following all the rules of the game he was just doing the minimum possible and optimizing everything for speed but no there's more sm kirkey did we've yet to discuss because like i said earlier lego star wars is a broken video game [music] in level 5 of episode 2 you normally have to use one bomb to take out one side of the barrier then go back and get a second bomb to take out the other side however the collision of the barrier stops extending out to the right once the right side is destroyed so by doing a precise spin move you can make it around the barrier without having to backtrack for the second bomb it's known as the 2-5 first barrier skip and saves roughly 14 seconds [music] in level 2 of episode 4 you normally have to build and push a block to progress through the stage but if you instead veer off to the left and double jump off of a slope in the wall you can make it to a platform and skip right through it once again this saves roughly 14 seconds and in episode 5 one of the biggest skips in sm kirkey's run takes place to end level 2 you have to get on top of the millennium falcon and the intended method to do this involves unlocking a door to release animals and jumping off of their backs instead sm kirkey precisely spaced a double jump to barely reach the top early saving 40 seconds in all there were more than a dozen tricks like this across the run adding up to minutes of time save there's honestly too many of them to go over in depth here but many of them followed the same pattern doing a precise jump somewhere you're not supposed to in order to skip doing something else that would take longer we'll see more of these tricks later but as a whole sm kirkey's run was on another level compared to the runs from 2013. fewer mistakes more tricks and a cleaner speedrun overall it was a great starting point and it stood as the record for almost a year but in mid-2016 along came a player known as tsg and what tsg did to the world record was this [music] in 2016 a runner named tsg came onto the scene by june he'd have the world record and over the next year he'd do that nine more times his dominance can be attributed to a few things first his skill level was well beyond that of any other runner the only one who was close was sm kirkey but he couldn't catch up second this was an incredibly active period of discovery for the game you'll see soon how many new tricks tsg was able to use and third tsg played the game on pc this wasn't fully known at the time but running the game on pc is much faster than any other version mainly from having faster load times tsg's first record was a 341-17 and after the first level he was presented with the option to save or not after you save for the first time you lose a couple seconds from auto saving after every level however it does allow you to reset the game before a cutscene plays at the end of each episode since your progress is saved before then this allows you to more quickly start the next episode instead of watching a long cut scene it's especially after episodes three and five and the time save is further compounded from the fast resetting that you can do on pc and of course he had a plethora of new strategies to use particularly in episode 5. 1 was in stage 5-2 c3po can't jump so you normally have to build a cart to take him up this ledge but instead tsg just punched him and pushed him up saving roughly 22 seconds from not having to use the cart and in 5-4 you normally have to have yoda teach luke the force and build bridges for r2 to use but why do that when you can just use bad collision detection in the wall and get up anyway this was discovered by grubo and saves a solid 30 seconds but the most notable trick in the run was one known as dv3 short for darth vader 3. in this form of the fight you're supposed to deflect objects into darth vader then eventually glass comes down and you can jump across however it's just barely possible to jump across without the glass meaning you can skip the entire fight you have three frames of leeway between the two jumps in a double jump and it was easily the most difficult trick in the run but if done properly you would save over 70 seconds from not having to fight darth vader and thanks to these three tricks and more despite having some big slowdowns tsg had his first world record his record streak would continue over the following weeks and the run had a couple major changes first he changed the episode order playing episode 5 last players were allowed to play them in any order they wanted but putting episode 5 at the end was beneficial since its ending cutscene was the longest and timing stops before the cutscene plays this way it's not included anywhere in the final time and the second change was the removal of a leaderboard rule red bricks were no longer banned that meant he could use certain unlockables as he found them throughout the game the two big ones he used were exploding blaster bolts which lets you kill some enemies quicker and blow up certain barriers and infinite torpedoes which means you always have them behind you in the flying levels and don't have to go pick them up having these two upgrades across much of the runs saved several minutes and when combined with better execution of other tricks allowed tsg to take the record under 3 hours and 30 minutes new strategies were also getting discovered left and right and in late 2016 one of the most obvious oversights from the developers was found by a player named osumnal on the last level of episode 1 you're supposed to fight darth maul by forcing objects into him but over on the right there's a lamp and for some reason everything below the lamp is considered by the game to be out of bounds you can stand and jump in any out of bounds area so it's possible to just jump off the wall to the top of the lamp and across to the other side as simple as that you could save 30 seconds by april 2017 tsg had taken the record to 3 hours and 24 minutes and with second place more than seven minutes behind he was in full control of the world record however in may a key rule was lifted back in august 2016 the ban on red bricks was lifted and now players were allowed to call in the second player welcome to the world of one player two controller strats [music] so what's the benefit of using a second player well lego star wars was designed to be a two-player game and some sections can be completed much faster with the second player in 4-5 for instance if you have one player you're supposed to build a cart to go over buttons fast enough before they turn red but if you're using two players no need for the cart there's a couple sets of these buttons in 4-5 and if you skip using the cart for both you save a full minute however you're not allowed to have a physical second player to help you out you have to do everything alone so whenever you want to call in player 2 you have to control them both at the same time it's known as one player two controllers or 1p2c and on pc there's three options for this you can use two controllers you can use two parts of the keyboard or you can use a keyboard and a controller most runners nowadays go with the keyboard controller method but in june 2017 tsg set a record with the controller controller method the only point tsg used one p2c in the run was in 4-5 but the community knew there could be applications elsewhere less than a month after tsg's run it would be beaten by a new player roush more he had been a contender for a while but rapidly improved his personal best in mid-2017 to take the top spot used 1p2c in stage 4-5 and thanks to a couple new strategies in episode 6 pulled ahead for a new world record by 90 seconds however tsg was up to the task and just a week later he took the record back by the end of the year tsg's time was down to 3 hours 19 minutes and 30 seconds the 319 run had a notable new trick in the first phase of the darth vader fight after dealing two hearts of damage darth vader jumps around and won't knock luke's stormtrooper helmet off you can then use r2 to precisely land on the white part of the panel then fly and avoid a death plane to barely make it to the other side once there you activate a platform for luke and open the door with the stormtrooper helmet to skip nearly the entire fight the trick nicknamed dv1 saves 45 seconds and was discovered by a runner named zolis when combined with dv3 it was quite evident that stage 5-5 was becoming the most critical point of the run speaking of zolis he would set the game's next record a 3 16-12 he implemented one p2c across the run more some were small time saves like deflecting shots so that r4 could safely activate the panel in 2-2 and others were more substantial in 4-5 you could now use chewbacca to activate the elevator and ride it immediately instead of having to use han solo and wait for its second cycle a time save of about 12 seconds but interestingly zolas played the game on wii we know from before that this is slower than the pc version but there's another consideration to be made the wii version requires using both the wii remote and the nunchuck so to do one p2c you need to juggle four controllers at once still zolas was able to pull it off with a world record by over three minutes tsg followed this up a few months later with a 314-28 it was notable for implementing yet another trick into level 5-5 dv1 and dv3 already had skips and now darth vader's fourth form did as well it was possible to do a couple of precise double jumps and skip having to use the force and having to use r2 they have the potential to save about 7 seconds and just added to the skill needed in 5-5 episode 5 as a whole was becoming really brutal and since it has the longest end cut scene it had to be at the very end of the run so let's take a look at our timeline so far tsg started dominating in mid-2016 and although he twice lost the record to roush more and zolas he'd always been able to fight back two years later his name was still on top of the leaderboard but tsg's 314 from june 2018 would be the last record he would ever set the game was about to enter a new era because in october 2018 roush more did this [music] over the span of just three weeks roush more took the record from a 314 down to a 309. the key was the rapid discovery of new tricks by a runner named eltri tricks that would save up to 8 minutes and the first one is really stupid in 6-5 killing the emperor normally takes a substantial amount of time however if you lure him over to the corner and die intentionally upon respawning you can just push him off the edge it skips the remainder of the fight and saves 45 seconds later it was discovered you could push him off at the start of the fight by calling in player 2. it saves an additional minute and is known as the ultra kill another simple boss skip was found in 4-3 you can skip the spy fight by using the force on r2 this pushes him past the trigger to start the fight and if you call him in after you can just go in the open door and save about 50 seconds but the real big time save was in 6-3 in this level you're supposed to hop in your speeder and drive through the roughly five minute course instead if you go into the corner of the end barrier with both players player 1 gets placed above player 2 and you can do a 360 to make it over the barrier this activates the end of the course and you can skip the entire thing to save several minutes these discoveries helped lead to four consecutive records from roush more his fourth and final time a 309 from october 2018 would be the final record set in the year but interestingly as the records stayed put at 309 the run started to get massive views on youtube it went semi-viral and many people who saw the video thought it could be fun to try running it themselves and largely thanks to roush more's video by early 2019 there was a new crop of runners ready to gun for the world record [music] in fifth place there was cenor with a 31137 in fourth place there was we super with a 310 45 in third place there was osomnol with a 3 1006 and in second place there was shred with a 309-54 all four runners were closing in on roush moore's record and it was obvious that one of them would beat it soon the general consensus for the favorite to do so was osomnol but all four of them had a shot at it and then one of them broke through on february 11 2019 xenor jumped straight from fifth to first place to capture his first world record he lowered his personal best by nearly two and a half minutes in the process cenor had gotten into the game after seeing roush more's video and although he lowered his time quickly he was comfortably behind the other record contenders but the key to see nor getting this record was 1p2c he used it all over the run he used it for multitasking he used it to get one player in position while the other player built he used it to push characters further ahead these were small time saves on their own but they added up when used across a three-hour run this was also the first run to use the incredibly difficult disco skip in 6-2 after building the speaker you then try and position luke so he's exactly 50 percent inside of the speaker once it's finished being built the game doesn't know what to do when you're inside a built object so if you're next to a wall it will sometimes push you through it meaning you can go out of bounds and skip building the disco party to save 40 seconds this is a really precise trick since you have to be positioned just right to clip out of bounds but if you miss it you can just break the speaker and build it to try again with all the competition from top runners people didn't expect cenor's record to last long but it would only last for three days on valentine's day 2019 shred took the record with a 306-27 tred had been running the game for over a year but only became a serious record contender early in 2019 and his record was an improvement by nearly three minutes which was especially impressive given that it was played on a wii it didn't do much new over cenor's record but was better executed it had a first try ultra kill and a cleaner episode 6 overall seen or fired back just three days later with another two minute record improvement the world record was now down to a 304 but it still had some significant slowdowns senor lost nearly a minute on disco skip and over 30 seconds in 5-5 from missing the dv skips so clean up those tricks save a bit elsewhere and add in a couple new strategies and suddenly sub 3 didn't seem out of the question in march 2019 two runners started to pull ahead from the rest of the pack cenor and we super both of these guys had only gotten into the game in the last few months but they lowered their time side by side and got good quickly they raced each other frequently and although cenor was slightly ahead on the leaderboard we super was never far behind as march progressed these two made it clear they both wanted to make a push for the world's first sub-3 it was barely in the realm of possibility but with the two of them pushing each other a sub three hour run started to feel more real than ever [music] thank you [music] foreign [music] [music] [music] [music] xenor had skipped straight over 259 to a 258.50 his run was roughly even through episode 6 but he saved some time later over mistakes and slowdowns in his last pb and at the end of the run he still had to execute tricks like hut skip and dv3 it was an intense situation but he was able to clutch them out and get the first sub three interestingly about half an hour before the end of cenors run we super started a run of his own and this run would finish as a 259.04 the world's second sub three had we super started his run just a few hours earlier he would have won the race to sub 3. but instead he had to settle for second place while cenor got the glory but cenor's record wouldn't last long he beat his own run by 43 seconds just a day later this run was notable for introducing a piece of rng in 4-4 there's a section where obi-wan is supposed to appear across the room on a bridge after you arrive the way the game tries to get him there is by running through a room with barrels if he gets stuck behind a barrel the game turns him to try and get around them which slows him down but he still eventually arrives on the bridge usually sometimes he gets stuck and if that happens he never shows up and you can't progress through the level lego star wars is a broken game now runners used to have a way around this you reload the bridge room by entering and exiting the previous room which guarantees obi-wan will show up for a two second time loss but players then found 4-4 cutscene skip by jumping off of this ledge you can hook back and enter an out of bounds area to skip to the next room this means a cutscene doesn't play and you save' seconds however as a consequence of the cutscene not playing you can no longer reload the bridge room since you wouldn't be able to leave the previous room if you enter it so obi-wan rng was back into play he didn't want to show up you were in big trouble a couple weeks later a fairly substantial change was made the community decided to alter the way runs were timed instead of starting when the players gained control in 1-1 it would now begin when selecting new game on the main menu this was mostly done so that movement in the cantina would be considered in the final time it added roughly 58 seconds to all runs so when cenor set a record that would have been 257.36 under the old timing it was re-timed to 258.34 and that made it four consecutive records for cenor he was the first to sub three and now he was taking control of the leaderboard for wii super he just couldn't catch up he perpetually remains slightly behind cenor easily in second place but ever since he missed his chance at the first sub three the world record eluded him but after the 258 34 xenor announced that he would be taking a break from the category to focus his efforts elsewhere maybe this was the chance we super needed with scene or at least temporarily out of the picture he could hone in on improving his time without needing to compete with anyone and as it turns out just two days later it was only record by a second but we super had finally overtaken cenor it was a run with a great early game but he lost some time on speeder skip and had a weak episode 4. still we super had broken through was this a one-time deal or was he about to make something more out of it foreign six days later a 60-second record improvement by we super largely due to saving time in episode 4. the very next day another minute and a half world record three weeks later two record improvements on the same day three days later a record cut by nearly two full minutes then we super took a break when he came back another world record seven records over the course of three months for wii super the final one was a time of 253.04 after a while see norton come back to attempts but this time the tables returned he was the one who couldn't catch up to wii super the way he went on this run was through both improving his own skills and utilizing new strategies in 2-6 we super began using dooku skip by standing on a barrel you can force it with player 2 and clip under the floor by then dropping out with the inbounds player you can lead them forward past the trigger for the dooku fight and enter the next room the trick was found by cenor and saves up to 30 seconds wii super also began using the vehicle smart bomb red brick it allows you to hold the special button in ship levels and make everything on screen explode which can save you about 20 seconds in 5-1 and interestingly with these new tricks being incorporated and runner's skill levels improving someone new moved into second place chimkin he had been in third place for months even being a part of the initial sub 3 grind but he always remained behind we super and cenor but he was improving and by may he was ahead of cenor and sure enough when we super woke up on the morning of july 6th his record was gone chimkin had beaten it by over a minute getting a 252 flat it was a run with a slow early game but after a gold split in 3-2 he was off to the races pulled ahead of the record and crushed it so we super had to get back to work and it took him 13 hours to get the record back over the coming weeks and months we super and chimkin would trade the record back and forth cooper was the first to take it under 250 with a 240 955 on july 17th chimkin would get the next record and by the end of the year it was down to 245.39 how did these two take the record down by seven minutes well there was a new red brick fast force which does what it sounds like it lets you force objects faster to obtain it quicker shimkin found a method of going out of bounds then doing a death warp to get back on track it's unlocked in 4-2 so players started playing episode 4 earlier in the run so they could use fast force in episode 6 3 and 5. and of course there were a plethora of new strategies discovered in the second half of 2019 some were small and saved a few seconds while others saved closer to half a minute but the big one was in 5-6 it's the last stage in the game and it had an evolution of skips over the years way back during tsg's record rain runners started doing a trick called best spin out of bounds you jump roll off a ledge to land out of bounds and progress forward in the stage to skip having to build c-3po and open the door it saved 45 seconds but was immensely difficult players used this trick for years but in december 2019 cenor found something better you join with player 2 and put lando in a doorway if player 1 stands far enough away and lando jumps the door will close if it closes while you're at the top of your jump you'll get pushed through the door frame and out of bounds ultimately you can get to the same room as you did from bespin out of bounds but it allows you to do so nearly a full minute faster and is much easier the only problem is that if you miss the door clip initially ai characters can randomly run near the door and prevent it from closing so you really want to get the trick first try with all these time saves combined and runners still improving their skills on top of that the world record was down to a really solid 245. it was enough for wii super to take a break from grinding the category and shimkin had stopped playing it as well other than those two nobody had a pb under 2 hours and 50 minutes but over the coming weeks in late 2019 and early 2020 the game would get a huge boost in popularity thanks to an unlikely source tick tock there was a big wave of nostalgia for lego star wars millions played it while growing up and after years had passed they looked back on the game fondly a trend began on tick tock where people changed their profile pics to mimic how they look in lego star wars with a green or blue circle around them this increased the game's popularity on the internet as a whole as people remembered lego star wars and wanted to experience it again as such speedrun streams and videos exploded in popularity and starting in early 2020 there was a new wave of speedrun activity and suddenly by february we super had new competitors on his doorstep in second place was t fresh and in third place was lead astray both had a time of 247 and both had aspirations for the world record we super had no choice but to do more runs if you wanted to defend his title so he did and in the span of just one week he lowered the record twice taking it down to 244.30 but this wasn't the complete domination that he'd had earlier his competition continued to close in led astray got a 246 and a familiar face had actually jumped into second place c nor the pressure was on for wii super these guys were both capable of getting the record and could really obtain it any day now we super continued to do runs and a couple weeks later he achieved the run that put away any competition for the record months of attempts had all led up to this moment it was his ultimate run throughout the first four episodes there were no significant mistakes he gained a bit of time on nearly every level and leaving episode 6 he was nearly two minutes ahead the final two episodes are three and five and although they weren't perfect they were good enough and when combined with the incredible start he'd had the end result was a monster world record we super wasn't that much risk of losing his title anymore or was he senor wasn't deterred from the task at hand wii super was now three minutes ahead but senor knew he could close the gap on march 27th he took his pb down to 244 and on the 31st he shaved another half minute off despite the optimization of wii super's record xenor was actually able to close in these two guys were ahead of the pack just like the initial sub 3 grind we super and cenor were locked in a battle thanks to the game's boost in popularity around this time the community decided to have a lego star wars speedrun tournament we super senor and most of the game's other top runners all participated it was a double elimination tournament and there were some great times put up by several different runners but when all was said and done after the brackets were completed who else would meet in the finals but we super and cenor these two would get the benefit of a big new strategy discovered a few weeks ago in 6-1 spiderless by using a forcible object you could clip into the wall which was faster than the old method of using the spider you can then come back and balance the touch of great which acts as a trigger for the game to send you straight to the boss fight and skip the cutscene this trick saved a full 60 seconds a huge advantage for any runner who could pull it off up to this point cenor had lost one match while we super was undefeated so to win the whole thing xenor needed to win twice while we super needed just one win and see nor handily won the first game we super accidentally soft locked in 5-1 losing several minutes and allowing cenor to cruise to an easy victory that meant there would be a winner take all match the next day to determine the tournament champion this was going to be a tough task for cenor think of all he had going against them his personal best was nearly a minute behind we super he had lost to him earlier in the tournament and he had gotten a pretty lucky victory yesterday thanks to a fluke soft lock he was gonna need to play out of his mind if he wanted to win this thing and so on april 19 2020 in the final match of the tournament with his opponent heavily favored to win foreign this was cenor's first world record in over a year back when the run was 16 minutes slower and it was actually a close race through much of the run but cenor eventually pulled ahead and although we super finished with a 242 he didn't stand a chance xenor won the match he won the tournament and he got the world record and the race to sub 240 was officially on [music] ce again cenor and we super were the two competitors as it turns out cenor's time at the top wouldn't last long we super wanted the record back and it took him just five days to do so he got a 240 32. this run was actually on sub 240 pace until 5-5 but the last two stages of the run are two of the toughest we super lost a lot of time to dv3 and 5-5 and to door clip in 5-6 sub 240 would have to wait [music] foreign [music] 45 seconds to door clip and missed sub-240 by just four seconds it's a great example of how tough the end of the run is door clip is in the very last stage and if you miss it initially bad luck can make you lose the record over the following few weeks competition caught up a couple runners named pickle toe and ginger legend got times in the 241 range increasing the pressure on wii super and on july 14th cenor had a run on sub-240 pace into 5-6 but once again door clip killed it he ended up one second behind the world record we super had waited too long other players had caught up and it was a dead heat for the first sub-240. but on july 22nd we super had a run with a fantastic first few episodes he then lost his helmet in 4-5 but a great episode 6 put him back in the lead he had a rough 5-5 but with time to save in 5-6 sub-240 was still possible he got door clipped quickly and left just enough room to get sub 240 239.49 we super had won the race this was wii supers 22nd world record he'd faced competition from some of the best in the world but time and time again he had proven he could come out on top with his sub-240 goal accomplished we super finally felt he could take a break and the runners in second through fourth place xenor pickle toe and ginger legend have lost motivation after being beaten to the first sub-240. so they all stopped running the category as well for the first time in many months there was little activity at the top of the leaderboard that meant there was technically an opportunity for someone outside of the top four to swoop in and make a move let's take a look at who was in fifth place [music] this is e-road house he had been running the game for about three months and managed to quickly enter the game's top five however during the sub 240 grind he was comfortably behind the big four runners he wasn't considered to have a serious shot at the world record but with all four of them stepping aside this was his chance in early august he stepped into fourth place and lowered his pb down to 241-12 and on august 10th he got on a run where he pulled about 15 seconds ahead of the record by the end of episode 4. there was still a long way to go but he kept nailing tough tricks spiderless in 6-1 speeder skip and 6-3 a shot at the world record was starting to seem more and more like a reality against an incredible episode 3 in the world record so he bled some time there but going into the last two levels of the run 5-5 and 5-6 he was only half a minute behind to answer the trick gauntlet dv1 first try dv3 he defaltered a bit but got it fifth try dv4 jumps both first try and finally door clip second try this all saved about 40 seconds over the last two levels in wii supers run and it was enough for e-road house to get a 239-43 he had leapfrogged over pickle toe cenor and we super to get the world record there was a new face on top of the leaderboard well we super wasn't going to take this lying down e roadhouse had only beaten him by six seconds surely it wouldn't be too hard to take the record back but we super wanted something better there had been a number of new strategies developed around this time we super knew that if he utilized them all in a full run he could beat e-road house's time by minutes we won't go over all of these new tricks but there's two particularly big ones and the first one well lego star wars has an ultra shortcut level 1-4 is the pod race you have to drive around the course three times to beat the stage for years there was no way to really speed this up even the fastest world records just drove the three laps but in mid-2020 p53 hamster and cenor combined to develop a trick called pod fraud it's a very complicated trick but the gist of it is that the game's only method for checking lap completion is seeing if you've touched an area on the far side of the course and seeing if you've touched the finish line region so after driving a lap normally you go out of balance with two players leave one by the finish line region and try to get the other to the far side this middle section out of bounds kills you but it lets you build up speed quickly so by dying a few times you can build up enough speed to make it across by touching this region the next lap is activated and you skip having to drive around this setup takes about 25 seconds but a lap normally takes about 60 so you save over half a minute the other big skip is called grieve cheese discovered by pickle toe with concepts from fezteo the general grievous fight is normally a slow scripted battle where you jump around the level and then attack him on the main platform however he'll only perform his scripted actions if you're actively standing on this platform so you can use obi-wan to lure him toward a rock then jump off the platform and shoot him with player 2 before he walks too far away by repeating this over and over you can drain his health without having him ever perform scripted actions unfortunately there's rng involved he can randomly block your shots which wastes time but ideally grieve cheese can save over half a minute with all this and more we super felt that he could crush the current record and he was right on september'th he beat a roadhouse by just under two minutes getting a 237-49 a few weeks later he did it again with a 23608 the leaderboard was back to normal wii super was dominating the competition multiple minutes ahead of anyone else and still years after his first world record nobody could catch we super at least not for a couple weeks just 16 days after wii supers 236 e roadhouse managed to get the record back the key to doing this was yet another complicated new trick falconless the normal way to end stage 4-5 involves activating four triggers scattered throughout a big room then killing all the stormtroopers it's a slow process that gradually raises the millennium falcon so you can eventually enter it and end the level however p53 found a way to end the level early you first have to load the last room of the level which can be done by entering this grapple room you then go back far in the level and by crossing a particular line the game tries to save memory by unloading the last room this means the triggers stormtroopers and millennium falcon all disappear the issue is that the game never reloads them once you go back forward so you re-answer the final room and nothing's there storm troopers are gone the game treats them the same as if they were killed so you can jump into where the open door would be and the level ends this saves about a minute and 15 seconds and erode house's new record was a 234-51 that means that even without falconless he still would have beaten we super maybe it was a fluke whenever someone took the record from wii super he was always quick to respond but a month later he wrote house set another record [music] 234-32 this was uncharted territory when was he going to respond well a couple weeks later e-road house got on a run that was 25 seconds ahead after episode 2. this was the best pace anyone had ever been on that early he lost a bit of time from missing a clip in 4-2 but managed to improve to 30 seconds ahead leaving episode 4. with one of the greatest ever first halves of a run he just needed to avoid disaster in the back half to get his third consecutive record but instead of avoiding a disaster something else happened e roadhouse went on to play the best episode 6 ever performed he was now a minute and 45 seconds ahead of the record as you can imagine the pressure he felt at this point was enormous and he faltered a bit toward the start of episode 3 losing about 7 seconds in 3-2 followed this up with his best ever 3-5 and leaving episode 3 he was more than a minute and a half ahead of the record it was by far the best chance he had ever had he had a shot to not just lower the record but demolish it but he still had to get through episode 5. the hardest episode in the run with the toughest tricks all right at the end but he didn't need a perfect episode 5. he just needed one that was good enough he had a 90 second cushion as long as he didn't completely choke he'd have another record but with all the pressure mounting being on an unthinkable pace he wrote house didn't have an amazing episode 5. he had the best episode 5 ever performed [music] this was by far the greatest record the game had ever seen e-road house had skipped 233 and skipped 232. he was more than four minutes ahead of second place there was nothing more he could do there was nothing anyone could do erode house was the game's new top runner and it was hard to imagine this record being beaten anytime soon so he took a break since nobody else had a personal best below 236 there were no challengers for the record however that didn't stop players from continuing to run the game but the nature of the competition changed it was now a battle for second place rather than the world record about a month after the 231 a new runner moved into second ginger legend a few days later he'd be beaten by xenor getting a 235 and then a 234 it's important to note that there were very few new strategies being utilized the vast majority of their time save came from getting better at the game fewer mistakes better movement that sort of improvement by february our runner named zach achieved a 235 and by march there was a trio of runners with a 234 see nor in second place ginger legend in third place and zach in fourth place for the first time since he set his mammoth world record e-road house was feeling a bit of pressure they were still minutes away from his record but their times were dropping so he decided to end his break and go back to record attempts but he struggled to get good runs going especially compared to his incredible 231 on march 6th cenor would once again lower his second place time 233.05. he was now within 90 seconds of the world record e-road house continued his attempts but failed to get anything good and then on march 9th zach got on a run that was even with the world record through episode 2 that actually gained half a minute over the record in episode 4. once again this was mostly due to better gameplay rather than new strategies he ended up losing time to the incredible episode 6 and 5 in e-road house's record but still finished with the 232-23 zach was just 35 seconds off the world record xenor had a 233 zach had a 232 and e-road house had a 231. all three of them were doing attempts and all three of them had potential to get the world record he wrote house's time had run out he was now in direct competition with two strong runners there was no question the world record was coming down the question now was which of these three was going to do it first well on march 22nd e-road house broke through it was only a five second record improvement but it showed that he still had what it took this run had another fantastic early game but he lost about 45 seconds in episode 6 from repeatedly missing disco skip episodes three and five were up and down but since his gameplay overall had improved it was enough to eke out a small record but his work wasn't done yet a couple weeks later he wrote house got a 231-35 another small record improvement but he was making progress while zack and cenor weren't improving their times still all three runners continued to grind over the following weeks the end goal had shifted it was officially a grind for the game's first sub-230. a half hour barrier hadn't been broken in two years in mid-may cenor lowered his time down by over half a minute all three runners were now within 60 seconds of each other who would get sub 230 first would it be the veteran the newcomer or the current world record holder well on may 14th e roadhouse got on a run with another incredible first couple of episodes once again this was his best pace ever leaving episode 2. he faltered a bit in levels 4-2 and 4-3 so his pace cooled off slightly exiting episode 4. but after episode 6 he was still a minute ahead of the record it was clear that this would be a golden opportunity for the sub 230. and then in episode 3-1 something strange happened a roadhouse was cycling through his splits to see what time saves he had left and he accidentally paused his timer he realized this a short while later and unpaused it but this threw everything off his pace would now seem better than it really was he didn't know how long it was paused so if this run went all the way he'd have to re-time it to see what he really got well he wrote house made his way through episode 3 and it went beautifully episode 5 got off to a great start and entering 5-5 he was a minute 21 ahead but of course his real pace was still a mystery 5-5 was solid and 5-6 was nearly perfect and when he stopped his splits they read 229-35 he roadhouse knew his run was slower than that but the exact amount wasn't known it all came down to how long the timer was paused so it had to be re-timed the exact length of the pause would determine if this was the world's first sub-230 or if the race would continue and after the re-time they found that e roadhouse's timer was paused for 21 and a half seconds meaning his run was a 229.57 by the skin of his teeth he had done it his sixth world record in a row was his most important one yet he wrote house officially had the world's first sub-230 in the aftermath of this run zack and cenor continued doing pb attempts for a short while both players lowered their times but neither could catch up to e-road house their motivation had just dried up seemed like another community break would be in order you're probably noticing a pattern by now whenever community motivation is at a low point new tricks are always found to bring people back in and right on cue in may 2021 two massive tricks were discovered one of them was a 30-second time save in 3-5 found by los but the one we're gonna go over was the one discovered in 5-5 this trick was notable for two main reasons for one thing it was in the toughest stage of the run 5-5 was already a completely broken level you had dv1 dv3 and the dv4 jumps the new trick fittingly was called dv2 every room of the darth vader fight now had a skip the other notable thing about this trick it was the most difficult one in the entire game that's right the toughest trick of the run was now in a stage that was already considered to be the hardest this is the insanity of dv2 you start by activating a moving platform outside the boss room then positioning luke on a panel beneath it and placing r2 on the platform when the platform moves down you can collide into luke as he's sliding off the panel if done at the perfect moment luke will go through the wall under the floor of the next room and you can just walk underneath the boss fight getting the clip into the wall is so precise that pause buffering is used to help line it up and even so every single step of this trick is hard it's hard to get on the panel it's hard to stay on the panel it's hard to pause buffer at the right time it's hard to line up luke it's hard to line up r2 it's hard to avoid going too low in the boss room it's hard to avoid going too high in the boss room any of these portions not being done correctly results in a miss but if done properly it would save an additional 50 seconds of lava fang 407 note ko and ejp man created dv2 and it made stage 5-5 a nightmare tough trick after tough trick right at the end of the run but with all the time saved potential people had to go for it and it brought runners zack and cenor back to doing runs they each got times of 230 and then on june 1st xenor set the world record it had a rough episode six particularly a slow ultra kill in 6-5 but he got dv2 on his second try fantastic result for such a tough trick he closed it out 20 seconds ahead of the roadhouse xenor's first world record in over a year back when the run was 12 minutes slower so now of the top three competitors only one had yet to get the world record zach he'd been in the top three for the past five months even moving into second place on several occasions but he had never been able to take the top spot it was frustrating he knew he was good enough he'd been on pace before and he also had a bit of time on his hands coming up so zach decided to start a devoted grind for the record but this wasn't going to be just any grind he was going to play the game 14 to 15 hours per day until he set the world record zach began on his quest and over the next two weeks he played the game for roughly 200 hours run after run good pace after good pace and despite all that he didn't achieve a world record in fact he didn't even get a pb zack remained in third place behind e-road house and cenor disappointing for sure but zach would still get another chance because on june 13th runners zach e roadhouse and we super all met up to grind for the world record 12 hours a day with cenor also participating at home only 12 hours may have been less than zach was used to but still four of the best runners in the world 12 hours per day for three days straight surely a world record was incoming but it never happened 72 hours came and went with no world records here's why between all four runners more than 20 world record paces were achieved into the final two levels all of them died to dv2 it was such a hard trick and trying to execute it when feeling the pressure of a record-paced run good luck with that so for zach a grind of 12-hour days hadn't worked 14-hour days hadn't worked either so he had only one remaining option on june 16th zach began a grind of 16-hour days to get the lego star wars world record [applause] [music] and he never had any runs on record pace it was starting to seem hopeless but on june'th zach finally got a run deep ahead of the record and what a pace it was entering 5-5 his best possible time was 228.43 that was a good enough pace that he didn't even need to do dv2 he could get the record without it but zach was committed to going for it and on just his third try he got in the wall just make it to the end of the room he'd be in the clear but disaster struck he went too low and died forcing him to start dv2 over again he lost over a minute and ended up missing the record by just seconds had he skipped doing dv2 he would have had the world record so zach kept going more long attempt sessions more failed runs but on june 24th he'd find himself in an eerily similar situation a best possible time of 228.08 into 5-5 once again he could skip dv2 and still get the record but once again he was committed to going for it it was a decision that cost him the record last time this time he hid it first try he was in a golden position now he closed out 5-5 got door clip and when zach entered the millennium falcon to n5-6 he had just set a new world record by over a minute after months of grinding and hundreds of hours of world record attempts zack's efforts were vindicated this record didn't stop others from trying or we super andy roadhouse all continued doing record attempts after the in-person meetup but eventually their attempts stopped in large part because 5-5 was such a demoralizing stage so throughout the rest of 2021 zack's time remained at the top of the leaderboard he went from not being able to set the record to holding the top spot for six months straight in early 2022 zach decided to come back to the game it had taken him hundreds of attempts and many months of grinding to set his world record and on top of that he hadn't seriously ran the category in half a year so expectations weren't too high when he started up runs again but instead of being the underdog like he was in 2021 this was the sack of 2022. last year it was a big deal when zach finally managed a world record this year he was unstoppable he wrote house cenor we super none of these guys could catch up by june he had taken his time down to 227.19 zach was using even more 1p2c than in previous runs 4-4 was now being done almost completely with two controllers but once again most of the time saved from these records was zach playing better tricks were being done faster and execution overall was improving improving to the point that nobody could catch him he was more than a minute ahead of second place but then after his 227 19 the world record stayed stagnant for over two months this was despite the fact that he lost 30 seconds for missing dooku skip in 2-6 and lost significant time in 5-1 as well community's goal was to achieve a 226 it seemed doable but zach was unable to and nobody else was particularly close the community was as active as ever but with no records being set a big opportunity was going to waste so in an attempt to get the game a new world record the community decided to organize one more big event it was going to be another four day break the record session but instead of the game's top four runners competing this time they expanded it to the top 10. 10 runners four days and a goal time of 226. even with this many runners nobody knew for sure if a new record would be set but one thing that wasn't in doubt was that there would be a lot of movement on the leaderboards zach and e roadhouse were in first and second place and they were the favorites to lower the record just behind them were baking soda and bricco still with decent odds to get the record and beyond them was a mix of prior record holders and newer contenders their personal bests range from zack's 227 down to a 233 but all of them knew that they had a serious chance to move up on the leaderboard let the world record attempts begin [music] zack any roadhouse may have been in the best positions to lower the record but fourth place runner bricco got the first good chance just hours into day one he had a run with the best possible time of 225.46 into episode 3. there was still a ways to go but it was easily on world record pace unfortunately a poor episode 3 cost them the record but he still got a 227-47 this was good enough for second place it was a big motivator for the rest of the group especially for the recently demoted to third place e roadhouse and toward the end of day one both he and zach found themselves on record pace in the 5-5 but dv2 would strike again you roadhouse finished with a 22825 and zach got a 227.45 zach's time was faster than every runner on the leaderboard except for his own record day one had come and gone and despite movement from some top runners no new records were set day two featured a couple pbs from runners in the top 10. we super got a 25 second pb cut and see normooth from fifth to fourth place but for most of the day none of the top runners got anything on a world record pace then late in the night after most runners were done for the day zach had a run with 227-11 potential into 5-5 but of course he still had to get dv2 and he actually did it first try this was the best chance of the event he had one tough trick to go door clip and unfortunately he couldn't get it he lost over 20 seconds and finished with a 227-38 the best time of the event so far but still no world record [music] day three featured several more promising runs from zach he achieved numerous 227s but none were low enough to beat the record there was a bit of movement from lower ranked runners as its jared moved from 10th to 8th place but as day three was coming to a close the record remained at zacks 2 27 19. time was starting to run out the game's top runners had gotten close but nobody had been able to break through but then toward the end of day three those runners would get a bit of extra motivation with all this attention on lego star wars speedruns a new strategy was found in the grievous fight before grief cheese could be used to get a quick kill but it was inconsistent as he would randomly block your shots but by switching your resolution to 800 by 600 instead of 1920x1080 the quick kill becomes much more consistent on average you save 10 to 15 seconds this wasn't an enormous time save but it was enough to give these runners a pretty big boost yet still day 3 came to a conclusion and no world records were set [music] 24 hours to go through the first three days neither zach nor erode house had said a pb but zach certainly had had the better chances of the two he set numerous 227s and with the new time save on grief cheese he was in position to get a record if he could just get there again but on the evening of day four it was a roadhouse who found himself ahead of the record after episode six after utilizing the new strategy and having a nice start to episode 5 he remained in the lead heading into 5-5 this was the level that caused zach to miss the record so many times in the last three days but he wrote house clutched it out he got a first try dv2 and entering 5-6 his best possible time was 226.40 erode house was one level away from getting a 226. he needed to get door clip and he did after wasting about 20 seconds the run was now teetering on the line of being a 226 or a 227. and in the end the run finished as a 227.03 it wasn't the 226 but it was a world record it had taken over three days but the world record had finally been achieved and interestingly at the exact same time zach was on a run in episode 3. entering 5-5 this run 2 had potential to get a 226. it was a chance to take the record right back but his final two levels weren't good enough he finished with a 22707 if he had set this time an hour earlier it would have been record but he was too late and with the event winding down it was shaping up to be a pretty disappointing few days for zach attempts for four days straight and not only was there no 226 but he had lost his world record in the process grunts continued on for the next couple hours but the event had a hard cutoff of 11 pm to get your last run started and as the last few seconds before the deadline ticked away zach was on the main menu maybe you shouldn't even bother starting another run he had done hundreds of attempts over the past few days and no 226 had come out of it once i'd lost record i was like okay i lost record i no longer have a streak of records it is what it is that's totally fine but i've really wanted to win btr and i didn't want to go out on the note that i had which was like multiple choked records in the event in previous days obviously i wanted the record back obviously wanted to win the event but getting the first 226 was still like the priority in my mind so with just eight seconds to go zach started his final run of the event and in doing so he joined six other runners who were in the middle of their own final runs and i was like this rut has to finish there is no world where i reset here because even if it doesn't pb i have to get through this run no matter what once i started that run i was like i know i can do it i didn't think i would but i knew i could during every cutscene i would be looking at the restream just seeing who was who was on a run and i saw that ginger was on a really good run and the reason i noticed this was only because i could hear the commentary and the commentary was just like losing their minds they were like i can't believe that ginger is like on this insane run right now and i was like this must be really good for how much the commentary is talking about it sure enough it was insane ginger was the game's seventh place runner with a personal best of 231.59 but with his back to the wall at the very end of the event he had somehow mustered a run on world record pace into episode 5. four minutes ahead of his pb ginger has this capability sometimes to just play insane he's an anomaly he can sometimes just pull something out that you've never like even thought was possible and i knew that it was it was actually a realistic possibility that he would get the record at even maybe the first 226 just with that run was this really happening the seventh place runner jumping straight to world record well ginger had an up and down last few levels and he finished with a 227-51 an enormous pb and definitely one to be proud of but it still wasn't the world record meanwhile while all eyes were on ginger zach had started off on an incredible run of his own so we typically talk about a good run as exiting we pay attention to our episode 4 exit that marks like around the halfway point in the run previously the best episode for exit was i think a 109-56 so getting a 109 episode 4 exit was something that had been done i think a total of three times ever and so what happened was i got another 109 and that is something that i wasn't even looking for you don't need a 109 for a 226 you don't even need a 109 for a 225 and that made me a little nervous but what happened next was just plain crazy on one of the game's greatest paces ever zach proceeded to play the best episode 6 ever performed now this was not only the fastest pace ever it was the fastest pace ever by over a minute zach was in position to demolish the world record he just had to hold it together for the final two episodes the run was pretty much insane it caught up bled a little bit of time in episode three until i got to the infamous library skip when i got there i prayed to the gods and those gods did not give me a first try library skip they did not give me a secretary library skip they did not even give me a 10th try library skip so i ended up losing around 55 seconds on that trick now at this point i was like okay this is fine now i wasn't happy it's only a minute now that might sound like an insane thing to say this was such an insane run that i could afford a minute time loss so i did lose a minute and everything was pretty much still in order i was still way ahead of the record and out of episode three going into episode five everything was was definitely still set up for me to to get a low 226 it was definitely still in the question but while zach was trying to navigate through episode 5 the other players were finishing up their runs and guess what ejp man pb by over a minute t fresh pb by' seconds we super pb by 40 seconds and all of this stuff is happening and i'm on this run and i'm like my mind cannot comprehend everything going on there's four people pving and so in my mind i'm like it's time to focus so i close the stream with all the other runners finishing all eyes were back on zach he made his way into 5-5 still ahead of the record by close to a minute when you're on pace this level is the killer i mean it's no question there isn't a level in the game that's even close to this hard and i get to db2 skip and i realize that my hands are shaking it's very hard to pause buffer while your hands are doing this the whole time so i have this this thing that i usually tell myself i'm like you could be nervous later but now you have to hit the trick i get the trick third try which is effectively my first actual attempt at the trick dv2 skip definitely i would say is a harder trick but db3 when the when the pressure is on when the nerves are setting in is just brutal so i miss it once and i'm like that's fine but when i miss it twice that's when i start to get a little concerned i think i missed it six times before i finally got it and at that point i was like oh this is gonna be close the best been opening cutscene is over a minute long and i think that is interesting you get almost two minutes to sit there and and be ready you know to prepare the whole time i was not preparing i was sitting there shaking being nervous out of my mind and my heart was beating super fast i could not stop thinking about what was gonna happen i kept telling myself you can do this you can do this you can do this and i don't think it was helping the toughest trick in 5-6 is door clip it was a trick that killed many runs over the years but this run was perhaps more important than any before zach made his way through 5-6 and miraculously he got door clip right away this was it he had some leeway and as he entered the last room of the run he was in position to get a massive record so enter the end platform and i look at my timer and i'm like i can probably do this so i get there and i'm killing the i'm killing the stormtroopers and it's going a lot worse than it usually does i should have absolutely been cementing like a low 226 5x here and i was actually starting to lose a lot more time than i thought and i took a very bad death i killed no storm troopers that just died which is just a flat two seconds and i was like okay now i'm cutting it really close so i killed the last guy i look at it and i literally just say please please please my god please i didn't know what to do to do besides just pray i hit the door i looked at the timer 2 26 59.7 i was at first in disbelief for about half a second and then i lost my mind i could not believe it i was just so proud of myself to finally get the 226 the amount of emotions running through me were just unbelievable i couldn't believe it [music] the 226 was incredible the culmination of zacks and others efforts since the start of the year but it wasn't the end of the road for lego star wars speedruns there was still room for improvement as a lot of time was bled in episodes three and five so even in the few months after the event there's been a lot of record improvements just a few days after the event ended zach lowered the record by another 21 seconds largely from cleaning up the final two episodes he'd then lowered the record down to the world's first 225. thanks in part to a new strategy in 5-4 by ejp man meanwhile both e roadhouse and ginger legend were getting close he wrote house had a couple runs that barely missed record due to a missed skip and ginger legend had taken his pb down to a mid-226 of those three runners zach would have the most success in the following few weeks ultimately lowering the record to the first 224 but that's not who holds the record today that honor goes to a roadhouse a 224-43 this record featured a fairly slow first four episodes but had the strongest final two episodes ever in a run that's where the world record stands today to most lego star wars is a game that you played 10 years ago for fun then never touched again it was a neat distraction and a source of nostalgia but in the end lego star wars was a game of the past but to this dedicated group of speedrunners this game is so much more than that they've been able to extract thousands of hours of enjoyment creating rivalries and friendships that have lasted years they've given the game a renewed boost of popularity years after its heyday and over the course of a decade this is how they've lowered its world record thanks for watching [music] if you enjoyed the video please consider subscribing it really helps me out thanks [music]
