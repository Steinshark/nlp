hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to continue to talk about why the king segrera has no transmission and we're going to be correcting some of the bad math that was in my previous video now if you haven't yet watched that previous video it's helpful to understanding what's going on in this video but ultimately what we were trying to calculated in that last video was will this car be able to spin its tires at 160 mph now why would you want to calculate that why does that tell you whether or not it needs a transmission well if you can spin the tires all the way up to 160 mph that means you can apply the maximum force to the ground up to 160 mph so any more aggressive gearing that you were use if you were to choose to use higher gear ratios and have a transmission would provide you absolutely no benefit because you're not able to put down any more wheel torque so looking at this what i focused on last time i added in air resistance and that's inaccurate to do basically all you need to look at is the tire itself what is the normal force on it what is the weight pressing down on that tire the ground pushing back up and what is the force the that this maximum force that this tire can apply so that's dependent on the coefficient of friction between the tire and the ground and the normal force the force pressing from the ground back up onto the vehicle or the total amount of weight that you have pressing down on that tire now we're looking at both rear tires as one single unit we're just looking at an axle here so the rear axle of the coning segrera so in calculating what this normal force is we're multiplying the coefficient of friction times the normal force that's one .1 we're using a very aggressive super sticky tire so we're just assuming it has a coefficient of friction of 1.1 and then we need to calculate the normal force now the normal force is made up of four things as far as i am concerned the weight the down force the load transfer and the load transfer due to drag so working through each one of these individually we're assuming that the kig segregar has a 640 rear to front weight distribution as a result 1628 kg is how much it multiply that by gravity 9.81 m/s squared multiply that by the percentage on the rear axle that's what we're analyzing which is 60% that gives us 9,582 newtons now moving on to downforce kig seg on their website quotes that this vehicle produces 450 kg of downforce at 250 km per hour now at 160 mph we're actually at about 258 km hour so this is a little bit off but it's close enough that we can use it in this calculation and it's the only stat that they provide so 450 kg multiplied by 9.81 multiplied by 60% now this is assuming that the center of pressure from that aerodynamic downforce is located exactly above the center of gravity if the center of pressure would to be towards the front you're going to have less of an effect loading up that rear tire and if it were to be closer to the rear you're going to have more of an effect of loading up that rear tire so that percentage is just where that center of pressure is as a percentage we're going to say 60% of it falls onto the rear wheels just like the center of gravity does and that's just going to be our basic assumption you could choose to move it either direction and play with it but typically for a well balanced car you want the center of pressure to be over the center of gravity so that gives us 450 * 9.81 * 6 2,649 newtons next we want to look at load transfer for the rear wheels and so if we are accelerating the load transfer on the rear tire is going to be masstimes acceleration times the height of the center of gravity divided by the wheelbase now we're assuming that we're not accelerating we're just staying stationary at 160 mph and we're about to slam the throttle and give it all the acceleration it's got and so in this case our acceleration is going to be zero so we're going to ignore load transfer for that moment also for number four now this is something slightly unique but you would have load transfer as a result of drag and so you're going to have this air that's you know resisting the motion of the vehicle and it's can transfer some of that load to the rear now if the center of pressure is in line with the center of gravity then you're not going to have any load transfer occur if the center of pressure were way above it let's say you had a big sign sticking out on top of the car for some reason maybe you wanted to advertise anyways you're blowing on that sign that sign's going to transfer some of that load to the rear tire now this effect is going to be very minimal and like i said we're just going to assume the center of pressure is in line with the center of gravity and as a result we're not going to have any load transfer as a result of drag so we're just looking at weight and down force now going back to our original equation f = mu * n 1.1 * the addition of 9582 plus 2649 that gives us 12231 newtons we multiply that by 1.1 that gives us 13,45 4 newtons okay so now we know that our tires from the previous video can apply at 160 mph 9,545 newtons just from the engine alone so we're going to take 9545 divide that by 13454 and that is going to give us 71% now this number in the previous video was 72% and that was using incorrect math the reason these numbers are so close is because the amount of down force that the vehicle produces is very similar to the amount of drag force against this vehicle so that's why the numbers came out the way they did somewhat coincidental and not really you know the the previous video was bad math this is better math so if we're assuming the engine can produce 71% of the torque needed in order to spin the rear tires at 160 mph the electric motors produce 900 newon m they won't produce all of that because they'll be spinning fairly quickly once we get to this high speed but if we assume that they can add an additional 29% torque to the wheels which they should be able to do considering they make about 40 some per of the total torque for the vehicle then it would be able to spin the tires as the previous video comes to the same conclusion now a few comments about this overall process we are assuming that the torque converter that the kic segrera is using is locked which it absolutely will be at 160 mph but if they were to have if they were to unlock that clutch in the torque converter and allow it to slip and spin up faster than the 5300 rpm which it's spinning at while it's at 160 mph then it would indeed be able to multiply that torque even further and produce a greater engine torque number than this which we've calculated right here and so you know it would be even easier for it to spin the tires the other thing is load transfer is going to occur this is kind of assuming you're going to have this shock load where you immediately throw all of the torque from the engine and the electric motors to the rear wheel while you're not accelerating and so what would actually happen is as you press onto that gas pedal you're going to build load onto your rear tires that's going to cause the amount of the load that you can accelerate with to be greater and as a result you're probably not going to spin the tires because you're going to have a significant amount more load on that rear tire so it's going to be able to accelerate more quickly now why does this vehicle have the ability to spin tires at such a high speed versus other vehicles well most vehicles have less power and as a result in order to get up to higher speeds they have to use gearing and through using that gearing every higher gear you go to you're reducing your wheel torque and so as you reduce your wheel torque you're much less likely to spin the rear tires and so most cars out there do not have the power to spin the tires up in those taller gears whereas this just has a single gear and it has an absurd amount of power and as a result it can spin those rear tires at a super high speed and because it can do that you gain no advantage of having gears more aggressive than that and so there's no need for transmission it's much more efficient to just have that single gear let the electric motors do the work at low end and then bring the engine on once you get into the higher speeds and you have this super quick super awesome vehicle so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
