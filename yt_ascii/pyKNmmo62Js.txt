ladies and gentlemen historically the game of chess has been associated closely with intelligence with a regal status with an elevated sense of self but in modern times currently 2023 chess has taken on a very twisted demented and perverted type and in today's video i'm going to be showing you hikaru nakamura's chess match that he played a couple of days ago against yuyangi one of the strongest chess players out of china this was the first round of the speed chess championship which is a 16 player knockout tournament on chess.com where hikaru played every possible first move with his pawns yes even the terrible ones he played the alphabet gambit against a top 20 grand master in the world and i'm going to show you how he did this is one of the most distant my life okay and you are probably going to be seeing the exact same thing that i do before we get into the games today no sponsor but just for today and tomorrow 48 hours probably about 40 hours remaining you can pre-order my book for 25 off from barnes and noble if you're in the us link is in the description use the code i think it's pre-order25 get this beauty 14 000 pre-orders already if we hit 1 000 more pre-orders it drops as a bestseller which is nuts so thank you all so much now you can pre-order it a little 25 off for you for the next two days and yeah and let me tell you what you're going to see in this video is not covered in my book this is vile so the speed chess championship is played with five minute games it's played with three minute games it's played with one minute games there is a timer and and you have to play you know you gotta play with it with a clock counting down so hikaru starts us off with a3 now a3 is a mild meme it's not that bad of a move okay because white can very easily just play knight f3 e3 d4 just play a normal opening but you know the move a3 is included and there's ways to expand on the queen side and actually justify this move now granted you're playing a top 20 player he's 3100 like this is probably not something that you should be doing and kikaru does exactly that he he justifies his he justifies his a3 he plays you know like b4 c4 and you know he's not worse right like from from the early stage the position is equal okay but you know the players develop hikaru trades knights plays b5 tries to take a little bit of space away from you yankee puts his knight on c6 makes a big exchange the knight gets out of danger and we have a middle game with queens rooks bishop versus knight and now hikaru plays king to e2 he cannot castle because his pawn is hanging he could move his pawn but it's nice he plays a mini bomb cloud in the middle of a game it's obviously not a bad move he then plays d3 but okay you yankee obviously is doing very very well he's just down a little bit on time and hikaru you know plays nice and solidly black could of course play the move queen h3 i don't really know what he didn't like about this move i mean he can't really take the pawn like if this then there is rook h1 but it still kind of looked nice but in any case hikaru just bleeds the clock bleeds the clock bleeds the clock shuffles a little bit puts his king to safety and yuyan kiju slowly gets you know to about 30 seconds and and chess is gonna be very tough to play when you have 30 seconds now kikaru takes a lot of space away but there's still nowhere to break through hikaru's trying right he's gonna play for but yankees got a fortress here he's got a fortress hikaru poking gets into a rook end game now some signs of potentially having an advantage he has an active king everything is good f6 hikaru plays rook c1 now at some point this is the big moment right it's a scramble 15 seconds per player hikaru plays f4 d4 f5 check and hikaru gets rook g3 and that's it because now he's gonna get this and this you yankee with 15 seconds on the clock incorrectly simplifies the rook end game and obviously this has absolutely nothing to do with the opening that was played but hikaru achieves a completely winning position and wins the first game by playing the move 1a3 and you would think well that's where he stopped i mean he played a3 that's a very reasonable first move he's been doing that against magnus you know they're bad influences for each other like you know your kid starts hanging out with bad influences but they're not like super bad influences you know they they do some bad things but not like super terrible things and then in the next game hikaru i mean and you know what you know what it's black he ck he like he he was he was playing a5 on the first move like that's crazy to play a5 on the first move at this level is unheard of okay so he plays a4 with white i mean i mean this is what are we even doing here so what happens next then he just plays b for like he he's just like a4 is not a losing move but he's playing a top 20 player in the world he's just he's just literally playing an alphabet game but i mean it's now obviously you know he's he's gonna get punished for it at some point you know the guy takes the whole center and then you yankee's doing everything right plays h6 good move hikaru undevelops so he applies more pressure and he's gonna try to expand over here that's exactly what he does he plays b5 and c4 and suddenly his goofy alphabet gambit is paying off because he's got very meaningful pressure on that side of the board knight c3 this should be two rook c1 why not let's go on all sides g4 he's just pushing all the pawns now you yankee shuts down the center hikaru trades away the bishop and yuyangi plays e4 just absolutely bulldozing down the center of the board hikaru has gotten himself into a into into a bad spot right he's got himself into a bad spot by the way this is called the potato variation the potato knight f3 and a4 it's called the potato i i might make a separate video on this entirely it's literally called the potato variation i i don't know why it's called the potato variation please do not ask me why it's called the potato variation i will not be able to answer so hikaru is under some pressure but you know he's the god of defense so let's see if he's able to i mean look at his knight though i mean it's just unable to and he's doing his best but yu yang yi has had enough of this he infiltrates with the knight the queen is very powerful the knight is dancing into f2 hikaru now has to try to create complications but he loses his rook rook takes d4 you're yankee not having any of it he's like all right look you want to play stupid openings i'll be here all day i will collect my points as they come the game turns into a ridiculous scramble but hikaru plays rook d3 which i suppose i i guess was a mouse slip because otherwise it doesn't make much sense maybe he anticipated something else oh he probably meant to give a check that's probably what he meant to do and then maybe go here but he goes here and well well that's losing and also this is losing so hikaru loses the game and the craziest thing is hikaru ran out of time here and rookie three was actually saving the day because this is hit and if you play rook takes g4 i i can actually go here here and promote which is anyway you think all right hikaru played a4 he had he had fun no he just kept moving down the board he played b3 i couldn't find if he played the polish i don't think he played the polish i didn't see it but he played c3 yep he played a3a4 b3 i don't know about b4 c3 c4 d3 d4 e3 e4 f3 f4 g3 g4 and i think those were the only games he had he he ran out of time to play the other moves like he didn't have a moment to it it's it's so absurd so the way he played c3 is he basically played a reverse karo khan which is kind of fascinating look e4 c6 d4 d5 so it's kind of like black is is white is playing black but has an extra move so it's kind of like a better karo khan and now it's in exchange karo khan it's just and now he plays f3 to try to play e4 which is which is so goofy which is just so utterly goofy like why did he not put his knight here he has children watching him play and this man is playing f3 and then he plays e4 he's not fully developed he like and and you yankee by the way to his credit strikes the center because the guy's king is in the center and he's two moves away from getting castled so if he plays knight to e2 you can chop and then you can shop and by the time he's ready to castle you're hitting him here and you're hitting him here and here and here and on the d file with the rook or the e file right that's what happens in this game take take hikaru's upon up but knight a6 something's coming here something's coming here something's coming here something's coming here something's coming here it's a very bad position all right this is kind of what you get for playing like this knight to b4 yu yangi swarming with his pieces but hikaru is one of the best defenders in the world hikaru might be the best defender in the world okay bishop e5 knight d4 yuyenge coming in bulldozing his way queen b6 hikaru cocooning and now here's the moment it's a it's a very tense moment everything is staring at everything else what is going to happen you yankee decides i'm bulldozing and i'm grabbing the rook okay wonderful he's up in exchange hikaru has the two bishops though kicks out the knight and plays knight f5 hits the queen here but suddenly queen c3 the knight is hanging that's mate yuyangi decides to sacrifice his queen and he did not have to do this he could have just moved his queen and then he would have just been up a comic exchanger would have still created some attack of course it would have been very unpleasant but plays like this and suddenly hikaru is just up a queen i mean just like nothing i mean his position was not so great like nothing rookie won that's the way the way you convert against two rooks especially when you have a queen on the board is you have to remove some pieces four pieces can fight against the queen three pieces likely cannot so you you leave black with one rook you bring your king to seal off the entrance into the position and now look at this b4 b5 queen infiltrates queen grabs a pawn queen is gonna grab a second pawn too and the this this is just unsustainable queen d8 check bishop takes b3 yu yengi resigns because after this hikaru would just play queen takes d2 it doesn't have to do this but this is a winning end game because you just promote this man really played c3 this man really played c3 g3 got himself into a slightly tense position a little bit tough but of course 30 seconds on the clock and he gets the job done now you you will realize he has to play real openings too the english is no joke right like this is one of you know he's gonna play c4 d4 and e4 okay he plays in english plays a relatively normal english too he plays d4 plays knight e2 which is a slight sideline puts an i don't have four it's kind of like a nimso-ish position that means nothing to you just pretend like you know what i'm talking about like you know i'm gonna mention some openings you're gonna go oh yes of goals this reminds me of samish nims 28 in groningen is that's what that's what chess players sound like oh yes i think i had this game in 2017. at the netherlands championship in the fourth round if i'm not mistaken his his and it was a very complicated game but i managed to prevail is anyway that that's that's what chess players sound like pawn to c5 from yuyengi and then he plays d4 as well and he just bulldozes the position leaving hikaru without the right to castle takes the knight and then plays rook d8 and hikaru is losing in 15 moves like i don't even know what happened i think you know he probably should have castled because this was already very provocative this was extra provocative and then he just moved his king out of the way but his knight got stranded on the edge of the board which made it very difficult to defend both the knight and the c5 pawn and somehow here black is just swarming hikaru plays queen c2 takes and in this position probably should go b4 but it's still very complex after queen a5 and queen a6 and queen e6 but please hear and just just rook d2 ends the game on the spot because it hits the queen and hits' moves for so the second kikaru played a real opening he lost in' moves it was just one of those days all right it was one of those days he couldn't play a serious opening even in this opening i wouldn't call this really serious 92 is not a real thing okay it's not a real thing nobody on planet earth plays 92 in this position you play knight e2 against the nimso indian for example e6 knight c3 bishop b4 castles d5 like this it looks slightly similar but you know there's no need to go here why are you going here anyway he tried to play a real opening it you know it didn't exactly work so so he he went back to goofing off he had a few games he played d3 d4 e3 e4 he never played a bomb cloud and and it's completely ridiculous because he literally and when i say literally i mean literally played every first move he could until his time expired i mean every single first move we are going to look at all of these games the fact that he can do this against the player who is top 20 in the world is bogus like it just doesn't make any sense and you know some chess purists are going to watch this and go well he would never do that in a 90-minute tournament he would never do that in the candidates yeah i i'm aware what point are you trying to make i don't chess can be played in different formats right so in blitz he's unstoppable in speed chess he's a number one number two punch with magnus nobody else is better f4 he plays now let's just get one thing straight the bird is not a bad opening it i mean it it really is not like if you know what you're doing and you can play there's you get a nice big space advantage life is pretty good and that's exactly what hikar does now we're in the bullet segment so you yankee's got to play for a win he plays h5 very aggressive stuff it would be a huge mistake for white to do this because that would leave a gaping hole on g4 so instead of that hikaru plays h3 which does not leave that hole and then if h4 he'll probably go g4 because taking doubles your pawns and is a little bit ugly and this there's e5 and rook h4 and knight h5 could be a little dangerous so whoops spoiler no you can't replace h3 knight d2 and just takes the center locks the position and now is like well you yanks he's got to beat me because i'm up in the match so go ahead g6 take take queen e2 long castles you yang yi plays a great opening position looks incredible puts his king on b8 makes every everything is good and now what right hikaru's played this completely absurd position where really none of black's pieces have any entrance points like they can't really do anything so union gigi goes here and then plays g5 which makes a lot of sense hikaru plays knight e1 like come and get me and let's say sorry you want to go to a4 just a4 just come completely unconcerned you want to attack let's go let's go you gotta attack me i know 97 that you oh look at you transferring all of these pieces to the side of the board what about this pun that pawn just fell kikaru's played 20 moves and hasn't lost any time they get one second bonus every move but he has literally spent no time bishop e7 gets rid of the knights so one of the aggressive pieces is gone and now this man hikaru plays h4 in one second now many people here would play moves like rook d1 which would blunder the a4 pawn alright also with blunder bishop c4 removing the defense of the rook which i didn't even realize so there you go a lot of people would transfer the knight to these points hikaru is like i don't want him to go here i want to do this because that's going to get him to bait a sacrifice and that's a massive commitment so he plays queen e7 setting up the sacrifice hikaru plays knight a5 and b5 and he is tempting yuyangi into sacrificing a piece which he does and now it's like killer be killed i'm okay carlos a piece up you yankees got 29 seconds to figure this out he takes plays knight f4 he's doing everything right meanwhile hikaru is just drilling away on that side of the board hikaru is saying you can't mate me you can't mate me look at this knight he ate kicks out the queen rook a2 defending now apparently here hikaru hung his rook in one move we're just gonna conveniently avoid that because it doesn't serve my narrative of hikaru winning with a bird [music] it's bullet you yankee went here 23 seconds on the clock 24 for white anyway this happens and hikaru plays queen b5 because taking this is not made and that is so queen c6 a7 and hikaru just hunts down the black pieces and knight e7 forks this and this and you yankee's time runs out he is already very tough to defend himself and kikaru just kept going just g4 i mean plays the grob which is statistically the worst possible first move for white but obviously it's very very goofy you yankee plays in a principled way tikaru plays h6 giving back the pawn and and please just plays king f1 just king f1 and you know knight h5 and we have the following position where hikaru has a very big center but he is a pawn down yuyengi however playing very well putting everything on the right squares trying to punish hikaru knight g3 check aru grabs the rook as well knight takes f2 on the way out and now a massive skirmish here the best move here for white was queen h5 creating various threats on the back rank but hikaru plays queen f3 and after knight takes h3 he's in some trouble because he can't take this can't take that so king h2 and when the dust settles he is just down a piece so you can't win them all when you play goofy openings but you know the craziest thing is he was completely fine after this big skirmish it was just you know it's bullet things happen he had to find this that move obviously stops knight h3 was a very very tough spot but he spent 2.9 seconds on the move and made a mistake and yeah uniongi is now just a clean piece up which actually is very impossible to win back because there's this so in g3 you yankee sacrifices some material but is just up a bit too much a bit too much is four pawns in this case hikaru still does his best and even though the bishops are on the opposite color yu yengi is running running and will probably convert this game but it took him a very long time and kikaru kept us going for a while yengi finally got this and yeah the rook just cannot stop four pawns three and a half that doesn't really count and here's a game where hikaru played pawn to f3 and this is what we will end our video on because it was just it was it was i mean i mean this is just this this is crazy like the fact that you can play like this against like i said people who are you know i'm gonna look this up i'm gonna go to 2700 chess.com you know you yankee is the number 24 ranked player in the world he is 10 points removed from number'. there is a bunch of players who are about five six points higher than him at his peak he was like he is an exceptional player but in speed chess there is nobody that compares to i mean like look the fact that you can just do this give such a handicap in the open like what is this i mean this is crazy you know i make all these tutorials for beginners intermediate players how are you supposed to play chess when you can watch one of the best players in the world do this to another one that's also a great player he's not the best in the world but he's in the best 20 you know what i mean like you yankee's he's 30 60 30 70 in blitzenberg he would kill me it wouldn't even be close all right and hikaru is just pushing all his pawns and castling and trading bishops and now yuangi is striking back with g5 and again he's doing everything right right he's doing everything that he's supposed to do we've seen him get good positions because he's getting such you know such ridiculous handicaps from hikaru in the opening rook g8 h4h3 all these big attacks knight g4 is coming in like knight f3 and and look at the cannons pointed at hikaru's position takes on f2 which might have been a bit rushed he probably should have pushed his age pawn bishop g4 h4 h3 i mean the position is just but now look at this look at what hikaru has done his king is safe his bishop is behind his king and that bishop is going to be counter-attacking you yankee probably feels a bit frustrated here trans versus queen to a point of attack but now knight g5 where is the attack and now rook g1 is coming and b4 a4 b5 white is about to launch a counter attack with this bishop that's protecting the king and he's staring down the opposite side of the board how does hikaru do these things how does he contort himself so well and then just get to a situation like this and look you yankee plays f6 and suddenly the knight gets in and and you genghis is catastrophically losing material here he's not going to be able to attack hikaru removes the knight from the board opening up the king take take the attack is gone pawn takes f6 rook f8 rookie five you yankee resigns he can't defend the bishop he moves away i take he goes hiruchi five resigns hikaru won this match 19-9 he played a3 a4 b3 c3 c4 d3 e3 d4 e4 f3 f4 g3 g4 and with the black pieces this man played a5 in apparently nine games what can somebody can somebody explain to me how this is possible you can't because you're watching this video on demand we don't interact with each other sometimes i pin some of your comments because they're very offensive and we all have a laugh about that sometimes i respond to comments speaking of comments this will be in the description pre-order it for 25 off if you watch this on september 7th or 8 2023 we use the code pre-order 25. how does this man play like this and win these matches against people who have dedicated 30 years of life to chess it's utterly absurd that just get just go go away get out of here
