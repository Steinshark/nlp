this started when my friend marc lebrun, who lives in california, he's a computer scientist. he likes to consider unusual ways of doing arithmetic, and he came up with this idea. you know that in school, children have a lot of trouble when they learn arithmetic. there's all this trouble with the carrys; it's very complicated. so he said, let- let's make it simple for the kiddies. we're not gonna have any carrys. we're gonna abolish all carrys. we're gonna change the rules, a bit. now when you add two digits, two numbers like 7 and 8, the result is not 15 anymore. on the moon, it's 8. you pick the bigger of the two numbers. so 1 plus 1 is 1, sure. 1 + 2 is 2. when you multiply, you pick the smaller. so 1 times 2 is 1. alright, and that's it. those are the rules, that's lunar arithmetic. (brady: so 3 times 8 is 3?) 3 times 8 is 3. 3 plus 8 is 8, you take the bigger of the two. (brady: i hope they didn't actually use this on the moon.) maybe they didn't, maybe they will in future. (brady: okay, i understand the rules, i'm a bit worried) (about what's gonna happen here, but-) let's do some arithmetic. let's do an addition, for example. suppose we wanted to add, say, 58 and 19. what you do is you say, 8 plus 9 is 9. remember, you take the bigger of the two. and there are no carrys, 8 plus 9 is 9, 1 plus 5 is 5. you take the bigger of the two, bigger of 1 and 5 is 5. the biggest of 9 and 8 is 9. so 58 plus 19 is equal to 59. that's lunar addition. what about multiplication? suppose we want to multiply, say, 17 by 24. remember, digit by digit. so four sevens are? (brady: 4)
- 4, very good. you pick the smaller. four 1s are 1. and now two 7s. two 7s are 2, two 1s are 1. and now we add them up. 1, 1 plus 2 is 2 - you pick the bigger of the two. and you bring down the 4. so 17 times 24 is equal to 124 on the moon. so now you can do a lot of arithmetic in lunar arithmetic, and you can produce a lot of interesting number sequences. [apollo mission recording snippets] what are the squares in lunar arithmetic? what's 1 times 1? it's 1. 2 times 2 is equal to - pick the smaller - it's 2. 3 times 3, 3 squared, is 3. 6 squared is 6, 7 squared is 7, 8 squared is 8, 9 squared is 9 - what about 10 squared? 10 times 10 - we have to do it. zero times zero, you pick the smaller. 0 times 1 is 0. 1 times 0 is 0, 1 times 1 is 1, you add them up. 1, 0, plus 0 - pick the bigger - and we get 100, just like back on earth! but what about 11 squared? well we have to do it. 1 1 times 1 1, we get 1 1, 1 1 - add them up. 1, 1 plus 1 is 1, 1. so 11 squared is 1 1 1 - 111. 12 squared: 2 times 2 is is 2, 2 times 1 is 1, 1 times 2 is 1. 1 times 1 is 1 - always pick the smaller. and we add them up 1, 1 plus 1 is 1, 2 is 2; so 12 squared is 112. and so on. 19 squared is 119, and so on. so that's the sequence of lunar squares. [apollo mission recordings] if you are interested in the formal details, this is an associative, commutative, distributive law - so it works. we don't have subtraction, we don't have division, but apart from that we can do anything. what i would like to tell you about next are the lunar primes. what are the prime numbers on the moon? you're really gonna like this - and i need more paper. (brady: i'll get you some) what are the lunar primes? well what is a prime? first of all we have to decide what it means for a number to be a prime. now you remember back on earth, 7 was a prime because you couldn't write 7 as 2 times 3, or anything except 1 times 7. if the only way to factorise it is as 1 times itself then it's a prime number. on the moon is 7 a prime, on the moon? well, notice 7 is equal to 8 times 7, right? because 8 times 7 - you pick the smaller of the two, which is 7. so 7 is 8 times 7, so 7 is not a prime! because it has a factorisation. but really before we get down to the details of this, we have to decide what precisely it means to be a prime. so formerly a number's a prime if the only factorisation is 1 times itself. what does 1 mean on the moon? we have to say what is 1 - if i put it in quotes - on the moon? well what is 1? 1 has the property that if you multiply anything by 1 you get what you started with. 1 times 3 is 3, 1 times 111 is 111, right. on the moon that's not true. 1 times 3 on the moon is not 3, it's 1. 1 times; well 1 times 111 happens to be 111 by accident. 1 on the moon - 1 times anything is basically all 1s and zeros. 1 times 30 is ten, because you go through a digit by digit and pick the smaller. so 1 on the moon is not 1. what is 1 on the moon? would you care to make a guess? what's the number? 
- (brady: is it-) (i haven't thought about it, is it 9?)
- it's 9! very good. fantastic, brilliant. because when you multiply something by 9, it just copies what it sees. 9 times 7 is 7, 9 times 1 is 1 - it just copies what it sees. so on the moon 9 is the 1. so on the moon a prime number has the property that the only way you can factorise it is 9 times itself. so 7 is obviously not a prime, because seven is equal to 8 times 7. what about 8? 8 is not a prime because 8 is equal to 8 times 8, so it's not a prime. it has a factorisation in which one of the fact- neither factor is 9. any number if- for it to be a prime the biggest digit has to be a 9. so 25 is not a prime because we could multiply it by 5 and get what we started with. so we've gotta have a 9 in the number. so 19 is the smallest. we must have a 9. (brady: there's no way to build) (19 except, what, 19-)
- times 9. 
- (right)
- you can't factorise because it's got a 9 in it. so if, if it was', we can multiply' by an 8 and get'. we'd have a factorisation. so you can always multiply by the biggest digit and get what you started with. so the big- biggest digit had better be 9. 
(brady: these primes are going to be rare then?)
- yes, but not all that rare. so yeah how rare are they? well, let's look at the prime numbers. so what about 9 itself? so  back on earth we don't say 1 is a prime, because it's - we wouldn't have unique factorisation. 2 is the smallest prime on earth. but on the moon, just as 1 isn't a prime on on earth, 9 isn't a prime. but apart from that we get 19. so the primes, the lunar primes, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 90 is a prime, 91. as long as there's a 9 and there's no obvious way to factorise it; you have to check that 90 is a prime. we can't get 90 by multiplying two numbers. you have to check it, but it's true. it's easy to check. 99, we get 109, yes, that's a prime. but 119 is not because, as we saw a moment ago, 19 times 19 is 119. so 119 is not a prime. but roughly speaking most members that have a 9 in them are primes. so those are the lunar primes. if we were to go to the oeis and we, in the search window we type lunar primes - we used to call them dismal primes because teaching of arithmetic in schools were so dismal. it's a dismal definition, i think we like lunar primes much better. so, well, i can show you the graph - or two graphs. one of the first 200 terms, technically it's called a pin plot because we draw little pins. you don't see the pins there because they're quite dense. then you get a scatterplot, just a plain graph of however many terms we have, and it looks like we're getting about; what is it, 2500 terms. there's one more thing i would like to show you. i'd like to prove that they're infinitely many primes. you remember-
- (brady: lunar primes?) infinitely many lunar primes! first of all i'll prove that 109 is prime. and the proof of that is: suppose it wasn't, it would have to be the product of two two-digit numbers. they would have to be two digit numbers because of the rules. so it would have to be ab times cd. but we've got to get a one at the beginning. so one of a and c, remember how it works, the table - the multiplication, the tableau. if you get 1 at the beginning either a or c has to be a 1. and to get a 9 at the end, both b and d have to be 9s. that's the other, only possibility because when we do the multiplication 9 times 9 is 9. 9 times 1, well, that's, that's 1 - pick the smaller of the two. okay, now we do the c. c times 9 is, well, it's c. whatever c is. multiplying it by 9 doesn't change it. and c times 1, well c can't be 0 so it's gonna be 1. now we add them up and we get 1, 1 plus c. i don't know what it is. it's the bigger of 1 and c. well, it's gonna be c. it could be 1 - anyway what we get is the number 1c9. but c can't be 0, because if c was 0 we wouldn't get the 1 in front. so this can't happen. this is a contradiction. if c was equal to 0 we wouldn't get the 1 in front. we cannot factorise 109 as a product of two primes. and then, likewise, 1 0 0 0 0 9 is prime by the same argument. there are infinitely many primes. (brady: yeah, no matter how many, you can put as many zeros there as you want?)
- as many zeros as you want and you get a prime. (brady: nice proof!)
- yeah. yeah. nice theorem. lunar primes, lunar arithmetic. [apollo mission] ok neil we can see you coming down the ladder now [preview] ...are the ones that the mathematicians like. these are the primes, or numbers that are related to primes, and they are - they are elevated above the ordinary numbers.
