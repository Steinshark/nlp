all right hey hi hi this is one of the first times i've ever done a really large crowd they actually are tracking me with the camera oh there they go they're track me i fake him out for a little bit this is unusual to have chat live sorry i'm sure i've banned at least half of you for my chat i i really like you guys but i just can't help it it feels too good to ban people all right so we're going to do something kind of weird sorry sir i have something for you oh you have something for me what do you got oh woo oh dang i have to get rid of the turo hoodie okay okay oh more turo how strange is that all right i'll put this on do you have anything else yeah oh we have more [applause] is it [applause] brazil it's like my most favorite thing about brazil is if you just say this word this photo will get linked 9,000 times on twitter so i'm very happy that this is not a sponsor but you could imagine you could sponsor us right now for the low cost i'm not a hat person but i i appreciate the blue hat thank you okay so the plan again is that we are going to go on here and we're going to talk about some tech things and i'm going to have some strong opinions and you guys are going to have strong opinions and my opinions are technically better than yours but i am willing to listen to yours sometimes or i will actually ban you it is the the two options here okay who who here doesn't have a github you're lying to me i know you do you work at turo all right anyway so this is what your github says about you do you think that if i were to look at your github would i be able to tell what kind of person you are could i tell you're js andy no yes or no you can't give me two answers i want one answer no okay okay you read the title you know the drill toxic bullying in the form of memes github has amazing have you guys ever watched any of his videos before i have been more emot i didn't realize that it's des censoring hentai with deep neural networks but it was i didn't see that one i didn't see that one coming due to the des censoring but i have never been more emotionally abused by anybody in my entire lifetime than other than this person right here a big box wi he just somehow knows exactly how to make me feel bad about everything i do so i'm very excited about this i think we may need do we need to turn it up just a touch right yeah can you guys hear this software but today we're talking about the people behind the software and we better to start than the noob no who's a noob who is it okay we got some hands all right who's lying to themselves come on there should be more hands right now repos no code committed why because they can't tell the difference between get github and get back can the liars now raise your hands can can anyone tell me that difference no okay just this is what happens when you confuse programming with watching ud demi tutorials what do you mean developer environment bro do you see what i'm saying that he's always trying to get me okay you make one face on the internet oh i just code on free code cam i need github so i can do open source you either die a noob or live long enough to become the junior devb life story in the read me cont you know when i first became a junior dev my first kind of like programming experience i of course much like all junior devs believed i knew every possible answer and i rewrote very many things in a database that should not have been rewritten in production but you know the the good news is is that we couldn't really fix it but i was new so i was like it's not my fault i didn't know what i why would you give me access right like why would you do that that is just ridiculous anyways yeah that's why i now use turo cuz i can't manage a database personally to save my life graph updating read me repos consist of projects from youtube that don't actually work or have finished courses the loi is on the soy latte is made the motivational reddit post is written leak code is grinded another job rejection email received the young junior again see the emotional bruising i i don't know about this guy who here grinds le code daily daily we only got one two really 3 four semide decent well i don't what does that even mean like a weekly who said that advent to code now that's a proper way to do it if you guys don't know if you guys have never done it does it who here knows what advent of code is again who's lying i know there has to be more of you no okay advent of code is like a a really great way to actually up level i know this is this is mostly joking but i'm being serious now it's serious time okay it's serious prime is that it's actually one of the best ways to actually get good at stuff cuz you're not just solving really simple ones they get progressively harder and they actually give you like a nice ramp and sometimes it's like a continuation of a problem that gets harder and harder and it does it every single time during christmas time so you can wake up and enjoy the christmas season with spending six hours on a very frustrating problem and then go yell at your family cuz you're so angry about what you just got done doing with your life and then you get to choose a language that you've always wanted to choose like ph php and you get to finally live that life of enjoying php your dev eventually evolves into the javascript enjoyer the javascript who is it who's the javascript enjoyer all right we got a lot of javascript enjoyers you know i got the l i had the fortunate chance to start javascript before they decided to improve javascript and so jquery was my main tool of choice you know how many people j queried oh what but you guys are all so young you shouldn't have these these scars what's wrong what's going on here it's brazil so jquery or like stuff doesn't move as fast down here like react is still on its way is that what's happening hey you know jquery is pretty awesome okay if you can jquery you can do anything and i mean that like that is just absolutely one of the worst code bases i mean it's actually every code i've ever i have ever touched turns into that but it's f it's enjoyer has an evolving github account in 2012 it was emberjs in 2016 it was view in 2018 it was react but now we're reinventing run times put on the floral shirt does anyone actually use bun no dino how about node actually use means that you execute the word bu n in your terminal no that's what i meant by actually use like actually use it okay that's you know this confirms my suspicion which is that there's a lot of these boutique run times but no one really use i know they promise the greatest performance of all time but it's just i always have to ask myself why what is like the the actual purpose of doing these like i understand dino is trying to improve like the npm experience but you just get the same experience right it's just you still are writing a ton of packages to dino registry instead of npm and the new npm is dino and then it just keeps on do you think that's going to happen with rust no no people won't write packages for rust no you know every time i start a project i have like 147 depenses i don't know what you're talking about it's the same thing it's the same thing every single time whip out the macbook post the twitter hot tape you can now use the t3 stack t3 actually stands for twitter rage bait twitch streaming and thumbnail farming agreed or disagree one's in the chat yeah i think i think that is what t3 actually originally stood for i don't know what it stands for now does anyone know i bet you there's someone that knows yes bro i know typescript is a linter not a language the like i said it's targeted this is actual targeted harassment at this point it is a linter it's always been one these are the guys that say vim is inefficient but then proceed to push their 2 gb vs code config the the same way naruto has sasuke india has pakistan joe rogan has basic facts the enemy of the javascript enjoyer is the backend elitist i just feel bad for the hair really just holding on you're just holding on at that point you got to move on back end elitist css is that a performance test what do you mean single threaded what do you mean dynamic typing hey girl i'd like you to balance my load the backend elitist has a contribution graph greener than a hydroponic laab despite the sweet fang job their setup looks like this who who has this this is my life before i got married like literally the night before i got married i slept on this and then magically there's like a there's like things that appear i don't know what happens is that just an act of marriage or is that just the difference between women and men right there d anyone anyone know cuz i live like a slob without this uses github as their primary cloud storage and when the repos aren't private it's another performance test whether they're riding it it's a valid question to ask which is russ versus z i think we should all think you know does anyone actually use o camel that's that's absolutely lovely thank you for that you're really just you're going to make funk yeah the [applause] everyone one day it won't just be jane street there's going to be more i can feel it going to happen o camel's going to take over the universe right after hasell you know camel edging to zig the backend elitist his roommates with the vimmer move out of the way [music] all i feel like that's not an accurate depiction of an average vimmer you know i feel like we we really optimize okay maybe it's pretty fair actually how that i think about this i'll try pipeline we got to study the vim script lua split keyboard mustache pipe i mean it it really is a good keyboard okay i i i fully agree that you should be willing to travel with such a nice keyboard you know like could you really program without that sound i don't think so does anyone want to b a coffee by the way [applause] i threw it right at you for those that missed it the bag may or may not have exploded i probably should have chose someone closer nolan ryan would be proud of okay the vim script lua split keyboard mustache pipeline the vimer lives in a paradox where their only github contributions is their own take that tj tj does even have a mustache or or the kinesis i kind of feel like that's it's unfair a neovim plugin or the occasional 3d game engine written entirely in rust super basic stuff the linux maxer deploy gentu on a friday nixos for the saturday don't you dare touch his dot files random repos and see and if they're doing webdev it's html only waiu body pillow in the zoom call suck less software actually what am i saying they're not even on github they're actually self-hosted living in a farm somewhere in ohio the chad it's true okay i know you guys all the nyx osers are are you know every time i say anything about ny os and this is this is not me exaggerating i would show you my email but it would be inappropriate but the moment i talk about nxs for the next two weeks it will be just emails explaining to me why actually nx os is easy and that trust me bro you won't spend your weekends adjusting your next config at all and and the language is beautiful apparently it's functional is that true yeah it's functional yeah yeah would would you like to tell me about it will you send me an email tonight i would appreciate it okay you'll send me an email okay that's good that's good it's always a random engineer or college kid somewhere in india ohio or brazil wait it's so brazil mened that was fantastic look at that how come i didn't have that horn or whatever that thing is is that a big cff what is that i don't know what anyone's saying right now and it makes when that happens i get offended okay i just want you to know wait did someone [music] say this guy has no time for a read me he's too busy actually writing code he's either contributing in maintaining core libraries and the rest of his repos are just finished courses you've been meaning to do you order coffee from a cafe he orders coffee straight from the ter not an ad this is not in fact an ad sorry about throwing that coffee at you and exploding it everywhere fantastic this is the guy your girlfriend told you not to worry about he's also from brazil by the way open source maintainers cricet has tulgar the ufc has kabib who here actively maintains open source stuff yeah yeah does anyone have is this project toyo here we do have tokyo yeah where's tokyo guy he didn't even raise his hand look at that that was the most reluctant hand raise of all time yeah you know tokyo i scream about you all the time and yet here i am praising and singing your glory and you're like you a little bit of tokyo not a big deal lifetime bro i know i i i know you clone you clone and ar m attack i get it we all do football has ronaldo nazario and for software engineering we have open source maintainers the goats of our field my favorite open source contributor this year has been giot any any other casual gatan lovers out there no yeah hey he's the back door champ and for his awesome contributions look up g 10 xz github has all kinds of people from noobs to students to in influencers just kidding influencers don't actually code to my favorite gi users people that use the sponsor of today's video boot dodev yes they also happen to sponsor mr handsome mustache vimer hey that's me you know why do why do you guys keep sharing my blue hair photo can we just can we just move on from that one time in my life you know you make one bad decision you make one bet with the internet and you lose i will take a mullet dev is an incredible platform i wish they were around in 2018 whene focus back in development with which is a fantastic way to get comfortable with programming at a logical and professional level bev has done an amazing job of gamifying the pro i didn't think so okay so i actually tried boot doev and for whatever reason i think i'm addicted to getting experience i play anything that's just like you earned 75 i'm like hell yeah i did i did that i'm so good at this and i just i get i get i actually get addicted to these kind of things and i can't i i have to stay away from them process of learning to code which you may know i'm a huge fan of it's entirely self-paced with the feeling of an rpg when i log on to boot dodev and see my xp levels achievements i feel like i'm loading up a game rather than a course on go and the best part of all they fully acknowledge the spiral of tutorial health so they get you shipping so much code and if you ever get stuck or have questions they have a thriving discord community oh and by the way their learning material is entirely free the membership unlocks the gamification and interact ac it features speaking of memberships by the way you guys like free stuff right yeah it's free you should at least do the free stuff hey look that big box s use that the link in the description box and use my code big box just don't pay lamee like that's my only request is that you don't ever pay lane just pay pay big box sweet to get 25% off your first payment for boot dodev that's 25% off the first month or your first year depending on the subscription you choose thank you so much to lane and boot dev for sponsoring this video and thank you for your time i am big b that's fantastic do you guys now know who big box is he's pretty [applause] good i will say one thing that's that's very important is that i know that like right now especially i i i mean i had a lot of you guys come up and talk about trying to switch jobs trying to like what is the best way to get into things and and really thinking about and creating what bothers you into a solved problem and putting it on github making a good presentation taking a moment to actually do the right things is one of the best ways for you to be able to showcase that you actually know what you're doing cuz anyone can follow a tutorial anyone like that's why you always have the same like nextjs project on all these different kid hubs because everyone's done that how do you stand out in this kind of thing and that's really where you want to like kind of you just want to you know showcase your skills and be able to and take the pictures and put it on there and then put it on twitter right cuz if you have a really cool like 15-second clip of what you built those things go like viral every single time and that's like one of the best ways i cannot tell you how many people i know that have gotten started because they just took pictures of what they're doing and posted it online so if that's you know if that if that's you it's it's totally worth it i don't know what chat's doing chat do you agree yeah that's my rules don't be a d if you're wondering clap okay well that's useful w yes no okay i'm using a macbook don't don't judge me all right
