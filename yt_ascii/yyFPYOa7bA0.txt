there are things which are right there in front of us which we miss and i'll quote my friend eric weinstein in saying look einstein carried his luggage freud carried his luggage marx carried his luggage martha graham carried her luggage etcetera edison carried his luggage all these geniuses carry their luggage and not once before relatively recently did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage and pull it and it was right there waiting to be invented for centuries so this is erik y stein yeah what do the wheels represent are you basically saying that there's stuff right in front of our eyes that once we it just clicks we put the wheels in the luggage a lot of things will fall into place yes that i do i do and every day i wake up and think why can't i be that guy who was walking through the airport what do you think it takes to be that guy because when you said a lot of really smart people carried their luggage mm-hmm what just psychologically speaking so erik wants that is a good example of a person who thinks outside the box yes who resists almost conventional thinking you're an example of a person who by habit by psychology by upbringing i don't know but resists conventional thinking as well just by nature that's that's a compliment good so what do you think it takes to do that is that something you were just born with i doubt it well i from my studying some cases because i'm curious about that obviously and just in a more concrete way when i started out in physics because i started a long way from physics so it took me a long not a long time but a lot of work to get to study it and get into so i did wonder about that and so i read the biographies and in fact with the autobiography of einstein and newton and galileo and all those all those people and i think there's a couple of things some of it is luck being in the right place at the right time some of it is stubbornness and arrogance which can easily go wrong yes and i know i know all of these are doorways if you go through them slightly at the wrong speed or in a wrong angle there they're ways to fail but if you somehow have the right look the right confidence and arrogance caring i think einstein care to understand nature with ferocity and commitment that exceeded other people of his time so he asked more stubborn questions he asked deeper questions i think and there's a level of ability and whether ability is born in or can be developed at accenture which can be developed like any of these things like musical talent you mention ego what's the role of ego in that process confidence confidence but you do in your own life if you found yourself walking that nice edge of too much or too little so being overconfident and therefore leading yourself astray are not sufficiently confident to throw away the conventional thinking of whatever the theory of the day of theoretical physics i don't know if i i mean i've contributed where i've contributed whether if i had had more confidence in some things i would have gotten further i don't know whether certainly hi i'm sitting here at this moment with very much my own approach to telling everything and i'm calm i'm happy about that but on the other hand i know people whose self-confidence vastly exceeds mine and sometimes i think it's justified and sometimes i think it's not justified you
