welcome to the vivo next three we're talking about advice that hasn't even been released yet i was just handed this massive black box which contained a cryptic message and this smartphone so today there are four things i want to show you a display unlike any smartphone you've ever seen before a camera test in some of london's most iconic locations then a speed comparison versus last gen devices and finally to take an infinity pool photo to showcase this new form factor you'll see what i mean in a few minutes so the first thing you're gonna notice here is screen this thing is almost all display now i can't reveal size and specifications but you can probably tell for yourself this is a massive phone with massive curves so much so that even when you turn the phone on its side half of what you're seeing is still display and compared to other curved display phones the vivo next three on the right spills about four to five times as much onto the sides plus one thing that's a little different here is that the body is completely seamless no physical buttons at all you've actually got haptic feedback on the body of the phone and it works surprisingly well on the right hand side you've got a slight grippy area which is your virtual power button and then you can use this to feel for the volume keys which are above and below it it genuinely feels almost exactly like having physical buttons on the top you've got a headphone jack as well you've got a camera pop out which i'll come to in a second and also a secondary power button for when one isn't enough and right next to that a microphone which combines with another microphone on the bottom of the phone just to pick up clearer audio you've also got a single speaker next to that and off we went there were six photos i wanted to capture in very specific parts of london the first one being covent garden which is famous for just being this massive entertainment shopping kind of area anyways i got my photo and the idea of this challenge is primarily to showcase the display to show that it's so borderless that it almost blends into the world around it the next stop was shortage the place of creatives and trendsetters and this place is filled with graffiti so as a way of capturing its essence i try taking a photo of that and this is one of my favorites i really like how this turned out it's not a perfect result and this is pretty tough to do because your phone is capturing things from a different perspective to where your eyes are seeing them from next up the shot which is actually the tallest building in the entire united kingdom and it's around this area where you get some of the best 5g signal in the country and so this is what i'm gonna be doing these speed tests which you'll see in a minute just while walking between the shard and tower bridge you've got the tower of london which is basically a massive palace and it's beautiful so i decided to get one of our photos here now tower bridge is the one i imagine almost all of you will have either visited or seen or at least heard about this is one of the most famous spots in the entire country whilst i was here i actually meant to take two photos because from tower bridge you could pretty much see the entire london skyline and i couldn't walk past that opportunity right so now that we were in this area and we were getting strong 5g signal in some spots of it it was a good time to do a 5g speed test but just before i jump into that a few things worth noting the phone has a glass back and a completely new camera system which i can't say too much about but it's different and it's exciting so the first be test was the obvious one i literally pulled up the speed test application and compared a 4g smartphone on the left hand side and a vivo next three on the right running with 5g and the difference is actually 10 times in terms of download speeds the app then automatically switches to testing upload speeds and whilst was getting run about 10 megabits per second on my s10 i was getting closer to 30 on the vivo next three reliably at about 25 so you don't need to be told that there is a massive jump in potential bandwidth here but to test it out a little bit more i tried downloading the same application ark survival evolved on the vivo next three as well as a 4g device it had downloaded about a gigabyte whilst the other phone was round about 200 megabytes and the next three had completely finished the downloads by the time the other firm is on about 20% so roughly speaking in my test i got about five times faster result when it comes to 5g though another really important aspect is latency or network communication delay providing that you're in a spot with good coverage you'll notice that compared to 4g things just happen instantaneously for example a youtube video might stop playing before the youtube app itself is even fully loaded it up and i'm sure you can imagine when you're watching videos on this display the picture just sort of melts over the sides of the phone kind of like the curved displays you're used to but - and the level whilst i was there i also had a quick crack at pop g just to see how that displays on this phone and sure enough it fills every corner of it another real world example of 5g testing was going through netflix picking a two hour film and hitting that download button and right before you in real time you can see that in this tiny space of time i'm doing this voiceover it's already downloaded like 25% now for the infinity pool photo the idea of this is that i was gonna get a picture of water and loaded up on this almost bezel-less display of the next three i was then gonna use another camera to capture this in a way that it looks like i'm actually sitting in one of those beautiful infinity pools the ones that extend all the way to the edge of a building had to pick up an umbrella just to diffuse some of the light because it was just so harsh at this time but i'm pretty happy with the result it almost looks like you're actually sitting in a pool that's flowing off the edge of a building conical no that device i've been using is super pre-production so none of the software and none of the camera quality none of that is final and is all subject to potentially improve but even from what i've seen this looks like a massive refinement as well as quite an alpha box smartphone if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated and i'm also going to leave links below as to when and where you can find out more about the next three the launch event is very soon and it's going to be a good one thanks a lot for watching and i will catch you in the next one [music] you
