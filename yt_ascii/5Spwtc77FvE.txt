so you have you have mr burum yes the pen dragon cycle and snow white and the evil queen right so is that a good order to discuss them in they are yes so let's start with mr b mr buram is coming out very soon and what is that mr buram is an animated comedy here's a look at the trailer for mr buram when i was a kid men were men now everyone's wrapped up in feeling real men stuff feelings down with red meat cigarettes and violence you and the geriatric girl scouts will be bed out in an hour burum buram mr buram bam b richard buram let the record show him a dick watch mr burum an all new animated series from daily wire plus now streaming it is inspired by a character that adam corolla has been doing on his radio show for years he's a this is series and tv series tv series yeah it is you know he is a cogy shop teacher that is like wood shop teacher in schools who is incredibly traditional incredibly you know everything he does is tangible it is about as traditional as you can get working with you know tools and wood and he's watching as the world just changes around him as things get more technologically advanced as the world gets more progressive as the school is trying to push him out yeah saying your job is not as important and so it follows his and what role do you play play his daughter i see i see and and what what's the character of his daughter she's incredibly it actually reminds me a lot of myself she's incredibly precocious very smart very close with her father and who's who's the target market for it i think the target market is people that have felt abandoned by comedy who watch you know animated tv shows who adult is it an adult adult series adult okay and who are wanting comedy that is truthful that is not afraid to pull punches that i think that the common man will relate to it has some sati i wouldn't say that it is satire but it has many satial elements to it it's the writing is incredible they brought me on and i didn't really know what to expect and i had done voice over a lot had not done it in a few years and that's always interesting because it you know i we recorded this whole series i play very significant role in it have not met met adam yet i have not you know megan kelly plays my mother in it i have never met megan yet i'm meeting her next week for the first time but you record all of this she powerful force she is yeah yeah and she's done she's done extremely well on her own yeah yeah so you know two thumbs up for her yes yeah we brought her in for that and but you record it all remote and so i only got to see bits and pieces of it i knew that the scripts were fantastic and then i started to sort of see the it launch it launches this month oh it does yeah okay and that's on the daily wire yes that'll be on daily wire okay let's talk about the pen dragon cycle yes so i that's a huge enterprise for daily wire they' poured a tremendous amount of resources into it it's the biggest swing we've ever taken yeah the jeremy has ever so walk through it i talked to jeremy a bit about it on my podcast but let's hear it from your perspective so p cycle and i'm sure jeremy told you this it is his favorite book series yeah from the beginning i mean he has wanted to create this tv show for 30 plus years this is something he's thought about dreamed about has physically written scripts for and it was finally the time when we had the resources it was a cultural moment he was able to step away to direct a majority of it he was the showrunner he produced it he wrote a significant portion of it this truly is his i mean i can't speak for him but in speaking with him while we were there and seeing him work this is probably the most important thing that he's ever done and we went to hungary i was there for five months he was there for seven months and i was the were you recording your podcast during that as well yeah yeah so we i was the only daily wire host that is in the show what role did you play i play merlin's wife so it is an aurian legacy tale of and and it follows the rise of christianity through the lens of an aran like not speaking right not legacy and so i play merlin's wife and she is she a good wife or she very she's a very good wife she's a good she's a good character she is yes she's a very very fun character to play she is she has a really beautiful balance of being incredibly strong but also being very feminine and very empathetic and very sympathetic for to merlin's very unique experiences and it was it was just a very very fun character to play and i saw a lot of myself in her i got to do stunts that i've never done before it was amazing it was fantastic it was a lot it was very very hard work we were filming show how long did you do itth five months so right and how many how many hours were were fil you know for the for the final series any idea what's going to come out of it i have no idea yet and i know that they'll probably like they'll have a first edit and then they'll cut it down and that kind of stuff but have you seen any of the edits i haven't yet jeremy's protected and when is it supposed to be when is that supposed to launch i'm not sure yet okay yeah they're in full post- production now i think that there is already a first round of edits that is finished and now they're we have so much vfx that that is going to go into this so many vfx there's just a lot of post-production that has to be done but the very cool thing is even though we are using some vfx we did 90 % of everything that you will see on the screen practically we physically did it all there was a the series starts with an incredible sequence with spanish bull leapers and they were physically jumping over these bulls one of my best friends who played the lead in pend dragon rose reed she was in the arena with these bulls she trained for months to be able to look like one of these bull leapers she was having to navigate around the bulls i was on horseback with a spear jumping over streams you know chasing aar we were physically fighting if there was an explosion that you see on screen we felt the fire there's a scene where i'm you know running through putting out a fire i was basically covered in fire protection which is like a goop that you put on so that you can't be set on fire running through fire as people were being fully set on fire around me it was absolutely incredible there was i mean they did not hold back good thing you said yes to the daily word is kidding and it's also it's very special because it's very full circle because i get to go back and do what i love more than anything which tell stories but i get to do it with people who i love and trust who i know are not exploiting me as a child actor who share my values and are genuinely creating content for the betterment of other people right well that's a good deal it is i i i would read scripts that i would be sent in hollywood and i would i would look at it i say i i don't want to watch this like these are terrible characters they're sharing terrible messages i don't even want to be a vessel through which this gets out to the public right right and i knew that and you had you didn't have that feeling with the pen dragon no it's an incredible story i haven't had that feeling with anything that i've done with awi i think mr burum is incredible i can stand by behind that completely the pen dragon cycle is a perfect mix of something that is meaningful in terms of its values and what it promotes and the values of the characters that you will fall in love with while also being something that is beautiful and that people objectively can enjoy you're not going to sit down and say oh i'm watching you know i'm watching a christian tv show you're going to enjoy it because it actually is very good but you can know that the people who made it the hours that were put in i mean jeremy barely slept for seven months but i've also never seen him happier because this was yeah i gained massive respect for him watching this take place and he did it masterfully and so you can feel good watching that and it's incredible being an actor in that environment and being a vessel because you really are a vessel you go there you stand and you mold yourself to the character and you lose a lot of yourself in doing that if you hate the project and if you hate the character you're playing but if you're able to love the character if you're able to love the production and the story you're telling it makes it so much more meaningful and you feel like you're actually part of something that can impact audiences can impact the culture in a really important way so let's talk about let's close with snow white and the evil queen so you pick to play snow wi yes yeah once upon a [music] time in time a prince would come [music] once upon a time but now that time is [music] gone so we announced it when we announced bent key which is our children's division and i think a lot of people assume that we had already filmed the movie when we released the trailer it was very backwards we did not do that i was we were we were maybe a week into filming pen dragon and i get a text from jeremy he just goes where are you like i'm at my apartment and he says i need you to meet me at the prey can you be here in five minutes and that was maybe an eight minute walk like yes if you d me ask anything you say yes i'll be there sprint out of the apartment i get to the lobby of the pr i sit down and he says we want to do something that could be it might be impossible and this was at the time that every it was during the sag strike but everything was going viral about disney snow white everything disney of the social order and the demolition of the narrative what of the traditional narrative let's just rewrite this be great every time oh yeah yeah we'll we'll improve it yeah yeah these not secret gay agenda mhmh and so that was in the middle of all of this happening and i had obviously been following it i had done episodes about it no the gay agenda is a mask it's just a destructive agenda it is it's just a de it's a demolition agenda with of all traditional values we're pro inclusion that's the mask that's the mask that's so that if you attack it you sound like a bigot yeah then you can't it's fair yes they yeah no no we're just bringing in the marginalized it's like yeah wait till you invite the real monsters out from underneath the rocks you and you bringing in the marginalized we're starting to see that happen already oh yeah yeah the maps the maps yeah oh no there's worse monsters than them right no no no no matter how bad there's no limit to what people are capable of doing right and so as you see one extreme emerge you can be absolutely 100% sure that that new margin has a multiplicity of more extreme margins on its fringe and there's no end to that well the end is that everything collapses that's that's how this has happened historically yes so okay so snow white where where are you where where where are you with this project we are in pre-production yeah you went to see jeremy and he told oh yeah so i went to see jeremy and this was as everything with snow white was happening and people were very disappointed very upset about the way that disney was rolling out this project the way that they were they picked such a fun actress too it was and you know i i'm a you've now heard me speak for i don't know how many hours we've been talking but about my love of literature and stories and i grew up reading classic literature i grew up reading the traditional stories i grew up reading grims and i love the stories underneath these fairy tales and so as somebody who is more traditional and has a love and appreciation for stories it's very it's sad to watch these stories be completely destructed for that agenda and so i had been watching this and commenting on it and so jeremy brings me in and say luckily luckily they fail they do because they're dull and and pry and and obvious and transgressive in the in the in the casual manner not in the creative manner right yeah jeremy said we want to do the impossible and we want to we want to do our own snow white and we want to do it in line with the values with which it was written we want to honor the story and we want you to play snow white and jeremy had been watching no audition well i think my audition had been the first month of pen dragon i understand your audition but i but he hadn't even really seen me act before that he had you know watched my tv shows and that kind of thing but he really saw me during pen dragon uhuh right right and so this was about a month into pen dragon or so and he said i'm going to keep you updated working on a script and at that time i think he had a very ambitious goal because that's when snow might was still going to be released right around this time he was like let's try to film it during pend dragon and i was like okay well we'll see how this goes that did not happen and i'm very glad that it didn't because i think we will do the story justice justice yes with the the right amount of time in the prep and we got back from no actually i'm skipping over the story of how we created the trailer but jeremy started working on music and he had this idea for the trailer knew that we were going to be announcing the roll out of beny and you know the 100 episodes of children's content that we had on the platform he wanted snow white and the evil queen to be the first feature film that we do on benkey and so i got a call probably at 4:00 in the afternoon and he said i want you to fly to trento italy tomorrow because that's where we had been filming pen dragon that week we jumped back and forth between italy and hungary i want you to get on a plane and you're going to fly out and we have a costume that's being worked on for you they're going to finish it in the next six hours on the plane with you and you're going to fly out to torento drive you're fly to milan drive four hours up to trentino wake up the next morning you're going to come come up onto a mountain another hour of drive and then stand in this forest and sing and jeremy was sending me oh gosh i still have the recordings on my phone one day i'll leak them to the public but it's jeremy on his on a piano app on his phone and it's what you hear in the trailer and he's singing it he has an amazing voice and he's an incredibly musician and so we sent me the lyrics he sent me the song and he said can you have this ready by tomorrow i said sure and this man he i have never had to sing this high before and i'm a soprano but i'm not that soprano i texted m of jeremy this is not gonna you know i sound like tweey bird and so we went back and forth and he sent me one in a lower octave i said this is much better and he was all nervous he was going breath this sounds really low meanwhile i'm thinking this is not really high so i get up to italy we record it we record it in the middle of shooting pand dragon so in the middle of the scene some of my other pen dragon cast is six feet away and at this point they don't even know we're doing so because it has not been announced to anyone jeremy said do not tell your mom do not tell alex do not tell anybody we have like three people who know that this is happening nobody can know so i'm sitting here in this princess dress thinking this is really not the wardrobe that everybody else is wearing they're going to know i'm like huddled up literally hidden the rest of the cast is over doing something else jeremy says hey we're going to film a little commercial for a daily wire thing that we have to do gets the crew to turn around points the cameras on me and we film this teaser and then i fly back to budapest and i keep going on comment section and keep going on pendragon and then i wait to hear what we're going to do with it and then it launches with ben key with a beny roll out huge success and then i keep i just sit and i wait i'm like all right jeremy when are we going to film this got back to nashville we wrapped pen dragon it was a raging success i truly think people are going to love the series and then we've now rolled into pre-production for snow white and evil queen so i'm in voice lessons you know three to four times a week i was classically trained as a singer when i was young but i moved more into po when i was older and have not sung seriously in many years and so i'm retraining that muscle i'm in dance classes every week it's a musical we're super excited about it and that's what i can tell you and there's a lot of people that i see comments every single day and they're like what can you tell us about x y and z it's all coming soon we'll be able to share more soon but it is an incredible adventure and it's just always a joy and an honor to collaborate with jeremy specifically i mean he's incredibly creative he takes incredible risks i think i've learned i've learned even more about risk-taking by working for him and working with him that was one thing that i felt incredibly comfortable with and excited about when i came to nashville and i came to da wire was i could not have asked for better mentors in the people that i'm surrounded with i mean i again i told you i i got this job when i was 19 and i walk into a room and i was you know with jeremy boring and dallas son who was one of the you know greatest producers to come out of hollywood in recent years has just an incredible story michael nolles matt walsh ben you know can i mean just you i mean just the fact that i remember meeting you when we were about to announce that you were joining daily wire and you were doing a photo shoot and i was in my studio and i think you would ask could i meet the youtube girl and i about just like fell out of my chair but i'm i just could not have asked for a better group of people and i you know they encourage me i grow every single day not just in my career but i learned from all of you you know emotionally and spiritually and in my personal life and that's just an incredible incredible gift typical hollywood story [music]
