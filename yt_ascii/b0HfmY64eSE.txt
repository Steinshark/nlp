i am about to spend $30,000 in the next 5 minutes buying the most futuristic tech on the internet and then we're going to test it to find out if it actually is the future or if it's all just marketing nonsense so what's the first thing i'd want to futurize a tv oh of course xiaomi released a transparent tv i knew this was a thing already i didn't realize you could actually just click by okay i have like a billion questions about this we got to try it what are the things we expect the future will have how about this invisibility bu oh this is great yes we need to do an invisibility shield if you haven't seen one of these already it's going to feel like magic futuristic bike i remember seeing this a while ago on the internet as like a concept device that could hypothetically exist 3,496 it's like $4,000 there's no way we can have the opportunity to test something like that and then not do it what would a person from the future use as their tools the neo ruler rule rule the scales didn't realize the battle for rulers was that intense so this thing is claiming to be a speaker that can focus its sound output directly to one person and the whole speaker is made of glass as well this is so futuristic gy ooh that's interesting so it's like a smart mirror but it's also saying that it contains your beautiful new personal trainer benefit from ai powered form feedback live body tracking and rep counting all in a hologram wall mirror i'd be dumb not to give it a go we can't do a futuristic tech video without a robot so this is world's first direct drive self-balancing wheel legged robot feels like they really wanted to be first at something i say that but this actually looks amazing i don't think i've ever seen a robot with this level of agility okay well this one has my attention you can ride it hey 8 m hour i'll never miss a flight again oh wait it seems that the same company also has another suitcase that follows you add two bag m the new rayban meta smart glasses i have heard that these glasses are the best implementation of the smart glasses concept to ever exist how close can you get to a real life hologram nowadays you can actually get something called the looking glass portrait oh it's the only commercially available display on the market that's able to showcase 3d cont content without the need for eye tracking or glasses i'm still very confused but this is the kind of thing we need to test i remember this company wooder they make these like haptic vests so you wear them and you plug yourself into like a game you're playing and that suddenly allows you to feel the game you're playing and it looks like they've managed to condense that experience that previously would have involved you wearing this basically jumpsuit to just a strap speaking of straps one strap endless possibilities flexible to stiff with a with a twist yeah boy okay marketing aside this actually looks like a really impressive this actually looks like a really really impressive product like it allows you to wear your phone around your neck or around your wrist or around your waist and then just twist it to make it stiff oh actually i do know a tech company whose entire thing is being futuristic gravar this is cool this is my jem there's a whole category of speakers called ferof fluid speakers they use a magnetic fluid to create a visual response to music these pencils have a really interesting mechanism that allows them to self [music] sharpen okay stop me i don't think i've ever been this excited for the stuff to arrive it's all finally here some of this stuff took over 2 months to arrive so in a way we very much are filming this in the future so let's go roughly from least expensive to the most expensive to find out how much it really costs to experience that next era so just $10 self sharpening mechanical pencils so you know when you're using a normal pencil the reason it gets blunt is cuz as you're writing you're holding the pencil from one consistent angle and kind of sanding away at the tip so these guys realize how to fix that by creating a system such that every single time you apply and remove pressure from the tip it rotates the lead so that even if you're writing from one consistent angle you're actually equally using every side of the pencil there's really not much to say about it apart from the fact that it really does work and every pencil should use one of these the entire sharpening industry would disappear so i'm going to give this a 6 out of 10 so then all the way up at $60 we have the futuristic charger from gravastar and actually while we're at it let's just do all the gravar products so that's the earbuds and speaker wa if nothing else it all looks cool let's hope there's more to it than that okay so the charger it doesn't initially strike me as the most space efficient with this whole transforming standing sitting design like they used a really high-tech material called gallium nitride to be able to get it to a really condensed size but then bulked it back up again with all the external fluff like it's a 65 w charger which is not bad that's two times faster than the iphone's fast charger but then at the same time if all you wanted was a 65 wt power brick you can get one in a smaller footprint at a lower price it's not really futuristic you're paying for design you're paying for these rotating ear you're paying for the fact that the eyes light up you're paying for the fact that it transforms from a sitting to a standing position but actually only if you don't have your plug in on top of that because then it's locked in 5 out of 10 but then with the earbuds the design actually has a purpose these things feel so premium like listen to these sounds oh it's got an rgb lighting strip baked into the charging case of the earphones you can very much tell this is made for someone who really wants to carry around a gadget let's do a sound test they do fit really well with a good amount of passive noise cancellation without any tech going on that's a bit of a shame the one earphone that is working does sound pretty good but the fact that straight out of the box one of them isn't connecting properly it's not a great sign for the software stability to come but you know what the funniest thing is you know the main extra function of this earb cas there's a bottle opener i couldn't believe it let's let's see if it works whose idea was this i mean earphones bottle opener the kinds of situations that you would use both go in are so different but also more importantly was it worth this was it worth carving out a massive triangle in this valuable real estate that is your charging case at the direct cost of battery futuristic in a dumb way 3 out of 10 that's nice though but the speaker is the thing that i'm most excited for i'm already liking a lot of the little touches like these tiny little rubber pads at the bottom which means when you plunk it on a table it massively softens the thud okay oh ready to pair bluetooth connected i can respect that some nice startup sounds oh there's a ton of different lighting modes as well you know for something that's designed to be straight out of a ccii movie this is actually weirdly well suited to camping ah okay so it's got a small tweeter here which is what's handling the high notes and then a larger subwoofer coming up the bottom which is what's handling the base and it's pretty mid-range to be honest it sounds like a $50 speaker the lighting's cool though so i'll give it a five all right let's see what the lighting of the future has in store for us this is the biolumin or and i got to say i do love the idea of a future where we're not just pumping out greenhouse gases to fuel our increasingly electric lifestyles but actually harnessing the earth's natural resources to live a sustainable life and this might actually be one step closer to that vision so apparently in this bag right here is a specific species of live microalgae that can take in carbon dioxide release oxygen kind of like a plant so i just dropped some on my table but also in that process produce light emitting chemicals so we basically pour what's left into the orb i'm going to leave that in a place where it's getting plenty of light for now and then what it says is that it's only going to glow not just in the dark but specifically at nighttime so we will just cover the other stuff and loop back to it at the end oh i've just realized there's a massive do not drink on the front which means someone's tried it i could totally see how you'd think this would be a superhero origin story i don't blame you i'm slightly curious okay and while we wait to see the kind of lighting that nature can generate let's find out what humans advantage to do because this product right here claims to have bottled both fire and the northern lights into something that can sit on your shelf okay so really all this is is a bunch of high power leds at the bottom shooting up at a deformed glass cylinder which refracts them and i mean there is stuff to like here like the glass cylinder is surprisingly high quality the reflections it makes on the walls and especially the ceiling really genuinely interesting to the point where i would say it kind of delivers on its promise plus you get a little remote to change the colors i really like this one it reminds me so much of the reflections coming off water but here's the thing i hate these remotes these remotes are aign that what you actually have at the core of this product is very cheap leds for me tech that is genuinely smart is tech that will use your phone or voice for controlling but the more fundamental problem is that this was meant to rotate by itself there's a motor there and when it arrived it was already fried which does not bode well for the overall quality of this thing so the idea is great it can be pretty but this is just a bit sad isn't it 4 out of 10 at $80 then we have what's claiming to be the future of the phone stand and while initially i could not wrap my head around how a phone stand could possibly be $80 now i can see it this is the morph strap you know the whole flexible to stiff thing yeah it's that now the company's being pretty tight lipped about how exactly it works but it seems like this lever here is basically a crank that tightens or loosens the internal structure sitting under this fabric so the company's idea is let's say you're walking around on holiday and you carry your phone around your neck as you do the second you want to take a photo bam selfie stick i'll be it a slightly bent one i mean that's not really what i'd use it for what i'm more interested in is can this be a way to mount your phone onto like any surface to take a weird shot for example the answer to which is yeah pretty much i just had an idea so i'm thinking hypothetically if i was in the back seat of a car and i wanted to watch a tv show while i'm on the go does work 7 out of 10 i feel like there's a lot more you can do with this than i've even realized at this point and then to measure how long your stiff phone strap is here's the ne ruler which is such an awesome name for what seems to be the one ruler to ruler the all you place the ruler next to it you raise the slider till you reach the point you want to measure and then that on screen is the exact measurement and there's an obvious initial question here in that my $1 ruler does the exact same thing who asked for them to over complicate it this much well for starters this thing is accurate to the nearest zero .01 mm which is a level of precision that you can't get by just eyeing it the fact that it's digital means that you can change units on the fly you can flip between millimeters inches even meters if you want to but also you can do crazy stuff like let's say you're measuring an architect's drawing or a map for example i just bought one yesterday and it's just a bit bigger than i was expecting so you know a lot of these drawings have a scale right like a 1 to 500,000 or in the case of this map 1 to 5 you can let the ruler know that scale and then as you're measuring it will not just tell you how many millimeters it is in reality but also what the actual real life distances of that space really are or for another example let's say that you wanted to divide something evenly you can choose on this ruler how many divisions you want and then you literally just pull the slider across and it will tell you exactly where to make those divisions niche yes completely next level for the people who actually have use for it also yes 8 out of 10 so now on the complete other end of the spectrum our shoes yeah apparently future shoes only come with half the packaging so we already know that this shoe it bends in half but why well this entire range of fes products was actually inspired by a letter from matthew walzer a 16-year-old living with cerebral pulsy who said that because of his disability he couldn't tie nike's shoelaces so nike set themselves an internal challenge to basically try and create a pair of shoes that you could take off with no hands and this actually requires quite a big rethink of how the shoe works like you need a hinge that allows the shoe to snap into the open and closed positions you need this tension band that spans both sections you need to make sure that the sole stays flat when the shoe opens so that it doesn't form a crease and then on top of that a kickstand which is what actually allows you to kick the shoe into this folded position so how well does it actually work it's a real life product showcase it's mor strap time crank that into position there you go look at that it's the cameraman of the future okay so foot slides into this top half it feels pretty loose right now but then wow all of a sudden that's like a perfect fit that's the easiest shoe putting on experience i've ever had and then when you want to take it off little bit of pressure at the bottom there and your shoe folds in half that's crazy i was skeptical but now i am completely sold at least on the vision it's yet to be determined if all these extra moving parts add any extra fragility to the shoe but this is a concept that i want to see more companies trying n 10 so i've tried haptic vest before but what's really interesting to me about this wua strap is how it's got the potential to still add another dimension to games and music without having to look like you're gearing up to go to actual war okay so the way this works is it basically sits in between your sound source let's say your ps5 and then your sound output let's say your headphones it intercepts that audio and then it turns the low notes which could be gunfire or you crashing into the wall in a car into physical impact that you can feel and then passes on the rest of the audio for your headphones to play as usual it does have physical ports for when you want to manually wire something in like i've done for my ps5 controller but it is also fully bluetooth so that's how it's paired to these headphones would you look at that oh and then there's also an app where you can control volume you can control intensity obviously we're on the maximum but also you can control rgb color which feels a little silly for me for a device intended to not actually be looked up i'm feeling so much impact just from the standard loungy jazzy menu music you know this is the kind of product that is very easy to write off as a gimmick but i would actually say as far as the experience of feeling like you're in a car this goes probably further than one of those like steering wheel accessories that i've seen a lot of people buy like i feel like i'm feeling the real texture of the road and the grunt of the engine i guess if you're a massive car enthusiast you'd also probably notice the way that different cars feel physically okay i'm just going to go for i'm just going to stare off into the fence oh okay okay so the actual final impact was not actually as much as i thought it was going to be i don't think this has the single-handed ability to deliver the authentic car crash experience this probably isn't the way to make it feel like if you're playing cod that you're actually heading into a real war zone but what it is is a really effective way of adding in that general lower level immersion that you probably don't realize you're missing until you take one of those off i wasn't wooed jud okay also around this price the invisibility shield let's have a look this is this is literally how the thing comes and i know it looks like i just went to my dumpster i pulled out a sheet of corrugated plastic and i stuck it here but no this is a specially crafted material where every single one of these vertical strips is a curved lens that bends light away from the center which has the very surreal implication that you could be looking head on at something and not actually be able to see it which is useful for i mean yes magic tricks but also stuff like camouflage in the military i wouldn't say it's useful for most people but from the perspective of it being a working science lesson in action give it an eight and then even more futuristic than that the holographic display very few things scream future like hologram but then i suppose at the same time we have seen so many poor executions of this concept it makes it feel like you're physically holding a memory in your hands and you're able to look around within it it almost feels like a very good trailer for immersive content so stage one of what this thing can do is turn a 2d image into a 3d image so this right here is a normal photo that i took on my iphone and look at this the software actually allows you to visualize what it's like to look around inside it using ai look what happens when i pick up this depthy no slider and drag it across you can actually see the image being manipulated in real time it's kind of a shame that the actual resolution of the output isn't higher but at the same time to help you visualize how impressive this is you know those holographic bookmarks you get where when you look from different angles you can see the same image from like four different perspectives this is kind of like that but instead of there being four different perspectives it feels like like an unlimited number of perspectives like it's literally 100 on top of the fact that it's actually a moving screen but there is also a level up to this so this program is also connected to chat gbt and can apparently allow you to talk to ai connected to a holographic character within this frame right so if i select the robot well now ain't that just a hot tamale of technology spill the beans and let's have a hooden this is weird so this thing has the intelligence of the ai models that we know but it's actually also able to communicate that within its own pre-programmed personality i'm like shaking a little bit you got it partner if x + 69 is 72 what is x well hot diggity dog if x + 69 is 72 then i reckon x is a sneaky little vmit trying to hide in plain sight what but fear not partner cuz this old cartoon android is quick on the draw if we subtract 69 from 72 we find that x is a mischievous little twitter equal to three what a weird way of saying three what's your favorite mr who's the boss video well ain't that a nutty question no it does feel like a bit of a demo piece in its current form in that it's not a final product with a particular purpose but equally i am shocked right now my brain is spinning with all the things this could potentially mean for the future like like imagine if you had like a table with this technology and you were playing holographic board games with the person sitting opposite you each of you having a different viewpoint of the same situation oh my god this is a 10 out of 10 this is a taste of the future a solid 10 out of 10 partner trippy as hell right one of the things that i think about a lot when it comes to the future is how language barriers just won't be a thing tech will be able to make it so that you can still have completely seamless conversations with people who otherwise you would never have understood it's just a question of when so are these that product that can take us there okay so drisha you are a spanish speaker well you have spoken spanish at some point in your life yeah this is going to test my high school spanish high school spanish okay that's good enough so you put one earbud in i'm going to put the other earbud in and there's a mode here we're going to click called siml mode hello how are you today you're hearing what i'm saying can i have a loaf of bread please what's it saying to you that's what it comes up as oh my god okay so this is not completely new tech like it's not dissimilar in translation ability to something like google translate but it's the form factor it's the fact that i can have one airb you can have one a bird and the microphone is really close to your mouth so it picks up the sound well and then it's the app it's the app that doesn't require you to keep pressing buttons it just listens out and allows you to have that conversation in real time we've used the google app a few times to try and talk to people who don't talk english and it's kind of like tap wait tap wait when you're using google translate you very much feel like you're using an app here you just feel like you're looking at the person and talking to the person yeah and i can see this slowly being added into things like glasses apple vision to make it seem more seamless as opposed to like going on holiday and giving it to someone that is such a good point of course that's going to happen could be really cool it's a good enough product that this is going straight in my travel bag and it can also do 40 languages and 93 accents right now the two things i don't like are that one the app tries to charge you for downloading languages offline which when you're in abroad countries is probably a likely thing you're going to have to do and then also the actual hardware construction feels a little bit cheap for the price these are like if they were just normal earphones you would expect them to cost no more than like $50 for a build like this so overall it's an eight time for the meta glasses which obviously i mean they're not a cheap product but at the same time given how expensive a normal pair of glasses from this company is and how far ahead the metag glasses supposedly are i was expecting this to be much more okay so let let's be very clear what this isn't is some completely straight out of a movie pair of augmented reality glasses where like i can see you and then like your name and your age next to you we're not there yet but what it is is a pair of real and rather stylish glasses or sunglasses that you can put onto your face connect to your phone and make phone tasks more seamless than they already were like music they've got speakers that angle down into your ears and okay i mean there's not exactly an established scale for how good glasses should sound but i would say the audio quality is not far off something like the third gen airpods you control things using this capacitive area on the side here like scrolling volume for example and then there's a capture button up top for the cameras for both photo and video you can also use voice commands but i mean imagine standing in a packed train like meta take a photo here's the thing that shocked me the photos and videos that you take on this are actually good it's not quite like topend smartphone but this thing takes 12 mapel photos and 1080p videos using some of the same processing techniques that your smartphone uses like hdr like the stabilization so you don't get overexposed skies or everything covered in shadow like i expected coming into this the key downside for me though is that the camera is not going to cover your entire vision and you can't preview what it's capturing like you can on your phone so it will sometimes result in a situation where you shoot something you later realize before you post it that actually you want to crop it a little bit to make it central but then at that point it's actually more effort than if you had just taken your phone out in the moment and done it properly but i do want to stress this is exciting it's the first product in its category that's actually i would say delivered on its promise and feels like a polished finished product that you could see yourself using so i would give this a nine and now moving further up the ladder the concept of this next one is absolutely bonk as if it works a speaker that can focus its sound in one area is like the entire perks of the isolation you get with headphones combined with the freedom of being able to listen to something bya speakers and actually while we're at it let's just do this at the same time as the ferrofluid speaker since unlike the name suggests it's not actually a speaker but it's designed to react to a speaker it's hard for me to describe how excited i actually am for this this is one of those very big moments where i'm actually experienced something for the first time that could be groundbreaking test and i want to start by saying this ferrofluid thing over here even without how it reacts to music just using a magnet over it is fascinating it's basically a magnetic fluid but because you never really see magnets in fluid form it almost shows you magnetism in action in a way that's much more real than you all have ever seen with solids that said the actual product feels like it needs a bit of quality control like there's some ferof fluid just stuck to the inside of the glass it's led backlit oh my god it's responding to my voice i have never in my life seen anything like that before okay so we'll put that there and now the focus sound this is a very weird piece of techn techology it genuinely looks like nothing is going on in here it's a really light completely clear speaker with just a little bit of a metal body so i imagine almost all of the audio processing and the actual tech is happening in this box here this is just the projector for the sound okay im each at first impression right now it's firing directly at me it's not the most bassy or punchy speaker but i can hear it very clearly i'm going to turn it away now oh my goodness oh my god i i've never experienced anything like that in my life so when you're looking directly at the speaker you're convinced the sound source is here but as soon as you rotate it it feels like it's almost throwing the audio source to that wall there or that wall there so when you turn the speaker away from you it's not like it completely mutes it but you're probably hearing it at about 25% of the volume versus when it's facing you so how well the way that normal sound waves work is they travel out in all directions until they dissipate imagine like throwing a rock into a pond and seeing those ripples come out of it but this directional audio speaker actually instead uses ultrasonic waves which are super high frequency and therefore much shorter wavelength which means they spread out much less they're completely inaudible to the human ear but the thing is as soon as they come into contact with the human air they distort back into an audible frequency so the target can hear the audio but the other people around them can't as much is it worth buying i'd say probably not yet given that you're having to give up a lot of sound quality to be able to get this effect but the potential is massive so for the purposes of being futuristic that's a 9 out of 10 and this ferof fluid speaker surprisingly cool this is an eight this is the air whe sr5 the autof following suitcase and then this is the s3s which is the ridable suitcase i actually really fancy a sit right now so we're going to start with the ridable one and i got to say i don't think i've ever wanted to like a product this much like okay when in your life have you ever seen this this before bombastic side eye there's a massive power bank attached to the back of it which means that you can plug your phone in to charge it and then you sit down on the thing and i mean come on come on i mean when you think about what riding around on a suitcase looks like i don't think you'd imagine this level of speed and turning torque this is literally like rainbow road and mario kart wo you got one toggle that's accelerate you got one toggle it's a break but the best bit is what happens when you press both together this is how you go through airport securitya you've got the app for this suitcase yeah i can see how fast you're going how fast am i going you're joking it feels a lot faster than that i what grish stop ch this is really weird oh just says god d out are you okay yeah so on one hand right nothing beats this but then on the other hand as a functioning suitcase there's a room for improvement so i mean for starters they make you carry around this ridiculous butt pad which really they could have just baked into [music] it i don't know what kind of holiday you can pack for in there at a squeeze that's two shoes and maybe a butt pad plus like the website for this thing is so atrocious that i have no faith that any of the tech in this is actually going to last and then we have the autof following suitcase this is the one that from a technical perspective i was actually looking forward to more but it's actually quite a lot worse so it has very similar perks to the other one in that because it's got a massive battery bank it can charge your phone it's actually also got a biometric fingerprint scanner for unlocking but the key differentiator is this wrist strap so this wrist strap essentially communicates with this sensor via ultra wideband which is like the same technology that your iphone uses to find your air tag for example so i am now connected which means if i walk more than 5 m away then like an overly attached child it walk come sprinting to me can it outrun me that's the question oh nearly obstacle avoidance on point so this is part of what my problem with the product is these two down here are infrared obstacle avoidance sensors they're not very good at avoiding obstacles do you trust the technology with your life go go go it slowed down so the problem is not that it's unimpressive it's actually pretty cool that it works most of the time it's just that for your most valuable possessions it has to be 100% and it doesn't feel like from what i've used it that i trust it completely there are a couple of safeguards in place like for example as soon as you lose it your wrist starts beeping and your suitcase just starts wandering around and around like that looking for the sensor but still you only have to lose something once and i feel like this will do it 5 out of 10 all right it's magic mirror time so i started using this thing a couple of days ago and it's a really unique product but i think the best way to show you is to actually start a workout and you'll see how it works and i will say they have got the fundamentals right like the software feels very slick it runs at a good frame rate although just because of what the product is you do get this slight ghosting type effect it's almost like it's an infinity mirror of bouncing back and forwards which reduces the crispness a little bit so the first thing you do is you pick a class so you can either pick it based on the duration you can pick it on who's leading that class or you can pick it based on what body part you feel like working out it's got a whole load of different settings you can play around with and what i like about it is that it's not assuming that you have access to an entire gym suite it's very much able to tweak itself around what you do have and now we go and now it initializes body tracking it's just making sure there's one person and one person only in the frame so when i saw this for the first time i will say as a fan of technology this felt pretty cool you've got all these fitness instructors who've clearly filmed themselves on a green screen background so they've been able to cut it all out and almost appear like they're holographically there in your room but it actually gets cooler cuz you click right here and you have access to music and every bit of music outputed by this mirror is generated by ai so every time you do a workout you are hearing different tracks and then part of why that helps is that you can separate the music volume from the speech and sound effects volumes because yes it talks to you like let's say i am actually following along to this workout it will tell me off when i'm doing it wrong bring the weight up to your shoulders right so is it good well there's a lot of things i like about it i like the fact that it gamifies workouts i like the fact that it feels like there's almost a watchful eye over you so that you have some company and it does smart things like when you first input the weights that you're lifting it will slowly use artificial intelligence to amp up the workouts to make sure that you're progressing the bone that i have to pick though is with the way it's marketed this thing calls itself a personal trainer replacement but really what this is is an oversized smartphone with a front camera with a screen with a set of speakers that does use intelligent software to watch you but it can't see every angle and you can obviously trick this if you want to like it currently says i've done seven bicep curls i haven't done seven bicep curls 2 plus 2 is four this isn't a complete replacement for a personal trainer but it is really good for people who don't have access to one so 8 out of 10 you know cycling used to be such a massive part of my life growing up and so this idea of me revisiting it now but using something that looks like it's straight out of tron legacy is kind of crazy okay we have to talk about this product is it futuristic yes hell yes this thing is straight out of my bike driving fantasies from when i was a kid like for example it has a kickstand that no joke once activated can only be deactivated with fingerprint access it's got a microchip inside of it that will alert your phone if it ever gets stolen and it will give you the exact gps coordinates to go find it it's got integrated signal and brake lights so you don't have to wave your arms around like this when you're gesturing that you want to turn right and then also headlamps that are sensitive to the the light in the environment so they only turn on when they're needed and all of this stuff is great like using tech to make the biking experience safer that's exactly what it needs and then you have the elephant in the room hubless wheels how is it that every single bike you've seen up until this point has a hub in the middle but this one doesn't well they've actually not really done away with the hub you still need one they've just redesigned it and relocated it so that everything that was previously happening here is now happening in a combination of here and then here does it have any practical benefit at all no it doesn't and that brings me on to the problems the whole thing is very surface level like it's very heavy it's got this really cheap feeling plastic coating that we actually ended up accidentally scratching earlier just trying to clean it as far as the actual electric bike performance it's really nothing special like it's nothing better than what you could get on a $1,000 or maybe even $700 electric bike the thing has basically no suspensions every single bump you go over you feel it but by far the worst part of this is the tech is basically dysfunctional we couldn't get the to connect we couldn't get any other the smart features to work customer service non-existent the company doesn't even seem to be properly operational anymore making this essentially the most expensive prop i've ever bought in my life and i'm really upset to be honest $4,600 that's where we're at right now and for that well this diablo robot really has to be something special right let's just get one thing out the way this is a very impressive product like it's one thing to be able to b as a human but to achieve that in a two-legged machine that requires very high intelligence it requires the robot to be able to constantly know exactly where its limbs are and also be able to correct itself in an instant the second something moves out of syn you know when you move it it feels so powerful like it could take me out if i accidentally oh my god i'm actually a bit scared now i'm not sure in my life i've ever used a piece of robotics that feels this powerful so this is making me think of a couple of months ago where i tested this for the first time it's a dji robo master and i genuinely thought at the time this is as extreme as toys get but that makes this very much look like child's play but also it can jump you ready oh my goodness me let's do a backwards jump which all begs the question why like what is this for and the way i see it the best use of a robot that can't seem to fall over is to carry stuff right so the mission coke on the robot and i'm going to try and deliver that coke to drer on the chair everyone's telling me not to do this she's watching with baited breath this is absolutely phenomenal okay you ready just swipe it you got it you got it you got it you got it you got it yes other thing we need to test here is carrying capacity so you can maximize it by going into the creeping mode as opposed to the standing mode i probably shouldn't get onisha it works you want to have a race it's going to give you a morph strap for when i blaze ahead of you should be on you so that you can catch me winning no no no no no no [music] yes oh how do you stop oh oh and the final added benefit is we now have a new robot to control our camera shots wow this is absolutely insane this robot's got to be a nine at nearly $10,000 then welcome to world's first ever mass-produced transparent tv and actually now we're here i do just want to show you one more thing you might have heard me talking about when we overtake apple and subscribers we're going to build this massive iphone unlike the world has ever seen well essentially we' started building it we're working with another youtuber called diy perks the guy who made that crazy phone shelf what oh my and long story short it's going to be mind-blowing like just to give you an idea the camera on the phone is an actual proper dslr camera and that's just the icing on the cake we're closing in on apple but we just need a little bit of help getting there so if you enjoy our videos at all and you want to see this masterpiece of a phone come together then a sub to the channel would be transformative all right so the tv itself i mean this is every bit as cool and futuristic as i was hoping it would be it's basically like a normal tv you've got a layer of glass a translucent layer of oled pixels then another layer of glass except that the way the blacks are represented is by transparency and insanely cool as that is it does create a bit of a paradox when you're watching content like for example if it does what a tv does best and produces really bright vibrant striking visuals then it's not doing a very good job of being a transparent tv and if it does a very good job of being a transparent tv then it's doing a less good job than a non-transparent tv the limitations are very obvious like how paired back the resolution had to be this is only a 1080p screen which stretched out on a 55 in panel is not the sharpest but that doesn't mean i'm not glad this exists like combine this tech with electrochromic glass which is what tinted windows use to tint themselves and you maybe do actually have something big on your hands this isn't a practical tv but i mean the way i'm looking at it it's kind of a piece of art so i'm going to give it a seven all right just before night time where we test the orb i want to show you our final futuristic gadget this is the insta 360 x3 camera see here's the thing in most major cities trying to use a drone to get cinematic shots of the city is strictly prohibited but drones are not the only way to get drone-like footage get one of these x3 cameras stick it onto one of the company's 3 m invisible selfie sticks and the camera basically uses some very clever software trickery to remove that selfy stick from the image giving the impression of a floating camera that follows you around at all times it's quite funny actually it's become this whole trend like you can literally go on to instagram now and search no drone no problem and you'll see thousands of people who've taken stuff like this and you would actually be hard pressed to tell that it's not taken on a high-end drone and here is my attempt at the same thing that is pretty cool and if you want to try it for yourself i have got us basically the best deal that you can get in the description right now with a 10% discount off the product a 128 gab sd card and the invisible selfie stick you need to actually take shots like this okay it's biow time and we can't see anything so far of note just looks a little yellow but if we turn the light off you can't see anything now but now i'm going to shake it oh my god that's amazing it seems like they react to motion to a human eye it's very impressive but then i suppose how often are you going to sit there rotating your bulb i'll give it a six
