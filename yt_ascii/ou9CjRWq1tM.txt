voice assistants are kind of disappointing when apple first launched siri on the iphone putting what seemed like a personal receptionist into our pockets we thought the future is here people finally something i can get on board with but even nearly 10 years after that the reality of it isn't quite there do you love me there are many types of love but ours is just as friends [music] so i've designed 50 questions to ask to the four most popular voice assistants out there google assistant amazon alexa apple siri and samsung's bixby questions that try to test the different forms of intelligence and to keep it simple each time one of them does what i'd class as a satisfactory job it gets a point if it gives me a useless response or it takes ages it won't get a point okay let's start with the math section 26 times 25. 26 plus 25 times 26. now divide it by five times and now multiply that by 999 times convert 25 ounces to grams [music] okay now to see how well each assistant can control the devices they're running on turn wi-fi off increase screen brightness by five percent change my wallpaper turn on dark mode so you can see an ability to control the device is an area that amazon's alexa isn't really for but now just for some general internet queries what i think a lot of people currently use their assistance for what's the weather today what's the weather tomorrow what's the weather this time next week play dna by bts tell me a fact about bts [music] who is robert downey jr how tall is he does he have children take me to the wikipedia page of robert downey jr spanish show me restaurants in london show me the highest rated chinese restaurants in london his formula one canceled this year when did england win the rugby world cup call theater royal foreign make a reservation at theater royal show me jackie chan movies tell me more about rush hour how much did the film gross and which other actors are in it so you can probably tell that all four assistants can answer your internet queries to some extent but what we're going to test now is something more challenging the ability to exercise control within your applications show me my photos from 2020 which of them had cats in them set an alarm for tomorrow at 9am how far is it from new york to new jersey can you give me the directions open the app store send a file using send anywhere play a song on youtube make a tweet search twitter for aaron meanie send an email to dave finchley okay and to round it off just a general miscellaneous question section just novelty things that you might ask your assistant but which can actually be quite a good indicator of intelligence what's my name that's not how you pronounce it remind me to pick up the keys in 10 minutes that reminder do you have any pets tell me something good show me an inspirational piece of music recommend me a great vacation spot start a timer for five minutes tell me a joke so that leaves us with amazon and bixby in joint last place siri quite a long way ahead in second and then google assistant in first a couple of interesting things i noticed while doing that for starters that amazon alexa is actually capable of quite a lot but for an average user it probably won't do a lot to really get the most out of it you need to start using amazon photos you need to get your contacts to sign up for alexa messaging you need to invest your time in teaching it alexa skills and when you do all that it is a great way to control your smart home but to be honest it's probably more hassle than it's worth just to control a smartphone bixby is no better i like the fact that it can control your device settings like your wi-fi like your bluetooth but bixby's main problem and it sounds kind of harsh to say but it's true it lacks intelligence it's slow for starters and if you start talking before the bixby bubbles come up it'll miss the start of your sentence plus it's just not very good at context what application am i currently in what was the last thing i said if you think about when you have a conversation with someone context is incredibly important when it comes to what your last sentence means considering that samsung has built bixby and they've built it four samsung devices it doesn't feel nearly as polished as it should siri is a lot better you can fiddle with your wording and talk at a normal volume and it'll still know what you're trying to say most of the time i would say siri reaches its limits in continued conversation and it does sometimes miss the context of what you're saying but it is leagues ahead of the other two and that leaves us with google assistant which is the closest to feeling like that personal receptionist we thought we were getting 10 years ago it's fast and the fact that you can issue a continuous stream of commands and the phone understands the context of them genuinely starts to blur the line into dare i say something conversational there is a way to go but i feel it we're starting to get closer to jumping that barrier that barrier between feeling like you're shouting commands at your phone and just feeling like you're able to just talk to it and i feel like once we cross that the popularity of voice assistance could just blow up there are some things i haven't covered in this video that assistance can do like the smart home control and the ability to set routines which are just multiple actions that can be triggered together with a single command but i think the results we got in this simplified test are actually quite representative of the general capabilities of each assistant so with that being said if you enjoyed this do consider subscribing that would be amazing we're trying to hit 5 million subscribers by the end of the year and with that being said my name is aaron this is mr use the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
