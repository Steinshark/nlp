so i think you and i eat some more diets at least i was the first time i've heard this yeah so i was doing it first time anyone has said that to me yeah but it's becoming more and more cool and but i was doing it before was cool so the intermittent fasting and fasting in general i really enjoy i love food but i enjoy the the i also love suffering because i'm russian so fasting kind of makes you appreciate makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow so but i have a outside the philosophical stuff i have a more specific question it also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker like stifling that from a scientific perspective to sit there for many hours and focus deeply maybe you were a hacker before you were ceo what have you learned about diet lifestyle mindset that helps you maximize mental performance to be able to focus for death think deeply in this world of distractions i think i just took it for granted for too long which aspect just a social structure of we eat three meals a day and there's snacks in between and i just never really asked the question why oh by the way in case people don't know i think a lot of people know who you you at least do famously eat once a day yeah you still eat once a day yep hey are you nur by the way what made you decide to eat once a day like this to me that was a huge revolution that you don't have to eat breakfast that was like i felt like i was a rebel like i yeah like abandon my parents or something because in a darkest when you when you first like the first week you start doing it feels you kind of like have a superpower yeah then you realize it's not really a superpower but it i think you realize at least i realized like it just how much is how much our mind dictates what we're possible of and and sometimes we have structures around us the incentivize like you know this 3mm a day thing which was purely social structure verse is necessity for our health and for our bodies and i i did it just i i started doing it because i played a lot with my diet when i was a kid and i was vegan for two years and just went all over the place just because i you know a health is the most precious thing we have and none of us really understand it so being able to ask the question through experiments that i can perform on myself and learn about i is compelling to me and i heard this one guy on a podcast wim hof who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath and all these things he said he only eats one meal a day i'm like wow that sounds super challenging and comfortable i'm gonna do it so i i just i learned the most when i make myself i want to say suffer but when i make myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes to bear in those moments and and you really learn what your what you're about or what you're not so i been doing that my whole life like when i was a kid i could not like i was i could not speak like i had to go to speech therapists and it made me extremely shy and then one day i realized i can't keep doing this and i signed up for the for the speech club and you know it was a the most uncomfortable thing i could imagine doing getting a topic on a note card having five minutes to write a speech about whatever that topic is not being able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about that topic so but it just it puts so much it gave me so much perspective around the power of communication around my own deficiencies and around if i set my mind to do something i'll do it so it gave me a lot more confidence so i see fasting in the same light this is something that was interesting challenging uncomfortable and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result and it will lead to other things that i experiment with and play with but yeah it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes the most boring superpower one can imagine now it's quite incredible the clarity of mind is it's pretty interesting you
