this episode is brought to you by brilliant during the 1980s amid the peak of the cold wars technology race a series of peculiar deaths among scientists working in britain's defense industry began to baffle investigators most of the victims were research staff of marconi electronic systems with the majority being computer scientists working on defense projects associated with u.s strategic defense initiative research and development furthermore many of these deaths were under bizarre circumstances with their underlying cause ruled as undeterminable others were declared as suicides or accidents despite overwhelming contradictory evidence the mystery began in march of 1982 with the death of senior computer scientist dr keith bowden a contractor for gc marconi bowden had driven his car off a bridge down an embankment and into an abandoned rail yard dying instantly it was initially concluded by police that boden was simply drunk and driving recklessly however witness testimony from friends who were with bowdoin that night denied he had ever been drinking upon further investigation of the wreckage it was soon determined that the tires in boden's car that were known to be relatively new had been swapped with a set that was old and worn no explanation for this was ever discovered the next mysterious death would occur in 1985 when radar engineer roger hill was found dead in his home seemingly from a self-inflicted shotgun moon though no evidence of hill ever owning a shotgun could be found the coroner ultimately declared hill's death as a suspicious death with no specific cause or an open verdict the next year marconi employee 24 year old computer engineer vamal dajabe would also die under mysterious circumstances dr bae had jumped off the clifton suspension bridge in bristol in an apparent suicide however his body was recovered with his pants around his ankles and a needle-sized puncture wound was found on his buttocks the bristol coroner similarly concluded the death was suspicious with no identifiable cause at the time of his death dutchby had been working on computer control systems for advanced torpedo homing at marconi two months after dajubai's death another marconi computer scientist 26 year old ashad sharif would turn up dead once again in bristol sharif's death was a particularly bizarre case as he was found to have decapitated himself using his car and the rope tied between his neck and the tree at the scene of the incident a metal rod was found on the floor of the car next to the accelerator paddle sharif was working on satellite guidance systems at the time of his death both dodgeball and sharif did not live or work in bristol and the coroner had noted that both suspicious deaths were connected by both men being associated with a top secret project at marconi that would later be identified as an underwater munitions guidance system known as project cosmos while incredibly suspicious no significant connection was made by these three deaths until 1987 when the pace of these mysteries massively increased that year richard pugh another computer scientist and a consultant to the ministry of defense was found at his home with his feet bound a plastic bag on his head and a thick rope coiled around his body his death was concluded as an accident by the coroner due to sexual misadventure a few days later dr john britton another scientist associated with the classified projects of the ministry of defense was found dead in his own garage of carbon monoxide poisoning this death was ruled as suicide five weeks later marconi engineer david skills was also found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning bizarrely his car was found modified with a pipe that connected its exhaust to the vehicle's cabin the next year two more deaths would turn up with defense engineer victor moore dying from an unknown drug overdose and scientist peter pipel also succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning papel in particular was found by his wife with his body jammed underneath his car in his garage with his mouth next to the exhaust pipe weeks later another scientist john whiteman was found dead in his bathtub surrounded by pills and empty alcohol bottles though the autopsy revealed no traces of drugs or alcohol in his body shortly after senior radar scientist david sand was killed when he made a sudden u-turn in his car and crashed at high speed into an empty cafe his vehicle was found to be inexplicably loaded up with cans of gasoline causing the car to be completely consumed by flames next came 24 year old engineer mark weisner who was found dead with his head in a plastic bag similar to richard pugh in 1988 lab technician 23 year old russell smith was found dead after jumping off a cliff in cornwall and another marconi senior computer scientist trevor knight was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning by august two senior figures at marconi succumbed to some of the most suspicious of all the deaths 50 year old computer engineer alistair beckham who had been leading several programs for the united states strategic defense initiative was found dead of an apparent suicide after some light sunday afternoon gardening at his home beckham was found in his shed with wires attached to his chest that were connected to a live outlet his mouth was jammed with a handkerchief beckham's wife unconvinced of her husband suicide described him as highly secretive of his work and gave an account of agents from the ministry of defense arriving at their home just hours after his death to remove several documents shortly after beckham's mysterious death marconi director john ferry was also found dead by electrocution after stripped wires that were connected to a live outlet was found jammed into his teeth fillings by 1989 the press had published several stories alluding to a kgb plot to systematically assassinate key defense scientists this was further substantiated by the occurrence of several deaths in 1987 and 1988 of key personnel of both subcontracted and acquired companies that were associated with top secret marconi projects despite calls for an inquiry into these clusters of mysterious suicides violent deaths and murders by several members of parliament and trade union leaders the government had dismissed the deaths as coincidences exacerbated by high levels of stress within the defense industry at the peak of these deaths professor colin pritchard a foundation professor of social work studies at the university of southampton an expert in mental illness and suicides had conducted his own investigation leading to the conclusion that many of the deaths were statistically uncommon for work-based stress pritchard had noted several odd connections between some of the men in his research with a small group all complaining to friends and family that they had been tasked strange impossible and unscientific tasks by their employers furthermore all were employed up until the day of their deaths and none had shown any signs of mental illness or other disturbance many of the deaths had even falled directly after an expressed intention to leave their position at marconi both pritchard and other news outlets had also cited the overwhelming use of sexual misadventure as a cause of death such a presentation is a common method of disguising murder in the world of espionage appearing within the training of almost every major intelligence agency its popularity not only lends itself to disguising the actual method of death but it also diminishes the victim's reputation diverting momentum from any subsequent investigation while the marconi deaths grabbed the headlines it was also accompanied by other suspicious deaths throughout the defense industry of europe in 1986 several west german scientists working on projects tied to the strategic defense initiative were also found dead under mysterious circumstances that july carl heinz beckerts a director at siemens and a key strategic defense initiative contractor was killed by a car bomb in munich a few months later gerald von burmell a senior advisor in strategic defense initiative negotiations was found with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound small firms throughout germany sweden and italy had all reported staff that had vanished throughout the late 1980s all of which had been involved either directly or prohibitedly in the strategic defense initiative program and its related projects by 1990 over 25 cases would be connected and documented by the media among them uk's computer weekly correspondent tori collins would file a series of noteworthy stories investigating the deaths in 1990 collins would go on to publish his book open verdict chronicling the series of deaths and the suspicious anecdotal evidence that tied them together however despite the overwhelming evidence of a clandestine plot to hinder the uk's defense industry no firm conclusions as to its true nature was ever uncovered [music] solving a good mystery always starts with following the logic and with brilliant building these critical thinking skills has never been easier brilliant is my go-to tool for
