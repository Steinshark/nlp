- my paypal is frozen and i really want to donate to tfue. so i did the only logical
thing i could think of. i went to the bank, i withdrew $15,000 and we're gonna drive from north carolina
all the way to florida. and yeah, it should just be interesting. all right, guys, the drive is 10 hours and 50 minutes. see you in 11 hours, tfue. - welcome to south carolina. one state down, boys. - stop number one. ah, sounds like georgia. see this. there you go. you want a hundred dollars? it's on the georgia sign. head out, boys. and now we are in florida.
- yay. - we're exactly four
hours from tfue's house. - i'm so bored. - you've been watching-
- you're watching a movie, - but i'm bored. - you're just trying to be dramatic. shut up. we just arrived in florida and the first thing we see is a drunk man laying on a table. i'm guessing this is what florida is. - sun's out, bellies out, boys. - it's clipped on it. it won't fly away. all right, so tfue just went live. his window has a blanket
over the top of it, but i don't care. we're still gonna find a way in. we gotta get to his house
before he finishes the stream. - we have an hour left of driving. - we just arrived at tfue's house. for obvious reasons i can't record outside and i'm gonna do my best
not to leak anything. oh yeah. you can see him. this is gonna be . i'm excited. - yo, what did i tell you he was gonna pull.
- wait a minute. he's on the other side of this. - yeah, but this is better though, right? - yeah, you're right. it's a good idea just
to drive for 10 hours just to watch a streamer
beside a streamer. - but see, we can hear him. so we get the echo effect.
- here. we don't need audio. we can just hear him.
- it's better audio like this. this is clean audio. - this is the real way to watch streamers. - who the on my window, dawg? - bro, what the fuck? - yeah. my paypal broke and
i wanted to donate to you, so the only logical thing
to do is just come here. whatever game you play next. every kill you get, i'm
gonna give you $500. - all right.
- yeah. it's just... - yo, it's mrbeast, bro. yo, mrbeast is at my house and he's trying to donate to me irl. - oh, he's doing that. - yeah. - do you have any snacks?
- yeah. you have m&m's or anything? - yeah. i got a box of snacks-
- oh really? that actually is pretty cool.
- oh wow. - he's elite
- all right, boys. - well, you gotta pay
him for the snacks, man. - oh yeah. here you go. these were probably pretty expensive. thanks for the snacks. oh my god. thanks for the hundred, dude. all right. we got mrbeast
in the back, dude. irl, twitch donating. every kill, i get 500 bucks. let's get it, dude. real quick. a quick 20-bomb or i
die off spawn, lets see, i don't know. whatever happens. let's get it. i think i gotta go to
the new island, dude. "the swirl." it's risky, bro. but gotta risk it for the biscuit. - hey, mom.
- hey, stream. i'm in here too. - we have a whole viewing show out here. - it's like a party. - it's like a live movie.
- woo! - bro, what if i die off spawn? - just do you have anything to make noise? we should try to distract him so i don't lose all of my
money in the first game. - yeah, don't kill that person. port-a-fort.
- oh, that's a bold move- - oh wait. he might actually die. that's a bold move, turner. first one. - i got a gl but i got no gun, dude. - a real man uses his hands.
- oh, shit. he's in trouble. - why did it give me a gl, bro. - turner's gotten very
unlucky off the spawn. he got a gl, which is not
the gun of his choice. oh, he has a gun. he's got a good gun now. oh, one kill, that is $500! cough it up, beast.
- throw it at him. - throw it at him. - i'm scared. bro, i got no health.
- will he drop 20 kills. not exactly starting off strong. - he does know the challenge is to kill people, right? - the opportunity of a lifetime. hey, you know you're
supposed to get kills, right? there's only 57 people left, how're you gonna drop a 40-bomb? - is it sad, i didn't even know that
island was a thing. - i haven't played
fortnite since season 3. - make it rain on the streamer. make it rain! - i'm gonna put it nicely
on the desk for him. we're not gonna make a mess. - yeah.
- nice. - oh.
- oh, . - $1,500.
- the total now at 1,500. throw it on him. - definitely gif.
- it's a 100% jif. chat, is it jif or gif?
- gif. - take away 500. - all right. next kill's 300. oh, 500. the total now at 2,000. - i'm gonna respectfully put it on floor. - slide it in the back of his chair? - it's like an atm.
- yeah. - yeah. just put the money in the atm. i won't let him focus. - dude, my stream just crashed. - oh really?
- it's too lit, dude. - they can't handle it, man. - blew it.
- oh - six kills. $3,000.
- hello, viewers. welcome back. wait, i lost track, don't i
still owe him another five. i don't know. woo. 500, 'cause we weren't counting. taking the tower, using the grappler and there- there we go. - we have everybody in . - oh, you better get that $500 ready? - oh!
- oh! - 3,500. woo-woo. - that was a bad throw. here, we'll do another one. just 'cause the throw was bad. - another one.
- another one. - it's not as bad. - look at his headset. - oh god. oh wow.
- oh, what a quick scoop. - another 500.
- he's in faze for a reason. - yeah, i was about to say. - i don't want this. take my money. - shout out, whoever cleans his room. - we have now reached $4,000 - i think 4,500 'cause i just threw- - we have lost count. but it's somewhere around 4,000... lots of money. - there's money in there, somewhere. - you've got this. go, tfue.
- no pressure. - you got this. - i think the 20-bomb is gone now, right? - yeah. he can't get a 20-bomb. - oh. sad face.
- the early game was rough. i got that grenade launcher. you know you're good. when everyone's disappointed 'cause you don't kill 20% of the lobby, like, "oh man." he only won the game and
killed 19 or whatever people. darn. - where are the people at, man? - he seems pretty focused right now. - oh wow.
- make it rain. - another 500. oh, it keeps coming. - that $100 is honestly
trying to be with you. - all right. - you think his nose itches a little bit. yeah. i think his nose- - why don't you scratch his nose for him? it does look like it itches a little bit. - does your nose, tenney? there you go. i know it can get hard when you got your hands
on the keyboard and mouse. - of course. - oh! ah. rigged. another $500. - i'm tired of throwing... dude, we're making a mess.
- put it in his headset. - can you guys stop just throwing
money everywhere, please. come on.
- all right. i won't do this again
after today, i promise. - such a mess, dude. i gotta clean all this up. but at least i'll be able to
pay somebody to clean it up. - nothing. - the money-
- ah, the money fell. all right.
- all right, we got- - we gotta put some money back up there. guess we gotta do more money. - he's gonna figure it out eventually. - here, we'll do the chair. there we go. his chair's a little more stable. - oh, by the way, nice to meet you, man. - yeah. nice to meet you, man. we can have our first
conversation after this game. - yeah.
- or tonight. whatever. thanks for following me
on twitter that one time. no problem. thanks for following me back. - okay. that was . - wait, what?
- the money fell off his head. gotta give him more. - oh, that was a good shot.
- oh my god, it's 11. - make it rain on them, tfue. - this is pretty intense. i'm just gonna set some money there. - he at least gets an extra
500 if he wins, right? - yeah. sure. more fireworks going off out here. - oh.
- oh, another kill. $500, okay, no one. - slide it in right there.
- is it the atm slot? - yep.
- yeah, that's the atm. oh my god. - it's not even fair. he didn't even get a chance. that's kind of bullying. - and another 500, . - i'm making another atm deposit. - atm, baby.
- only two kills remain. - oh. - did you take fall damage there? - yeah. i almost just died. - oh, lots of fast building. oh, this is an intense fight.
- ooh, good edit there. - he's doing a lot of things. i can't comprehend. - somebody stream snipe him.
- it's us. we stream sniped him. - i'm playing mobile. - yeah, i was gonna say i'm
actually playing mobile. that's me over there. - oh my god.
- he's not dead. - i believe, he has plenty of mats, this is getting intense. down to the final two players. - i'm actually learning
stuff, watching this. - you know those stories of the kids who pay for fortnite lessons?
- yeah. - that's what you're doing right now. oh, one left. - and a victory royale,
the man killed himself. - does that count?
- yeah, sure. - give him 250. - good job, man.
- holy shit. - come out through the window. - yeah.
- you gotta come out. - come say hi to the man
who just gave you money. it's better out here. - yeah. - i think you should be able to play` to get your money back. - oh!
- you okay? - our chairs are right here.
- that's one way of doing it. okay. - would you like some of your snacks back? i'm good, g. - sexy .
- i'm good. - he's sweeping up the money on stream? - you wanna get one
more game in real quick? - all right, i'm down. - can't go back through the window- - no.
- this is only for leaving, not entering. - do you have any words for the beast viewers, turner?
- follow my stream. me and beast are gonna run
some duos in the future. so stay tuned. - all right. if you win this next game you get whatever we have left. - i'm gonna try to win a game. only using a pickax and traps, dude. - i actually feel pretty confident, i'm gonna get to keep that.
- yeah. - would you mind moving to the left a bit? it's a little hard for us to see out here. - all right.
- that's cool. thanks, man. i appreciate it. - this is gonna be easy. jk.
- that's actually so funny. turner, don't get too cocky, all right? - i mean, i gotta kill people
with traps and pickaxe. - why are you getting ammo?
- i don't know. - oh!
- he has weapons . - it's been a while since i gave him money and it's just like-
- yeah, you're right. - it's like your instinct.
- i know. just like, i gotta be flinging money. where would this be nicely held at? - put it right in his shirt.
- in his shirt? - yeah.
- back of the shirt. - tuck it all in there.
- we'll do the back. it it's very tight shirt. it doesn't fit in. i think we have to go with the cubby hole. - yay. more money.
- yeah. oh. oh no that's...
- all right. two traps. there's guys fighting over here, dude. do i take the fight? - of course they might have more traps. - i'm going for it, boys. these are looking like some nice, a couple good players to...
- oh. - i'm not here. - oh, all right. let's see how he does it. - oh.
- ooh. - this guy like, "this
guys hasn't shot me once." did he do it? - i got no more traps, dude.
- so deceiving. - trying to ruin your chance at money. don't worry. - what do we do now? can we play a game of rock,
paper, scissors, real quick? - yeah, sure. - we'll do best two out of three. - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. ooh. - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - here you go. - this man throws a double scissors. who does that?
- dude, scissors is op, okay? - that's a bold strategy-
- i promise you. that's like the only time
scissors has ever failed me. when i head back to my state. it's like that way. it was nice meeting you, man. it's only like 12 hours away. - yeah, i got all your money. so now you kind have to walk home. - can we borrow like a couple bucks. - yeah, actually can i have some money? - yeah, i got you.
- perfect. this will pay for our gas. - yeah.
- all right. well, we're gonna head out.
- all right. yep.
- bye. - bro. what is going on, dude? what the fuck? no. get outta here. get the fuck out of here. - you're getting it.
- don't do it. no.
- you're getting it. you are.
- oh. oh. - how the did he throw
that good of a shot, dude. - where did he throw it from?
- from range, dude. so listen to me. the fbi is saying follow mrbeast. - yeah, i love this place. i'm gonna come here with all my videos just so they plug all my stuff for me. - yo, what's good, guys. i'm about to get into some streaming. we got like four challenges
every two hours or . so it's gonna be lit. but anyway, i have a problem that i . do you guys know how to fix this? i can't close my wallet. it won't close. you guys know why. - all right, jake paulers. we're back in north carolina. the trip was pretty
successful, wouldn't you say? - yes. - tfue was a really
great guy, super chill. honestly, it was a lot better
experience than i thought. his brother joogsquad did a lot for us. he set up all that. and he was really friendly. just overall, the entire
atmosphere was just chill and it was a lot of fun. let me know if you prefer this style, where we drive to twitch streamers, instead of doing it online. i'm down to do more of this in the future. honestly, this was so much fun. i'll probably go do tfue
again in a couple of months. just because hanging out
there was just a lot of fun. so yeah. all in all fun video. like the video and subscribe if you play fortnite. is that an easy way to get conversion? i don't know. goodbye. [music] mrbeast, oh [music] [music] mrbeast, oh [music] [music] mrbeast, oh [music]
