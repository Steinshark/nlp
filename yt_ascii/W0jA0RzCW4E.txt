in this video i'm going to be covering a topic that a lot of beginners have trouble with and that is immutability in python because it might not be that obvious by the way we can change strings and tupes that they are actually immutable types for example if we have let's say this text of type string and we're just going to say hello here and later we can decide to change this text by typing in text equals text plus exclamation mark and of course that has to be a string but when we actually print this we're going to get hello with the exclamation mark but i thought that a string was an immutable type so how were we able to actually add these two together and the same thing goes for tupal let's pretend we have some coordinates which are of type tupal and this tuple will follow the signature of a float and a float and that will equal let's say one and and two those are my secret coordinates now for whatever reason we're going to add a third coordinate so here we're going to type in coordinates plus equal 3 now when we print these coordinates it's obviously not going to work because we need to create a tuple here so i'll add a comma but once we add these coordinates we're going to have 1 2 and three but i thought tup were mutable so how was this operation possible very briefly i just want to mention that if you're interested in mastering the python language or learning a skill that can help you with your future job check out my website indent. i provide full python courses that can help you achieve a higher level of programming so on the website you can browse many courses and as soon as you select a course you can tap on start learning and it's going to take you to udemy and you might have also noticed that there is a massive discount if you use the link in in the description box down below you'll have a coupon automatically applied to your purchase and all courses are backed by a 30-day money back guarantee so if the course doesn't feel right for you no problem anyway that's all i wanted to mention sorry for the interruption but now let's get back to the actual video well this operation was possible because we did something quite inefficient in terms of memory and that is we created a whole new variable just to make this simple change and we can demon at that by printing the id of our coordinates before we do the operation so here i'm going to type in id and we'll just type in before all right let's actually do that the other way around and i'm going to also type in after and as soon as we run this you'll see that the ids will have changed completely before and after the change these are two separate ids which means to make this small change we had to create a whole new variable we didn't change the original tupal in any way we just created a whole new variable with that updated value so you'll notice that with some immutable data types you can still update the value just keep in mind that if a data type is immutable you're never truly changing that value you're just updating it and creating a whole new variable that's holding that updated value and actually if we were to type in coordinates and use do notation you'll see that we have no mutable methods that come with tupal if you try to index it if you say t pull at the index of z is equal to one you will get an exception because it does not support that mutable operation so why is it important to understand this well for one if you're working with a lot of text let's go back to our text example which is quite simple but if you're working with a lot of text and each time you want to concatenate two strings together then this can potentially lead to a huge loss in performance but of course that matters on how many string operations you're doing how performant you want your program to be if you're running your script maybe once per day you can have the least efficient program in the universe and no one will care but if you're running your script let's say thousands of times or even millions of times a day who knows what operation you're trying to perform the time loss you get from not understanding immutable types is massive because creating a new variable each time you want to perform this operation just isn't efficient and i guess i'll also show you that strings do not support assignment either of course you can index them but as soon as you try to change something in them directly such as the h2 and a you're going to get another error that string does not support object assignment anyway just remember that immutable types cannot be changed and it's not a feature that is broken and it's not the devs that had too much to drink when they were creating this it's just how python works anyway that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's video do let me know what you think about all this in the comment section down below and with all that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video as always at the end of the video you get a bonus today i have this new espresso cup and it's actually been quite cool cuz i can just pour the coffee in here and i think it looks quite cool
