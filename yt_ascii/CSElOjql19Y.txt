okay so let me draw an analogy there and you tell me what you think about this it's frequently the case that neoy entrepreneurs who have created a product believe that the fundamental issue at hand is the product right it when when i started selling things into the marketplace i suffered from the delusion that it was 85% product and you know 10% administration and 5% marketing and sales and that was like exactly backwards and so it sounds to me like a similar issue here that you presumed that except in the political realm you presumed that if you had your policy prepared you were already a credible person that that would be the bulk of the initial battle but what turned if i've got you right what turned out to be the case was a very sudden realization that while you had to get in the conversation at all and that sounds like a sales and marketing problem to some degree and this is i think why so many candidates who are credible turn to political consultants so rapidly right and and that often syns them so okay so is that a reasonable analogy and you've but you've you've put products in the marketplace before and so in principle you knew that on the commercial side so well i would say something about this is i i i agree with you on your analysis on the commercial side what i would say is that is on steroids in the political side right right so even if you transpose the commercial instinct onto politics you'd be missing it by by by mile the other thing is i came from industries that were a little bit different i haven't really been in a consumer products industry or in the media industry i mean the industry that i spent the most time in was developing drugs for diseases that pharma had ignored systematically and that was an area where look it's it's a regulated process i saw from a front row seat how broken institutions like the fda really are but it's not an area where if you're pre-commercial and everything that i did was in the research and development phase not in the commercial phase it actually it as entrepreneurs go i actually did not necessarily have that same experience as many consumer interfacing entrepreneurs so that may be idiosyncratic to me and then i would say even for consumer interfacing entrepreneurs and strive was a little bit closer to that because that's that's a that's a you know fund management company that competes at black rock i had some of experience it was nothing close to what the importance is of that is in politics is it was all about to call it sales and marketing in some ways undersells the problem because sales and marketing is once you're once you're there how much do you amplify how many people hear your message whereas for me at the early stages of the campaign and as i think about the last year and even some of the things that later came back to become headwinds for me when i was a you know front running or or whatever top four top five candidate were actually the path to getting there sort of set me up for the difficulties that i had later on but the first challenge was not even selling or marketing your message more effectively it was literally like nobody would know that i was running for us president even though i was running for us president so it was just getting on the map or being heard in the first place i just talked to dean phillips and his campaign obviously came to an end for those of you watching and listening dean phillips was until recently run against biden on the democrat side and he faced this problem in spades i think he probably faced all the problems you faced plus the additional problem was that he was absolutely 100% shut out of the entire democrat apparatus people were literally told that if they worked for him they would never do anything politically again in their life and then also he had to face the same reaction from the legacy media and so he didn't get it and i don't think that he was attuned well enough to the alternative media let's say you know the podcast crowd and all that to capitalize on that quickly plus they tend to tilt more in the classic liberal conservative direction anyways okay so you had to face this problem of getting on the map at all so how did that unfold so so one of the things i did and this is where you know i took good advice you were one of the early people who offered a reflection on this and you know i said what what's the downside in trying it makes a lot of sense to me is if the traditional media is ignoring you go to the non-traditional media as a way to reach the people and so i adopted strategy let's call it a maxim early in the campaign which was the talk to everyone and anyone's strategy okay left right center cable news non-cable news print media smalltime media local media individuals walking on the street recording it and putting it on social media i wore a you know i'm wearing a little camera or i'm wearing a little what do you call it a little microphone right now i wore a microphone pretty much everywhere i went we just clip the conversations and put it out now my social media following was a lot smaller than than it ended up being at the end of the campaign but still that was just a way of putting out my message into the world and what we started to notice was you know most of those things would get relatively small reach but in a few instances there were a lot of interactions where people actually began to take interest to say wait a minute that's an interaction of a kind that i haven't seen before that's interesting to me some of them were not necessarily casting me in the most flattering light i might not have looked good right just even visually you know the things that i would have said were sometimes a little bit unscripted may not have been said as eloquently as i might have prepared for in a speech or a tv interview but that was actually part of what made it appealing and so that started to take off i think allowed the campaign there were a couple moments and then i got called i happened to be in new york city and they said do you want to come on don lemon's show right because many republican candidates aren't going to go on there so they thought they have a republican candidate who's running why don't you go ahead and go on don lemon's show we had a kind of interaction where this man lost went haywire i had just given a speech at the nra meeting and he picked on one particular thing that i said which is a fact of history that black americans in the united states did not get to enjoy their civil rights until they actually had their second amendment rights and the first anti-gun laws that were passed in the united states were designed to keep gun guns out of the hands of black americans and that was part of a broader historical trend where even countries like china or iran or other countries around the world that claim to offer the same bill of rights that the us offers don't have a second amendment and so don lemon and and the funny thing happened actually i thought this would be a bit of an aside but i'll i'll offer it they said there was a list of topics see these are the some of the tricks that the mainstream media plays it was really interesting there was a whole litany of topics they said this is what they would like to talk to you about i forget what it was it was something related to china policy which you know i i believe that the us needs to declare independence from china they gave a couple of others but i specifically remember that being one of them and then you go on the set and what do you know is they've pulled a airlifted quotes from my speech at the nra meeting with their own commentary as the wraparound as the leading into the interview when they have purposefully given me it's not like they didn't think about it or they said we're not going to tell you what we're going to talk about said this is exactly what we're going to talk about a litany for a you know relatively new presidential candidate first time on their show here's a litany of what we're going to talk about and it was not that it was that they decided to change topics in a in a spontaneous way it was designed as a trap and so in that case anyway i gave don lemon on air a history lesson which caused him to it ended up being a big favor for me on the campaign lose his mind you know the earpiece that he had in he was screaming at the people who were the producers in his ears saying it was distracting him as was engaged in this debate with me it was such an uncomfortable moment for everybody involved including anybody watching it that it ended up being the new york times reported the next couple of days later the catalyst for don lemon actually getting fired by cnn and so i had a few interactions like that that that started to kind of increase the steam behind people at least paying attention to my candidacy and and things went on from there so let me ask you about well let me ask you about that so i want to know what other moments went viral right so that's that's a really interesting one because one of the well there's two things about that that i find particularly interesting the first is the way that these mainstream legacy media journalists set up the people that they're interviewing so the game seems to be and this has happened to me many many times the game is very straightforward the game is we will poke and prod at you with illin informed but provocative opinions hoping that by being as a annoying as possible you will say something fatally stupid demolish your reputation online and elevate my reputation the journalist as an investigator who can then walk away with like your scalp so to speak on his belt now that's that's a and so that's the kind of interview you face where every single word the interviewer utters is a verbal trap okay but my my experience has been that if you keep your head during that interchange and you don't play the game so you don't say anything stupid you don't apologize you don't get upset that that can turn viciously viciously in your favor and you said okay and so that's interesting so i'd like to see your thoughts on that and then i'd also like to know what other things you did in the alternative media and direct to consumer direct to voter model that also went viral you know some of that's chance right if you put out 50 clips you're going to get a pito distribution of effect but did you start to see a pattern for the clips that you got okay so let's let's unwrap that let's start with the gacha journalism first of all well well the gacha journalism so my strategy ended up being it wasn't really a strategy i think it's sort of how i'm wired first was to do exactly what you said just rationally process exactly what they're telling you and respond rationally as the person on the other side increasingly loses their mind cu you're not doing what they expected or planned or set you up to do which in turn i think makes them look i think far more illogical as a consequence when they were actually taking the rafan populist republican to try to make fry of them even for their own audience they end up looking like the less reasonable ones so i went in the breakfast club had major viral exchange there where a woman she was pressing me hard on the fact that i had only ever really had major accomplishments in the business world that had never been in public service with utter unawareness that the last and i believe successful president of the united states donald trump came with a very similar background and yeah i think she was frustrated that i wasn't falling into her traps and then she ended up giving a soliloquy about her experience in sixth grade where she put together a coalition for lunch money or something like this which to her own audience which is a largely left of center audience broadly panned saying that we don't want to really hear about your sixth grade experience we understand that somebody who has accomplished things in the business world can at least have a legitimate case for having his ideas heard this is coming from the left don lemons firing i had an exchange with chuck todd where he said are you how can you have the level of certainty that there are two genders and i explained in the manner of somebody who happens to have a biology degree which i i don't usually like using you don't need a biology degree to know something about biology you don't need to have a harvard degree to be able to have standing to speak on a subject of science but i have those things and for an audience that particularly wrongfully elevates their attachment of value to those degrees i decided to use that in my favor and broke down for him here's what two x chromosomes mean here's what an x and a y chromosome mean and that exchange went viral as well and i think this one was more by chance but he quickly was was no longer on the air at meet the press which was his made show shortly after i had done the same thing with don lemon shortly after we had exchanges like that at the breakfast club and then you think about the exchanges that i had on social media that ended up being the one ones that really caught the public imagination were again interactions that i had in the field let's call it at the iowa state fair at other places where we had protesters or people who were purposefully trying to either disrupt my events or others i got to give them credit who were respectful but sharply disagreed with what i had to say and approached me in one-off conversations that weren't performative but they were real conversations authentic conversations between people who deeply disagreed on subject matter and so if i'm to put those together both between the corporate media realm as well as in the in the let's just say real world translated social media digital realm that's the through line that i would draw is the thing that really ended up creating not just oneoff but this ended up being a series of probably three four months in there of repeated verality of interactions that were nothing more than the kind of interactions that i've been having for all of my adult life which i enjoy which i thrive on you know think about the people i went to school with at places like harvard or yale predominantly had political views that were different from mine i leaned libertarian most of them lean liberal some of them are even friends of mine and remain friends of mine to this day authentic heated but earnest exchanges and some cases the person on the other side wasn't necessarily authentic in their motives take the don lemon but you treat them as though they are and then they self- imilate in front of you that ended up really lifting up the campaign in this case now far earlier than we expected okay because when we saw me not lifting up off the ground i think i calibrated myself to saying okay this is going to be a long haul it's going to be only after the debates begin and let me at least try to qualify for those debates let me at least make that table stakes that i would qualify for the debates and then after that it would be a steady buildup instead something started happening where when i took the talk to everyone's strategy leftwing media rightwing media corporate media podcasts and interactions we actually saw a pickup that was then far earlier than i expected after i had recalibrated my own expectations and that created new problems of its own actually [music]
