so hello everybody i am here with tom holland tom holland is a novelist and author historical author he has written several books and his latest book called dominion looks at the intellectual impact and moral impact of christianity on the west and how it shaped the way the west saw itself and how it saw morality and its own identity i finished reading the book a few weeks ago and i was very impressed several people kept pointing me towards the book and said you have to read dominion you have to read dominion because it fell within this strange post secular or i would say people who are questioning the way that secular society has viewed itself in the past few few years and so it felt like his book fell right into there and so i'm really excited to have this discussion with him and to explore a little bit about his idea of what this means for for the world today and so so tom thank you for accepting to do this i thought maybe i could start maybe you can tell me a little bit just to start for people who don't know about you what the impetus for writing this book particular book was well thanks very much for having me the i guess this is a book that had been kind of brewing in my mind for maybe a couple of decades really i about so in end of right at the end of the 1990s i began writing a history aimed at a popular market set in in the period that i'm particularly interested in which is the classical roman in particular so i wrote i wrote a book about the fall of the roman republic and then i wrote a book about the the greco-persian wars so marathon from what police alamus and so on and this had always these had always been the kind of periods that i'd loved as a child and i'd kind of identified with the greeks i'd identified with the romans i'm in the greek context i'd always like really identified with their gods but the process of writing these books and having to really get inside the heads of of these very alien people brought home to me just how far removed i was as someone living in the late 20th century early 21st century from pretty much everything they took for granted and in in the introduction you kind of mentioned the moral side the ethical side but i think in a sense it kind of went even deeper than that it was pretty much every aspect of classical society seemed increasingly weird and i guess things that seem might seem familiar they they they were kind of false friends they kind of deluded you into thinking that you know just because the romans had dinner parties or enjoyed public entertainments or kind of worried about their property somehow they were like us actually they weren't at all and lots of things that i kind of lazily assumed were pretty fundamental sex family how you view society i came to realize weren't unique these were not at all how people in the cr pre-christian world had understood things and it was as fundamental as as the problems that i had writing about them that using it the english language i began to realize that there were so many words that were just freighted with all kinds of significations all kinds of meanings that would have meant nothing to the romans nothing to the greeks and the more i thought about it the more i came to realize that what was stopping me from feeling a sense of commonality with the romans was basically christianity that christianity was like a kind of great cloud of incense that had gusted up and although i could see through the incense clouds i could kind of make out the shape of of roman history it was almost impossible to get rid of this this incense cloud and in a way it kind of distorted what what what i was seeing and so that was something that i felt you know writing about the classical world over two decades now and then also i wrote a book about the origins of islam so i had to kind of really immerse myself in the islamic world in the way that that islam has has kind of calibrated how it understands reality and and again that served to sharpen for me just how deeply christian my assumptions were and so i wrote dominion basically to put that thesis to the test see how you know how how far back can i trace what i take for granted as a westerner in the early 21st century how far back do they go and where and what if i trace these leads back where do they end up and almost invariably it ended up i thought with christianity and and so that's i wrote the book i'm not 100 certain that that this thesis would would would turn out to be okay but i'm hugely relieved that actually pretty much he did i mean the process of writing it confirmed me in my kind of gut what had been a gut instinct it seems to me i mean this is something that i've also been thinking about for for decades as well the i would call it the enlightenment overlay of the classical world or kind of like the the influence of edward gibbon especially on the way we understand christianity and the way we understand the ancient world we and the renaissance as well these kind of moments in in christian history or these moments in western history where people have tried to revive the classics they've always done it in a way that ended up putting a christian veneer on those classics and ended up putting a christian veneer on there even though they used ancient society or this notion of the of the greek city or the roman empire as a way to criticize the contemporary world they nonetheless were doing it through christian eyes and they couldn't help it and and it seems like today with post-modernism one of the great effects of post-modernism is that because it's breaking down grand narratives it's actually helping us see more clearly those things like we have a capacity to look let's say at the classical world for look at it for what it is rather than be blind at our own presuppositions as much as we did let's say 50 or 60 years ago yeah i think it's i mean in almost in all kinds of ways when when we look back at the classical world we're looking at it through christian lenses and that's kind of obvious you know if you're talking about aristotle or the idea of what let's say democracy would be would be an example that i'm thinking about a great deal at the moment oddly because i'm writing a children's book i'm writing a book for young adults which is a history of ancient greece and the gimmick in this is that the gods are real so they actually exist and the legends that the athenians tell about themselves are true so the athenians thought that they were sprung from the soil they were autonomous they believed that they had to pay respect to the gods or else you know the city would fall to pieces they felt that they had a particular relationship with goddess athena obviously and in a sense there was this kind of matrix of they're born from the soil the gods look after them so you've got earth and you've got heaven and democracy is an attempt to give form to that and it we translate it as people power but actually demos doesn't really mean people in that sense demos is the kind of totality of people who live within attica who who have been shaped by this kind of autonomous origin and who are the favorites of athena and so in that sense it includes women as well as men the role of men is to fight and to debate in the assembly but the role of women is to tend the temples to and in particular to kind of relate to say demeter at the great shrine of elusive and particularly to mediate with athena and if you look at democracy through contemporary eyes secular eyes then that idea seems ridiculous because because we think of something called religion which is separate to the important things that the men are doing so what what the women are doing is kind of mad stuff that you shove in a corner maybe give a couple of paragraphs in a book but otherwise don't think about but if you kind of it's about rewilding ancient greece if you bring the gods back then suddenly this seems incredibly important and you understand that the way that we understand democracy as being about rights as being about rights that that individuals have that this is holy alien to the way the greeks understood it but we that we think of democracy in that terms because we've been christianized because we our understanding of democracy is about you know essentially the idea that every voter in a state has value by virtue of well of what i mean kind of essentially ideas of rights the greeks had no sense of rights at all that wasn't what they were about and so we s our what we mean by democracy and what the athenians meant by democracy is completely different and we cannot really even imagine what it's like to live in a state where athena is real because those gods have been banished so completely by christianity that in that sense we are their heirs complete we're we're we're soviets of christianity that we don't even realize what it is that we're seeing when we look back at the pre-christian world of democracy yes but there are new gods on the horizon right now it seems as we look around we can see as christianity is waning and i think that we like you said we can't avoid the christian overlay but within that waning we can see these these new gods kind of pop up and they they have a christian veneer to them you know like the social justice god has a has a strange christian taste to it but there's something else going on which is i'm not sure exactly what what it is there's also something in your in your text which i really appreciate it i think that the the chapters that i appreciated the most were the the modern chapters or the mod the when they start when we start at the enlightenment because we have in the enlightenment narrative is such an important part of the way that we're trained in school because the the training of our mind also has a there's a reason why they train them the way they do and as you talk about the enlightenment and then at the end of the enlightenment you talk about the vande massacre and then you bring in assad the marquis de sade at the end there's this this idea that as christian as the christian veneer starts to fade there's also something else there's a promise to something else on the horizon which is coming and is and and is not necessarily what you what you might expect well the marquis de sade is is is a kind of the great satirist of the enlightenment and of the pretensions of the french revolution because sard kind of properly recognizes what it is to reject christianity and his contempt for christianity foreshadows nietzsche's which is kind of similarly blistering that both sard and nietzsche are able to identify in the classical world the kind of will to power the the contempt for the weak the the the kind of adoration of the strong there was a kind of very you know a vital part of of the way that classical culture did kind of understand the world and which we tend to shrink from and part of what the enlightenment was doing was was kind of riffing on on a kind of a christian idea that idol and idols have to be toppled and superstition has to be banished which of course you know goes back ultimately to the hebrew prophets i mean that's kind of a constant idea and the early christian missionaries in in early medieval europe are literally kind of toppling idols you know they're chopping down trees they're sawing them up and turning them into chapels and the protestant reformation is is riffing on the same theme only it's now taking the roman church as as the kind of sump of idolatry that has to be drained and the enlightenment is doing exactly the same but it's now turning its fire on the whole edifice of christianity and so it needs something that it can look back to that precedes christianity and so it enshrines athenian democracy the roman republic greek philosophy as the kind of model of an enlightened society that enlightened people in the'th century should probably try and return to but sard is a kind of sardonic commentator on that because you know he lives through the french revolution i mean he's literally kevin he's in the bastille a couple of days before they they stormed the bastille and saad recognizes that this is an illusion that that there's nothing rational you know the the the idea that that that by kind of overthrowing churches and guillotining kings you're somehow going back to an enlightened is is is folly and it's kind of devastating i mean that's why he's such a dark figure i think yeah kind of terrifying one of the let's say one of my theories in the past few years that i've been trying to bring about is that christianity is a is really a union of of opposites it's a union of in the the christian idea of christ as the union of god and man there's this whole idea that he unifies these extremes in into himself the cross itself is both this this image of of a man being murdered as a criminal but with an ins with a sign at the top of his head saying that he's the king so it's always this union of opposites and my theory has been that the modern world or the modern movement away from christianity has been a kind of the incarnation and we are seeing the opposites pull apart and so one of the opposites would be saad and the will to power rising up and this kind of this idea of absolute power that comes down from above and just imposes but the other is the the other let's say parody of that which is the the the reign of the weak or the weak that wants justice for themselves and so the the communists you know you you can see it in the opposite of the nazis and the communists it's an easy way to understand it where warranted is absolute order cutting off anything marginal that doesn't fit just burning it off and the other is taking all the marginal stuff and raising it up to the the highest ground and so i don't know if you've ever thought about it in those terms well and i think about it in a slightly different term because i i i think that the french revolution and then the russian revolution and the the kind of ripples out from from marx are very much going with the grain of christian tradition because actually what's radical about the crucifixion isn't the torture it's the fact that the tortured person triumphs over the torturer it's it's the idea that the slave actually turns out to be the king that you know the first will be last and the last shall be first that is what's really paradoxical that's what's really novel because there's no great paradox in the idea that the strongest role the paradox lies in the fact that it's the weak who are strong and that's what the french revolution plays with that's what the russian revolution play with and even though they famously notoriously reject institutional christianity they actually do it for very christian reasons they see you know the french revolutionaries see the church as an overweening powerful institution that has kept the poor downtrodden so likewise the the bolsheviks in the russian revolution to a degree now in you know the past summer people who are pushing social justice causes are targeting churches and the statues of missionaries and so on because they see them as being hegemonic as being kind of i don't know heteronormative and sexist and whatever white supremacist then yeah it's an embodiment of of of what is first that has to be become last i think that the nazis the fascists let's say the fascists more properly say looking mussolini before hitler the fascists are consciously obsessed by the pre-classical world in a kind of sardian sense they worship its its strength its glory they're not interested in the weak the downtrodden the poor and they look to the future they look to a supposedly you know post-christian world where it will all be it'll go away oh yeah it'll be kind of airplanes and steel and you know i mean kind of highways and the trains are run on time and all that kind of stuff and it's a fusion of the pre-christian and the supposedly post-christian now of course there are christian elements within within fascism hitler and mussolini were both catholic they were both very clearly drew on the kind of the the the mastery of spectacle that the catholic church embodied the strain of anti-semitism in in nazism particularly clearly drawing on on the great inheritance of christian anti-semitism which has been a kind of stain right right right from the beginning and the apocalyptic strain the the idea of a thousand year reich that also is part of the mix but i think that just reflects the way in which even the nazis find it impossible completely to get to get rid of the christian inheritance because to a degree that no one has done since the time of constantine the nazis do succeed in rejecting not just institutional christianity but the entire framework of values and ethics that christians and post-christians have upheld of which the two major ones are precisely the idea that the first shall be last and the last should be first the nazis do not believe that the nazis do not believe that weakness is a source of strength they see weakness as a source of weakness and therefore to be crushed and eliminated and the nazis repudiate the idea which the french revolutionaries with their their their their proclamation of universal values universal rights and the and this and the communists with their proclamation of the universal dictatorship of the proletariat both uphold the idea that there is a kind of commonality of human experience the nazis decisively reject that they repudiate the poor line idea that there is no jew or greek absolutely jews and greeks are completely different and that's what provides them with the license to to to launch genocide yeah and i think that there's a a sense in which the shock that that delivered to the west was so profound that now in a sense although we remain deeply christian we remain christian because we're horrified by the nazi distortion of christianity rather than because we're obedient to what christianity actually teaches so we we are we we get our christian morals and ethics from from our revulsion at the at the nazis who who rejected it yeah well i think i think that i agree with most of what you're saying i think that the only place and i saw this when i was reading the book there was a little there were these little places where i wanted to push back on on your thesis a little bit and it started right away at the beginning when you mentioned that saint paul talks about of course this this passage that you mentioned that there is no jew or greek there is no man or woman but then there are other texts where saint paul talks about a natural hierarchy between man and woman for example and i remember the way you phrase it was that he doesn't dare to go to the end of his own of his own thinking let's say he doesn't want to push it to the end and i think that for me that is the place where i'm not sure i that i agree in the sense that if you if like i said i see even in the story of christ for example there's a reason why christ is shown as entering jerusalem in glory before he's crucified right yet he's hailed his king and then he's crucified as a criminal right those two images are there to kind of act as this this joining of opposite so the cross is there yes as this idea that the last is the first and the and the weak can you know that there's a joining of these opposites but there's also the moment right before where he's hailed as as the king and coming into the city and we see that all through in my vision when we see that all through christianity where for example christianity never does create at least at the beginning doesn't create a social revolution it it the christians martyrs die and they die and they die and then the emperor converts and now then you find this strange balance and you see how the balance happen over and over you know the the the germans and the the northerners come in they kill they kill they kill then they convert and then they become knights and they integrate the hierarchy where at least the ideal of the knight is to use power and authority to protect the weak so then you have this balance of this idea that yes we have an hierarchy yes we have power yes we have even empire but the purpose of empire is to protect the weak and so it's not the we it's not the same as the weak take com rising up and taking power that i don't see i don't see neither in the christian story nor in the early church or the early martyrs or and i see that you frame it like for example you frame the gregorian reforms that kind of like that wow i don't know go ahead well i i mean clearly christ's crucifixion you know christ's death on the cross would be meaningless if he were not the king yeah i mean otherwise it's it's nothing and people say a guy dying you know unless christ is risen then then then what we believe is folly you know it's not it it it has no hope at all so it is fundamental to christ's mission that he is indeed god as as as well as as man otherwise there's there's nothing there so yes absolutely and i completely agree that you know paul is not interested in preaching social revolution that's not what he's about and i think that he's not absolutely certain what he is about and i i and and i mean that you know that coming from other other way you know i suppose particularly jewish and muslim the immense bodies of law [music] you know whether it's the talmud or the sunnah or whatever what's what's really striking about paul is that his letters are not meant to be prescriptive like that they that they are in a sense dramatic monologues you know they they they are quite close to say cicero's speeches you know you when you write when he's writing to the galatians you you sense what the other guy might say you know as you do when you read a cicero's speech you only get cicero's okay but but what you also get with paul is the sense that he's he's he's thinking aloud so that's in that sense that it's a kind of dramatic monologue and you constantly feel and that's why i found so powerful about it he he is wrestling with something that he cannot put into words he's cut he's struggling to compute what it means and my guess is that whether he has a vision on the road to damascus or not i mean what you agreed i don't know whether we can trust that accountant acts as as being a historical record but something like that clearly does happen he clearly does have some overwhelming experience in which he comes to realize that this crucified criminal is is in some way god and i can only assume that he comes to that conclusion because he has the revelation and then he he has to think what's going on here i mean how whoa and and and then he he he said he's a highly literate man steeped in in the scriptures of his people and so he goes through and he reads the scriptures and it's reading the scriptures that gives him the kind of sense of of what's gone on he he interprets the scriptures retrospectively through his experience and so he then has to try and formulate what this means and the letters seem to me a pr an attempt to try and explain that and that's why they are so incredibly fertile for future generations is that in a sense paul himself isn't entirely clear what it is that he's trying to say but because they are kind of marinated in the incredible richness of the the jewish scriptural tradition and also of course the fact that paul is is someone moving around the roman world this globalized world and he has a working knowledge of of of he writes in greek he he knows about stoicism all of this is a kind of blends together to create this incredible well i mean i kind of think of it as a depth charge that goes off underneath fabric of of the of the roman world and it it ripples outwards in ways that perhaps paul would would find completely shocking and so that that thing you know the the there's no greek or do no man or woman knows label free which which seems so fundamental to the way that that we in the west now think and organize ourselves morally ethically societally of course the the key phrases in that is in christ jesus you know it's not a manifesto for social revolution but but the potential is there yeah you can see and those ripples go spilling out and spilling out and spilling out or it's an acorn you know it's a tiny acorn from which this great oak would grow and part again part of the power of christianity is that it lends itself so prodigiously to metaphor to parable i mean that's the other great thing is that is is it's i hope i don't just focus on paul because there's also the parables the power of those parables to effect change and in a way they are even more influential so i the the last chapter you know i begin with the migration crisis in europe where you have angela merkel saying yeah okay come on in and victor orban saying no don't come in you're a bunch of muslims we're defending christian europe let's put up the let's put up the barbed wire offense merkel merkel is clearly inspired by the by the parable with samaritan you know the the whole of this transformative convulsive episode that had such an impact on on on europe is ultimately due to a short story interesting i one of the questions i really wanted to pose for to you and i have two questions left i guess is have you thought a little about a little bit about this idea of this death of christianity and this this breakdown or we can see the influences of christianity kind of spreading out and and what i'd see as becoming opposites have you thought about the i the image of antichrist that is given in christianity both in saint paul and and you see it in the gospels obviously in revelation the idea that somehow the the breakdown of christianity is part of the story that christianity itself sets itself up to die that it's gonna die and there's something that's gonna there's there's a there's a mechanism within the very pattern which is is is going to upend it and going to to to to destroy it or to it's going to it's going to scandal is going to happen as christ said right scandal needs to happen but woe to those by whom it happens and so i was wondering if you had thought a little bit about that pattern in your in in your thinking well okay so two responses to that one is the the the story of antichrist which then of course bleeds into revelation so antichrist first appears in in paul's letters but then it bleeds into revelation and becomes a kind of entire mythology of the future which it is incredible and continues to be incredibly powerful but it's something that i think that certainly in in the west christians have become embarrassed about and the whole kind of supernatural superstructure of angels and devils and heaven and hell has become a kind of thing of mockery so so the the the viral video of trump's spiritual advisor summoning angels from africa i mean people just found it you know hilarious and i think that that's a problem for institutional christianity if if all this stuff is seen as being you know essentially risible and even you know i don't know what you know bishops here in england i mean they they rather steal from a poor box and talk about angels i think or devils i mean it's all you know but i think that that is you know that that that is a crucial part of it and i think that that's one of the reasons why the church is growing so explosively in africa is that perhaps you know that dimension of spirits of of angels and and devils it seems much closer or why pentecostalism is by miles the fastest growing expression of christianity globally is because there people do take spirits they do take it you know seriously and they kind of open themselves up to it so i think that in a way that you know the antichrist the devil you know it's such a crucial part of the christian story but in a way it's it's the part of it that's hardest for me to get to to get to get back at i can kind of look at it as you know rather you know to to in a way it's it's a it's a source of great frustration to me because the power of it is so incredible and you just have to go through christian history and realize how i mean it just kind of changes i mean kind of everything ever all is endlessly coming back yeah and endlessly compulsive you know the great thing in in the reformation is is is it it's one of the things that joins you know it's the truly ecumenical thing is both sides sinking the other around christ yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think that there are keys to rega recapturing that i guess i would say part of my work what a large part of my work is help people recapture it in a way that is that fits within even modern categories and it's really i think that going back and also understanding some kind of what you see in the church father is if you look at the righteous father say maximus or gregor of nisa the more intellectual fathers you could say you find keys in there to help you deal with the problem of angels and it has to do with the notion of intelligences and and pattern and the idea that there are pattern beings above us we know there are because cities are patterned beings above us they they have a pattern and they're we can recognize them as as existing we can say london exists even though it's a million of details and you can still see that it exists and so it has an intelligence it has something like i can write to london and london will answer me right i can write to my city and it'll answer me i can complain to the city and the city will answer me and the person who's writing the letter is not is not the person answering me really they're just a tool of the of the city and so we get as we start as we as we're if we're able to perceive that there are there are patterns which exist above just material reality and those patterns stack up from a person to a family to a community to a to a city et cetera et cetera then the idea that let's say the angel of new york can fall and then that's it new york's gonna go down right if if it's spirit falls then it's then it's over but we we are able to recognize this spirit right because i can recognize a new yorker even if i'm in canada i can recognize someone from chicago i know i there are ways to recognize people who belong to corporate bodies that are higher than than the that's a an individual and those those become ways to recapture and especially with the new science of consciousness like the these new ideas that the inevitability of consciousness to for reality to appear to us right the categories are go through our intelligence it's harder and harder to to to ignore that then we can then notice these corporate beings of course we can't we can't do it like you said you know it exactly yet in the same way that ancient people can because we're we're so materialist that it's hard for us to encounter it but we get there's a subtle capacity to encounter corporate beings like i said you can you can still you can write to santa claus and santa claus will answer you you can write to all kinds of corporate beings and they they answer but i one of the one of the chapters that i ended up not writing basically because i know you're orthodox aren't you yeah so so i decided i couldn't i wasn't going to go into orthodox christianity because it was just too huge topic yeah but if i had done all if i had done orthodox christianity as well then i would have linked dostoevsky and nature and the the the obvious parable in in dostoevsky is the parable of the grand inquisitor in brothers for amazon and i think that what that touches on is dostoevsky sense that there is perhaps something within latin christianity that has kind of inevitably moved towards atheism that there's there's a progress within everything that that that has made latin christianity so dynamic and and so incapable of of staying still that has ultimately kind of inevitably led to it to atheism has inevitably led to you know christ returns and the grand inquisitor locks him up you know angels are irradiated devils are banished we we get rid of everything and we end up with auschwitz that that europe's experience of of modernity is is in a way shadowed by by western christendom's suicide the the the there are dimensions and you know and it's not just western you know it's there's something within christianity that leads to its own inevitable termination i think it does well i think there's a resurrection but i do think that it leads i think there's something there's a cr christ set up a pattern that was going to lead to personal death and then corp corporate death and it was just par it's a frag it's a fractal pattern that is repeating itself and so i to me i'm not i don't like it but i'm not surprised that it's happening because it's there in christ's story it's there in christ's story and he's rejected by his own people like christ is it's judas who betrays him it's from within his disciples that he was going to he was going to be betrayed it's atheism had to rise out of christianity there was no other place where it could come from because it's that that's the pattern of the story and you know desacralization is often you know it has long been applied to protestantism and and i think that's that that's true i think that that protestantism does consciously kind of aims to de-sacralize an enormous amount that that catholicism had represented but the whole christianity is a process of desacralization you know i think of milton's great poem on the nativity which essentially consists of all the gods going oh milton describes the greek gods egyptian gods the canaanite gods basically all being banished you know for milton the gods are real but they're demons what then happens is that christians come to think that they never existed yeah you know these ancient gods never existed and then that's kind of intermediate stage and then from that it's not that much further to go on saying well actually christian god never existed so there's a sense in which christians are sitting on a branch and sawing that branch off yeah and and all those all those all those all those gods are waiting to to to eat us up like the mouth of hell at the bottom once the branch gets cut off we'll see it's it's it's hard to know what's going to happen but that we can feel the let's say we can see all these all the principalities now fighting to know which one is going to rule you see but you see i think i think that there is i think that people cannot survive without let's call it myth in the non-pejorative sense sense that there is a kind of potent story that explains things more deeply and profoundly than than the shell of reality does and in a way all the kind of you know the movie franchises harry potter and avengers and lord of the rings and all that kind of stuff it's kind of an ersatz attempt to fill in the gap it's it's expressive of people's ache for for the kind of story that the churches used to tell yeah i don't think that the churches have the confidence to tell that story anymore i think that that and so i think that the the kind of the cultural the moral the spiritual brew that the churches serve up is is very anemic it it's not satisfying in the way that that story used to be i think the same is also true of of secular humanism i think it's true of you know of social justice movements i think it's incredibly telling that social justice movements kind of almost despite themselves reach after the kind of gestures and displays and narratives that clearly demonstrate that they are deriving from christianity they're washing people's feet toppling statues proclaiming that you know slaves have been brought into a promised land all these stories but because they've been divorced from the kind of fabric of of from which these stories originally emerged you know they've been divorced from the matrix of that they seem to me kind of well a bit dull to be honest yeah kind of dull and hectoring and unable for instance to kind of hook into the the mainframe of people's emotional and and spiritual responses in the way that social the the civil rights movement could because martin luther king you know he could he could invoke the crucifixion he could invoke the story of exodus he could echo the language of the cadences of the bible and do it in a way that didn't feel as acts now he was summoning the immense heft of this incredible story and i think that that's that that that's why the civil rights movement had the impact that it did why it came to be almost so universally accepted and why today's kind of social justice movements are far far more divisive because they they cannot tap into you know not only do they can they not tap into these stories but they kind of set themselves against it the echoes that they they have within themselves of these stories are something that that objectively they're guarding against you know the id is is absolutely part of it but the ego is standing full square against it and i think that that makes their appeal incredibly limited and so i think that you know my prescription for for christianity to make a kind of you know come back in terms of people going to church and sitting in pews would be for christian leaders to embrace everything that they spent the past century rejecting the kind of i you know christianity in the west seems to me a palette similar yeah it used to be yeah well it's i think that it's at least in the one of the reasons why i became orthodox was also because i could see you know i'm i'm mostly an artist and i noticed and i learned about the the pattern of storytelling and the pattern of image making it's a it's really like almost like a sacred algebra and it's a self-contained language that moves between imagery and architecture and music and all of this and so in discovering that i realized that it's i believe i believe that if we rediscover the stories and the legends especially if we if we stop being sola scripture all the legends and we let's say we at least understand their function we can understand the function of the legends and the function of the wilder aspects of our tradition then there are ways back in they're they're harder but there are ways back in using phenomenological approaches to existence you know i tell people yes the you know the sun the earth turns around the sun but the sun still gets up in the morning you can't avoid that and the sun still goes down in the evening and you can't avoid it and your day is still managed by that pattern so that pattern is real and and the fact that our days and the the liturgical cycle follows the natural patterns those can still be real when you watch you know when you watch the leaves fall those are real patterns of death and rebirth that you're experiencing so when christ is born in the cave on nativity and it's the lowest day of the year and it's the solstice this is a real experience you can have of the of the shortest day and the seed planted in darkness which will rise again because the because it actually follows a natural pattern of of nature you can't yeah you can't completely get rid of it i entirely understand the tug of of orthodoxy i mean i i really do but but equally what i found when i was writing dominion and i was kind of you know it was kind of it was like a constant process of kind of rushing into another sweetie shop and gorging myself on suites and then not having to you know i had to kind of rush off and go to another one i mean i could happily have spent you know years in any of the periods that i write about but i found that it was again and again there were certain points where what i was writing about was personal for me and i so pilgrim's progress for instance actually seems to me you know this was this was the most read book after the bible in england for for centuries after bunyan wrote it and i remember reading it as a child and returning to it it it just i just kind of allude to it in a single sentence not by name in dominion but it was kind of quite important in in opening my eyes to you know reminding me of the power of the protestant story you know that kind of dissenting non-conformist understanding and that's done through through a story and that story seemed you know incredibly vivid to me this this time under lockdown i had my eyes open to the way that the canterbury tales chaucer's canterbury tales is is full of a kind of christian magic in a way that i'd never understood eating it before because the opening of the canterbury tales i would i had been planning to to walk with my brother through kent so in april you know country tales famously opens with with april and the pilgrims meeting in a pub in in south london reading in lockdown unable to go and meet pilgrims you know unable to go and do this walk with my brother made me think god how amazing it would be to go to a pub until not socially distanced with people meet up with total strangers and get out of london and go and walk to canterbury and chaucer specifies that people going to canterbury to talk to the tomb of thomas beckett because he makes people who are sick well i suddenly thought of course plague was endemic in london when chaucer was writing this and it's worse over the winter so the whole thing about going on pilgrimage in april is you can you can escape the play you can escape the death and you can go to the shrine and you can give thanks for you know the fact that you're alive that you're you're out there that you're with other people and suddenly i had a sense of how powerful it must be to go on pilgrimage to a shrine like the one that that was in canterbury until the reformation and you know and and i felt like you know this was you know this was part of my past part of my cultural reading part of my cultural inheritance suddenly being given fresh life by the experience of the pandemic so kind of sense of light coming out of the darkness and those kind of experiences as is what the the the the process of of thinking about christianity in the way that i have done for what the past five years has given me it's it's kind of made me alert personally i mean i just for me to the incredible wealth of of the different ways of seeing the world kind of like taking a drug that it kind of changes the way you see color changes the way that you you experience reality and that's what christianity you know gives it had this incredible inheritance of literature of of art of music of sensory experience you know of travel all this kind of stuff and i feel so grateful that i've gone through it and that i know that it will continue to give me these incredible experiences these incredible insights and and what a you know what a resource that is but i do think that that you know the questions about well what what is is that enough for for people or is it do you need more and of course that's a question that i do wrestle with quite a lot what about what about i don't know like i don't know your your let's say your situation right now i mean what has it for you has it been enough to kind of bring you actually into church like would it would it be enough to bring you into church yeah so i when i was writing the book i went to a number of churches you know if i was writing about the reformation i go to a lutheran church and so on and i there's a wonderful church in london which was founded in the reign of henry the first but supposedly by his jester who got ill and went to rome and perfect church for right now yeah absolutely i had a vision of saint bartholomew who told him to go back and found a hospital in a priory so he did that and so the church is a part of what was the priory and the hospital saint bartholomew's is still a functioning hospital in the middle of london so that's a norman church where the virgin appeared it's the only appearance of the virgin in london and she turned up and kind of bollocked a load of monks he was saying the literally wrong and then vanished and then chunks of it got closed down in the reformation sold off and what had been the lady chapel became a printer's where benjamin franklin worked for a year so the whole church seemed to me perfect embodiment of everything that dominion is about so i fell very much in love with it it's kind of beautifully done but also i had this amazing experience in in the church in the village where i grew up where my mother still goes to church which is very much the kind of protestant experience of a great preacher suddenly catching fire and pentecostal flame coming down and it was this this woman who who you know it was incredibly drab service i thought it was going to be it was kind of about eight eight eight of us huddled in in quiet stools very early in the morning and she just gave this amazing service where she talked about the dove at the baptism coming down and how the dove was a sacrificial animal in the temple so christ was baptized with blood as well as with water and how this was a form of you know pregnancy you know giving birth and it was so literate and it was so scholarly and it was so emotional and it was so beautiful and i just kind of went wow that's that's incredible so i did i i i have had you know it's i haven't just studied christianity as though it's a kind of butterfly pinned on a board i have kind of experienced the the slipstream of it the top of it very very powerfully well that's oh that's wonderful i all i can say is i looking forward to seeing where you will you end up on this path let's say and where you're going in these reflections and so i want to encourage everybody to to get dominion everybody watches it's definitely worth it it's very refreshing like i said the chapters especially the chapters as we move towards modernity there really is this momentum that gets built up and you start to see let's say the the consequence of his thesis of tom's thesis which is you know how this is going to influence even as christianity's being is being eroded we see the influence continue and so it becomes very magical as the book continues and so tom thank you thank you for your time and i really enjoyed our discussion thanks very much for having me all right it's good to talk to you
