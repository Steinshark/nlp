the galaxy s 11 is looking like a lot of things some of them are really impressive and then others not so much fessing first cameras and samsung phones have heard consistently good cameras for a while now but the imaging hardware itself has not taken a big leap forward into the galaxy s7 that is about to change with their new at 64 megapixel isocell bright gw one image sensors samsung phones are about to take not just high-resolution photos but ones with even greater dynamic range now with faster autofocus it's also looking likely that it's going to allow for 480 frame per second continuous slow motion video in clean full hd resolution now the s 11 plus is not gonna be the first phone to use this sensor but it will be the best one because it's gonna be combining that with three other cameras for just maximum flexibility now i've already heard a bit of talk about the next samsung devices being powered by a hyper efficient five nanometer chip that would be great but just judging by past history these flagship phone chips they tend to get this boost in efficiency once every two years and it's only been worn since we started seeing the current 7 nanometer chips on the flip side though samsung has announced a partnership with amd and has pretty clearly stated that its purpose is to create mobile graphics chipsets for samsung smartphones so you might know that in the pc market amd is pretty widely known for their radeon of graphics architecture and so if samsung managed to leverage that company's expertise it could well mean a galaxy s 11 that completely fries the competition when it comes to gaming it kind of reminds me of when nvidia we're making move all chips and how they managed to produce a 72 core gpu in a phone where most others barely had four but also remember that this radeon partnership my only benefit phones powered by the exynos chip set so it might not affect people in the us and other regions that get the snapdragon there is good news though for qualcomm users in that all s11 s were - based on the snapdragon 865 or the exynos equivalent should have a 5g modem built into the chip the current solution in phones like the s10 5g is actually having a separate modem that sits alongside the chip and so weaving them together could mean not just a slimmer smartphone but also a more the s11 plus would also pair this with ufo s3 storage and up to 12 gigabytes of ram on the subject of power we haven't seen any clear-cut leaks on battery life but i think it would be a pretty safe assumption to guess about 1,100 milliamp hours if you look at their past devices the s8 plus had three thousand five hundred million powers because the s9 phones were more of a refinement of the s8 they had the same but the s10 plus was a full redesign and so along with that came a battery boost assuming them that the s11 is yet another refinement phone it should carry a similar capacity battery what is a bit more than just a refinement though is that it should also be getting the same 45 watt charging that we should be seeing on the note 10 as well i've already made an in-depth video all about the note 10 by the way so if you do want to see that i'll link it as a card above visual differentiation is really important for a company like samsung because obviously you've got tech nerds like us who we're always gonna know what the latest flagship phone is but for an average consumer walking into a store to upgrade they might not be able to tell so you may have actually noticed that with each new flagship phone samsung adjusts the aesthetic for seemingly no other reason than to look unique consider the change from the s9 plus to the note 9 if anything the camera layout on the s9 plus made sense it looks clean and the fingerprint scanner was far down in a phone the phone to reach and yet on the note 9 later on in the year they took what seemed like a backwards step on this which will at least in part just have been to make it feel new so this could mean a whole number of things on the s 11 but this is just what i think so far we all know that the s 10 phones have this pretty sizable hole punch in the top right corner and the expectation for the note 10 is for that hole punch to not just shift to the center but to become smaller it's quite possible then that the s 11 will utilize this smaller hole punch from the note 10 but with the positioning of the s 10 i don't think that the s 11 is where we'll see any kind of under screen front camera because the current compromise with quality is a little too high another aspect of this that i find kind of interesting is naming now that the company has hit the golden 10 number with the galaxy s 10 it might be time for a change you could argue that if they continue this naming trend you're just going to end up with a load of special feeling devices and it could just end up being a bit of a mouthful could you imagine if down the line they started releasing a phone called the samsung galaxy s 17 plus at the same time though the galaxy brand has a lot of power people see it and they have a lot of positive associations towards it so instead of ditching it it probably makes sense to start a new series within it for example they could name this phone instead of the galaxy s 11 the galaxy x1 which would then be followed by the x2 the year after and go from there there is almost definitely no headphone jack on this phone and chances are it's even going to be dropped on the note 10 coming before it it's more a question of when as opposed to if it's just the direction that the industry is heading as for the price it's a pretty safe estimate that the s 11 plus is gonna fall into the same bracket as the note 10 pro so it's safe to expect a starting price of between a thousand and fifty to 1,100 and don't forget that by this time the s 10 plus will be closer to $600 so it'll be up to you as to whether or not that purchase makes sense now that is the stuff that we're likely to see but as well as that there are just a few things that i'd really want to for example in consideration when it comes to economics samsung has a bit of a history with putting buttons and sensors in places that just don't make sense the note 8 had its fingerprint scanner impossibly high up on the back of the phone and the s 10 plus is power button literally requires a hand shuffle every time you want to press it what is it kinda nice is that with the s 10 phones samsung has massively cut down on the actual weight so they are much more comfortable to hold and i just hope that with the s 11 and moving forward they kind of learn from what has worked the second thing is a better camera night mode i was really excited when i found out that samsung was planning to introduce night mode on the galaxy s 10 because it's hardware is just so capable especially with a variable aperture that opens up at night to let more light in and the capability is still there but it just so happens that their execution of the night mode on the s10 was pretty weak if samsung managed to improve this software and being optimistic let's say they managed to match what the pixels are currently capable of then combining that with the new 64 megapixel sensor they're gonna have you could get unprecedented low light in theory as for a potential 90 hertz refresh rate i would personally opt out i really do like the slickness adds to the ui but at least with the current tech there's still too much of an impact on battery life i've actually disabled this setting on my 1 plus 7 pro because i found that after a couple of weeks of using it your eyes adjust to the refresh rate and you stop feeling the novelty of it and so at this point and this is my personal preference everyone is a little different in this but i found that instead of appreciating that extra smoothness of the screen i spent more time wishing i had that extra hour or so of screen on time by putting it back to 60 hertz alright so just your standard disclaimer that a lot of the stuff in this video is based on early leaks and some speculation on my part so i do hope it's giving you an idea of what to expect but at the same time clearly there's a lot of stuff that is not set in stone if you enjoy this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
