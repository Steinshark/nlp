ladies and gentlemen we have a new world champion of chess replacing the reign of magnus carlson it's yandy pomnushi of russia it's dingley ren of china 14 games were played in classical slow format they ended 7-7 today we play the tie breaks a best of four in rapid chess 25 minute and after that if necessary we will decide the world chess championship with blitz yes the same blitz that you play on the toilet on your smartphone every single morning before you prepare for school or work this is the way it works buckle up it just ended literally moments ago and it was absolutely sensational what a match game one dingly ren dingly ren has white they drew lots okay they drew out of a box dangly ren begins the playoffs and he plays the move d4 and he plays what i've actually already talked about now listen i'm not gonna take no credit here i don't think dingly wren watches my recaps but if he does ding thank you so much ding has played everything this match okay he's played this he's played this and in one of my last recaps i said recently the way people are getting interesting positions in the london is they're playing c3 and they're playing c3 to avoid c5 so if black goes here now white plays a london and is like haha i tricked you and if they play c5 white takes the pawn and doesn't give it up and that's actually exactly what happened now of course this is still very principled and essentially this is the queen's gambit accepted but with the colors reversed so jan plays e6 we have bishop to e3 bishop e7 and basically ding just doesn't give the pawn back but things like you can't have the pawn that's literally the entire purpose of my opening if you could get the pawn back easily that would pose an existential threat to this entire thing i'm playing and it would be dumb now black has a couple of ways to play this first of all black has this really interesting gambit i say gambit because it's giving white another pawn but in return black is gonna start firing at the bishop and try to take this and and good pressure on the queen side and so on but instead of that there's just the immediate move knight g4 now if white plays passively if white just kind of comes back black will play b6 cb6 queen b6 threatens mate and you think okay so what well look white setup is very stupid looking and at some point the integrity of the entire setup will be challenged and at that point probably white will have to give the pawn back so knight g4 bishop d4 and yam plays queen c7 the idea of queen c7 where do all three of these pieces stare at that square right so the idea is this the idea is to play e5 now again a massive existential threat here is posed to dingly run's position if he plays bishop to e3 this is an absolutely horrendous transformation of his pawn structure why because he has doubled isolated pawns he has no dark squared bishop and the i mean black is gonna feast so instead of that dingley ren of course not only a frequent viewer of gotham recaps hence his opening of 3c3 but also a gotham long-term subscriber danger levels your bishop is hanging what's worth as much or more than a bishop a gotham subscriber you well maybe you're not subscribed but you might as well click it now that i've reminded you if you watch all the videos because they get recommended by the algorithm but you're not subscribed yet i mean i don't know my bigger number better person like ludwig says h3 bishop knight worth the same okay like kind of some people say bishop is 3.1 it doesn't matter takes bishop takes knight takes pawn takes pawn takes pawn attacks knight now here if yanyupomnishi had gone back he would have been disqualified from the world championship for playing a move that i would play instead of that janipomishi is like well my knight is hanging you know what's worth as much as a knight a gotham chess subscriber that's you well unless you're not subscribed in which case you okay i'm just kidding bishop f6 now we attack the knight this knight is also hanging ding plays rook c1 jan captures and now knight back to c6 now the difference in losing this pawn whether it's to a knight or a queen is the fact that if a knight arrived at this square it would be a bull in a china store and it would just destroy everything okay it would just kick around and yeah but queen is very different and let's not forget this is also hanging so the apocalypse has taken place and in the span of about eight moves half the pieces fell off the board it's queen knight bishop two rooks and five pawns versus queen knight bishop two rooks and five pawns where's the imbalance all over the place actually i mean it's ac versus a b it's fgh versus gfe like white just doesn't have an h pawn the h pawn went here here got absolutely obliterated by the bishop knight g5 knight e4 and then i just headed to d6 now visually speaking i i mean i i love dingley run's position this is dingley wren's bread and butter ding has a light squared bishop do you know chess strategy no well if you only have one bishop on the board let's say it's a light squared bishop you need somebody to cover your dark squares because you don't have a dark squared bishop anymore so what do you do you complement your light squared bishop not compliment you don't tell the bishop he looks nice you complement the bishop and what you do is you add a bunch of pawns on dark squares which means you have nice little fluidity nice little harmony symphony crescendo all right fortissimo going on i don't i'm just saying words to be funny hopefully i'm being funny you have some nice synergy going that's another buzzword with your pawns and pieces rookie five queen d2 and i mean ding's got just an incredible position here in game number one i mean ding is looking to strike all right ding as always the person playing with white is doing really well now you'll notice that jan is putting a rook over here he has a grand total of zero plans but what he's doing is that's a bit of an exaggeration what he's doing is he's creating chaos creating confusion there are two ways to defend the chest position three the first buckle down guard everything hope you don't lose the second create chaos create confusion create counter play the third is to bribe your opponent i don't think that's gonna happen in the world championship rook b1 knight e5 and yes now we see the threat it's knight f3 so for example knight f3 take take and you lose that's not a threat at this level it's a threaded intermediate level it's not a threat at this level because we just have to move e4 now you will notice all of a sudden stockfish has stopped liking white's position right after this why there's no threat though i mean right this is all covered stockfish stopped liking white's position because in this position plays a move that is so nasty have you ever sacrificed your queen do you blunder your queen is that a thing that you do b6 cb6 abe what a queen blunder in the world championship he gave up his queen pawn takes pawn takes rook takes queen is a hundred percent free well it ain't it's a prank bro rook c7 knight f3 the rook stops guarding this if you go king f1 you walk into a fork you lose a queen by fork and you walk into another one double forked all right and this is just made a full queen down mate is unstoppable oh my god oh my god knight b5 he has to go back and suddenly suddenly all the pieces come off the board and we're gonna get a little bit of a draw here by repetition of moves all right and you're not you're not going out this way because otherwise you're gonna lose your rook so you got to keep touching the rook otherwise you know rook takes it game ones that ends in a draw oh my god he was on the ropes and he sacked his queen for defensive measures that is disgusting from oh my goodness oh my goodness and this idiot gotham here said he had no plan with rook h5 he might have not i mean like again his plan was just sort of like this but he did not i mean this is sensational oh my god okay so jan seizes the early momentum by holding a draw in game one of the playoff now i said it's best of four right so you gotta win three you gotta win two and a half or three nothing if it's two one they're gonna play a fourth game all right so we have a spanish we've had this opening a million times we have a spanish we've also had this opening multiple times and for this game yan goes back to a4 now keep in mind jana's basically played everything right he's played various c3 stuff h3 stuff last time he played some bishop e3 thing we have a4 h3 and we have another setup a4 h3 bishop e3 that we have not seen yet i'm not gonna get into like the little intricacies of the of the spanish opening and what pawn goes where i feel like for all of you it's like taking a five-year-old to like you know the a certain ancient exhibit in the metropolitan museum you know of new york and and like explaining symbols to you it's not necessary you gotta get a little older to like fully appreciate it like me i hated museums my whole life and then recently not hated i just like didn't care and then recently i went to the met again and i was absolutely fascinated by like 10 different things i saw i was like is this what it means to get older i mean some people like museums when they're young but those people are weird unless it's like the natural music like unless it's dinosaurs but like art museums is like a 14 year old bro i just wanted to be on my phone you know and i wanted to know where we were going for lunch but then i recently went to the met i was like wait this is actually kind of nice it was also nice because i got recognized but i'm just saying anyway bishop a2 pawn takes a4 okay you might ask yourself why white just completely lost the pawn on a4 white lost the pawn on a4 because he can do whatever he wants he's 2800 like what do you stop asking him questions the other real idea is the fact that this pawn can easily be won back it's a doubled isolated pawn standing into the barrel of the gun here black is gonna try to create counter play like this and as you can see from the eval clearly nobody's done anything wrong in fact that pawn gets taken right away it gets taken right away and actually ding secures a nice position right knight c6 knight a4 i mean life is good so knight d4 bishop c4 c6 take take and ding is trying to trade off the bishop here while yan i mean i mean first of all jan can take that pawn that's just 100 a clean pawn i don't actually know why he didn't like i i can't really explain it to you maybe he didn't like queen a5 but then he has bishop c4 and then i can move somewhere there is a tactic here knight takes pawn and if you take there is this but you don't have to take because it's not checkers so like take take take take take maybe he just wasn't i don't know he didn't like something here queen before like yeah i mean there's a lot of targets all right i ain't gonna lie to you there's a lot of targets in this position instead of all that though young just plays rookie one i mean he just doesn't take the pawn on a6 so dig moves it like chess is not uber complicated sometimes like my pawn's hanging so i'm gonna move it world championship solved queen f3 oh rook b7 e5 the board explodes board absolutely explodes ding plays knight d5 ding is now worse both guys getting dropped all right like bare knuckle knight e knight d5 and in this position jan just needs to stay patient just bring the bishop back and black doesn't have a good move because if black takes one e5 to relieve the pressure i got mating ideas which are always nice i mean bishop d4 right everything in black's position is a bit weak and if you play f6 that gets weak see like there's no winning here so of course i'll take that too but c5 f6 same concept but jan plays this okay he rushes in and now after this exchange ding gets back in the game ding uses the elasticity of the i think that's the right word i don't know i just learned that from economics but i think it's like elastic flexible i don't know queen e5 he uses the queen's flexibility to defend everything trades the queens trades this and for the second game in a row we get rooks and horses all right we get towers and horses which sounds like a sequel game to dungeons and dragons rook to b4 rook c5 and ding plays d3 and ding sort of played very actively defensively by the way can we just talk about these rooks like what are these bozos doing i mean they haven't moved for 30 moves like this rook castled okay i can't really say like castling is moving okay castling is like getting on your friend's private jet like i i you know what i mean like you you did nothing okay you did nothing to get there in life you just got on your you got lucky your friend is rich all right but not the rooks are not moving there's somebody move a rook this is nuts okay well well okay he was forced to move he was forcibly removed from the private jet by the night and now it's deadly symmetric deathly symmetrical nobody's gonna blunder here and it takes us a little while but yeah this is actually kind of cool he sacks his knight to win back the night and he does that to open up the structure here and damage them but the problem is that even though the structure is bad the kind guards everybody king's got eyes on everybody and there's just no way in i mean there's no way that white is going to utilize this so even if the structure is awful now if this was a triple pawn yeah white probably has winning chances but i gotta tell you even there it's actually very hard to win when all the pawns are close together game two ends in a draw nothing to choose between these guys i know i know every blood look i don't i don't in classical i wouldn't say in rapid and bliss but in classical chess and such is life okay such as life all right game three thing goes back to the white pieces ding oh this is cool knight f3 we haven't seen that yet he has not played already this is his first new opening in this is ninth game with white right because he played seven then he just played one so this is nine game plays the ready and he just plays up already i mean already you don't commit any of these pawns now we have c4 castles and here white can play the actual catalan so i mean the catalan is like dingly ren was born knowing the catalan i mean he didn't learn it like he he knew it i don't know how but he knew it when he was born but he plays b3 b3 is an opening called the neocatalan because you're kind of playing a catalan but you're like not playing the move d4 right so it's kind of a catalan but it isn't it allows black to play d4 which is definitely what ding wanted by the way like you allow this because you want to go here here you want to play e3 you want to play b4 you want to destabilize your opponent center but yeah we have c5 pawn takes d5 knight d5 bishop b2 and now d4 and we have pawn takes knight takes knight takes queen takes and checkmate is threatened and yeah in this position something that i've never seen at a world chess championship ever in my life or frankly any elite tournament ever happened and if you think i'm exaggerating or you think you know what i'm about to say yeah it's exactly what you think in this position yankee stop the checkmate in one move queen drops back f4 knight f i'd have some flashy stuff i mean goodness me knight to f4 the idea is that if you take the knight with the queen i take the bishop and you're rook is trapped if you take like let's say the bishop i can take with the queen and i hit the rook and i'm still hitting this so if you do this i'm gonna take the queen and then i'm gonna take the bishop and then i'm gonna come back now still ding has very nasty pressure in fact it's super annoying here to play black like if most of you if if any of you play black in this position you would really really struggle you might even lose very quickly because you have no natural looking moves but jan plays rook b8 the idea of rook b8 is to move the b-pawn right knight e5 apparently an inaccuracy but the idea is that he's happy to make this trade because ding is much better in this end game not much but enough and he wants to bring in his rooks and that's sort of his argument ian is not really impressed plays rook d8 trades and then this one is very easy you snap it that's the bishop's first move of the game and yes he perishes but he perishes for good reason because opposite colored bishops best players in the world know how to transform positions not like not like harry potter you know where you make somebody you know into a pig but they know how to transform positions via trades and they're not afraid to lose material bishop hanks pawn hangs doesn't matter king f8 doesn't matter because opposite colored bishop end games are very drawable to the point that you could be down two pawns and draw them in certain situations well rook c7 and a couple moves later we have rook d2 and this and this is going to end in a draw as well this is the shortest game recap that i have for you not a whole lot happened you know ding got a little bit of a pleasant edge but that was that now it's time for game four one and a half out of three one and a half out of three and yeah this was absolutely nuts this game this game was nuts and if you're clever and you have an eye on the timestamps of the video this is it this is the final game of the world chess championship 2023. yesterday by the way what happened yesterday i said 2014. you know what it's because they played their 14th game so the number 14 just made it into my head so i said 20 40. that was really funny but at least you guys were watching i mean you called me out on that that was like 12 minutes into the video means watch time was pretty good this is it this is it so take a moment kiss your loved ones make sure that you're they're actually your loved ones before you kiss them this is it e4 i'm so tense and i've and i watched this game live i know the result of this game some of you might i'm still so tense and we'll talk about it after e4 e5 a spanish all right in fact a spanish which we've already seen before we have seen all that literally all of that knight c3 was played in the other game excuse me bishop d2 was played in the other game and then it was knight c6 and stuff like this time we have knight c3 so jan plays it a bit differently rook b8 bishop b1 that's a weird move apparently it's prep but what is this what is this utter disrespect putting the bishop on the ninth square stuck behind three pawns what now clearly the idea here is something like this this this this this bishop a2 all right i'll take it all right that looks pretty much that looks pretty good i get it i understand the idea what happens if black shoes doesn't give back the pawn though like what is going on here right and things like well you wanna get out so i'm not gonna let you get out b3 point is that if you take there is this so ding plays the move c5 knight a4 knight c6 jan comes back and jan apparently should have played the move c3 here kind of monitoring all of this slowly trying to get all his pieces out he drops back the knight immediately and ding plays a5 for the second time his pawn is hanging and it's a very tense position don't listen to stockfish i mean it's spouting out some random evals this position is utterly tense and yan plays the move knight d2 he wants to go here and here ding needs to act fast he plays bishop e6 with the intention to play d5 and the center is officially exploding but now the advantage is back to yan pawn takes d5 knight d5 and jan here should again go for pawn c3 the objective is to unearth the bishop operation light squared bishop all right operation lsb that's the plan slide the bishop forward and get it to poke out because black has weaknesses and white can actually start some sort of an attack that is what yan should do but he doesn't he goes here but that actually further delays the encore on the opening of the bishop now in this position diggly run has knight f4 completely turning his eye away from the queen side and mobilizing this way that apparently is the way to go he can then in the future build forces in that direction queen c7 and so on and point them at the king instead he takes all right he takes and then he takes again that is a massive decision and for some reason young didn't like this i guess he didn't like opening the d file but again i just want to operation lsb but instead we have b take c4 how is this bishop ever getting in the game bishop d2 bishop c7 oh there it is but you can't even go d4 so clearly something has gone massively wrong right and in this position dingley wren plays f5 ponza f5 is an indication he don't want no draw all right he is starting a same side king side attack here comes the rook every single piece that dingley wren has in this position is attacking he's going to go e4 he's going to go f4 and queen g6 and all of this good stuff and essentially right now what we have is an unstoppable force in the black position versus an immovable object in the white position will black break through rook a2 is a fascinating idea by yan trying to cover the entirety of the second rank and as you will see this rook comes in handy in a little bit queen g6 queen e2 yan in this position is begging for a pawn break why is he begging for a pawn break because they all have drawbacks this allows queen e4 and if this opens up hello cowabunga on the diagonal if you don't play f4 and instead you play e4 trying to go 95 i will bust open this position and my bishop will still come alive and jan finally succeeds ponza e4 is a mistake and an accuracy if you will but maybe it was the only move i mean ding can only shuffle back and forth so much he plays e4 pawn takes e4 follows it up with a night move but look at the time that was clearly the idea and by the way look at this the rook is guarding the bishop yanyupumishi a defensive savant knight e5 queen drops back to g2 folks white is a move away from getting this this is game over for black queen g2 king and queen have a hug before the battle begins jan play ding plays knight d3 we have takes takes e takes f5 and jan is better in the ensuing end game and has double dings time now there was another moment here jan could have chosen to play queen d1 apparently the best move here was king h8 which is just they should drug test you if you play this move queen g2 knight d3 and yan plays this this this this this this this this one two three four five for white jana's up a pawn jana's up six minutes you literally cannot draw it up any better in this position yan must play rook d2 rook d2 blocks the bishop's vision here but you cannot take this because i have queen d5 check king to h8 and i get closer with my pieces i have rookie two and all this stuff and white has a dominant position but instead of that yang plays this and mind you very quickly gives back the pawn on f5 and now it's anybody's game i mean it's an it it's an open game pawn is coming down the board it's a three on two on the other side one side's king is definitely weaker than the other sides so we have bishop d2 we have h6 queen c6 infiltrating king h7 hiding from the action bishops meeting in the center of the board queen e8 bishop takes c3 jana's down a pawn but look at black's position black is struggling here queen d7 queen e2 dancing around each other ding can't pushes pawns yet queenie for check ding is 90 seconds left on the clock and the players start repeating moves we have a repetition of moves going on ding 90 seconds on the clock and hear the move heard around the world rook g6 six he played it with a minute he said no i don't want to draw what is he out of his mind i don't want to draw he wants to lose this world championship h4 h5 i mean i don't know you name it he can't push either of his pawns dingley ren is playing for a win with a minute on the clock yan immediately devastated by this news plays queen f5 which is a minor inaccuracy it's not a big deal and he plays pontus c4 to advance ding h4 and all of a sudden here comes queen d3 by threatening a queen trade the queen escapes all the way back home and the rook is behind the pawn and dingley ren is completely winning he is completely winning he's just gonna push his c pawn queen a8 rook d6 oh he's not completely winning anymore this is completely nuts so instead of playing rook d6 he just had to go forward yes rook d8 looks scary or something but he's nothing there's just had to be brave he just had to be brave instead he trades the rooks queen e4 queen g6 but what wait he has no advantage anymore bishop to d4 and now jan is gonna threaten mate and the bishop is hanging and the pawn is hanging and you can't just play a3 right surely you can't just play wait a minute he just played a3 and in this position jan now has a draw again but it's impossible to find it's this you can't sack a bishop here to force a draw it's apparently a perpetual check i mean the computer sees it but also jan can play h5 burying the king and disallowing advancement but he plays queen c7 and dingley ren now comes back pushes his pawn and jan cannot stop both pawns ding brings the bishop back plays h5 himself centralizes his bishop and now there is a red carpet for all of his pawns g4 hgh5 and on move 68 of the'th game of the world chess championship 2023 resigned and dingley ran against all odds the new classical world champion although it was decided in rapid which is weird but that's the way it works om the first time dingley ren led in this match he won it he has not led in this match at all in fact he trailed in this match four different times in fact in a game where he was already down one he was lost and he won that game what am i mean commiserations of the highest order to yani bomji i have so many thoughts about this folks i don't know how many of you have been following chess dingley wren was not even supposed to play in this event he was not even supposed to play in the candidates which is the tournament that leads up to this event he got a spot in the candidates because of the disqualification of one of the players and then he played 20-something games in the span of like two weeks to be eligible to play because that's the way it works you have to be active and because of his struggles during covet he was unable to travel much out of china he wasn't even supposed to play in the candidates he made it to the candidates in the last round of the candidates he was playing against hikaru yes hikaru and he was in no business to win that game anyone and because he won he secured second place on the candidates and by securing second place in the candidates he secured a spot against yani bomnishi if magnus chose not to defend his title and he was down four times in this match and he won they gotta make a movie about this man they gotta make a movie about this man this is re the things he had to go through to win this match oh my i can't even congratulations commiserations congratulations to dingley run commiserations to any promise i almost cried when i saw ding win this match i will go cry and then i'll watch nick's heat at 1pm it's been so great making these recaps for you i'm sorry about the thumbnails but now we'll go back to having regular thumbnails thanks so much for all your support i really do appreciate it play play more chess it's really fun now get out of here
