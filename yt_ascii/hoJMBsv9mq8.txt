today's video is going to be something a little bit different and slightly clever marketing on my part as well by the time you're watching this video as long as you're watching it on the day it was released i will have released a single you can probably tell from the guitars in the background and i've done some music stuff on my channel before but i'm really into music i play a few instruments and i sing and you may have also seen that at the end of all of my videos i have a link to my music channel if you haven't already consider checking it out for the single i decided that i wanted to make the artwork for the album cover myself originally i was going to try and take some photos and do some sort of comp work for it but then i thought it'd be quite cool to use my vfx skills to make something in blender the name of the song is the rabbit hole is calling if you're into rock music there's definitely a lot of oasis sounding stuff in there i'll play a really quick snippet of it now just so you can see what it sounds like [music] life is just [music] so there we go but let's get back to the point of the video how did i make the album cover before i started i already had a rough idea of what i wanted to do for it i knew i wanted to be looking down a tunnel because the name of the song is the rabbit hole is calling and i wanted to have a silhouette of someone probably me in the tunnel looking down it and that was really all i had in mind the rest of it just kind of came from trying a few things in blender till i found something i liked the final effect is actually really straightforward so i'm just going to remake it step by step and show the whole process the first thing i made is the tunnel so i started off by adding a cylinder then i stretched it out in the y-axis so it was really long something like this then i deleted the faces on each end added a load of subdivisions so i added a load of loop cuts like this if i turn on screencast keys you can actually see what i'm pressing i also added a subdivision surface modifier onto it i turned it up to two just so i had lots of geometry to play with then once that was done i added two different displacement modifiers onto this the first one is using a pretty generic noise texture just to get the shape right this is kind of adding all the lumps and bumps into the detail of the tunnel apply the scale so that it displaces correctly i set it to something like this so it's quite a large scale displacement and if i set it to smooth you can see the tunnel's already kind of starting to look like a tunnel from here i started to change the shape of the tunnel a little bit so i went into edit mode and just did a bit of scaling so it starts off bigger and narrows down as it gets towards the end i did a lot of this with proportional editing that looks pretty good if i put a camera at the end of the tunnel then we can see exactly what it's going to look like i went for quite a wide focal length i can't remember exactly what i did but i think it was 24 or' so let's just go with 24 for now then i started adding some more high frequency detail into the walls of the tunnel so to do that on top of the first displacement modifier i added a second subdivision surface modifier so this gives me even more geometry to play with then on top of that i added a second displacement modifier i used clouds again for this but i made the scale of the noise much smaller so it's much more high frequency detail and i turn the strength right down on the modifier like this as you can see this really helps to add a lot of extra detail into the walls and then i just kind of went between the two different displacement modifiers and found a happy medium it's kind of a balancing act of getting the scales right on both of the noise textures so the first one adds lots of large lumps and bumps and you get the scale right and then the second one is adding the really fine details the next thing i did is start adding the lights into the scene i knew i wanted it all to be backlit and there to be a light at the end of the tunnel it felt very poetic not really sure what it means in the context of this album cover but i just thought it would look cool so i added a big old plane at the end of the tunnel over here and i just put a material on this with an emission shader on it i set the world lighting to be zero and then i set the strength of the emission shader pretty high and as you can see this is giving a really awesome look immediately even though the displacement on the tunnel is pretty crude with just with the two noise textures when you look at it from this perspective when it's already backlit just using the one point light it looks really dynamic and it's really cool that's pretty much all i did to make the tunnel it's really straightforward like i said the next thing i did was bring in a model of me i happen to have the photo scan of me from the treasure planet video and i just thought that would be a really good use for it originally i was going to take a photo of me and try and compete in nuke but i thought if i actually used a 3d model in blender it would be a lot easier to get the lighting to feel consistent across all the assets in the shot so that's what i did so if i grab that it's in my assets library and then all i did was pose this in the tunnel really simple once i was posed there was a bit of going back and forth to find the right camera angle i ended up tweaking the size of the tunnel quite a lot and the shape at the end so that the composition was right and i had enough of the silhouette showing and i could also still see the light at the end of the tunnel it's really easy to do that because i haven't applied any of the modifiers yet so the actual mesh still looks like this so it's really easy to manipulate it in edit mode so i can just grab it and just make the end of the tunnel a bit wider like this for example then the final cherry on top because it's music themed is i found a 3d model of my guitar online and put that in my hand and this is the final result in blender as you can see i made the light a bit blue i've got the 3d model of the guitar in there the photo scan also has some hair particles on top that i kind of roughly made to look like my hair they don't really show up in the viewport render so much because i've got the particle count set to lower until i actually hit render but that's kind of what they look like so once i was happy with how this was looking i rendered one frame as an exr and took that into nuke just to do some final bits of comp so this is what the nuke script looks like it's really simple i didn't really do much in terms of changing the look and comp i just kind of enhanced it with some glows and stuff so it starts off with the render looking like this then i put a bit of a glow on it just to kind of enhance the bloom at the end of the tunnel i also separated out the emission pass and did loads of levels of glow on this so i kind of blurred it a bit and then blurred it a bit more and turned the mix down and then blurred it even more turned the mix down blood even more turn the mix down so you end up with these kind of multiple levels of blurring built up on top of each other which look quite cool and then i put this back on top of the original render but importantly i also rendered a utility pass and i used the kryptomat from the utility pass to give an alpha of me and then i used the alpha to stencil out the photo scan from the blur so that the blur isn't overlapping too much on the photo scan because otherwise it was like this and it was way too much then on top of that i added some volume rays which i think worked really well just to add a bit of atmosphere into the tunnel this is literally just done with a volume raised node in nuke that's plugged into the original render you can kind of change it depending on where you put the position of the volume so i set it right in the middle of the shot so there were some nice streaks coming out from under my arms and around my body made them a little bit more blue and gamma them down a little bit with the grade node and then just put that back over the top so that's what it looks like with them on and that's without also in terms of composition because you have these kind of diagonal lines streaking out from the center of the frame if you have any background in photography or cinematography you'll know that having lines in your shot that lead the eye of the person looking at it to whatever you're trying to focus them on is a really good way of crafting the composition so all the volume rays coming out diagonally from the center kind of draw your eye into the middle of the frame which is quite cool then on top of that it's just tweaking the colors really i made it a bit more blue so i put some more blue into the gamma and then i added a bit more of a vignette with a color correct node and just a circular rotor shape and that's it that's the whole thing i also did an alternate version that i didn't end up using but i did think it was quite good looking so this is the one that we just looked at but i also made one that was much more beaten up so kind of like an old record i downloaded a load of scratch textures and old vinyl kind of overlays and then i used about six of them and combined a few different elements that i liked it looked quite cool definitely gave the image some character but i just felt that the clean version looked a little bit more sleek i think as an album cover i prefer this so you can kind of see my thought process there going between the two so there we go that's how i made it i hope you guys think it looks cool i'm really happy with how it turned out if you're interested in getting your hands on this and having a play with it the blender file and the nuke script are both on my patreon in the one dollar tier if you do happen to download it and tweak it feel free to post the renders in the discord server i'd be interested to see what people do with it and finally just to plug the whole point of this video again the song is called the rabbit hole is calling it's available on all major streaming platforms so spotify apple music youtube music whatever you use if you like rock music at all so stuff like oasis then it'll probably be right up your street so give it a listen and let me know in the comments if you like it i'd love to see what people think of it thank you very much for watching hope you enjoyed and i'll see you very soon [music] [applause] [music] is you
