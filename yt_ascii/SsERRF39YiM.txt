ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode of coffeezilla today we're at a whole another level of scam we're at flying lambo levels of scam of course let's go to the board bitclout yes if the name doesn't already give it away to you they're trying to mimic bitcoins notoriety popularity they say they're the bitcoin of like profiles of social media have you heard this before buzz buzz buzz buzzword i'm i'm just like satoshi guys i swear i'm just like satoshi but they got big founders they got chamath they got sequoia capital they got a lot of big boys what are they seeing that i'm not big clout it's hot on the market right now why do i think it's scam why all these guys are cashing in let's find out today shall we let's examine let's investigate this 200 million dollar scam something i allege is a scam by the way founder he's anonymous yeah just let's start there but okay that's fine right you say what what when has a anonymous founder ever been a scam fair enough let's talk about it we'll start with the white paper bitcloud is a new social network which lets you speculate on people and post with real money and it's built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain boys so here's how it works you buy a coin called bitclout which you use internally to the website to purchase like creators and speculate on creators there's only one tiny problem how do you buy big clout with bitcoin now can you sell big clout back for bitcoin does it work the other way well the answer to that question is a resounding no the money goes to the anonymous founder it seems or somebody we don't know who it just goes to an address an address which is now received let's check that real quick let me see if my numbers are right oh that's right 200 million dollars boys 200 million dollars yes of usd that you're not going to get back look you bought in this stupid platform you're not going to get it back so what do you get for buying bitcloud well the only thing you can really do with it is by these creator coins and everybody has a coin guys you can buy your favorite person's coin people like this now there's only one small problem the exciting people who are on this list that they're selling they've tokenized everybody and they're selling them as creator coins have those people bought into the platform that would be a resounding no so it turns out they're just stealing people's identity and selling it as crypto is it a scam yet can we say that oh no no no totally not a scam guys this is real this is a real project not a quick cash grab look who it's backed by guys it's backed it's backed by chamath it's backed by sequoia capital there could be no ulterior motives here see they actually did a pre-sale for founders and investors so investors might make some money but you well you'll probably lose out well because literally you can't what are you gonna do with the big clout how are you gonna sell it you can't how do you get the big cloud out of the platform what sell it for more big clout hey i'll sell you some mr beast if you sell me some leon lush tokens dude no bro what is this what is this new economy everything has to be tokenized no it doesn't guys i understand that everyone's excited about bitcoin everyone thinks it's gonna save the universe all of a sudden the world's not gonna end anymore because we've decentralized it and it's on everybody's comp you can download the earth on everyone's computer now sorry to say it's not gonna work that way but anyways back to the part where they're using people's identity without their permission so here they have elon musk right and people have been buying elon musk's profile they pitch it as we're saving his profile for but in reality all they've done is they've copied his profile and let people pay money inside of his thing and given him a market cap so allegedly his market cap is 38 million dollars which is probably inflated right it's probably inflated but they've made money off elon musk and elon musk has seen none of that does everybody understand why that's wrong and they're gonna get sued for it and it looks like that's actually coming down the pipe we'll talk about that in a second but this profile is reserved if elon musk has not joined bitcloud yet meaning elon musk could hate big clout and think it's a scam but they're profiting off of him now do you guys what's gonna happen if elon musk goes hey give the people their money back are they gonna get their money back probably not because did i mention that the founder is anonymous oops the founders diamond hands now some people have pointed to this guy being this guy nader nader theory because yeah they sent him a cease and desist letter actually for using you know an identity without that person's consent but to just tell you guys how insane this stuff is just think about it this way let's say i launch a crypto coin i say hey guys come to i steal your ip.com and buy some tokens right and it's like theft coin dot co or something like whatever and all of a sudden the first thing you can buy with it is a mario token or a luigi token nintendo has not given me the rights to use that i'm profiting off of them and if nintendo comes knocking on my door hey i just say well hey you can claim it you can claim it here's the thing with bitclout here's the little growth hack that they're trying to use which is that people can claim their bitclout their big club profiles and get a percentage of that token now the key word is percentage though because big cloud's taking the majority the lion's share bit cloud has already made the money on the bitcoin transferred into bit clout so what are you actually getting are you getting worthless tokens where's the actual value the actual value is in this wallet which is allegedly where all the money from this thing has been going to to transfer stuff into bitcloud 209 million usd made from theft scams guys it's so easy these days all you need is a pseudo-anonymous account create just some sketchy white paper with a bunch of buzzwords do some pump of mentals get some founders on board by saying hey you're a big in crypto come to my thing i'll give you some easy cash and then promote it to all your followers we'll steal people's identity and get make it seem like our platform's bigger than it is and we rake in a cool 200 million dollars but probably the stupidest thing of all is this idea like bitcoin big cloud is a fully open source project and there's no company behind it it's just coins and code have you ever heard this before hey this thing got created but no one's behind it who could be behind it we don't know there's investors but they must not be behind it because apparently it's just coins and code hmm where's all that money go then that's turning the bit clout into bitcoin is that going to anybody if so it's owned by that person who's getting all the rewards yo if you get scammed by this don't say i didn't warn you because this is so shameless and shady how they're getting people to buy in by basically pre-selling your your stuff without your consent and going hey come in and get a cut they call it the founders rewards actually where you can like set your little fee and the founder the founder reward percentage all this kind of stuff it's so stupid this stuff makes me so mad when i watch a project pretend to be like altruistic pretend to be like hey guys we're just an open source cool project and it's like one guy getting super rich wow where's the money going that's my question not the big clout coins where's the bitcoin going which is being used to buy this i don't like it it is a giant scam you can translate to this to any other world imagine pre-selling or tokenizing any kind of ip without consent be like hey i'm selling this guy's identity it'd be like selling merchandise for any movie and then being like yeah you know they didn't officially authorize it but i'm sure they'll be cool with it now in addition to them taking really popular profiles and pre-loading them on the platform another problem and another form of identity theft is where they literally someone else takes your profile and uploads it this happened to my buddy here roberto blake you guys may know him from his youtube channel this happened to you right like somebody just made a it's it says official account rest equal scam creative entrepreneur coach 500k youtube podcaster keynote speaker and there's three thousand dollars that's been spent on this coin that's you yeah it means that i mean they literally are scamming like my fans and people who would want to support me and like i don't even have a big cloud account i only found out about this because one of my fans told me about it they want to capitalize on the creator space without fully understanding it this relationship between investors and creators is gonna go well initially because i don't think they respect the space i don't think they understand it and i don't think they respect the relationship creators have with their fans it's these big names that they want to take advantage of and all the recognition and traffic so they just want to leverage these people for their audience and if it goes sideways they're going to leave people with a reputation-based business hold in the bag it's not cool it does look like legal action is being taken as i mentioned before already seasoned assist letters are going out and yeah i only see more of this happening but by then it seems like the money will be probably gone i fully expect some kind of prosecution to go down with this i think what they're doing is absolutely deplorable and i think it just makes the crypto space worse because it just plays into this pre-existing kind of fear of scams and crypto because there's so many people getting stupid rich by making these short-sighted scam coins scam offering scam platforms it's like what are we doing here anyways i don't like it i don't like this company i don't like anything they stand for that's it for now thanks for watching i'll see you in the next one i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
