- obviously my videos
require a lot of manpower. so, i hired a new guy
just to help us do things. and i noticed my new
employee, garrett, either has to uber to work or take his mom's car because his old car doesn't really work. so, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take apart his old car. and put it in his office and then give him a bunch of
money to go buy a new car. so, i amassed an army. that guy right there, he's a mechanic. this is garrett's old car. it's literally a piece of crap. it doesn't work. it doesn't move. i know he has no attachment to it. it's literally stuck in his driveway. so, my mini army is gonna help me. hey, chris, take apart this car. and then we're to drag
the pieces to the office, put it in his room, and then he's gonna go in the room and be like,
"whoa, there's a car here." and it's gonna be cool. - viewers might wanna see
themselves real quick. - oh, hey. oh, wow. you guys are ugly. - look, they cracked it they're so ugly. - wow, geez viewers. what, do you guys like not
take care of yourselves? sorry for screwing up your car, garrett, but we're gonna give you a
lot of money to buy new one. so, it's okay. i know you don't care. let's destroy it. - oh man, i really love this car. - chris, how would katie feel about that? i'll hold it for you. - thank you. - well, if she doesn't
know, it won't hurt her. i got a little excited. - this is the first
piece of garrett's car. many more to come. so, mr. mechanic, what you doing? - just turning this bolt thingy. - is that gonna make
this thingy come offy? - it is gonna make this thingy come offy. - before we put the car in his room, i need to tell you guys about war robots because they're the one
funding garrett's new car. huge shout out to war
robots are sponsoring me as a creator via spons.org. without them, i wouldn't be
able to buy garrett a new car. and without you guys helping
out the sponsors, you know, by downloading the
game, i wouldn't be able to pull off videos like
this in the future. war robots is a free mobile
game that surprisingly isn't pay-to-win, which
is quite refreshing. and i really enjoy playing it. so, for those of you that aren't a part of the 70 million players that
currently play war robots, it's basically a 6v6
tactical multiplayer game. chris, i called you here
because i want you to play a game of war robots. i know you've played it in the past, but if you win this game, you get $1,000. - let's do it. yep, to battle. all right and i've
eliminated one of their guys. we just won. add three kills to that game. - well, i don't actually
have the cash on me, but i will get it to you tomorrow. - you better. it's crazy that a free game like this has tons of
weapons, robots, events, all kinds of maps and everything. there's so much stuff, you'll
never get bored of this game. - head to spons.org/mrbeast on your iphone or android to install the game for free. link is in description. don't bother going to the store. just use the link in the description. and if you download it now you'll receive the welcome bonus pack, which is leo robot, four
new weapons, 100 gold, and 400,000 silver, which
is actually very helpful. it'll save you quite a bit of time. and by downloading the
game and supporting them, you're supporting me and
allow me to do more videos like this in the future. so, i really hope you guys click the link and download war robots. thank you, war robots,
for sponsoring this video. and yeah, guys, hope you
enjoy the rest of the video. that's really funny. and there we go. all right, so far in our
collection, we have a trunk, we have a door, and we have a mirror. - hey jimmy, guess what?
- what? - i adore you. - so they took the bolts off this car door and that's what happens when you kick it. hey, chris.
- i'm taking my stuff and going home. - chris, come back. we love you. quick status update. we got two doors, a trunk, and a mirror, that you guys shattered. did meme review have a bonus meme? - it did not. - let's go save bonus- pewdiepie must be on to us. - chris] oh my god. - he's sabotaged our car. - look at it. - give us our bonus
meme, pewdiepie, or else. i don't know why pewdiepie's
fighting to end the bonus meme. we want it back. how many cars have to suffer? - got it. - hey chris, having fun? - yeah, i just figured out how to take this thing off. - time for a quick little update. no steering wheel. no doors, front's starting to come off. there you go. let's play a game. let's grab something random. we found some lip gloss in garrett's car. you guys want some hello kitty lip gloss? what are you doing with that, garrett? this is all the money we
found in garrett's car. so, this is perfect. we're not gonna give him this money and we're gonna buy him a
car that's less than this. so, we just stole from garrett, sh. what is with these magic
the gathering cards? what are you, a nerd? i don't want the viewers to
hear this, but hey garrett, if you ever wanna play
magic the gathering, just let me know. i love it. geez, garrett, could
you clean your car out every once in a while? hey chris, i think this
car could use a sunroof. do your thing. - there's one tire. - so, as you guys can see, we got rid of the tires, the doors, the
chairs, we took off the hood. we took off the bumper. we took off this tire. now, we just got a hollow shell. garrett's car is in the
back of chris's truck and we also threw a bunch of
it in the back of our car. and yeah, we're heading
back to the office. we're gonna take all these pieces. we're gonna build the car in his room. we're gonna get his reaction
to his destroyed car. and then we're gonna go buy him a new one. that's the hood, that's
seats, that's a bumper, that's a door, that's a table, that's tires, doors, doors, another door. all right, we got most
the stuff right, chris? - oh yeah.
- and what we're gonna do is we're gonna build the
car right smack dab here. and yeah, i don't know
how this is gonna work. - we're gonna try. - yeah, we're gonna
try right mr. mechanic? - exactly right. - guarantee the thumbnail's
gonna look different. - hey, sh. we have a table here in the middle and we're gonna use this as the framework for our ferrari. boom. i can't wait for garrett to see this. - this is badass.
- yeah it is. - it looks like-
- it looks like one of those smart cars.
- yeah. "icarly" made it look way
easier to take apart a car. like, did it look like this in "icarly?" i don't think so. so fa, we've got two doors
and a chair on your car. keep renovating it, boys. so, we have the tv right here, and yeah, we're building a racing simulator in case you couldn't tell. so, i haven't really talked about this, but garrett's actually been planning for my 5 million subscriber video all day. he's been going around
buying this stuff for it because it's a pretty big video. so, that's what he's been doing. i'm gonna call him real quick and just tell him to come back. but-
- sorry, the person you were trying to reach has a voicemail- - i guess his phone's dead. chris, what do we do? we'll just come back whenever. okay, so apparently garrett's like literally pulling in, right? - yeah, he's pulling in right now. - so, garrett's pulling in, in a van. we have a van that we use. it's obviously not his car. it's right there. so, we're going to flick off the light. all right. hey, garrett.
- what's? - hey.
- what's up? - what's going on, buddy?
- what's up, chris? - what?
- what's going on? how you doing? - just got back from the truck. - how was it?
- pretty boring. why?
- oh, nothing. - you should show this
new guy around the block. - yeah, we, we got a lot of
paperwork in your office, if you would. just go in-
- this is my office? - yeah, sign- - i already signed all the contracts. what do you mean?
- there's a little bit more. - yeah, just come on. come on, new guys. - what the ****? yo, bro - surprise.
- surprise. we got you. duct taped.
- and your car. it works. - he's acting just like ethan was. - i've only been here
for like a week, man. - and we have this thing
where like i hire employees and then i fuck up their cars. we know how you didn't like having five, six seats or whatever. so, we just made it a one seater. - nice, it's like a little spaceship? is that what you're going for?
- yeah. you're supposed to be mad. be mad.
- i am mad. i was supposed to scrap
this the other day. - ha, see, i told you,
viewers, it didn't work. you guys thought i was wasting it. - what do i do now? - obviously we're gonna buy you a new car. you know what we do? - like ethan?
- yeah. basically.
- look at the smile. - so i already know what you're thinking. go figure out what car you want. this is no longer your car. this is a decoration. - i'm gonna need a minute. - no, we are are going right now. - right now?
- you don't even get to look. we're leaving right now to buy you a car. - come on. get in. come on, get in. - chris, you look so funny. - vroom, vroom. come on in, man. let's go. it's getting bumpy. whoa, oh, it's nighttime driving. - you're getting them after nine hours for your permit. - yeah.
- i love how just chill garrett is. garrett, do you even know
how **** long this took? go on a computer and figure
out what car you want and then we'll go buy it. - all right. - we're not actually
buying him a car right now. we're gonna buy him a car tomorrow. - because it's late. - and they wanna home. all right, garrett, you have
the night to think about it. everyone wants to go home. tomorrow we'll buy you a new car. so, it's the next day. and we're on our way to the dealership. all right, garrett. you excited to go by your car? - oh gee, yes i am. - hey, can you just fake
being super excited? - yeah, man. i can't wait. - yeah.
- yeah! - yeah!
- yeah. how about you, chris?
- yeah, yeah, yeah. - woo.
- yeah. - woo!
- woo. - and we're here at the dealership. as you can see, lots of cars. you don't mind being on camera, right? - no, we're good. four new tires. - four new tires, dude,
there's four tires. i thought we were getting
a car with only two tires. four tires sounds expensive. so garrett, what do you think so far? i think it's a pretty nice car. it's got four seats, four tires,
and it comes with a slave. - stay back there.
- sorry, sorry. - we have a history of
buying cars on this channel. we bought a car with
pennies for my stepdad. i can do it. - i got a new car. - then we bought a car using
$1 bills for my brother. - are those all one dollar bills? - those are all one dollar bills. - aw. then we destroyed my friend's
car and bought him a car. you like it?
- yes, i love it. - awkward. and now we're buying garrett a car. - thank, jimmy. - yeah, yeah.
- yeah. - yeah.
- yeah. - yeah.
- yeah. - here's a check for our car. - all right. - this isn't as exciting as when we bought a car
with pennies and $1 bills. would you guys have minded pennies? - no, we take anything, my friends. - you're gonna regret that. - we'll keep that in mind. - where's the money coming from? - it's coming from chris' pocket. chris is a billionaire. - yeah, i'm a billionaire. - these guys love cars. they love cars. - show them the antique
cars that you got for sale. - which one's the most expensive one? - it's the jaguar. - how much?
- this is 50,000. - how much is a model car?
- $200. - if anyone wants to pay $200 for that, hit up this man. - hey. - but first, let's go buy our car. and there you go, garrett. you own the car. - like zoinks, dude.
- yeah. that's the video, i hope
you enjoy your new car. everyone comment. - bye, guys. you'll never see me again.
