[music] i'm about to spend five thousand dollars in the next five minutes buying the weirdest tech on the entire internet and then we're gonna test it okay let's start with etsy because i know this looks like a really family-friendly store but this website gets weird wow this is why i love etsy it tests the limit of creativity i want it all i think we've just found the pinnacle the infinity dodecahedron i can't even imagine what this would be like to hold in your hand type in weird gadgets we just got nicolas cage on a spoon so someone is 3d printing guns that shoot tic tacs why not world's first emotional party mask this is rather terrifying probably not my kind of party but let's try it it's making me think actually what if we can use the internet to create the most outrageous tech outfit yeah maybe not now that is actually cool let's let's get this one and see how well the fiber optic works i think it may be time to enter the weirdest site of them all hello wish.com a laser glove some shoes these look ridiculous i can't believe i'm gonna buy them gone man let's go gold okay let's move past the led outfit let's go for just weird gadgets we've got a device here that turns your toilet breaks into a rave let's get that we've got a device here that you can apparently put your batteries inside of and it will tell you the amount of charge left i can't be the only one who had no idea this existed got some very unusual bike seats creative egg lamp i can't be the only one seeing this i think we have to buy it to be sure that is quite the warning light let's have a look at some novelty usb sticks this can normally get pretty strange yeah yeah i mean technically that is what i was looking for weird earphones what is that it's an a bone conduction ear hook let's try it wireless mushroom speaker ah it also sticks onto the back of your phone for three dollars it might actually be quite a good product hmm isn't it just crazy to think that there are people out there whose entire job is to design stuff like this anyways i think it's time we move over to amazon got a real assortment here there is a bob ross toaster which toasts bob ross's face onto your bread wow the kubo it has a heartbeat what is this so this is basically a pillow that when you hug it it tries to recreate the feeling of hugging an actual animal so it has its own heartbeat it responds to sounds it even like wags its tail apparently who is this for there's a company here called ninebot which has some of the strangest vehicles i've ever seen a self-balancing wheel i don't even quite get how that keeps you upright and then they also do something called electric hover shoes which i mean that literally looks and sounds like something straight out of a movie but i've never heard of them oh you can actually buy a physical handset for your mobile phone why then you have to connect it using a usbc adapter that is bizarre this is fascinating so you can actually buy a belt that detects when you're falling and then inflates an airbag inside of it to protect you from that fall it's like a superpower i cannot believe this is a real product the pavlok3 you basically wear around your wrist like a normal wearable device but as well as tracking all your stats it can give you electric shocks to try and get you out of your bad habits this is a shock collar for humans what i mean yeah i've got some bad habits let's let's see if it can get me out of them what am i signing up for there's a gun here which basically uses ordinary table salt as ammo doesn't require any batteries and can shoot that table salt out to get rid of insects i've like a thousand questions ah okay so this it's called ottomatone is a a japanese musical instrument that can apparently sing you can kind of adjust the pitch and the bass with your fingers definitely one of those we need to see in person to to be able to understand it my god this is going to be a very odd unboxing experience i can't believe i actually bought this stuff i'm only just realizing how strange it is now that i can see it sitting on my desk in front of me so let's start weird and keep getting weirder taking things off with kubu what looks to be a replacement for your pet all right so here's milo he's kind of soft a little biter than i would like also absolutely covers you in cat hair and here's kuvu oh you're a real soft aren't you he wants his tail when you stroke him he's getting a bit excited now that's enough it's just like a real cat but it actually does what you want it to do sorry milo if you think that's odd we're about to make some very strange slices of toast this is the bob ross toaster and it is begging an obvious question is the face gonna taste different to the rest of it only one way to find out god that got hot quickly what the fuck bob just happened oh my god fully looks like we got the wish.com version of the photo we were promised the outside tastes fine but the face is to call that burn would be a compliment this is really heavy but i'm so excited about these two the world's weirdest vehicles i guess so first up with the hover shoes which can apparently whisk you away at 12 kilometers per hour or three times the speed of walking and then the even more expensive and even more capable solo wheel unicycle if the unboxing experience is this dangerous i'm slightly scared for the riding experience and the crazy part of this one is that they're saying it's going to fly me around at twice that speed 24 kilometers per hour it soiled my desk the hell man both of these are gonna need charging up so we'll stick them on now and come back to them at the end okay time for a lightning round those tvs have not been working this entire time have they let's try that again these are the cheapest weird gadgets 200 seconds on the clock let's go so first up this mushroom is a three dollar bluetooth speaker but what on earth does a three dollar speaker sound like good if you could turn it on oh the eyes are buttons it's got a sticky pad so i mean okay slightly louder and slightly bassier than my phone better than i expected ah the creative egg lights so yeah i mean for three dollars i see no reason not to get a pair of these lights but hey i mean if your goal is to get people on the road to notice you they're not gonna be able to look away now it's perfect right then we've got the battery capacity tester all right so here we got a battery that i know is full because i got it straight from the pack and it does tell me it's 100 so it works so let's try the one that's inside my tv remote right now it's got about 90 pleasant surprise now as dumb as i know it sounds this toilet aromatherapy led kit actually has the potential to be a game changer product just need to clean the toilet before the scene right so i've set this all up and i know i kind of bought it as a joke but i'm gonna use this so for starters it has a motion sensor which means that it can keep the led off until you get within three meters of the toilet it has an aromatherapy feature which is basically a scented tablet that you put inside of it it's not nice but it is effective it smells like what i imagine lemon bleach would smell like this is not planned but i've just realized i actually have lemon bleach sitting right here yes it's that but the cherry on top the reason this has two lights at the bottom is that one of them is a uv light so once a person has come and activated the rgb lights it waits for them to leave and then uses the uv to sanitize after them box me well it doesn't get much weirder than this a phone for your phone i can't believe people actually buy this like i'm sorry but can you imagine hello hello that's kind of my point ah a wish.com special this is the three dollar ear hook we ordered never seen an audio device like it is it about to be the next big thing so i think you just slip it over your ear i can't be here that's got to pick up my mouth how is this the manual ah this is interesting it's got a really open sound to it because your ear is not being obstructed in any way at all but because the speaker unit is therefore so far away from your eardrum it's also not very immersive probably a better puzzle than it is an earphone but this tic tac gun has got to be the weirdest cheap gadget of them all why would you want to shoot a perfectly tasty tic tac and more pressingly why is there a tiny child in the packaging well it definitely feels cheap kind of like it was 3d printed in someone's living room that's not to say anything about the performance that can't be right okay we're in pull back the lever to load and i think we just fire ah i'm just trying to shoot the camera it's really not very powerful see if you can pierce a target come on okay i just failed to smash the subscribe button so you don't have to wait that doesn't work [music] don't do that okay loki this is what i've been most excited for we bought an absolute truckload of led gadgets so let's get them on and use them to create the most ludicrous led outfit i believe these are the led shoes goodness me i feel like i meant to hate these but i'm kind of embarrassed that i don't i genuinely can't tell if these will make you look like royalty or like you're homeless ah the light switches are hidden on the inside of the buckle three two one they really are something that's about as good as they're gonna get all i can do is rack my brain thinking why don't i hate this right of course there's an sos mode okay let's get them on that's our infinity mirror oh wow wait that's a lot smaller than i was expecting spots on the inside that counts though it's actually cute it's a little bit more plasticky than i would like for a 100 plus gadget well it better perform well i'm just saying that that is mesmerizing it genuinely looks like it goes on for an entire meter on the other side and it's so trippy to see that it doesn't fascinating so the way that this apparently works is you have two mirrors on either side and then a ring of leds sandwiched in between them but what makes this so interesting is that these mirrors are one-way mirrors so you can look into them the same way you would look into a window but on the inside the leds are bouncing back and forwards and back and forwards between the mirrored parts of these one-way mirrors okay but if you think that's complex i feel like this next one is going to fry our collective minds this one's actually bigger than i expected ah that's so cool so it's meant to be a really similar concept but instead of just two mirrors bouncing the leds back and forth this is based on a dodecahedron which has 12. you're ready for a peel compilation i need a change of clothing now i've made sure not to look at any photos since the moment that i bought it so i'm kind of going in a bit blind here and only be half surprised if this opened up a wormhole to another dimension oh my gosh wow what am i looking at right now let's get some lights off it's responding to my voice things i could do with this power i genuinely feel like doctor strange right now i'm calling it right now this is the coolest gadget that has ever entered this building oh wow what is going on i think i've got to put it down before i get carried away by the power but we still have our stupidly expensive hoodie to test [music] that looks far less cool than i thought it would why do i have a cone on my head this is such a strange material for a hoodie why is it sleeveless it comes with a remote very interesting so we connect that up to the remote we are ready to go i'll show you this in action once we've got all the products on so then we have the laser glove this is getting wild i'm actually very confused as to why someone would need this but here goes this does not look safe it genuinely looks like it was made in someone's garage so the glove is on what's with the studs i'm gonna point this away from you just because i don't want you to die we have lasers and now i'm gonna press this button that must be spinning extremely fast for it to create consistent circles like that this kind of feels like a superpower you could actually hold your arm out and literally blind anyone who looks at it or yourself if you're not careful let's power you down for a minute what a bizarre invention so then we have our piece to resistance it's being sold as world's first emotional party mask which yeah i mean i promised you weird tech okay i'm not gonna lie this this feels kind of cool the mouth is moving to what i'm saying oh my gosh when i blink it blinks as well ah and then when you shake your head it lights up red and says no and then if i nod my head it lights up green and says yes i get it it's making it so that if you're at a loud party and you're trying to talk you don't need to shout to be heard you can just gesture there is also a companion app so you can pick from a bunch of different static displays that was a matrix one this is kind of scary right got a heart line i mean like imagine walking across me like this in a dark alley oh that's nice i can go sad this is confused and this is a cat meow and then finally this is equalizer mode which should be pretty self-explanatory that's also reacting to my voice isn't it imagine my evil laugh right now i've been waiting for you okay i'm gonna stop now this is the most useless incredible outfit i've ever owned in my life the shoes are kind of making me want to dance but the robot inside me doesn't know how dramatic robot moonwalk out of here i got stuck on the carpet all right well that is surprisingly realistic oh i get it it's a thumb drive i am captivated by this one this gun right here fires salt it can apparently eliminate flies and other pests but because salt is so fine it won't damage furniture or windows this is a nice gun they've clearly put a lot of thought into the ergonomics and the the feel of using it the improper use of this gun can result in serious bodily injury i don't get it it's salt loaded up with table salt does this make it an assault rifle a joke why does a salt gun have a safety catch what i heard salt falling it's a beefy reload as well oh my table is covered in salt you can tell from that slo-mo cam that it is making proper impact it's a good thing i'm actually really hungry right now all right we're in the top five these are the craziest of the crazy products we could find on the internet i have so many questions about this one this is apparently a japanese musical instrument but i can't quite see how very nice easy packaging batteries are included one two three now what do you do what is it i can't be the only one who thinks this is wildly inappropriate i feel like someone's going to call the cops if i do this much longer no words well this is by far the most expensive belt that i've ever bought to be fair though if it can save someone's life i'm not complaining okay so fastening the belt like this activates the electronic mechanism it's live now i'm about to fall over on purpose to see if this can save me this is really hard to do please protect me please protect me please protect me it worked wow i'm alive thank you yorkshire care equipment oh my creative egg lights they've actually managed to make falling fun and now i've got a toilet seat attached to me okay these are ready i'm not sure i am i have absolutely no idea how this works oh god oh god i got this on backwards okay so you just tilt forward to move forward tilt back to move back it's just very fast here goes nothing one two this was my fear what do i do here guys oh god this is not what i thought i'd be doing today wait come back here okay if i can get to the unicycle i get to upgrade to it oh my god oh my god i'm doing it this is this is okay this is fine how do i stop how do i stop how do i stop that counts right we can title this video my first time twerking okay unicycle unlocked no i'm scared rgb everything so the slightly tricky thing about this one is that if i just put one foot on it's going to go in that direction so i've got to get both feet on at the same time that wasn't me okay i mean i'm on technically goal one is to stand up it's harder than it looks good that feels good forward back cut back this is it if i can get to the other side i get to move on and test our final gadget i know that the answer is confidence i've got to just stand up all the way and not half commit all right all right okay confidence confidence confidence up okay come on no i'm up i'm up no no no no no no no i'm at a stage now where i'm not even scared anymore i just want to do this there is no way we're quitting now i'm going to use the fact that i'm not scared anymore to just get up straight away okay oh core strength core strength oh i'm doing it i'm doing it it's just two meters okay okay okay it's just me it's just me it's just me i felt like i set myself this insurmountable obstacle and then actually pushed until i did it that feels amazing i can't believe this is a real thing this band right here apparently uses electrocution to force you to keep your habits so it's kind of like a fitness tracker it records things like your sleep quality but the difference is that if i've told it that i have a problem with biting my nails for example ah flip that's like a really hard pinch oh god what are you to see me buying the biggest tech on the entire internet that video's here and i'll see you there
