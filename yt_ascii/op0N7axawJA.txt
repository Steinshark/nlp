well i don't have any cash but i got some gift cards if you need some help to get food and clothes and all kinds of stuff where that at ma yes sir what did that say i believe it's in the mall i think there's one in the mall which is the applebees is right over there yes sir get tonight you going to eat good oh yeah god bless yes sir yes sir thank you man my name's rusty nice to meet you rusty in my previous homeless video i just went around and gave money to random homeless people and you know it did have a positive influence on most their lives but i don't think that's the best way to go about it so what we're actually going to do today is we're going to call homeless shelters get a list of things they need go to the store buy it and deliver it to them what exactly would you guys need and what would be most helpful for you guys if you guys need like couches tvs beds anything yeah hey hey wow look at that it's only 3.99 you know what else is $3.99 no it's something i think i can't what else is$ 3.99 it's something that can do stuff like this no i thought it was more of a thisy all i know is for $3.99 you can get a washer i wouldn't buy anything else for 39 [music] whoops nah nah nah ooh i don't like that washer it's kind of ugly nah just kidding guys everyone comment how great of a washer chris is stop telling people to comment things about my life because last time everybody was like don't have [music] [music] kids what's up guys i just moved out and i have this $6 million mansion right here we got nice microwave table here it's been pretty what' you say lunch is ready so the homeless shelter told me that they spend most of their time washing clothes so this is an $800 washer and dryer and we got two of each of these because if they spend most of their time washing clothes we might as well make it easier so we're waiting on all the washer and dryers to be grabbed from the back and yeah guys i think they're almost done so let's go [applause] check so the next thing they said they needed was a stove and by the way if you guys don't want this i will gladly microwave a microwave microwave and microwave microwave and an iphone inside of here so if you don't want this just give it right back to me but yeah it does have an open en closer just like pewdiepie's chair that's the the na'vi boys wow this stove has the fast boy wait what's inside of here i'm fast ass boy next i said they needed a lot of cleaning supplies so so we're just going to dump it all in here have you seen the thing where if you pour chris what are you doing getting those gains all right i think that's enough g we should t it down we got to get the games more games did they use some cascade i think they want cascade there we do we do good viewers this is one clean cart and remember guys it's always a dad and we won't get demonetized cuz these are actually for laundry should you eat ti pods jimmy no no no no no no no no how about you thought this video was us giving stuff to homeless people nope it's a tie d you're so extra you call me gay yeah [music] thanks all right guys so we just bought a bunch of washer dryers we bought a stove we bought a bunch of soap especially tide because you know this is a tide ad now we're going to head to walmart buy a bunch of stuff from walmart and yeah last time i came to this walmart i got kicked out ask what you're doing i'm just working on a video and we cannot do that in the store not allowed all right absolutely not all right okay i'll so i'm not quite sure what type of shampoo homeless shelters want so we're just going to start grabbing [music] things next they said they needed a lot of toothbrushes so [music] we have about 200 toothbrushes they said that twoth freshes obviously can only be used once and they need a [music] lot all right so the next thing on the list was they said they needed a bunch of computers they said they had a grant but it fell through so they didn't get computers so what's up man uhoh here we go we got to be on youtube i need five high five desktops some five monitors done what's up [music] f all right ni i appreciate it y'all have a good one i love what you guys are doing say

monitors five really nice desktops these ones will do them just well we just drove an hour with the u-haul full of stuff we're here at salvation army because the salvation army near where i live didn't want anything so we had to drive an hour for one that actually needed stuff so is there anything special what we need to do or just just start unloading it just start unloading all right see i'm doing work yep that is awesome they' got microsoft office and antivirus with them i mean we can help you guys open up stuff if you want to i mean we're just trying to be as helpful as we can if you want us to open it up and help you with it do your old ones do y'all do y'all need those hauled off cuz we've got that truck there unless y'all are going to donate them or something probably give them to the the old on to the family store uhhuh mhm and we have people that are all in our refere re housing program so we're going to split half of the stuff we bought with them and then give the other half to the other ones so we bought a bag full of flipflops and stuff that should be pretty useful awesome that's great thank you so much i appreciate it and this is what that's brand new towels woo and these are towels i tell you what put them right there and do y'all need any coffee we've got a bunch of coffee got coffee yes sir we they drink it but like just take the wash and dry for instance we put the new in the old that comes out we we'll end up putting it in our store gotta but every all the money that goes in that store goes right back into the community yeah for helping people in need so it's pretty awes yeah that's awesome you guys are doing this and thinking about us like helping people yeah awesome it's not you use stuff like this clean and whites clean spray wash

first place went really well i'm actually really happy with how that went this is the second place we called ahead we got a list of everything they needed like a washer a dryer tons of other stuff so i'm really happy to see how they react to it should be a lot of fun i'm excited we spoke to somebody yesterday about making a donation got we got some washers and dry for you guys a bunch of so we stopped by and we donated some stuff to salvation nory so now we're here for you guys okay all right all right where's the best place to put it right now it's a stove this one the ov sto working here yeah but the work and that one the oven works [music] but i can't really tell the difference i don't see i mean which one was the new one again i think the left one's the new one i can't really tell yeah so they told us to throw everything else in this room so i guess we're just throwing it in this room room are the old computers these are probably at least like 5 years that one's at least 10 this looks like it's from when i was born this will be their new computer i i don't trust you down there out sorry thought this was sponsored by quib but it's a tie d this is how you have to move famous people you're fired if i drop whoa royalty royalty at its finest old mr beast so we've basically offloaded everything we have the monitors the towels bed sheets that just tons of stuff over here more computers more monitors washers dryers we put in the stove over there more stuff and yeah hopefully it makes a difference yeah and thank you all yes ma'am i hope it really does yes it does thank you we're done well we really do appreciate you know what you all had done for us and you know helping us to help those that are homeless and who are nearly homeless and we will you know put it to great use as far like helping out with the homeless population we didn't use a sponsor because usually when i use sponsors people just complain i don't know why but people just get mad at me for using a sponsor even when i give away all the money people still get mad at me so comment down below if you care whether or not we use a sponsor obviously if we use a sponsor we can give away way more money and if you want to support me and allow me to do more nice things like this buy my merch it will be linked in the description it's pretty fire i'm not wearing it because it's just so fire i
