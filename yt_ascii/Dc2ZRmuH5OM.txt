you don't lose those lives. and then there was two, what are you guys waiting on? - [nolan] you were filming stuff. - [karl] yeah. - [mrbeast] no one has
been able to do it so far, will nolan complete the impossible? no, watch out, watch out. (bell dinging) get out of here. (nolan sighing) karl, everyone has lost a life. - [karl] watch this, ready? - there's no way he does this, no way. oh, oh. oh, he hit it.
(buzzer sounding) you hit it. i'm sorry, but even if
you are actually dead, you lost a life. and all four boys lost
a life on this course. since they all just lost a life, i'm gonna put an extra life
right here and not tell them. shh. for this next stage you can

just reach up and touch it, but they won't. and to distract them even more i'm gonna put an extra life right here. so they're gonna be focused on this, and not even realize
the diamond's missing. - [chandler] hello? - [mrbeast] all right, come on in. you can go whenever you want. there might be something
on the ground over there. - [chandler] oh my god, he did it. - boom. - [mrbeast] don't touch the laser. - get skinny, wait for them to go down. - [mrbeast] be careful,
