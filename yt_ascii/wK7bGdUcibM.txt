the mechanical pencil the calculators the tvs over the years japan's sharp corporation has delivered a bevy of iconic products but starting at the turn of the century the company found itself increasingly trapped in a single incredibly competitive business attacked on all sides by foreign competitors and running out of money the company sold itself to a taiwanese electronics giant the first such foreign takeover of a major japanese consumer electronics company for this video let us talk a bit about the rise and decline of the 100 year old sharp corporation but before we move on i want to talk a bit about our channel sponsor private internet access or pia i frequently work in cafes not sure if it's a throwback to my university days but i find that i can't really focus unless i'm surrounded by other people working around me however this also means that i am using a public internet connection and frankly that makes me a little nervous maybe it's just me but i feel a little uncomfortable logging onto a public starbucks wi-fi and seeing that warning label saying that all my traffic and browsing history are being exposed it really is kind of like sending private one-on-one messages into a public group chat so i have been using a vpn to help with that pia whenever you connect to the internet on a public wi-fi network at a coffee shop airport or a library pia helps protect your personal data by encrypting your internet connection through one of its servers in over 84 countries and each and every us state it is pretty simple to use and is available for virtually every platform you use windows mac os android linux one subscription can protect up to 10 devices at the same time is more generous than many other vpns i use pia on the iphone ipad and the macbook air it also works with streaming services like netflix iplayer amazon prime and more considering that i'm right now obsessed with the last of us tv show on hbo max which is not available in taiwan this is good sign up using the link below and get pia for about two dollars a month plus four months free there's a 30-day money-back guarantee and 24 7 customer support so it's completely risk-free my thanks to pia for their support founder takuji hayakawa was born in'93 in tokyo the third son of a furniture maker he lived a harsh childhood his mother suffered health problems and could not take care of him so he was put up for adoption treated harshly by his new stepmother takuji was forced to drop out of the second grade for work but at the age of eight an elderly lady got him a position as an apprentice for a strict but compassionate metal worker after training and metal working for seven years hayakawa graduated and joined the workforce soon after came his first invention a belt buckle dubbed the tokubido what was special about this buckle was that it can be fastened without needing to punch holes into the belt it was a hit selling 4752 pieces and necessitating a serious expansion and capacity thus at the age of 19 hayakawa opened a metal workshop of his own in tokyo with just 50 yen of invested capital 40 of which was borrowed a few years later in 1915 a manufacturer placed an order at hayakawa's workshop for the metal innards for a mechanical pencil struck by that pencil's poor quality hayakawa worked day and night to produce a superior version the hayakawa mechanical pencil this pencil was a hit most pencils at the time were imported from germany but with germany fighting world war one at the time the haikawa mechanical became the next best alternative the business rapidly expanded hayakawa's long-lost older brother masaharu joined the business and in 1923 the two brothers built a new 990 square meter factory staffed with 200 workers to handle all the orders then on september 1st 1923 11 58 a.m the great kanto earthquake struck the country haikawa his family and his factory survived the initial earthquake which is said to have lasted over four minutes however haikawa's wife and two young children perished in the massive fires that followed the initial quake over one hundred thousand people died in this national disaster that does not include the various mob-driven massacres of ethnic koreans that occurred thereafter a horrific and undercovered secondary tragedy amidst this devastating societal and personal tragedy the hayakawa brothers pencil factory burned down hayakawa still owed 20 000 yen worth of pencils to his pencil sales distributor which he could no longer produce to compensate for this tokuji transferred over all of his pencil making equipment and granted them free use of his patents he then moved to osaka for six months to help them produce these pencils themselves tokuji enjoyed his time in osaka and resolved to rebuild his business there in 1924 after fulfilling his six-month contract he established hayakawa metal laboratories and started tinkering with a new product the crystal radio radio was only recently introduced into japan and most radio receivers were basically regarded as mere toys the dominant telephone and telegraph makers did not deal with them leaving the market to tinkerers and hobbyists hayakawa bought an imported radio for seven and a half yen and tore it apart despite knowing nothing about electricity or radio principles he and his team reverse engineered the device in 1925 hayakawa released their own domestically assembled crystal radio called the sharp at three and a half yen it was drastically cheaper than its foreign competitors the sharp radio came at the perfect time that same year the tokyo broadcasting station and ancestor of nhk started japan's first radio program radio channel subscribers grew steadily throughout the 1920s and 1930s despite the sharp radio's popularity hayakawa knew that crystal radios were an inferior product a crystal radio relies on the radio signal's power to make sound limiting its reception and volume levels vacuum tube radios on the other hand were capable of boosting the signal's power and volume after reverse engineering and imported nutradyne hayakawa eventually produced the sharp dine series of radios depending on the model the sharp dine had three to eight vacuum tubes ran on ac power and caused a fraction of the foreign imported models is sold like hotcakes sales went from 58 000 in 1936 to 130 000 in 1939. to make enough radios to fulfill demand haikawa built a new factory and set up a production line with 23 minute long steps on a conveyor belt in 1942 the company changed its name to the hayakawa electric company producing all sorts of radios from simple receivers to advanced two-way radios for airplanes in the military effort this business supported the company through the difficult war and post-war reconstruction periods in one case the company only survived thanks to the korean war spurring massive radio purchases by the us army in 1951 nhk and other big japanese companies started experimental television broadcasts to demonstrate the technology's potential they set up receivers in public areas these large screen projections were well received so the nhk moved forward with public television broadcasts same as with radio hayakawa electric wanted a television receiver ready for the big event with technical assistance from rca the company eventually produced a device in time for nhk's first television broadcasts in february 1953. the tv 314t japan's first commercially available television the tv314t still cost a megaton it cost 175 000 yen at a time when the average civil servant made 8700 yen a month nevertheless the products early and timely entrance secured hayakawa's dominance in the domestic television market manufacturing costs fell and monthly salaries grew and before long a household television set was no longer so expensive and sales skyrocketed haikau electric quickly started moving on to other categories in 1962 they released japan's first microwave the r-10 as well as japan's first solar-powered consumer electronics product a transistor radio high power remained a dominant solar cell producer into the 1990s but it would be another product that put the company onto the global electronics map in 1960 excited about the future possibilities of the growing semiconductor industry haikawa electric started a team to design logic circuits and eventually produce a computer however japan's ministry of international trade and industry decided not to enroll the company into its mainframe computer development program without government support hayakawa decided to focus instead on sophisticated but non-programmable consumer electronics like voucher printers cash registers and calculators calculators especially in 1962 the british company bill punch had started importing and selling its vacuum 2 powered desktop calculator anita so high kawa set up to produce their own 20 key desktop calculator powered by germanium transistors thus came the cs-10a compat one of the first all transistor calculators it used 530 transistors weighed 25 kilograms and cost about 535 000 yen or fifteen thousand dollars in today's usd despite the price it sold out its entire 300 unit supply in just a few months the next year silicon transistor prices rapidly started to drop allowing hightower to produce the cs20a calculator first released in september 1965. it was more power efficient reliable and best of all cheaper newer models quickly followed 1966 saw the cs-31a the first desktop calculator made using integrated circuits the calculator had half the parts half the weight and sold for half the price that year high coward led the japanese calculator industry with 44 market share selling 24 000 units about half of that was exported to the united states through its sharp electronic subsidiary as well as global distributors like sweden's facet i did a video about facet earlier in this channel worth watching in 1970 hayakawa electric changed its name to sharp corporation the brand's name derived from a pencil but soon came to encompass everything the company did that year founder takuji hayakawa also stepped down as the company's president takuji passed away 10 years later in 1980 at the ripled age of 86. new president akira sayeki took on the challenge of guiding sharp through new uncertain economic conditions sharp's calculator success triggered over 50 japanese manufacturers not to mention various american ones to enter the market too setting off what we now call the calculator wars in about a decade the calculator went from this desktop-bound monstrosity with hundreds of vacuum tubes to a portable battery-powered gadget doing all of its calculations on a single integrated chip the calculator was the mobile phone of its time and the calculator wars pushed sharp and its competitors to pull every possible trick to make their calculator smaller cheaper faster better up until now such calculators use fluorescent display tubes or nixie cold cathode tubes to display their numbers however these were expensive large and power inefficient in january 1969 a sharp researcher watched an nhk documentary about rca in that documentary rca demonstrated a technology they announced back in 1968 dynamic scattering mode liquid crystal displays scientists first observed liquid crystals in'80 they were a strange material they sat in a phase between liquid and solid and refracted light like a crystal thus the name in the early 1960s rca researchers noticed that liquid crystals had interesting electro-optic characteristics and eventually invented a way to electrically control the way they reflect light as a technology for creating a display but in order to be suitable for a calculator the crystal display needed a better contrast ratio and had to work at room temperature more work had to be done sharp ask rca's general manager bernie vonderschmidt to develop and produce dsm lcd screens for their calculators and even offered to pay for development however rca and vonderschmidt declined the reasons for this are unclear rca wasn't too interested in lcd seeing it as a distraction from their core cathode ray tube or crt display business and vonderschmidt personally had concerns about lcd's immaturity cost and yield by the way vonderschmidt was a silicon valley giant he helped teach rca semiconductor manufacturing methods to taiwan's first teams and later co-founded xilinx with ross freeman in 1984. his japanese contacts were essential in helping to secure manufacturing capacity for the first fpga anyway in 1971 sharp licensed some of rca's patents and set up a team called s-734 to put a dsm lcd display into a calculator in 12 months after tediously mixing over 3 000 kinds of liquid crystals and synthesizing 500 plus mixtures the team eventually produced the right mix for a suitable screen thusly in june 1973 sharp brought the lc mate el805 to the market made up of just an lcd and five ics on a single glass substrate it is hard to convey just how revolutionary this product was the calculator was 2.1 centimeters thick 12 times thinner than its closest competitor it used 1 9000 the power of existing calculators and can go for 100 hours on a single charge and weighed just 200 grams a 125 times reduction more calculators followed including a solar powered one in 1975. by 1985 the company had cumulatively sold over 200 million calculator units sharp continued its studies on lcd technology in the mid-1980s they found out that ibm had identified a new full-color silicon-based display technology known as tft lcd has a potential replacement for crts they got to work producing their own version of it and in 1987 the company leapfrog gets lcd competitors and successfully producing a 14 inch full color full motion lcd display then in 1991 they debuted the first wall mounted television the 9ehc one people recognize this electrifying technology as the future and it started replacing crt and televisions and other displays unfortunately this strong position was in marked contrast with the rest of the company following the unraveling of its real estate bubble japan's domestic economy weakened from the influence of a strong yen increasing wages and the effects of manufacturing offshoring this recession fundamentally shifted the direction of japan's big electronic firms cheap foreign imports challenge sharps older products like fax machines calculators and microwave ovens to replace them sharp launched a belly of new more advanced products some like the camcorder were relative hits the viewcam had 20 percent of the japanese market after its release in 1992. but other categories like the wizard electronic organizer never took off and saturated categories like notebook pcs failed to make enough money profits declined throughout the 1990s in 1998 net income fell to 24.8 billion yen representing just a 1.4 profit margin and a near 50 decline year over year this bad performance resulted in sharp's president resigning the company's one bright spot have been lcd panels and lcd related products responsible for 30 of company revenues thusly in 1998 new president katsuhiko machida sought to streamline sharp and reposition its lcd business at its very center the crystal clear company as he called it in his first press conference he said sharp's problem is low brand perception for branding we have to make quote unquote a clear face for customers to this end we will set lcd technology as our face from now every sharp product will be related to lcd technology sharps pivot towards displays was risky considering the emergence of intense competition from the rest of asia particularly taiwan and south korea regardless sharp had high confidence in their lcd technology they ditched their venerable crt television business which dated all the way back to 1953 and went all in on lcd televisions launching its aquos tv brand this bold move seemed to have paid off in 2001 aquos quickly captured 80 global market share in the very young lcd tv market generating nearly 400 million usd in sales worldwide sharp seemed to retain its dominance even after 2001 when a bevy of japanese and korean firms like sony samsung and lg followed sharp into the television market by mid-2003 aquos dominated the local japanese market with 60 market share the next year in 2004 sharp still held a leading 33 market share in the overall lcd industry but samsung and the competition were catching up faster than anyone at the company anticipated notably in early 2002 samsung caught sharp and the rest of japan's display industry by surprise by being the first to produce leading edge 5th generation lcds looking to cement their lead sharp began investing billions of yen into new tft lcd factories across japan the largest of which was the kamiyama plant and kamiyama city in the mia prefecture this massive factory had two phases completed in 2004 and 2006 and costs a cumulative 4 billion usd it produced over a million panels a year the world's biggest at the time kamiyama represented a big bet on japan-based production by now many other japanese companies had offshored their lcd production to cheaper countries president machida and the management however had high confidence in the superiority of sharps technology and believe local production was necessary for the company to retain its secrets local media praised a factory as a model of japanese manufacturing sharp position its panels as a premium product the kamiyama model brand was to be like the kobe beef of tft lcd of televisions the billions of yen spent on the kamiyama plan however strained company finances like many other conservative japanese companies sharp had a long-standing financial rule restricting any single division's investment to a certain percentage of its sales operating income and cash flow but because of lcd's importance to the company these rules were waived unfortunately the plan came online the same time as other massive facilities built by taiwan's au optronics sony samsung and lg the lcd panel industry fell into a situation of oversupply in 2004 a 32-inch tv panel cost about 865 dollars by 2011 that same size panel would cost about 149 dollars throughout the 2000s sharps tv market share would fall from as high as 80 percent to under 10 while its rivals caught up to the company's first mover advantage the lcd television was starting to turn into a cheap commodity looking to retain leadership sharp announced that they would focus on selling more lcd panels to other businesses as president machida said back in 2004 we will try to keep greater than 50 share in world lcd panel production half of our products will be sold to other lcd tv manufacturers and the rest will be used for our own tvs such a plan can be achieved if we continue to invest in production capacity this strategy meant even more financial investment leading to phase two of the kamiyama plant in order to pay for it sharp cut its investment in home appliances by 2006 lcds made up half of the entire sharp corporation's revenues you can say that the lcd push had some positives lcd-related division sales steadily grew from 2002 to 2006. and in the fiscal year ending march 2008 sharp as a whole showed record high sales of 34.5 billion dollars and a billion dollars usd in profits but was this healthy revenue machida mentioned that he wanted 50 of production sold externally but that ratio never cleared 20 percent and with competition from taiwan south korea now china catching up and surpassing sharp the massive investments they made into lcd production were not paying off as originally expected in 2007 president machuda stepped down and a new president took office mikio katayama however machida retained his influence as chairman together the two oversaw the financial blow that crippled the company in 2007 sharp announced that it would build a new set of factories in the city of sakai osaka prefecture the sakai factories would cost 3.4 billion usd and were projected to be almost as large as the latest kamiyama phase 2 location 13 million units of 32 inch equivalent panels compared to kamiyama's 20 million units who was going to buy all of these new panels sharp reached out to fellow japanese tv makers like pioneer toshiba and most importantly sony in february 2008 sony then the second largest lcd manufacturer announced an agreement with sharp in which sony would take a 33 ownership share in the sekai factories then named sharp display products however sharp failed to properly manage relations between its tv and display panel divisions it is the same issue with samsung and apple where one division of the company competed with the customers of another division sony found itself relegated to second place behind sharp's own aquos tb sales leading to shortages and delays that pissed them off in the end sony did not go through on its 33 purchase and never owned more than seven percent and eventually sold its entire stake in the joint venture back to sharp sharp tried to sell sakai's larger panels to the united states but these 60-inch tvs never really caught on there then came the global financial crisis sales collapse and losses increased in march 2009 a sharp announced that it had turned a net loss for the first time since the stock went public in 1956. management admitted they made a mistake in investing in local production within japan yet they still continued investing in sharp display products which changed its name to sakai display and kept lcd at the center of their strategy this was despite the tv business division continuing to deteriorate by 2009 sharps tvs held a market share of just six to seven percent good for fifth place and a third of samsung's market-leading'.8 percent operating utilization for the new 3 billion dollar sakai plant fell to less than 50 percent not being able to decide between the lcd panel supply and tv businesses led to sharp losing in both of them sharp sales in the fiscal year ending in march 2012 declined by 10 billion dollars from 2008. the company turned a net loss of over 5 billion dollars and the company nearly fell into bankruptcy in march 2012 katayama stepped down from being sharp's president for this terrible performance making way for takashi okuda however katayama and machida remained influential through positions as members on the board at this point foxconn enters the story in 2012 the 150 billion dollar taiwanese electronics giant bought a 9.9 stake and sharp for about 854 million dollars they also bought a larger share in sakai display why would foxconn be interested i mentioned in a previous video that foxconn has a land and expand business model that seeks to take over a client's whole manufacturing supply chain electronics assembly is an extremely low margin business foxconn squeezes profits through economies of scale and vertical integration up and down the supply network the more components that foxconn's clients source from a foxconn affiliate the more profits fox khan gets to keep and for electronics gadgets like your mobile phone the most expensive component tends to be the display three years earlier in 2009 foxconn helped taiwan's intellects acquire two other taiwanese display companies to create one of the world's biggest tft lcd panel makers adding sharps capacity and technologies enhances this roll-up strategy foxconn did request a more substantial partnership perhaps even an acquisition bisharp declined such a tie up and would do so for several more loss making years chairman machida led the negotiations with foxconn for the investment now with katayama and okida still influential in the company rumors of power struggles wasted through the japanese business press akuda eliminated 11 000 jobs as new smartphone makers like xiaomi became big buyers of sharp small and medium-sized panels but the company remained deep in the red there was still too many players in the lcd market in 2012 sony toshiba and hitachi merged together the lcd division secrete japan despite inc or jdi jdi and sharp competed for several years causing pain to both and sharp for all of its supposed technological prowess missed several critical industry transitions including that towards new display technologies like led backlit lcd screens and oled in march 2013 the company announced a staggering 5 billion dollar loss leading to all three leaders and former leaders katayama machida nokida exiting their positions the company never regained his footing thereafter in 2013 sharpened fujitsu began losing their one solid grip on the japanese domestic smartphone space perhaps one of their last hopes in the consumer electronics world apple surged ahead and now holds dominant market share as early as the first investment in 2013 foxconn had an offer out to sharp for a more substantial investment at the time sharp declined but in 2016 after three more difficult years sharp finally accepted foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66 stake for 6.2 billion dollars however foxconn then revised that offer down to 3.8 billion upon learning about a bunch of new financial liabilities several other students came up including those organized by the japanese government however sharp's bank creditors eventually chose to side with foxconn sharp's acquisition represents the first foreign takeover of a leading japanese electronics firm a sad end for a venerable 100-year company foxconn appointed a taiwanese tai jungwoo as its new ceo he has sought to cut costs closing various unprofitable overseas ventures cutting even more employees and moving production out of japan in its first full year under taiwanese management sharp turned a profit though small for the first time in four years tai reoriented the company back towards producing the branded electronics products like it once had many years ago foxconn is also rebuilding sharp's withered semiconductor manufacturing business which include a very nice 130 nanometer fab i mentioned this briefly in my video about foxconn semiconductor ventures in india in february 2022 tai retired and a new ceo from foxconn took the job he previously led the company's brand products division another indication of its future direction sharp corporation became a consumer electronics giant not necessarily because it had the best technologies but because it used technology to produce the right products at the right time as the company fell deeper and deeper into lcds the company clung to a confidence in the superiority of its technology but as it turns out display panels are brutal grinding business with low margins and high insecurity and a ground up sharp too we shall see where foxconn takes sharp in the future the brand still has a hundred years of value behind it i hope i can see it rise to its former glory once more all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you
