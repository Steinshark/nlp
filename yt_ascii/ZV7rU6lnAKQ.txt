already falling down in the mud. it has been raining here
in la, which is not common. these contenders are not used
to the environment today, but they're gonna have
to get used to it fast to adapt to this environment if they wanna walk away
with the $100,000 prize. black already getting weapons,
running through the field. - [black team player] hey,
hey, over here, over here. - white is coming up
from the rear from the- - [blue team player] grenade! oh! ah! - a smoke grenade. blue smoke grenade being thrown in the far side of the field. purple going in, and they're trying to loop that same area that the australians just came in, where they didn't find weapons. but now they do have a few weapons. - the australians are trying to flank behind that guard there. - [blue team player] try
and make a run for it! run, run back! - and then we also have purple coming up behind the
australians in those ruins. all right. purple now, taking shots
at blue through the window. and we're seeing a live face-off here between purple and blue. there's a lot of camping
that's taking place right now. - as teams are afraid to push. but i see a push right now! gold moving in. they're gonna run in on red. shots being fired! balloons pop. i think that building, they might have it. teal running out. and gold doesn't see 'em! gold doesn't see 'em! teal escapes gold's push forward. - [blue team player]
don't waste your ammo! unless you're hitting, dude. - pink is retreating from green on the far side, on the egyptian side. we also have the black team over here. - [black team player] take out the girls, and take their ammo. - [green team player] how do i look, guys? do i look good? - orange is sitting in
that spot right there. oh, there's a push now! teal coming in. now, we're getting some live action. purple down behind that car. grab the weapon. he has a rifle now. - [gold team player] watch my back. got him. he's out, he's out! - faze blaze, again,
completely out of the game. all three balloons gone. - so, blaze, how do you feel, man? - bro, it feels bad, man. there was a gun right out
in the open with a full mag. and rug didn't have a gun. and i was like, "all right, rug, take my gun. give me cover fire. and i'm gonna try and
get the gun for you." and literally, the second i stepped out, like five teams looked at me. - just lit you up? - and just lit me up. - faze blaze, first member that confirmed, completely out of the game. that's gonna hold, faze. black sneaking up now. they're moving in on that red team. it's purple. it's purple versus 12. and purple's completely eliminated. - what, what happened? - [purple team player] one gun! there's literally only gun in our vicinity and two teams on both sides of it. - ah. - white team, still
camping in that corner. yellow pushing forward. some live action through these ruins here. as blue is camping, yellow's
running through the field. - cameron! cameron! cameron! - what?
- help! - what? - putting it all on the
line, these youtubers. - i'm gonna cover you, okay? get up. - you get hit with one of these pellets, it doesn't feel too good. - [yellow team player] mason, run, go! - bro, you're fine. - [white team player]
you're out, you're out. - [yellow team player] wait the front. what the is this? what is that? let me get this. - only team that i see
fully intact at this point is red, is white, excuse me. white is on the... - [gold team player] got 'em
all three, got 'em all three. they're all down. - [red team player 1] we're out. - [red team player 2] am i dead? - [red team player 1]
yeah, we're both dead. - [red team player 2] dang it. - storm is coming in. the staff is pushing these
players to get the more... cross-wave combat! blue walks in. walks to the pillar. it's blue versus teal. they're shooting through the window! balloons being popped! they're exchanging! oh! there's a couple balloons left. and teal's, teal's out. - [light blue team player] i got one. - there's only one balloon
remaining in there. - [blue team player] am i popped? - and it looks like, maybe somebody in teal has forfeited because they were getting
sprayed at close-range. teal completely out. and there was an exchange at the end. and he's out! blue's completely out! - so what happened? give me the rundown. - when it starts off, they're like, "oh, yeah, you're in
a high artillery zone. you're sweet." literally, no guns within 100
meters of where we started. - [gold team player] where'd noah go? - [gold team player 2] i don't know. - [gold team player] you're
out, you're out, you're out. you've been out, dude! - [yellow team player]

all right, it's all right. - [green team player 1] what? - [green team player
2] the gopro popped it. - four battles about to go down. i cannot wait to see how this ends. - [gold team player] yeah, yeah. check the trees. purple, one building over. - getting pushed to the center there. - [pink team player] got 'em! go! let's go, baby! - pushing hard. orange has been forced
from their camping spot. and i believe purple is
in the storm right now. i believe they're in the storm, and they need to push forward or they're gonna get disqualified. - [gold team player] out! out! i got you, i got you, i got
you, i got you, i got you. - shots! - [gold team player] i
got your balloon, bro! - he's still alive. he doesn't know he's alive. - [orange team player] you're
out, you're out, you're out. - we're yelling to him, we're trying to let him know. we're trying to help him out. not technically cheating, but... - yo, courage! - we tried, bro. - what happened? - it was intense. we all walked through one
doorway and just went, - really? no way! - we have the black team, sitting all the way out there. and orange retreating back
to the, the camping mechanism that's been working for
them the whole game. they're easily outnumbered. - [orange team player] you good? - black retreating. black sees a flank. black is pointing out, and they're pointing right at
light green and dark green. they're pointing out
this flank that's coming. and they're getting prepared
for it in that far corner. coming up through the trail right here. - [green team player]
should we just do it? - and the six man team agreeing. - [green team player]
i'll follow you, dude. - now, listen, green's
kinda out in the open. but they do have an advantage. - [dark pink team player] we
gotta make it behind that wall. he's pushing out, he's pushing out right there! - i'm not sure if that
came from orange or pink. but a team we just didn't
see this whole game, came outta nowhere. - slinging shots! - [green team player] which one? right here? - [orange team player] we're going too. - and now green is in a tough spot. they're getting cornered
from both orange and pink! - [orange team player] i

down by roman atwood! - [white team player] one more, one more! - what the heck? - [white team player] andre,

little before that guy. we're gonna squeeze him! turn that way, that
way, that way, that way! he's right here in front of me. - and roman atwood, and tanner, with one balloon each. oh! roman atwood knocked outta the game! it's one v one! it's tanner! uh-oh. he's behind. he got him! - guys, i saw you guys hoarding weapons. what happened? - man! you know, we had it, and then somebody suck up behind us. we got pinched by two teams. we were taking fire from everywhere. - it's not about winning or losing, it's about having a good
time with your friends. - and you had a good time? - i had a great time. - dude, thank you, "apex". - and the joogsquad is back. the black team is completely out. - [green team player]
i took out one or two of their balloons. you got pretty close. - leaving the area, i don't see green. i'm not sure what happened to green. and i don't see pink. - pink! - [dark pink team player]

guys, put your hands in. put our hands in, put our
hands in, we're still in. namaste, go team! - [green team player 2]

have their weapons up. and there's a spray right there. i'm not sure if tanner is still in. - oh! tanner fox knocked out of the game. - yo, what happened, man? - oh, man. my teammates, they did super well. the zone pushed, and i had to be out in
the open versus two teams shooting at me. - ah! two teams! how was it? was it fun? - it was a lot of fun.
- yeah? - it was a lot of fun. thank you, "apex". - yeah.
