ladies and gentlemen it was late evening last night i was enjoying myself sitting on my couch doing what most people my age do nowadays which is scroll aimlessly through their phone and waste hours of valuable existence and i came across a youtube short that featured andrea botes and it was called never resign never surrender never give up i am andrea boces opponent a 2100 rated player played one of the most disturbing and horrible games i've ever seen in my life and i thought to myself well you know the bottezas have been using me for some you know youtube farming and i absolutely approve of that so why not return the favor in today's video and show you this absolutely catastrophic game that andrea botez's opponent played and credit to her she put up a fight she did not surrender and she had like no time on the clock this game will be an inspiration to all of you struggling with your chest that even at the 2100 level you know absolutely nothing about the game i'm 2700 blitz and i also know nothing about the game we're gonna take a look at this game also if you're lucky enough to watch this video in the first 12 hours that it's out all my courses are 50 off valentine's day sale link in the description everything 50 off just saying happy valentine's day to you and your loved ones if you don't have a loved one yet you'll find one chess is a very good start they'll think you're smart also andrea's opponent deleted his account after this game so that's the purpose of today's video d4 do check out the bow ties live channel we'll be doing some more collabs with them i don't know who we are it's just me so andrea began this game with d4 her opponent played d5 and her opponent's brazilian and isn't acai bowl because that's what they are and andrea played you know typical london she plays the london she only plays the london i don't think she knows any other opening exists with white just say listen that's i'm not trying to start no beef she would probably beat me up in a boxing match but she only plays the london bishop d6 bishop g3 actually her opponent is playing a very interesting variation by the way everything i'm saying in this video like if you get offended by it you're very sensitive it's just a joke minus the fact that her opponent played catastrophically you're about to see that that's not a joke her opponent plays a very professional variation of the london where they do not play the move knight c6 this c5 bishop d6 and queen c7 approach trying to move the knight to d7 was popularized i think in a game between magnus carlson and wesley so like four or five years ago and the point is that the knight just doesn't go here so the knight comes here supports the pawn and also supports e5 it's just a slightly different way of playing the london andrea does the right thing i mean she plays knight e5 there's other ways to play this position with white you can try to play bishop d3 and very quickly push for e4 i think in my d4 dynamite course i recommend rook c1 and then there's this very interesting move c4 just basically trying to blow up the c file c4 blow up the c file i am not funny courses are 50 off though valentine's day sale so yeah you're trying to blow up the c file with the move c4 opening this up and trying to punish the queen for being there because normally the knight would be blocking that so there's a lot of ways to play this but in almost all of them black is completely fine so she plays knight e5 and now the guy does not play what you're supposed to play guy goes back to playing the traditional setup which is probably still fine and here andrea plays this move f4 now i like to play the london like this too but i like to play the trumpowski which is when the bishop went out there on this on the second move and normally took the knight so i just do this with no dark squared bishop which kind of aesthetically looks nice because this bishop is like really jostling position with the pawns i mean it's not easy at all here to get comfortable now her opponent plays a really sophisticated move the idea of f4 is to build up this massive wall to take like this to force black backwards and then to use the center clamp to then create a very strong attack on the king and as you see from the eval bar stockfish very much approves of all of this and likes it a lot now the drawback of playing the move f4 other than your dark squared bishop being very unhappy is because you have pawns on dark squares which of your color complexes is weaker which one if you have four pawns on dark squares you are rock solid on very good the dark squares and you are very weak on the light squares which means 97 works and now your opponent tries to just block the light squares i mean knight e7 is a brilliant move like if if i didn't know the elo here i would just assume that black is cheating but black is 2100 so you know smart enough to play the movie 97 very very very good move and now knight f5 but the thing is white can just slide out of the way and even though this bishop is very very ugly you still have decent attacking chances like white can still try to play g4 h4 you cannot stop an avalanche with a horse all right like you could probably read that on a fortune cookie somewhere you cannot stop an avalanche with a horse wow i mean this is like really true gotham i can already see the top youtube comment of this video it'll probably be me pinning my own comment about the valentine's day sale but once that is gone it'll probably be quote you cannot stop an avalanche with a horse unquote and then it'll say dash levi 2023 and yeah so g4 is on the way so now her opponent plays a move that's a little bit too sophisticated and what i mean by too sophisticated it's like sometimes in chess you come up with this ultra elaborate like plan and it like involves multiple moves but it's just really stupid like it's just a very bad plan and you're only going backwards why does black go bishop e7 in this position lycos bishop e7 because he anticipates the move g4 and he is going to rotate his knight from c6 to e7 to f5 to d6 that's the idea to d6 here's the problem you're never going to get here okay now if white allows you to get there yeah that's really dumb by white all right that's not white doesn't want that so andrea plays the move queen to f3 now here the engine gives pawn take c5 queen c5 baiting the queen into a line of attack first and only then playing queen f3 and then pushing for this attack in general the point in the london is if white wins the battle for these two squares which i will draw in multiple colors so you can understand the significance if white dominates e5 and dominates e4 in my opinion white is just much better i don't care if the engine thinks it's equal your opponents are not engines or maybe they are in which case they'll probably get banned or maybe they won't they'll just play for six months and then they'll get banned so queen f3 like to me this is already a complete success story white has completely dominated this white will play g5 queen h5 like just start a huge attack rook g1 also white can always cast along but even the king in the center is safe it's just a massive armada of pieces in front of the king right so i was looking at this game like all right this has been that like what how did it get so bad remember this all came from andrea bottas like clip right it was a short and it was her opponent just playing disastrously in the end and i was like she's playing great game like what's going on so her opponent played b6 now here she really should stay focused on g5 but she decided to bring another pawn to the party the problem is now you're giving black time to consolidate and there is a hidden resource in this position and the higher you go up the rating ladder like the more you're gonna have to understand how the entire board works together for instance the move b6 affects h1 how does the move b6 affect h1 like how does that what is the what is the symbol like what how are these two connected they're connected because the bishop wants to come here hitting the queen and getting to the rook which means that the move knight e4 is now possible it's crazy but b6 e4 and h1 are all connected because the knight is now able to go here why because even though white wins this massive exchange bishop b7 is a dynamite and and i mean you simply you're simply losing and even if let's just say the move the rook was here this is still not very pleasant this is still not pleasant at all except for like the laser beam just shattering the entire board so the move b6 affects e4 affects h1 and that's something that you just gotta like get better at as you get better at chess so she plays h4 he plays knight e4 very well timed move yeah and now her attack is kind of stopped like that's honestly just the reality which is why i like the trumpowski a lot because on the second move of the game i don't even have to worry about the knight like i'm i'm always going to be able to take and and my opponents do not get to have a double nightclamp and god forbid black also plays f5 like god forbid black also gets this i mean this knight is never going anywhere white will have to try to fight on the g file instead so 94 and unfortunately andrea blunders here she takes and that's already losing just the first move is losing the first move is losing because black just takes like this black is not going to take with the knight hoping that he gets taken black just goes here and it's a fork and it is a fork under normal circumstances that is not a fork but you cannot take this because i just showed you knight e4 and queen e4 so and bishop b7 not not just queen e4 bishop b7 wins this so it's over black is just completely winning black is up a minute and a piece she has to now go here and lose this most people resign here it's minus seven most people resign one minute on the clock 2100 opponent mad that they blundered a fork they resign she does not resign and oh my god thank thank the heavens she did not resign because it turned into the greatest piece of content i've seen it like the 2000 level you are not ready for what you're about to witness rook g1 bishop b7 queen h2 the guy's just coming in 94 d2 is a check pawn takes pawn like you gotta open the position trade off how is she even gonna attack she got no attack all her pawns are in the way but she play she finds this knight takes d3 all right he tries to open up the position she plays this and gets hit with knight takes c3 now knight takes c3 is a little too flashy for my liking black is trying to do this that actually doesn't really work because of king e2 but also in this position it's not checkers she could have taken a moment and just played rook c1 but she has 30 seconds okay she has 30 seconds and rook c1 pinning the knight to the queen would have been obviously more potent defensive stand but 30 seconds i can't really blame her she goes here and is like well i'm not down to piece anymore so the guy did not need to sacrifice all right when you're winning and you're up a minute and a half like trade pieces trade pieces why are you sacrificing all right converting winning positions which is a chapter in my middle games master class which is available at chesley.com 50 off right now in the first 12 hours anyway knight takes c3 takes here king e2 and she runs her king out and i mean she's dead lost okay she is dead lost but the guy still has to find a way to win he plays f5 the idea of f5 is to secure the control of the center and also probably to open up the file to get to her king so she just plays h5 she's got 20 seconds on the clock the guy goes here the game is over over over over queen d3 is made you move the knight i check you i probably win everything in a few i got rook c8 rook c3 like it's beyond over she plays rook d1 okay she has' seconds on the clock now they're playing three two so every time you make a movie game two second bonus all right he takes on g4 which is an accidental blunder he blunders this i don't know if it was deliberate or not because now it's made in three it's made in three on the board why and he finds it he finds queen e2 and folks what you are about to witness in the next eight moves is the most disgusting throw of a game beyond the 2000 level i think i have i think that's ever happened ever happened consider everything the clock situation consider the board consider all of the possibilities for black to win this game white's only legal move is bishop to e3 bishop to e3 loses two things number one it loses a queen an absolute queen no questions asked and on the very next move you give a check and you mate okay queen h2 instead of that black plays the better move black plays queen f3 check andrea goes forward black now has no less than two checkmates in one move with the queen the piece that just moved you literally cannot draw it up any better tunnel vision exists when people move the same piece multiple times in a row literally take the bishop or go here it's mate the only two checks that make any sense on earth it's made in one the only two checks if you get lucky and you accidentally blunder well well then it's gonna be making a couple of moves all right in instead of that her opponent plays this her opponent after this and this spent one like two seconds on bishop f6 not queen d5 not queen e3 but bishop to f6 god bless because she took the pawn now he has like 70 different checkmates and three he can give a check with this rook with this rook with the queen with the i mean the king should not be that far forward all right he gives a check king to f5 not exactly the most accurate check he can still take the bishop he can play pawn to g3 he can even play the absolutely disgusting king f7 king f7 trying to get a pawn mate queen e4 doesn't quite work because the king escapes and there's really no mate now which is why he needed to get the other rook into the game because after this king f5 any bishop move is made any bishop move except that one is me you gotta just move the bishop and it's a discover check and mate okay he gave the wrong check fine king f5 now he plays g6 check i don't like that okay i don't like that for two reasons number one it hangs a bishop andrea doesn't take it she does this okay now he gives her a check again she now has a couple of choices she can move the king but she decides to go f5 okay suddenly black is out of checks and black has 15 seconds so he's probably in panic mode he's like oh my god i got no checks i mean he has this but that loses a queen he doesn't play that he panics now he can still get checkmate in two moves all he has to do is bring the queen back that is not even a complicated move because if you just ask yourself how do i check the king on the next move queen e7 that's mate in two that's made in three max i don't know but the king's got no moves andrea's opponent not only doesn't play a queen e7 or rookie 7 or anything to the seventh rank he goes here he he hangs checkmate in two i she even ended the game up more time she she ended the game with more time i told you it's two second bonus like bro no wonder this guy deleted this i mean i i am sorry okay but she had 13 seconds on the clock to a minute the guy found queenie too he could have won the queen he could have played queen h2 he he could have accidentally checkmated here those mates happened by accident just the last like three moves he made were with the queen how okay even here just give just get closer with but by the time he decided to give checks with the queen it was too late and she saved the king and not only did she save the king she won crazy all right folks you know i got low elo chess on this channel you know i i have this how to lose a chess playlist this man is now the president of this playlist i mean what a game what a game he played well he played well it was a high level battle but it goes to show you at the end of the day we're all bad they're bad i'm bad magnus is bad compared to stockfish we're all bad you think you're bad these people might be double or triple your rating and they are more than capable actually not they andrea did not blunder checkmate in one but her opponent might be three times your rating and look what he did so let this be an inspiration to you okay that anything is possible on the chessboard doesn't matter if you're 700 it's gonna be like this for the next two thousand points the amount of times i've blundered checkmate in one i got so many clips on youtube on my clips channel of me doing it don't get discouraged chess is hard all right and this game just cracked me up i was like oh my god i gotta i gotta i gotta do something with this so shout out to andrea for never resigning for fighting on in a bad position and she won the game she she could have resigned at any of these moments and she didn't so credit to her and credit to her opponent for putting on a good performance good performance by the opponent as well and yeah i'll see you in the next video get out of here
