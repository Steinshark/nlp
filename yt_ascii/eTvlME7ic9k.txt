this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] okay so jonathan well i'm not going to introduce you because anyone's that's anyone that is here is here for you and you also notice recently that it's kind of silly to introduce you as a nikon carver i think it's hilarious i really actually enjoy it especially when like jordan peterson introduces me as a russian orthodox icon cover which is just great it's funny yeah and and it is more and more visible with each interview that you're having recently recently that okay icon covers don't talk about those things or don't talk about it it's mostly that i think it's i think it's just strange people don't understand how to how to frame me they don't understand what category to place for me and then so they struggle they have to give me a qualifier and then they struggle to do that right so i think it's just part of parcel of what i'm doing you know i'm trying to kind of span a lot of categories in what i'm doing so so i think that's what that's what happens when you try to do that but you also studied some theology right yes i did yeah i studied theology both in university and on my own i don't have a degree or anything but i did study in there's an orthodox program here in montreal so i studied i studied for a few years in that program so i have some formal some formal theological education but most of what i know is just from my own reading and from my own yeah sure but but it's not just you it's like matthias is a very curious guy then we recently learned about dan how many yeah yeah three though they're three pajo brothers and so so yeah so material is more he is definitely more like a mathematician he studied computer science in school also yes he's more hermit like you know that's more of his personality and he but he him also i would say most of his understanding and knowledge comes from his own studies and not from the formal formal world of academics we both became very disillusioned matteo actually makes you actually quit university i think he had like one or two classes left before he got his degree he almost did it on purpose because he he was so annoyed with the academic world that he quit just before having his degree just to almost to be able to say that he doesn't have a degree in anything so yeah i mean maybe maybe it's a question to your parents actually not necessarily you because i have four little boys myself and i wonder how to how to raise them so that each of them like follow their own path but at the same time is so successful as you three are because dan also it was like a popular guy in canada yeah my brother my brother dan was a professional skateboarder at some point he was one of the top he was like in the top seven or ten like top ten in the world for a few years just super very technical very proficient and so he's he's actually now a pentecostal type pastor in vancouver and he just opened a a skate park there so we're quite like we're all the all three of us we both we are the three of us are quite different in some ways but then also in other ways we're pretty we're very similar like our father is someone who wasn't afraid to just blaze his his own path like didn't feel the need to get the let's say the the acknowledgement of others necessarily like it's like he just did his thing and he did it you know completely and so i think that we we all three of us got that you know we we never felt like we needed to have official titles or official disks or official that we just did what we did with all our all our heart really low low inagreeableness not necessarily to fit in oh for sure oh for sure my tears low and agreeableness my father too i'm higher in agreeableness and and dan i'm not sure i think he's probably pretty high and agree with this too yeah okay so before we move to the symbolic stuff i wanted to ask you about the missionary work that you did because i get you you say a word or two about it here and there but we never got like a whole idea what what it was like and and what what did you do there and you were still there right then right i know i was orthodox but i was it was a it's one of those things like don't ever do this people so because what happened is i was i was going through this crisis i would say a general crisis which was not not just a crisis in terms of art and there was a spiritual crisis but i was also working a job which you know although i appreciated the work and i appreciated the job i always felt like there was something missing or that i was that it was just not it wasn't particularly useful to be doing what i was doing i was working for a project management company and developing developing pedagogical material and and writing case studies and doing animations and doing all this stuff kind of like to support their trainings so so that's what i was doing i was doing that i guess like from 1999 to 2000 1998 to 2003 maybe it's about five years anyways so in that moment like i was i was just thinking like this is not what i want to do long term and so with my wife we had looked at going to to do some volunteer work with a christian organization which was called mcc mennonite central committee but i converted to orthodoxy in 2003 and then everything came together in 2003 to leave and so i basically converted in like on at pasca and left in the fall which was just never do that that's like the worst thing you can do because i was basically a new convert and i was just kind of thrown out into the world and there in congo where we were i was able to it took forever i was able to finally find a parish but it was really hard to access it and it was difficult because of the cultural difference you know it's like all imagine all this cultural difference you've just become orthodox then you move to africa and then you go to an orthodox church in africa so it's really intense and difficult but there are some very powerful shining moments of my time in congo in terms of orthodoxy that were that were pretty powerful anyway so while we were there what we were doing was working with artisans the mcc mennonite central committee they started a project called ten thousand villages which is which was a series of stores all over north america that sold let's say handmade things from all over from all over the world with with kind of fair trade ideas like ideas of encouraging local economies encourage local know-how and also preserve more traditional ways of making things so that's who i was working with in congo we we basically teamed up with a group we basically created a network of artisans and because export was so difficult to do in congo what we did is we opened a local store and then used a local store to kind of train the artisans in terms of terms of quality in terms of design in terms of also how to present yourself to clients and all that because it's hard you know when people are are poor and are don't have a lot of education they don't it's like they need a bridge right to be able to interact with people that are more highly educated and have more means and so we were kind of acting as that bridge between the market and the artisans and we did that for four years in congo we opened the store we had about working with like at least 30 different artisans and artisan groups and when we so what we did is we set it up in a way with a local partner and we trained that person and ultimately the last year like the the the fourth year we we moved out of the management of the project became like consultants and the project just ran for that year with the local person and so that store remained open until copied like it so that was like 15 years but it was a pretty it was a pretty powerful project especially knowing that in congo most projects just don't they just don't they they they physically yeah congo is a crazy chaotic place but sadly the store is in is in trouble because of covid you know it's just they don't have he didn't have a lot of safety net and so i've been in contact with our friend there his name is debo and he's really struggling so we're so hopefully like there'll be some opportunities for him soon because it's it's it's tough we have at least we have social nets that kind of help us out of these moments but covet in africa like in kinshasa was just insane it's it's they had lockdowns can you imagine lockdowns in in kinshasa like my friend called me and he said he said we have these lockdowns the police are finding us we have to wear a mask and all this stupid stuff and then he said oh i it's like i'm just i just have a bit of typhoid right it's like there's diseases everywhere in congo like people get typhoid they give them a little bit you don't get covered right it's like okay as long as you don't get like coconut is nothing compared it was just so absurd anyways gosh so that tells you it gives you an idea of what we were doing and now okay so we're using congo in three years in kenya oh wow was there a like a spiritual element to it in any way evangelization no not at all no not in terms of the not in terms of because i wasn't a mennonite you know so we didn't have official evangelization as part of the the program it was really more in terms of a craft but there was always there's there's always like a secondary evangelization that is you know you you you work with people you know you you learn from people and you become like a testimony but to be honest the idea of sending missionaries to evangelize africans is the silliest thing in the world it's like they should be sending missionaries to evangelize us because they're way more christian than we are and so to me the idea of going to africa to evangelize africans is just a it's just not a just not something that holds up it's it's more to to kind of help them to give them potential to do the projects they want to do you know so that that's what we're doing it's actually it's actually happening already in poland we have a very famous ugandan priest that goes around and gives retreats so you know it's happening but [music] in terms of like the the orthodox church is not necessarily known for sending people out into those remote areas right is is that this is there a reason they will but it's different yeah it's a different way of evangelizing orthodox the way the orthodox will often do it is this is that for example there was an orthodox mission in congo which was pretty successful it was more in the interior than in kinshasa and the way they did it is i mean they basically send a monk a monk goes out there sets himself up builds a hermitage you know builds a chapel starts doing his thing and then it attracts curiosity and ultimately admiration and then people start to to kind of congregate around that monk that's that seems to be the way that it was done also in alaska in the different places where the where the the the orthodox had a major impact that seems it's a it's more that way than through colonization but that's like particularly like the russian church or the or the yeah both the russians and the greeks so the russians are the ones who evangelize alaska for example and they were very well received by the by the local people there because of because they didn't they didn't come with also a lot of the colonization and the evangelization was done with like the military on one side and then the evangelization on the other and so it's very shady whereas in alaska it was more of a just someone you know saints who would go there and and and just live with the people and so that's what happened in congo there's a there was i forget his name which is horrible chicago was a greek it was a greek monk who went to the interior of congo and set up set himself up there and he had a massive effect i saw some of the churches involved with him that's one actually one of my little magical moments of orthodoxy in congo is one year one year i was in the interior when pasca was coming around and so i was away from my my wife for several weeks kind of in a small in a small area inside and kind of in the in the congolese jungle i guess and so it wasn't totally in the jungle it's a city but it's really it's more remote and so pascal was coming around i was i was doing my fast for the hope for a holy week and so i was i was like what do i do like i won't i won't be anywhere for pasca it's not gonna work out so i start asking around and i start asking people do you know about you know you know about an orthodox church and asking the congolese around me and a lot of people were like i don't know what that is and then there was one guy who said i think i've heard of what you're talking about this orthodox church and he was really fascinating because the man he was severely handicapped he was that he was he his legs didn't work very well and so kind of had to drag himself on the ground with his hands and his feet and but despite that he was like a serious badass this guy was tough his nails i mean a lot of the people that are handicapped that i met in congo are super tough they almost have to be right because it's like they have to overcompensate for their physical lack so he was super tough and he's like you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna set it up for you i'll figure it out and so he basically sets it up he finds he says there's a church i know where it is he finds where the church is he sets up his taxi to like bring me to the church on on saturday in the afternoon so i get on this taxi the taxi breaks down in the middle of nowhere and so we get out of the taxi and he's with me right so he's like there's another road down there so we like get to the other road and this guy's like crawling on his hands and on his hands and legs at this point we get to the other street he flags down a car and i'm not even sure it was a taxi at this point and he's like can we pay you to bring this guy to this place and so anyway so i get taken to this to this church like through this whole chaotic thing and i arrive at this church and it's like a third from salinity that's like dropped in the middle of like congolese forest it's amazing so there's this church there and it's saturday afternoon and i'm like walking around and you know there are no white people there there's no there are no europeans there it's just it's just called these people and so everybody's like what is this guy doing here like what is happening and so i walk into the church and it has frescoes it's beautiful and then people start to kind of stream in from everywhere they kind of just start to stream in for the for the possible service and i'm thinking you know it's like i haven't struggled i'd struggle to go to church and i for all the holy week i was in i was there and i'm like i need to go to confession you know before bosca so i'm like trying to figure it out and i see this line forming before the priests like okay this their people are going to confession so i get in line with everybody to go to confession and it's like i come to this to this african priest and like i do my confession and the whole time i'm thinking like what is he gonna like how is he gonna react and he has the best reaction in the world he looks at me after i go i confess and he says you know we're not pagans anymore so we really have to live like christians and i'm like what did i say like what is the thing which what did i say that it's like here's an african priest telling me to stop being a pagan anyways just oh you're vegan yeah it's pretty amazing so so i was able to commune that that night and spend the night with the people and you know it was really greek greek chanting and everything but then when they said christ is risen you know at the moment of the resurrection then africa started to like appear people started to to you late you know when you hear women going i started to like to be more boisterous so it was wonderful so i had so i had a few moments like that of like amazing contact with orthodoxy in africa wow well i certainly wouldn't expect that to happen there yeah well interesting you know you can't you can't know what to expect especially in congo everything's possible okay so thank you for that but let's move on to yeah this one is something else okay so that the the moment that i think i got what you what you meant was was the moana video right so where you you brilliantly showed that okay so we have those images but they present this deeper reality that tell us something about our current situation like like the mechanics of the of the of the current world surface in in in that movie and then we can see that right and and especially shocking was was the scene with the the pile of those flat stones and then the shell on on the top right yeah that was so clear it was i mean if you doubt my interpretation up to that point when you see that that pillar with like a with a with this shell on top it's pretty clear yeah yeah it was it was definitely like the the definition of of of this moment right yeah but then i checked the comment section right in under that video and there was someone talking about how the shell can actually be the you know the rainbow over the mountain or that it can be the the crown the crown yeah that's right yeah that's the thing that that's what makes it all very ambiguous and strange is that in a way maybe that's what's happening ultimately at this moment but you know it does can i say this is that that maybe that's what's happening but it's also there's a scandalous aspect to it it seems to happen through scandal but so it's like we don't excuse the scandal even though it might be ultimately revealing some little hint about how all the things come together at the end yeah so so would that be okay to say that so the patterns there we have we have the pillar and we have this this let's say the crown but then the interpretation is something else like if it's like a positive finishing up of the hierarchy like the decoration or if it's like the i don't know the the harbinger of breakdown soon the thing is that in a way so especially in moana it's what you have in people with people in disney and a lot of this is that they have a very very actually profound and intuitive understanding of these symbolic structures but they are weaponizing them and so that's the problem and so often that's what some people point out to me they'll say like there's this this aspect which is seems to be true or since we pointed something true and often they're right so for example that image is very powerful but in in the story it's represented as a kind of replacement scheme okay you know because it ends with you know let's say it ends with with maui being completely left out of the equation and then this you know the having moana that they solve the problem of the goddess and all this like it's these two women encountering each other ends up being the solution to the problem and so it shortcuts the usual masculine and feminine relationship which caught which brings about that's like the birth of a of a new world so so the image for example the image so the image of the pillar is you're right that it has there's something of it that can actually reveal a high mystery about reality but then it ends up being weaponized so you but you see that all the time that like i said a lot of the people even even some of the wokest the wokest of the woke they they they have a very deep intuition about these patterns and they're using them and that's why christians and that's that's why christians and people who don't want to be completely take over taken over by this thing have to be able to to understand it it's the same with the rainbow symbols you're right that that you know the current ruling party that that that is ruling in terms of culture narrative they're using the rainbow in a way that's completely symbolically right like it's not it's a it's a perfect understanding of the rainbow it's just weaponized in one direction and therefore it becomes a problem because yeah because it it is it's almost like a devouring it's using the ornament to devour the image as you can imagine the idea like of the pillar in the and the crown it's like this crown is trying to eat the the world it's trying to devour the the normal yeah yeah yeah so like from the technical perspective when i'm when interpreting like a work of art like a movie or or animation of sorts you get the full idea of what this pillar with this shell means in in the light of the following scenes not not not in itself like in in isolation right yeah so it's you always have to interpret the patterns as all together like and that's i think i always tell people when you're interpreting a movie for example you have to stay inside the movie as long as possible because people tend to right away see something and say oh that's an image of prometheus you know and then they then they jump out of the movie to now make these analogies but it's like wait before you do that why is that image of prometheus used among all the other images that are there you need to get that first before you tell me about something else and so i always that's my always my recommendation is for people to let the story the story tell you what its relationships are so like if this happened again with this happen for example in the green knight movie where people would take certain aspects of the green knights story and then they would say well this is very this is good like this is a powerful image of some powerful image but like okay yeah but you have to be able to account for all these patterns working together in order to really see what it's about and not just isolate one and it's the so it ends up being the same with scripture right ultimately with scripture you have to kind of get to the basic pattern before you take a verse and you just say and you just kind of put it out there you know a lot of a lot of modern christians that's what they do they just take a verse and put it out and then it looks like it means something but it's you always have to have it in balance with all the other stuff going on okay so so you teaching all of us the the things symbolically the symbolic way of thinking is a kind of apologetics right i mean that maybe i mean i think you could see it that way apologetics in the sense that it's it's at least proving let's say proving the case that the patterns that are in scripture are useful for you to as a lens to see the world and so it can open people up to to wanting to explore them more you know okay so do you think there is there could be a danger in that in like like you had with with the green knight like people interpreting just things taking out taken out of context maybe and maybe you can do the same thing with with the scripture right and when you interpret oh yeah for sure that people do it all the time with scripture it happens all the time you know the word heresy the word heresy means choice like that's what it refers to it's like a heretic is someone who takes an aspect of it of something and then takes it to the exclusion of the others so you can you can you can use an aspect of scripture to create complete you know aberrant things like things that aren't that are completely wrong if you isolate them from everything else and and symbolic thinking does not protect us fully from that or does it well it if you truly if you do it properly it'll help because what you want to do is you always want to be able to perceive the different aspects of each part you know and so there's also like it's there's always especially like in old testament stories i always tell people you know each character has several sides to them and so let's say you know let's say jacob represents something in in a pattern but jacob has a light side and a dark side you can see you can see the story from the perspective from different perspectives and see the effect from different perspectives so that helps to that helps to kind of balance things out and so but there there are totally have been moments where people have pointed out to me i think that i'm that i missed some aspect like for example in the moana video there are people that said well you know maybe you could see it this way and i'm like oh you know what there's there's even though i do think that that's what disney was doing what i would like my basic interpretation but sometimes you can miss some aspects if you're too focused on that well especially in the light of all the other movies they're making right yeah exactly it's like if you see it if you see all these movies getting put out with all the same thing you know you can try to isolate one and say this one isn't as bad but it's like it's it's really happening in a way that's almost impossible to i mean if you look at what's going on now it's just crazy like it's it's accelerating to the levels that is just so caricatural and absurd you know like dc comics i think it's like almost every one of their characters now is like some lgbt character it's like you know wonder woman is is is bisexual robin is bisexual superman is bisexual everybody is is one kind of and that's just the first step because the bisexual one is the most like the easiest one to swallow because it it says always selects but he's also you know and then then it's just gonna keep going it's gonna get weirder and crazier and more insane yeah recently i mean like a couple of days ago i showed your propaganda in pop culture video to my local priest and he was like his eyes were like became so big and and he said oh that's that's just peterson on steroids what did you mean peterson on steroids yeah because there's this saying around our part of youtube that that peterson is is the entry drug to pajama right when you notice those patterns in in in several movies across like the across the whole spectrum of movies then it's like so obvious that that you just cannot simply deny it right i have a i have a question because i had this i had this problem recently analyzing waters above in in one of the animes and because you talked a few times about waters above already but i don't know because when when when the when the mountain is is like you know putting us in the direction to the to putting us up like we're looking out and then above us is also water it's it's usually as you say it's usually a water of blessing but then in that particular anime and maybe that was just one scene or maybe the japanese culture is somehow disconnected from from from this way of thinking and and it's it just doesn't work there there were monsters as well like the whales and there are monsters even in western i mean you know the story of jack and the bead stock that the short jack and the beanstalk has the same yeah yeah so you go up you go up the the ladder and then you encounter giants in the heavens so why right right so the question is like we are kind of the the hierarchy is built to to somehow escape from the the flood that is below or the waters below but then it moves upwards towards like waters as well is this is this the way to move well like in terms of the monsters above you have to understand them as you have to understand it fract like as a fractal so in the same way that in the same way that when you let's say you go into the temple you will encounter a cherub at the at the door of the holy of holies or if you're going toward eden before you get to eden you'll encounter a monster at the gate of eden so the gate of eden is higher than you right it's already above you so there are traditions for example that talk about how the dog-headed men are both like monsters from the edge of the world but there are also guardians of guardians of eden so all of this is related it's the idea that it's like if you're in a world right so imagine you're in in any world so the world has a lower part and the world has a higher part right a part that gives itself to something above now if you move down you'll encounter monsters you'll encounter cerberus you'll encounter you know the the kind of tonic monsters these earth monsters you know whatever it is that you the freaks the amazons all of this is at the it's at the lower level okay the demons and all that stuff you see in western imagery the demons are underground right and they're mixtures of all these kind of creatures but if you go up right you encounter angels angels are monsters too i don't know what to tell you they're men with wings they they're hybrids they they but they it's not the same it's a different it's a you have to be careful right not to not to mix them up not to confuse them because one of them is like a guardian for a higher level the other one is let's say the the that's a you could say that it in a way might act as a guardian for even lower level so cerberus is a good example yeah subaru staff people down here from coming up but he also acts as an image of hades for that person that's coming this way right so it's like if you're coming this way you could be eaten by cerberus cerberus is preventing these things from coming up so you can unders you can always understand it that way so when you're going up then you'll also encounter a guardian and then that guardian will stop you from going up but it'll be like the lower aspect of the higher world is the best way to understand it okay so you could see it as a support right so for example so the cherub guards you from it's not necessarily a monster that eats you could also use potential so like a monster the cherub acts as a guardian to the garden of eden but the cherub is also the mount of yahweh right yahweh rides the cherub across the heavens so you see that in the psalms right so he's the potential he's the throne right the he he guards the throne of god and the throne itself like the reason why some angels are called thrones is not arbitrary right they're the lower aspect of what is above us so they function in a similar way as the throne that would be below and would have like you know imagine a throne with like you know like lion feet like you see in a lot of these thrones like that's that's when the throne is the throne is potential that that that seats your authority that you sit here you establish your authority on your throne and so it becomes an image of your kingdom you could say so the throne is potential and then the crown is potential right there but it's different it's the crown is is glory the clown the crown is glory but they're related they're related together but they're not the same and and you could say that you could say that metaphysically ultimately in god they're the same but not in the world and you have to be careful not to confuse them because that's you could say that that's the trick right that's happening now one of the trick that's happening now is to confuse the lower waters with the higher water and to me try to try to change try to kind of switch one for the other right so you have an intuition right that let's say the crown is the highest yeah yeah and so so then what what the world is trying to do now is to put the monster up there yeah as the crown in but the lower monster yes so that's what's going on like it it's that's why the the highest god right now is is you know intersectional monster okay so that's the flip that's what we worship and that's the flood at the same time because the the the the above and the lower mix right so exactly you could say that it's an image of the flood because that's exactly what happens during the flood the waters from below come up the waters from above come down they mix they mix together and then the world ceases to exist okay okay that's why a lot of this stuff is like is is basically it's destroying the world it's destroying the category and is this is this war always going on like do the margins always attack the center or does the sensor always ex try to expand to to to get the margins or do we have a stability at times or is this always like is this always is there always this turmoil i think i think that there's always a tension but i don't think that it's necessary to be conflict all the time so i think that there can be let's say so for example like the image of yahweh writing the cherub right so that's an image of a a balanced relationship between the margin and the higher aspect you know you can imagine for example moments where the stranger is a wonderful relationship of trade with with strangers or with other empires and you have a you have an empire and then you have these other empires and and they are able to have enough peace so that the they provide potential for each other and they actually kind of increase the the possibilities of each and so that's though there are moments like that in in history i think but it's it's difficult to kind of maintain that you know and then things tend to get pulled a little bit on one side too much and then they then they move to the other and then you get this flow you don't get the pendulum and before you know it you have war right right as as for war i haven't done it during video because i was really expecting that you would do it i don't have a covet passport so i haven't seen it so i'll watch it as soon as it comes out here in streaming i'll just get it and watch with my family okay but but movie the movie is one thing but you know the story right you've read the books or another basic story yeah basic story i tried reading dune several times but man i don't i really don't enjoy it and i never finished i read like some of the later books when i was younger but then i tried reading the first book again just two years ago i guess but yeah i just didn't like i just didn't i found the writing to be able to be too like really heavy and and very winded long-winded i would say yeah well talking didn't like it either so you're in the same yeah i mean the the the main question i have about about tunis is whether it is the the return of the king story or the barbarians at the gates like when when paul gets the freeman to take over iraqis again is this and and i don't know how to how to interpret that because like with each book with each next volume you the the story develops and it's never finished so yeah the consequences of that act of that one action are spread spread across millennia right so you want to know if if it's the if it's the return of the king or the invasion of the barbarians right that's your question yeah so this is gonna it's gonna not this is not gonna be particularly it's gonna be an answer that might frustrate people is that that really depends on the point of view right right that's what that's this that's the thing so think about that's the post think about this with king david like king david is a great example right so king david associates himself with a bunch of thieves and thugs and like lives as an outlaw in caves you know and so when he becomes king from the point of view of king saul yeah right it's definitely not great you know but for sure from the point of view of david then it's the arrival of the hidden king it's the rival of the true hidden king and so it's not it's sometimes it story's going to have multiple can be so the pattern is true right so the pattern of the invasion of the barbarians is true i'm not being a postmodern and saying it's all mush and it's all it's all it's all whatever you want it to be it's like the pattern of the return of the king or the hidden king the secret king manifesting himself is true the pattern of the invasion of barbarians is true but sometimes one can be the other pattern from a different perspective and so so but there's also like you could say that you can also have things like patterns of like the let's say the king wielding old potential like like something which was forgotten or something which had lost you know so and a good example is so is is moses leaving egypt right is it egypt falling into chaos and losing control of its hierarchy or is it the establishment of a new identity and and a you know it's both at the same time that's exactly what i struggle with each time yesterday that's great dude if you can if you're able to perceive the patterns from the different perspectives then you're you're you can come very you can come a lot closer to insanity no i'm not well if you're careful you can mostly understand that understand that let's say meaning is everywhere right that that the the patterns are there and in their in their complexity and their multiplicity and if you were able to see that in a movie then when you go back in scripture like i said you'll have a much deeper understanding of what's going on there because you're able to see like for example matsir was was really good at this and and then i tried to kind of follow in his example he would always try to say okay so let's read the story from the point of view the egyptians in the text like not not not trying to to to to or for example think of a a proverb where it says if you do this this will happen you know and the the first reading is that this is negative but then asking yourself is there a moment where i would want this to happen yes right and are there stories in the bible that manifest that this relationship of causality in a positive way even though usually we think it's a negative you know so if we once you do that then you can then the story of samson opens up to you and a lot of the stories in the book of judges that people have no idea what they're about will kind of open up to you so so so for sure it so i mean i would say yeah i always be careful not to go crazy but but think that it's a it's a good it's a good it's a good tool to to to to it's a good mental exercise to do that it's like the stumbling stone that destroys the hierarchies it's not necessarily like the the thing that that is bad but not neces exactly so a good yeah so the example in the the vision of daniel right in the story of the in the vision of daniel then you see how the the uncut stone which comes from the mountain crushes the feet of the of the hierarchy and then it comes tumbling down the description of the hierarchy is pristine it's the best one of the best descriptions of hierarchy that exists in scripture is the the statue of daniel you can apply that hierarchy to the temple you can actually apply the vision of the statue of daniel which is an idolatrous evil hierarchy you can apply it to the way in which for example the metals are used in the temple right it's the same yeah but but in that case then the stone that comes to crush it that's i mean if you can get into that space dude you you're you're in a good you're in a good you're in a good on a good road but it's like you said it's hard and the hardest part of it is communicating it because yeah like if you see me in a q a hesitating like and going i'm not sure i want to talk about this because communicating the different aspects and communicating some of this subtlety and complexity is is difficult yeah and i mean i feel the danger of it because i really feel that like if i asking myself if i'm going like too far into into into one of those interpretations that that i could like i could motivate a crazy interpretation of something because you know i see the patterns and it works like that like this for you and then you know yeah goldfish sure you have to be careful and kind of pull back you know and then also you know you could see it as can i say this you could you need to have a hierarchy in interpretations as well you know and so for example let's say the story has a structure let's say the scriptural story has a structure and has a main thrust that is important to maintain and then that they ornamentally or more marginally then those those variant interpretations are real and they're possible but they're only good if you keep them in the proper the proper order because if you don't then you get very dangerous you get a very dangerous thing right so for example like you could say is it possible to understand the story of cain and abel from the perspective of cain and the answer is of course you can't yeah and doing that can actually help you understand like i've i talked about subtly like why christ saves rome why christ is roman is to be able to perceive the story from the point of view of cain or the point of view of esau but that's if you if you're not careful then you come up with people will come up with like luciferian interpretations of scripture because they don't have a normal hierarchy they they will they will flip it upside down and you see that like a lot of the the kind of occultist luciferian interpretations are just them taking the pattern flipping it upside down and then wanting to kind of embody it you have like an early christian sex like you had these they were called canites for example and they were they had completely embodied the idea of the the the let's say the upside down as their their story you see that in you see that in also in in some of the the the weird kind of capitalist sex like in the frankism and and all these kind of weird late kabbalistic sex where they they basically said you know like we'll just do the opposite of the law in order to show the totality of the patterns like dude that's not good like that's that'll destroy the world like that will destroy the world yeah maybe the world should be destroyed right yeah but what did it what did christ say oh in christ christ has the best christ always has the best answer to that he says all will be revealed you know all the stones will be overturned scandal must happen but woe to those by whom it happens right it is the world the things so it's it's something like for example accelerationism so people who who want to embody accelerationist ideas who want to bring about the end of the world right so there are people out there that what they want to do is they want to bring about the end of the world so what they're doing is they want to accelerate the process okay so they will embody things that they think are evil right they'll larp the larp as the their own political enemy and they'll pretend to be super woke in order to provoke the the the hard right in order to provoke right and to to create more and more of this chaos so that world so this so that this world will end and something new will come out of it now like the thing is what people don't realize is that that plays out in you as well yeah so it's fractally true so if you do that for society don't think it won't affect you and so you will be one of those that perishes in the flood that you're trying to bring about yeah you're not going to make it through so that's why christ says things like that where he says you know like we know scandal must happen the antichrist must come antichrist must appear it's all part of the pattern understand that it's gonna happen but that that that doesn't mean that you should play a part in bringing it about because it'll destroy you sorry man yeah yeah i think am i feeding your insanity now like no no no no it don't work so we know that the the children of the revolution being eaten etc etc it's all the same it's not the same yeah right exactly and and the famous line from from the dark knight like that some people just want to watch the world burn and that's that's that's what you just laid out so yeah it's and and it seems like changing changing completely the the the direction like with with bitcoin again you recently spoke to that guy and and it's the same right it seems that two patterns are or the two phases of the same pattern around are going on there like bitcoin is supposed to topple the the central banks right but are the central banks the the proper hierarchy or are they the corrupt hierarchy and bitcoin has this is this people that keep using that immaculate conception of bitcoin like it's the savior of the monetary system or something and how to interpret the bitcoin is it is it you know one or the other or is it both and and yeah you never know no but the thing how can i say this so the for example like let's say the the the decentralized idea right the idea of the decentralized blockchain and to create a completely decentralized network that is almost automatic because it doesn't have a hierarchy yeah it's like those things don't exist in a vacuum like something like that will call to more control and more it was the same with you saw you saw it happen in the internet right the like the internet it was like oh this great thing where now the sudden everything is available and everybody can just say whatever they want and everybody can be anonymous and do whatever they want and people thought like it was it was basically a manifestation of like the of a kind of anarchic freedom and it was for a while right yeah but now look at it right right because because extremes call upon each other right and extremes call call to each other and so the idea that bitcoin will just be left to exist and that that's why if you watch my conversation with actually i think it's not out yet i did a conversation with robert reid love that's going to be on his on his podcast i think okay and and i kept bringing it back to like guns and weapons and saying you know in the end you know it's like this will play out the power of of like the mechanical state that has weapons is going to play itself out in terms of you think bitcoin is not just going to remain online if bitcoin becomes a threat to the system it's going to play itself out in the streets with with real dangerous weapons it's not going to continue to just be online that's a silly idea to think that that's how it's going to play out anyways i think it's naive yeah it's going to call for more control if people want to defend bitcoin they will eventually have to do it in the streets right i mean i don't know how it's going to happen but i'm just saying that it's not it's not it's not a it's not a simple it's not a simple just it's not simple to think that it's just going to take down the central bank like i don't and like i said it's like the idea that that bitcoin is secret power is not necessarily something that you want either okay like do you like it's gonna reveal all these so basically you have you you have right now possibly massive billionaires and bitcoin keeps going up maybe you'll have trillionaires right bitcoin trillionaires who are their only reason why they're trillionaires is because they own this coin that's the only reason they've never built anything they've never done anything they're they don't they they've never managed people they don't they're just people who bought this coin and so is is that who you want to rule you like i'm not saying the people that are ruling us now are doing a great job it's horrible and there's a lot of horrible stuff going on but it's like am i going to trade that for a bunch of guys that bought bitcoin in 2011 really no thank you like seriously no thank you i think i think there is there is some evolution in in your ideas about governance correct me if i'm wrong because i remember you telling us three four years ago maybe about obedience to to the authority right and you still keep that but we as when when kovit came like you had you had expanded this if you want yeah super super obedient so my if you want to know my position now is that sometimes you have to disobey and you disobey and you accept the consequences that's the way that i see the saints do it it's like if you look at the way that let's say someone like sam maximus the confessor for example he just said you're wrong he said he told the emperor you're wrong emperor you've got it wrong and everybody's like if you keep saying i'm wrong i'm gonna i'm gonna hurt you and he's like you're wrong and so he cuts his hand off okay and then sam actually says you're wrong and the number says if you keep saying i'm wrong i'm gonna hurt you so he cuts his tongue out and then say maximus gets sent into exile and it's like i'm not saying that that's easy but i'm saying that so say maximus never said never tried to get an army never tried to raise an army to fight the emperor like another like another character in the middle ages who who disagreed with with his his hierarchy let's say so you can see the difference between a revolutionary and someone who disagrees for the sake of the of the the world itself you know that's what i think but i mean i don't know when things hit the fan like who knows what's gonna how it's gonna it's gonna play out because it's it's not getting better that's for sure that's for sure yeah well on this positive now [laughter] i want to thank you very much for coming to my channel especially in the in this time when it's like it seems that you have an interview every day somewhere and you're becoming very popular very quickly especially with god's dog and and everything that is going around it that you're fine well thanks for the i really love your interpretations and i feel like i remember the the first time i saw them was actually my two of them sent me your video yeah i don't know how he had stumbled upon it and yeah how did it happen yeah and so we both we both really we really saw that you have a very very strong symbolic intuition and so if you cannot go crazy like i think it'll i think it'll serve us all well well i'll try i'll try i tried to carve out the niche with that anime and symbolism but it seems that this this niche can be non-existent almost because like there aren't many people interested in both things at the same time yeah but i mean i would say just i would say to keep doing what you're doing again to to to to do it the best you can and i mean it sure also the the the fact that a lot of your videos are in polish is is obviously limiting to their reach let's say so that's definitely going to to happen but you know i for sure the ones that i saw in english were really really excellent so yeah keep going yeah so thank you very much and i invite everyone to go and buy and support god's dog and i hope that this develops into like a multi-book series and then who knows what thanks jacqueline i really appreciate it it's good to meet you in person finally thank you jonathan see you have a nice day as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can also support this podcast and these videos through paypal or through patreon everybody who supports me has access to an extra video a month and there are also all kinds of other goodies and tiers that you can get involved with so everybody thank you again and thank you for your support
