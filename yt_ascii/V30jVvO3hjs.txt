ladies and gentlemen thanks so much for clicking on this video this one is very special i'm gonna share some breaking news with you and i'm gonna leak a massive secret so a couple of months ago luka doncic one of the best basketball players in the world was asked whether or not he was following some news on his phone and he said nah not at all i play chess on my phone so so luka doncic plays chess who would have thought well today chess.com announced that they've parked and they created the luke.ai bot it's an ai chess bot that's gonna get better every single day as long as you play against it and that's what i'm going to do in this video i'm going to play a game with white in a game with black against the brand new luka doncic chessbot also this is an open invitation to mr doncic and his team that i would love to play a game against them live over the board and before i get into these games here's my massive secret the last couple of years i've been training to get the chess grandmaster title and i was playing games online but i needed to remain anonymous or else people would be able to look at my games and prepare for me so i asked chess.com to let me play on an anonymous account and i name my account luca doncic that's my account i dedicated my account to him because he's the man and in one of the biggest coincidences ever not only does luka doncic play chess there is now a chess.com bot with his name listen mr doncic i would be more than happy to give you your account name back i'm very sorry i took it in the first place i had no idea and i promise i will not create another account named after a basketball player because you're the goat alright let's take a look at these bot games so because it's the first day of playing the bot lucas rated 431 he opens with e4 and listen don't think for don't take 431 lightly is higher rated than at least half of you i think i'll be principled maybe i'll play my favorite i'll play the karo khan defense obviously trying to luca bot said is this some sort of prank said is this some okay all right i mean listen we're down in the trenches here the the queen h5 bishop c4 business does not work against the karo khan because i'm blocking the light squares okay d3 is fine newbies i would say keep the tension in the center i'm gonna play knight f6 which attacks the queen and and kicks it out hopefully the bot doesn't do any crazy blunders this is definitely a move one of the things that i would recommend if you're if you're a beginning player is like don't get distracted trying to chase the queen around just finish your development i want to move my bishop but i'm just gonna go here for now develop my bishop and then castle let's see if it takes okay now now i actually can't do that right every time a move happens in chess you've got to think about what's changed so i can't do my plan but the queen now no longer defends the center so the ai bot is doing a lot of queen moving right now luca said let's go yeah i they gotta time these these bot words because he he does yell let's go but not not when he moves his queen seven times in the opening but again it's day one so i'm gonna play luca bot again i'm gonna take that pump okay can you take that one back thank you all right and we could trade queens but no no queen trade for me i'd i'll castle here we go short castle short castle short castle g3 is a good move now i'd love to develop this bishop so i have that option and that option of course taking center real estate is good also going out that way hitting the queen let's do this that weakens that but it's still pretty well protected okay i can go here but i i kind of like how long this diagonal is knight c3 we're up material so just again every time a move happens you've got to think about what's going on on the board right i'm up material so i'm more than happy to do this now whichever way the bot takes with he can't castle anymore right so we're up upon and white has lost the ability to castle i want to go here but if he does if i do that will it spot the blunder will it spot that it can take my bishop wow boom ouch 400 huh don't change bought out here seeing the queen can go down the board that's hanging i'll i'll push that now again i want to avoid a queen trade and i want to create some counter play so i'm gonna slide my queen over here to this long diagonal and then i'm gonna bring in my rooks ah that's hold on a minute hold on a minute queenstock queen's a little stuck here queen went wandering in the forest wait a minute wait a minute rookie eight wait a minute oh oh now the best thing to do here if you're playing white is to take the rook don't just let me take for free of course i'm not coaching a bot i'm coaching you at home so i'll take the queen the bot said you're playing to win i like that nobody compliments me g4 right so now whenever you're up material in chess the the easiest thing to do is to attack the king or send it down to an end game so bishop g5 now i can play queen takes check which is a fork but i also have knight g4 and then checkmate threatened on the next move so i guess i will i guess i'll threaten that that makes the most sense to me okay yeah the bot is just sort of going back and forth and i mean in this case that's just queen and knight coordination so queen f2 is checkmate it said you were the better player this time dobra igra wants to run it back oh i'm learning i i think i know what igra means i speak i speak russian so it's the same word in both languages and i guess dobra is a good game yeah let's run it back that was a little bit too a little bit too quick for my liking so and again it's easy to beat up a bot when it's rated 400. i wonder if i refresh the page has the bot gained rating or is it just 400 today okay i guess it's just 400 today all right let's play a game with white let's play a london i wanna i wanna i wanna keep this one going a little bit longer d4 e6 all right develop the bishop so the last game it was just a lot of queen moves ah okay well i think the more games that you play against the bot and beat it the more it's gonna stop bringing its queen out so early typical london stuff here i can just defend my bishop by pushing and this actually helps me build my pyramid so there's not there's not a whole lot there that's not a bad move you can take in this case normally when the bishops face each other in the london you want to slide back but what's funny is that if you do that in this case you cannot take back with the pawn like this so normally you want to go here but it's funny because the way that the bot played it's pinning the h pawn to the rook so actually i have to go here which is not that nice it's gonna go here okay queen h6 right so the queen attacks the pawn multiple ways of defending you can always block you can defend the thing or you can move the thing i can't block so i'm gonna have to defend and i guess i will defend with my queen so i can that this is a bad move because i put my queen in the way of my bishop i probably should have played queen here but then i would be putting my queen in the way of my knight so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna castle queenside that's the plan yeah of course the bot when it's 400 it's it's negating its own development it's just sort of making pawn moves but for the average beginner this is a pretty solid position for black i mean it's not good in the traditional sense but the bot isn't really doing anything like horrible or egregious so i'll play i'll play castles yeah it's moving a lot of pawns so the position is very close the closed position is one where both sides have seven eight pawns so at some point i'm gonna have to use my advantage to push forward and and open up the position why do i have an advantage because my opponent made a lot of queen moves actually only two that was a stupid piece of information but my opponent has a lot of pawn moves has kind of sabotaged the the development but this move does have some bad intentions to maybe open up so i need to finish my development i'm gonna probably slide my queen out of the way to get my bishop out this is going to be my plan and and now really it's like the hardest part you have okay like the bot is moving it's king right it's not supposed to move its king but it's low level so what do you do here like what do you do when you've gotten a nice position and you want to kind of push it forward you definitely want to make sure your king is safe so your king is sort of out of the way of the enemy okay well the bot helped me out there and then you want to open up the position like if your opponent's king is in the center of the board you want to open things up you want the trades maybe not right away but just to show you like i'm more than happy making captures every time a pawn trade happens the position goes from close to open so the more pawn trades that happen the more the position opens up and yeah i'm going to move my rook behind my queen and we're gonna kind of stare down that way we have a lot of material staring down now at the king only protected by a pawn okay the king's gone running i think i'll trade here too so like i said the more pawns that you trade yeah the bot is just sort of letting me play whatever i want now every time in in every bot game one of the reasons that i recommend you play humans instead of bots bots just sort of are programmed to self-destruct so at a low level the bot will self-destruct much earlier i'm gonna take not that's actually not a not a great move but it is a move because now the bishop is open so i kind of helped my opponent there more than i help myself now it's good to look around the position and notice what's weak when my opponent played knight h6 that pawn actually lost all defenders so now i have this sneaky move and at an elementary level these kind of sneaky attacks work but it's also just it's not a bad move that can't be taken by the way one of the reasons i i haven't now we play shaq black should go here good move because now the rook defense i would love to get a rook to the c file so actually believe it or not a very good move here for white despite having queen two knights and everything is just to move the king yes i get safer but i'm also trying to go after the king on the c file i don't think that stops my plan i can still play rook c1 although it's not check anymore and now these things softened up so maybe i'm gonna sneak in a little bit closer here with my queen and get to the king all right i'm attacked so i can take a free pawn a free pawn or give a check listen it's hard to say no to free pawns right the drawback of this is that yeah maybe i can be attacked i can't take that i can't take that but i do have a very nice move here very tough to spot move this move uses the weak positioning of the king and also targets that so you can try to find it here i'll give you a few seconds it's a very nice idea of course i do have checks and everything but rookie 5 here is lights out for black because this is made like that's literally checkmate but i have to take the queen first so yeah the bot attacks my rook but it doesn't think about what my idea was so i'm gonna win the queen and that's just made on the very next move so yeah and again the bot is just sort of like self-destructing rook takes i'll play one more game i feel like i feel like this has been you know a little bit fast but it's it's it's on its kind of low level today but it will get stronger as as the games go on so i'll play one more game with the black pieces i'll see let me refresh sometimes when you refresh the bot won't play the same opening i don't wanna i don't want the luca bot to play e4 queen h5 but okay it does is it gonna play like if i play g6 will it play queen h5 or will it play queen f3 okay queen g4 all right i'll play a modern defense fiancado uh development maybe i should have played c5 try to go for a sicilian defense okay i'm just being principled i'm just developing my pieces knight d1 wow i got a rematch luca bot in a few days castles listen principled stuff haven't made any peace moves two times you know i'm gonna attack the center now normally in this structure you want to play pawn to d6 all right we play d5 pawn take c4 yeah the bot is a little bit oblivious to central pawn captures but it will get stronger finish our development i want to stay principled also finish my iced coffee let's play queen d6 gonna trade queens here rook a2 yeah i feel kinda i feel kind of mean playing this version of the bot like i feel like i should have played it in a couple of days from now but listen we're doing our best all right queen trade that's defended let's oh god will it see this ah on poisson i have to play on posanto force right will it comment about on poisson no i don't even i don't even if that's not calm why are you making me do this man i know luke is a better player than this come on me and chess.com he better than this you guys did him dirty on this level one bot all right i gotta listen i gotta i gotta be a good role model to the audience you gotta take hanging pieces gotta take hanging pieces well listen i will say this to the audience okay today is your best day to play this spot because today you will feel very smart you'll feel very very smart playing this bot but it's gonna get stronger in the next few days because it's programmed to be ai maybe we can set up a pretty checkmate maybe we can hold on i'm gonna try to set up like a nice little bishop checkmate maybe that's the move check knight f4 i'm oh i hung my bishop actually oops oops oops that was not on purpose i just forgot my bishop was there e4 push pawn rookie eight maybe i can get a pawn checkmate nope you're not letting me bring the rooks to the center ah pawn how do we i want i want to do something pretty to end this video how can we do something pretty i don't want to lose my pawn i gotta protect my pawn at all costs knight e2 okay he's still not taking i will take this i want to make a knight and i want it to be mate can we do that somehow i want to promote my pawn and i want it to be a knight and i want it to be checkmate oh he's going after my pawn no i will make sure my pawn queens no i will make sure my pawn queens luca how much to get away from my pawn how much do i have to bribe you rookie how do i do this oh wait that hangs another bishop don't take it though please okay thank you check i'm not gonna be able to make a night oh i am going to be able to make a night maybe check how do i do this i want to promote to a knight and i want it to be checkmate but i don't i don't i don't see how i'm gonna do it rook trade wait it said he has a dog the chat message from the bot was like i'm gonna go walk my dog vicky what uh all right all right all right come on i want to promote and i want it how am i gonna do this check good start king g4 okay he's running out of moves we have to make sure he runs out of moves okay the bot did not know on passant check okay ah b6 he can only go there that's stalemate it's tough this is like not easy at all i might just have to give it up i i don't know how i'm gonna promote a knight in checkmate here i guess i'll just have to promote a queen maybe maybe i can [music] i can somehow how do i do this bishop e5 king b1 i need to help all right you know what if i can't promote a knight i will promote to a bishop bishop checkmate very nice ggs listen in a nutshell this is like this is an international master playing a 400 right this is not the most impressive of victories but if you play the luca bot which you can do right now you can train it to get better and it will improve every single day and i think their goal at the end is to get it to play the best bot on chess.com and win and my goal is to play the real luca dungeons in the chess game so mr doncic it would be it would be an honor and maybe we could do a little you know you teach me basketball that's hopeless absolutely not please don't do that i will rip my spine in half trying to play basketball but lucan bought us live out now on trails.com and can you believe it that i had his chess.com account how crazy is that i had the name luca doncic i mean that that still blows my mind i i had i had no idea i just named my anyway hope you enjoyed the video go play the bot link is in the description i'll see you in the next one get out of here
