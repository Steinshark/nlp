ladies and gentlemen i cover a lot of different chess on this channel but in particular one of the things that i like to cover is my own games because i'm not one of the best chess players in the world and i don't play perfect chess and i also have human emotions i'm not a cyborg i'm not really experienced in playing at a elite competitive level and i think that resonates with many of you but also i think i'm able to break down motifs and ideas and thoughts in my own games in a way that you can understand and not just watch but also potentially include in your own games of chess that was a very long-winded way of saying that yesterday i played in title tuesday on chess.com and i played against the aaru now this is like my third game against taru in a year and for whatever reason i can't get paired against magnus carlson but you already know when that happens that's going to be a banger of a video i played a fantastic game of chess against taro i'm very proud of it i would like to show it to you maybe i won maybe i drew maybe i lost i don't know but that's the beauty and we are going to check this out without further ado here we go today's video is sponsored by air just air air sponsored this video please remember to breathe meditate a little bit breathe in breathe out anytime you feel a little overwhelmed go outside get some fresh air if you live somewhere dangerous maybe stay inside now i had the black pieces hikaru opened with e4 which was already a surprise to me by the way like i i i i got paired against hikaro and normally when i get paired against hikaro i just yell a lot and then i prepare myself for the you know playing hikaro for me is like knowing i have a dentist appointment you know like i know what the result is going to be i just have to kind of sit and and and and be brave and whatever usually he plays knight f3 he likes to play a little bit more positionally against me because i'm aggressive and you know he played e4 and for me it's like a split-second decision what i play in the opening i mean i can play a caro khan i can i've been recently i've been playing a lot of scandinavian i actually am working on a scandinavian course maybe if you watch this sometime in the future it's already out but i went for a french and i like to create massive imbalance in the french defense with this with with this move pawn takes knight takes knight f6 i really like this line it's very fun for blitz you damage your structure but you get the open g file you can target white center it's very fun very fun line that i that i like to play it's like my little pet line he went here and at this point i already grimed because this is the king's indian attack you can play e4 d3 knight d2 and then g3 and bishop g2 and knight f3 you can play this with white against anything against anything like you could play it against the caro khan you can't really play it against e5 because like it's a more center-based approach so black would very quickly get two pawns in the center like this but yeah i mean he you know he played d3 and i and i knew right away what he was going to go for so so i went i went d5 oh my god i don't know why that was such an aggressive infiltration of air into my nose bless me though d5 knight d2 knight f6 knight f3 he's going to go here here and here he's trying to play in a in a solid maneuvering positional way try to get me a little bit thrown off and so there's many lines here like the standard approach is black goes here white goes here black goes here white goes here black goes bishop e7 but both sides castle and then you know white plays like rook e1 c3 and then black like plays b5 and tries to attack it's is very normal you know that's one approach i i decided to play g6 because i wanted to put my bishop on g7 that was my you know like in blitz i i i like to frequently fe and k i i like to put my bishop on g7 i like to fe k on my bishop i think it can often do very well against opponents so g3 bishop g7 bishop g2 and we both had the same idea we both both castled and so what white likes to do by playing this kind of close center type of game is white likes to play rook e one to support the center knight to f1 to maneuver pawn to h4 and actually pawn to h5 in many cases and the knight maneuvers through where that pawn used to be to prevent black's expansion on the queen side white frequently will play a4 or c3 and sometimes the center closes sometimes not so play can now go in many directions and the direction it's going to go is me taking a sip of my matcha been trying different caffeine sources recently especially later in the day i don't like such a big caffeine push because then i don't sleep a5 this move is simply trying to take space on the queen side without committing anything else if hikaro plays a4 which stops me from expanding i now get good access to the b4 square and if he plays c3 to prevent access to the b4 square i get that target so the move a5 actually you know saw me looking for 14 million possibilities ahead and that's why i played a5 and karu played e5 which is a very committal decision very very committal but the thing is if you're going to implement the game plan of the kings indian attack which is to attack black you prefer a close center you don't want to do this if you try to play h4 i'll go here you won't attack anybody and now the center is open so i have tons of counterplay so karo plays e5 which i you know i thought about knight d7 one other thing i'm very happy about as well look at the time look at the time i'm not overthinking wh- which for me is a big deal because when i play really good players especially when i play like karu you know when you play karo you just the game boots up and immediately you're like okay i'm going to lose but you know i might try my best that's a really weird place to be psychologically some of you probably have chess friends that are a couple hundred points higher than you again you could have a positive mindset of i'm going to try my best i'm going to try to beat them you know they're better than me but i'm going to try my my best and if i play my best i know i can maybe you know beat them maybe i give them a good fight i don't have that when i play hikaro frankly i don't have that against like the top 50 on chess.com but a3 know was going on with me today hikaru stops me from playing a3 because if he plays c3 maybe i play a3 i give up the pawn but i damage his structure plays a3 and i do my typical you know c5 all right i'm expanding on that side of the board and i want to play b5 knight c6 just get as many pawns rolling forward as possible so here of course i'm very cognizant of the fact that hikaro closed the center and also drove my knight away from the defense of my king so i imagine that at some moment he's going to begin attacking of course i'm i'm i'm i'm very scared but i'm putting on a brave face right i'm attacking his pawn in the center of the board he's defending it and a major question here is should i play f6 should i completely get rid of this pawn not that one that one but then i open up his bishop and rook and then i also give him access to e5 so he can always play knight e5 now he can play like knight e5 and and it's very very nice position for white so i decided that when he played bishop f4 i'm not going to play f6 i also made a decision i'm not going to play h6 because i thought it was stupid i thought well he's going to go here anyway so like why would i do that and if i play king h7 he's just going to play queen d2 knight h2 knight g4 like he's just going to go for my pawn and then that's really bad so i thought you know what i need to be brave i need to not fidget on this side of the board i need to let he come to me i need to stick to my plan with b5 okay hikaru did not rush he played c3 it's very important actually he played c3 it's the best move it's it's the only reason it's 31 that's it so multiple times in this game i put hikaro in a situation where he needs to play the best move like he has to play one of one he can't ignore me he can't just go for an attack because as it so happens like my my counterplay is quite strong here so he plays c3 right and he he's trying to build up the center with d4 and i play queen b6 that's how you play in these kings indian attack positions white comes to you on the king side and now we see hikaro playing h4 this is quite scary the guy's rated 3200 second highest rated player on chess.com in blitz right i got to think queen knight is going to come in the same side pawn attack is my bishop going to get stuck in the corner am i going to get mated and i was brave and just played b4 just went just went along with it so it's what i got to do as you can see i started spending more time right so i spent 17 seconds on b5 then i spent you know 5 seconds that's normal then i spent another nearly 20 seconds and then i took and i was already very nervous here because i thought oh man he's still got 258 like he's made every move so damn fast right so i thought he could do a lot of different things i thought he could take and then i would take and then maybe he takes on a4 but then i have rook takes and queen takes i thought i could go knight c5 which looked nice and bishop a6 and i just thought okay look if hikaru wants to get a game where i'm just stripping down his queen side and it's like a race you know it's a race of can i beat him there before he beats me here i'm going to be happy then i thought well he could you know he could take once and then not take a second time or he could take this way once and not take a second time so i didn't know what to expect but he went here big move and the computer not not you know thinks it's equal very very tense position thinks it's equal i can take but i thought that was stupid i thought taking was bad cuz i open up his queen and i also open up the diagonal for his bishop which i this did not look good to me the computer finds bishop to b7 hanging the knight because if you take the knight the queen of strapped which is bogus which i obviously did not see and then if he keeps attacking me i can play b3 which i would have never i would have never in a million years played the move b3 how can you lock the queen side now you where you going you got nowhere to go now computer thinks it's fine and then you put the knight on d4 i don't know i would have never done that in a million years but bishop b7 is what the computer likes anyway i didn't do that i went here and my idea was i'm attacking the pawn so i know his next move his next move is going to be to take back and now i thought something very simple very straightforward hikaru cannot checkmate me which is clearly what he's playing for without his queen he cannot checkmate me without his queen so i play queen b3 now if we trade queens i'm two squares from queening but i also have a massive advantage because i'm threatening all this he could go here to get my pawn but then i get this so the rook cannot attack and defend at the same time i played queen3 i was actually pretty happy here then he went queen e2 and suddenly i started thinking wait a minute is my queen stuck cu right now the only way for my queen to get out is this way what if he goes here well then i slide over right and i thought i should put more pressure on this pawn so i went bishop a6 and here i had a mini heart attack i had a mini heart attack because i thought my queen was trapped i thought rook b1 queen c3 the bishop goes back and i thought oh that's it it's game over because i can only move queen here because the queen is blocked and then he's just going to play knight e3 or knight e1 to trap my queen and i thought oh man the game's over it's not as it turns out if he goes here here here i use danger levels his queen is worth as much as my queen knight d4 this is the saving move i attack the queen i'm threatening to take i'm threatening to get out with my queen and after this i would escape and i would actually be fine and this pawn would be a huge weakness so very interesting i i played bishop a6 and for a moment i had a heart attack i thought oh my god i lost to hikaru in 12 moves 17 moves 15 moves whatever all right i yeah i thought that was it thought i lost but then he went here and he spent 20 seconds which like to make karu think for 20 seconds is a big deal you know i played 92 and the funniest thing is the position is s if and only if hikaru plays this move so again i was happy that i you know for me getting hikaru to a situation he's got to play really precisely to deal with the pressure is good because if he took my pawn i wouldn't have taken back because a pawn and a knight are not worth as much as a queen so i would have taken this first and then i would have been a pawn up and i would have been very happy two connected pass pawns position looks very nice so he went knight d2 and i slid in we ready to get out in a moment's notice he went rook c1 now as it turns out i can actually annoy him and go here which is hilarious and on this move i can just bounce around his position like a like a like a pinball machine just threatening everything just yelling at everybody instead of that i was like look i'm not going to get my queen traps let's play queen a5 and now karu played h5 and and this is where you know i i felt the most pressure in the game the computer says to take this pawn what hikaru is doing here is a culmination of the plan of his opening but it's very important that my knight is gone remember like long time ago he played e5 my knight was removed as a defender of my king i really shouldn't have i i couldn't stick around because i would have gotten trapped in the future so we fast forward like 20 moves right and now hikaru plays h5 my knight is gone and i really should not be taking because this is so ugly these pawns are really really weak and slowly he will get there maybe not right away but he will get there you know here here checkmate the computer cold blooded says take the pawn and vibe i can't do i mean that does not strike me as normal so i went here and that was my biggest mistake of the game now the computer finds a sequence of moves that tears my position apart it all begins with h6 i knew this move was possible i didn't see its power cuz i thought well now i'm safe my king is safe like my bishop is guarding my king i'm never getting mated but then the computer finds take take e6 and this is very brutal because my knight hangs my rook hangs hikaru's rook hangs but if i play something like rook e8 he just gets my king out shreds my king and then mates me in brutal fashion like this i have to give up both my rooks so when i played rook b8 with the intention of creating b file counterplay i saw that and i saw this but i missed how powerful e6 was but we both did we actually both did it would have been better for me to go here cuz that actually prevents e6 but this pawn to me mentally was just immobile because there's a rook there so he can't move that pawn but we actually both missed that i played rook b8 fearing the worst and karu spent some time and he played a move that i very i'm very proud to say during the game i knew was a bad move he went here and as you can see all two points of advantage were gone i didn't realize it was plus two cuz nobody saw that h6 take take e6 we both missed that queen e1 now it's equal now i thought it was equal even in the position prior like i thought the position was balanced but i was like queen e1 why why i'll tell you why i i actually think this is like a let gotham self-destruct kind of a move which listen when you play me perfectly legitimate strategy by the way and in my true style you know i i i i just kind of like slid a piece over because i was like i'm not going to touch anything i don't want to ruin my position turns out i can already begin taking and taking turns out i can already take this pawn which is incredible because after knight takes i can play knight takes after bishop takes i can play bishop bishop takes and the queen stops guarding the knight and like i i don't get mated cuz the queen takes the pawn it's unbelievable but you know he would like take on d5 and then i would take and then he would take and then i would take but black is surviving apparently black just puts the king here black surviving it's amazing he went here and i thought okay i you know i i didn't i didn't see that idea so i played rookie eight my idea with rookie 8 was to bring my knight to guard my king even more cuz i thought this knight was poorly placed and hikaru's next move kind of expedited that plan cuz now he has a threat now if i play king h8 he wins because he takes i can't take because of this so i thought okay bishop h3 but i was always going to go knight f8 as it turns out i can still go here so like if i spot this move there is a very very very high chance i simplify the position massively now unfortunately i didn't see that move cuz when i play hikaru i just got to be a little bit more confident but you know know against any player frankly i'm playing passively right i'm playing too passively playing too passively i'm still thinking like oh hikaru is going to take at some point it's like what why why why don't i take like why am i not the one considering you know and then if he plays knight takes then we trade the queens and then i take the knight and then etc like why why is it only if he takes now finally he played this i had been expecting this move right so i went bishop h8 i didn't know what his next idea was going to be but i knew we were going to get into a scramble and i was unhappy cuz i was down 50 seconds so what happens with when you play hikaro he plays so fast like every move is so so quick now queen e3 this was annoying again hikaro found the best move i think i think queen e3 was the best move the idea of queen e3 is genius right now i have a very strong center i'm disallowing a lot of forward peace mobility for his army so he plays queen e3 targeting my pawn in the event of a capture and the bad news is i can't do anything about that if i capture now and we go through this sequence there is no queen trade a move ago there was a queen trade now i just lose my pawn i can play knight d7 but then i remove defenders of my king and he can start attacking my king a little bit more it's pretty passive it'll i'll survive but it's passive but the idea is to bait this move d4 is the best move but it gives him this right that's this is the piece i've been trying to restrict the whole game i've been trying to disallow him from trying to punish me on the dark squares i already envision a world he goes here he goes here right he gets in he gets a queen to g7 i get mated this bishop is my lifeline like i can't lose the bishop so it's very very dangerous so he he plays a move baiting upon move and then he slides forward he could have slid back he could have slid forward but now he's targeting my knight now he gets me to play another move which blocks my rook and now he slides backwards and he he's still up a minute he's still up a minute he's slightly better he got access to the center he has a lot of control of potential dark squares and of course i'm a little bit nervous and now i play knight e7 i played knight e7 to obviously open my bishop and go help my king and potentially target this pawn okay karo plays knight e4 and now i thought i came up with a very nice idea i can't let his knight go any further right here or here if i play knight f5 he'll play here and i can't move if i play knight d7 to try to get out he'll push my knight back i go back he gets in here he gets in here it's bad so i thought why not trade i'm just going to chop his knight down normally a bishop for a knight is a bad decision if he takes like this they should revoke the grandmaster title because doubled pawns and now you give me this that's not what you want he didn't do that he took like this so he controls some diagonals here but his light squar bishop is still not threatening me and he's not getting in on the dark squares and so what i played here again a little too passive i probably should have tried to get out i was like oh queen trade look at that let's trade the queens hikaru let's trade the queens and then we'll both fight for the b file and we'll both get our p all you know we'll get our pieces over there it'll be a good a nice fun game i thought hikaro can't mate me with no queen plus i have 40 seconds so i have to play fast the computer wants this it just wants me to like not stress if bishop g5 i can go here if rook e1 i can get my rook in like let me start creating some counterplay look at this i got four pieces acc costing that pawn is that the right word i thought it was like when you when you apprehend somebody you know you go to i hope i hope this is the right word anyway queen e2 he says no queen trade and now i start getting my knight out i got 40 seconds on the clock i'm slightly worse knight g5 i'm under a lot of pressure his bishop is going to come come here what do i do well let's plop the knight into the center of the attack i wanted hikaru to play g4 because i thought it was blocking his bishop and i thought that was good for me the computer is not so convinced but i convinced hikaru cuz he went back he went back to the e4 square he like i'm not he was on f3 but i'm just saying he went back to try to you know jump in and maybe play g4 next or take my kn now i took a pawn i took a pun and i thought i was fine i was like wait a minute knight takes what what is hi caro's idea if he's going to take on c5 i'm going to play knight f3 check he's going to go here and then i don't know e5 and i'm like almost winning so when i took an e5 i was like wait a minute did he blunder now i got 28 seconds i got 28 seconds he didn't quite blunder it was like more of an instinct type of move where he kind of felt like all this pressure was going to pay off i went to a5 and now the move g4 is very very good if g4 the knight has to go the knight goes he gets into d6 attacking my rook and attacking the knight with the queen i would go here he would need to take my knight maintaining more pressure and then i would have to find the only move in the position which is would probably never find in a million years which is now queen a8 defending my knight and my back rank and for example if bishop takes i can't take because this is mate right all the but i told you the bishop was my savior so when he plays bishop e5 i have to find knight f4 and if he plays here threatening mate i mate him that's what i had to do that's what i had to do that was the only if g4 but then hikaru thought and went knight d6 now knight d6 still struck me as a winning idea because if i take then he takes attacking my knight threatening to take my bishop and checkmate me on g7 if i take with the knight he takes i take with the bishop he takes with the queen he's threatening my knight and he's threatening mate and i'm lost but then i found i can take i can take and now i just got to be able to play this move so look at this nice idea defending my knight and if take i can always play f6 and i thought i was in good shape well as it turns out we both missed that the knight can come back but then it can go back to the open square somehow there's a blockade mentally on this square the best line is take take and take because of this and i'm threatening to take the pawn i'm not just defending mate i'm threatening to take the pawn which is preventing which is which is allowing the checkmate so g4 knight h6 and black is winning okay winning better black is potentially going to lose anyway but better and you know there's some cool ideas in this position for example like this queen takes f2 sacrificing the queen to bait the knight the king into a knight fork there's a lot of these incredible ideas and and the defense of knight f5 was there knight takes d6 bishop e5 and then putting the knight back and i i i it's crazy i would have been like minus 7 now of course would have could have should have but i still thought i'm defending myself and then you know hikaru took and i we both realized you i' i'd stop the mate he would take and i would go here and the game goes on i'm going to get his pawn but at this point with 20 seconds on the clock i kind of came to this sobering realization this is a very cleancut example of bishop is better than the knight particularly on an open board and especially in end games we are nearing a heavy piece endgame a lot of pieces have been traded the heavy artillery is still on the board but it's queens and rooks and bishops and knight right rook and bishop is bishop versus knight the fact that the bishop is sniping from a distance and is scorting two pawns is a very very very big deal and when hikaro went here i knew i was going to have to lose my pawn so i went for a queen trade and i took the pawn cuz i had to but i think this is a very very very big advantage for white like it's i can't even put my rooks anywhere like i can't fight back in a in a good way and if i try to create counterplay i'm too slow so he went c5 he's now three squares away from queening what i should have done is probably going e5 and when he plays c6 i don't know block the pawn and try to fight because now he blocked his own bishop but' seconds on the clock you know i i i put the rooks but then he went here i brought my knight but then he went rook b1 again it's an end game it's an end game so all queens and rook trades are going to be beneficial because the bishop is better than the knight the bishop is just standing from a distance scorting the pawns shows you the dominance the dominance of the bishop versus the knight so i went here but we're just trading too many pieces he plays this very nice centralizing move targeting my weakness and also teaming up on c7 and now the pawn has arrived and yeah i have three seconds he's trying to go here i thought one last gasp was queen e5 i thought this was a very clever idea my point is i'm trying to get into to attack his king so i thought bishop b7 knight takes pawn if he takes it's a draw so i saw that i saw that with two seconds on the clock if hikaro would have blundered like that i would have went here and it would have been a draw king f1 and i would have had to sack my rook but it was perpetual check queen d3 i mean it's still very tough to spot all of this cuz like this loses but this is a draw but that's what you got to do when desperate times call for desperate measures you got to open up the king you got to sacrifice to try to get to their king that's why i went knight g3 i was looking for knight g3 ideas this is actually still the best move believe it or not because here you just don't take the knight it's not checkers and if fork you know like that's great but he's going to queen but i i i made him play the you know i made him play a little defense he played queen c5 which completely kills my fun now knight g3 has just met with a queen trade and i took and i i i thought i was really clever by the way look at me i'm stopping oh my god i'm i'm pawn i'm going to play knight8 and take his pawn i'm so smart it's hikaru man it's it's no rook c6 and the problem is here that by the time i take the pawn by the time i play a move like knight e8 or knight b5 it's all the same he's going to force me not to take with the rook he's going to force me to take with the knight and that's paralysis i can't move my knight or my rook if my king was closer maybe but right now i'm frozen and i i went to e8 but he just took my pawn and i can't take with the rook so i took like this just out of inertia i mean it's already lost he just goes right back and that's it that's the end of the game because he's is going to push or he'll play bishop d5 bishop e6 and he's going to win so rook b8 rook c7 and i think i ran out i mean resignation running half a second out on the clock is virtually the same thing honestly of all the games i played against thear in last year this one i can be happy with still a little bit too passive like i definitely have to shift my mindset to take my chances a bit more like hikaro is a human he's not an indestructible cyborg that's killing me at all times like he's human he makes an accuracies you know even hikaro magnus they always queen e1 in this position instead of this bulldozzer with taking like they make an accuracies and i had to wait i had to do less waiting for him to do something in the position and seize the moment myself a little bit more but even so like the the last mistake that i made was here i mean it was either i find the defense of my king which just so happens to get me into a better position or i let him play out the combination into an end game where my chances look very bleak with the bishop versus the knight so overall don't really hate this performance going to keep trying our best we're going to keep trying our best and maybe one day i will get my second win in my life against hikaro and if you don't know the first one i made a video about it so it's called the one time i beat hikaru or the one time lev you btar anyway i'll see you in the next video get out of here
