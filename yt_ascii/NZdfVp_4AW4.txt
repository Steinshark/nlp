as a coding bootcamp graduate myself i have a lot of thoughts on coding bootcamps i actually attended a coding bootcamp about five years ago and from that i have worked as a qa junior developer back-end developer front-end developer all the way now to a senior developer it's been quite the journey and do i regret going to a coding bootcamp absolutely not but i think the reason for that is because i knew what to look for in a coding bootcamp and keep in mind as i mentioned this was almost five years ago so at that time there was a lot less coding bootcamps to choose from but i think one thing that really remains the same is exactly what to look out for when choosing the coding bootcamp before we get into it though make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech and coding related videos leave in the comments other video topics you want me to cover other questions you have you know i make these videos for you based on your questions and feedback so leave it all down below okay let's just jump right into it [music] as i mentioned i went to a coding bootcamp about five years ago and there was a lot less to choose from nowadays if i was going to a coding bootcamp i would feel so overwhelmed with all the different ones out there all of the different options and that really comes down to choosing oh my gosh also let's get candid here there is a lot of positive stories about coding bootcamps but there's also a lot of negative and i think that really comes down to the coding bootcamp you choose to go to it can really really depend on how your experience is going to be and the likelihood of you getting a job afterwards and before we get any further into this video i want to say a big shout out to codingdojo for sponsoring this video i have been working with coding dojo on and off for about a year now maybe even longer and i just i've attended some of their classes i've met some of their instructors i've watched a lot of the different classes that they do and i am a full believer in coding dojo and what they have to offer not only because i've attended their classes and see what they do but also too i've seen the results i've seen where their graduates work today what the percentage of graduates are it's just they know they know how to do it they know how to properly teach you how to code and get you to the next level and i also want to highlight i get approached to do to promote or share about coding bootcamps probably if not daily every second day and 99.99999 times i turn them down because i don't know enough about them or i don't maybe believe in them or different things like that so i just want to have a really candid conversation with you because although yes this video is sponsored by coding dojo regardless of that this is the coding bootcamp that if i was to go back to a coding bootcamp i would go to okay now we got all the the fine print out of the way let's just jump right in what are some things that i look for in a coding bootcamp we're back there are a few different areas that i really focus in on when i'm even considering looking at coding bootcamps recommending them or things that i look for if i was to go back to a coding bootcamp or that i did look for when i was initially attending one the first one is curriculum then career services reputation and stats for curriculum one thing i really look for is what are they teaching is the technologies that are being taught up to date are they trending are they in demand because if they aren't it's there's really little point in learning it if your end goal is to get a job and one thing that really stood out to me with coding dojo and i always like to highlight is they have a three stack curriculum so you're not just going to be learning one framework or one programming language and why i think this is so great is because that's the real world when you are working on a team or working in a project depending if you're working on a product-based company at a product-based company or a project-based company you're going to have to continually be learning new programming languages and getting comfortable with that process of learning and just being able to do that right off the bat is such a huge advantage to have over other boot camp graduates who may be only focused on one stack another thing i look for when i'm looking at a good curriculum is are they broad or are they narrow and what i mean by that is how many different kind of courses are they teaching because if they have 10 or 20 different programs they're teaching hey maybe the school is very established and they have been around for a long time and that's something they do but more often than not i think sometimes schools especially boot camps spread themselves too thin and one thing with coding dojo i really like is they only have software when i say only i mean they focus on the main ones software development data science cyber security and ui ux design so the four main pillars i would say in tech as far as for the technical side of things goes and you can branch outside of there but i really like how they don't try and offer 20 different kind of courses on 20 different subjects they really hone in on these four areas and are experts in those areas okay the next one as i mentioned is career services and this is probably my biggest my biggest highlight because one of the things for me when i went to a boot camp many years ago i didn't have support after i graduated so it was like okay you graduated your coding bootcamp you're on your own and that was terrifying and honestly not having that support from my teachers at my coding bootcamp or mentors at my coding boot camp it made me feel like the process was very cold it was just like okay you're done on to the next it was just like a money maker and it just felt really bad and then the other thing was it was really difficult to land that first job without the support required you know yes i've had other jobs before getting into tech but when you're navigating technical interviews you really need that support and with coding dojo you get that support which i think is huge and invaluable because that's really when for me anyways yes learning a programming language is hard yes learning a framework is hard especially when it's your first but what is the most difficult thing ever is landing your first job and you need that support so with coding dojo i have right here unlike many other boot camps they give you access to their career services team forever not just for one month not just for two months but forever so even after your first even if you want to switch to your second job or third job you have access to that support team and i think those resources that are provided by having access to that i mean for me it's just a win-win i can't think of any better way to if i was going to a boot camp again that i would want to do it because it's scary and it's hard the next one that is so important to me is reputation so what kind of reputation does this school have that is something that i always kept in mind when i was looking for a coding boot camp is does this school have a good reputation or any reputation at all because sometimes if they have no reputation it's almost as bad as having a bad reputation and the way i was able to really navigate what schools had good reputations versus bad ones was just reaching out to people on linkedin that have went to the school so i have people reach out to me all the time for about the coding boot camp that i went to and honestly most time i just say that i don't know where the school is at now so i just don't have enough information to give but then i recommend one that i do that i do feel confident sharing with them but when i was looking for a coding bootcamp reaching out was a huge way to really connect with graduates and hear their take on it so one way to really understand what school's reputation has is just to reach out to people and that brings me to my fourth point the fourth thing that i would look out for which is numbers i'm a huge data and numbers girl and i just let the numbers speak for themselves what is the outcome what is the percentage of outcomes that students have when they graduate from a school and i'm going to put on screen here i'm going to share with you some stats from coding dojo actually talking about outcomes so the percentage of students who find a relevant job within'0 days and let me let me pause there before i go further a relevant job so many coding bootcamps just say percentage of students that just find a job and i think that's a very very key difference here a relevant job versus any job so for relevant job it is 89.1 percent i mean look at all the other schools they are comparing to and how they are the highest that's in'0 days that's not long i think for me when i went to my coding bootcamp i was in the mindset and goal of let's try and get a job within about three to four months so that's 120 days four months yeah so yeah'0 days is super realistic and that percent and many i'm sure find a job right away afterwards up to'0 days and then if we go higher relevant job within one year it's 95.3 so of course it takes some people longer to find that job that is perfect for them and their needs but it's pretty cool to see just how high the student outcomes are and it makes me really proud to be sharing about coding dojo with you seeing how high these outcomes are i think at the end of the day you need to figure out what works best for you with these filters in mind or these tips in mind i guess you could say when i say filters i mean like having glasses on that really help what does that work glasses what is it when you see things through like rose heart lenses or something i don't know i feel like i'm always outdating myself with these terms but making sure you're looking at schools very closely and critically with different having a checklist what is important to you what do you hope to accomplish there what are their what's their reputation what is their data what is their numbers and if a school isn't willing to share something like that with you it's a huge red flag another thing going back to coding dojo and their difference and why they stand out really is too because they teach the fundamentals so many coding bootcamps just go skip over the fundamentals and go right into higher level things but the problem with that is you're going to get into a job or try and learn something new and really struggle with it if you don't have the fundamentals so the one of the things that really stands out as a difference for me with coding dojo is how they really start with the fundamentals having that building block or that oh here we go with another bad example but that foundation laid out right away and having a strong foundation for you and i really like they actually have a little saying here and i really like it because it's so important and it's so true which is here you won't just learn how to code you'll learn how to be a developer and there's such a difference in that anyone can learn how to code but it takes different skills to learn how to be a developer to be self-sufficient to understand what you're googling and why you're googling different things and i think there's so much to take away from that i linked coding dojo down in the description so make sure to go check them out you know i'm a huge fan and i've spoke about them before so let me know if you have any questions feel free to leave them down in the comments and i hope you found this video very valuable and helpful and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [music] you
