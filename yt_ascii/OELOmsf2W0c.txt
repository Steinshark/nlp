hey everyone welcome back to talk tech with 
tiff today i sat down with summit who is the   chief design officer at digital dash we are diving 
into how he came over from india to canada what   his experiences was like tips on entrepreneurship 
and so much more i hope you enjoy it welcome to my   new series called talk tech with tiff where i am 
sitting down with industry professionals to hear   about their career journeys and current roles 
i created this series to hear from people who   are established in the tech industry so that 
we can all learn what these individuals do   in their day-to-day jobs and the type 
of opportunities that are out there   okay let's get started hi it's amit how's it going 
hey tiffany nice to have you here thank you for   taking time on this saturday it's gorgeous well 
it looks gorgeous out maybe not the weather i mean   you know the weather it's canada i know it's 
very it's either cold or it's hot and you never   know you know you got to check the weather up 
every day i know it's true i know and as your   your co-founder cam was saying earlier you 
can't be in canada without talking about the   weather so here we are first start starting 
it by talking about the weather exactly   you know i come from somewhere where it's like 
super warm yes it's very different coming here   and like you know stepping out it looks sunny 
and suddenly step out and it's like freezing cold   it's a whole different story i know well on that 
note of you're not neces you're not originally   from canada that was actually my first question 
i had for you is tell me a little bit about   yourself and your background and uh you are the 
co-founder of digital dash but leading up to that   what's your what's your story well that's that's a 
big question that's a big question what's my story   let's see well well let's start from where 
i'm from yeah i think that'll be like a little   origin story you know like a hero origins 
but you know i was brought up in india   i studied there for let's say 17 years 
and then i moved to canada for university   i in fact i studied computer engineering 
so i know a little bit of coding yeah   i was deep into the dev world but honestly i hated 
coding i just did not like it and you know growing   up in india just i had a very big creative side 
with like music with art with drawing and things   like that but i never really like pursued it as a 
career but getting into tech seeing that there's a   whole side of it with like ux design and like user 
experience and things like that i was like okay   i like drawing i like doing photography all these 
things but i'm also coding right but what's   like the intersection of these two things in tech 
um and you know that's i mean the rest was hit   history i learned about ux design and i'm like 
that's what i want to do yeah yeah when you you   went to school for computer engineering so did 
you self-teach as far as all ui ux and design   did you self-teach that yeah i think that's 
a that's a good question well initially i did   you know i was very grateful to have a 
lot of friends in tech so a lot of them did   mentor me pointed me in like the right direction 
what resources to learn and things like that   and this was actually one of the trips that i 
took back to india interestingly enough i met   someone who was a ui ux teacher oh wow and he's 
like yeah i can mentor you and i can help you out   so i mean he sent me a bunch of resources and 
that's how i got started but more than that   i learned a lot just by applying myself you know 
i started with helping out with some people who   had some ideas and they're like okay i have like 
a website that i want to create but i have no idea   how to design it yeah yeah okay i can take that 
on yeah exactly just being willing to yeah to   take on different projects and and learn as you 
go yeah that's awesome it was fun definitely fun   yeah well now i mean now you're cdo chief 
design officer so clearly clearly it worked   out good for you yeah yeah interestingly 
enough i call myself a chief design officer   but you know i started off with ux design 
but the whole reason why i kind of shifted my   title from like product designer to chief design 
officer yeah was because you know i feel like a   lot of people limit themselves with like giving 
them some themselves like titles the jobs that   they have right so for me because i gave myself 
the title ux design i thought of design only   from like the perspective of something that i'm 
creating digitally right like a tech platform or   something of that sort but i kind of shifted my 
role when i kind of gave myself this title chief   design officer because i'm like okay i can think 
of design now as a more holistic approach zoom out   and think of design in terms of what design is 
for the company yeah so that could be something   like i don't know what our brand management is 
our brand assets things like that or thinking   more in terms of like marketing or just anything 
to do with design right yes expand yeah yeah yeah   i love that that's really great well before we 
jump in more about digital dash going back to   a bit about your background and your story what 
was it as i mentioned prior to us starting our   chat here i mentioned i get asked a lot about 
people who are interested maybe they're living   in india or maybe they're living in a different 
country and they want to come to canada what was   and i know everyone's experience is so different 
but what was your experience like with that and   i guess if you have any advice i know these are 
really big questions here but if you have any   advice for anyone looking to to make that move or 
make that leap yeah i think that's a that's a very   very interesting question i think i've experienced 
tech in india i experienced tech over here as well   and there is a significant difference in a certain 
thinking that you have to adopt i would say   in india it's very i would say a little 
bit more confined when you're working in the tech   space it's like we've given you certain things to 
do certain objectives and you got to get that done   but really coming to like a country like canada 
or if you want to work let's say i mean even   in the u.s or like a north american company what 
they really expect for you from you is not to   just figure out what you need to do it's 
like you need to have a little bit more of   like that product knowledge you got to think a 
little bigger than just the task you're given   right so i think how i like to think of it 
is that you know in india you're given   the solution to a problem and you just have to 
create it but over here it's you got to find what   the problem is and then also create the solution 
as well so if you can kind of shift that thinking   i think it'll be a quite an easy transition into 
getting a job maybe in north america or even   really pushing the boundaries at 
your job over here yeah how did you   how do you shift that thinking was it something 
that just kind of came naturally for you   or just even recognizing it and acknowledging 
it and kind of shifting it from there yeah   that's a that's a good question i don't 
i think for me at least it came naturally   just because you know i was pushed into 
the world of entrepreneurship so it's like   yeah i see the problem right so already i'm 
creating the problem like i'm figuring out what   the problem is and then creating the solution yeah 
so it kind of came naturally just because i had to   do that right but i feel like if if you take 
the more traditional route of getting a job and   things like that it might be a little difficult 
because when you first start you don't know   well people need to tell you what to do 
to start off with right but honestly   my advice to kind of figuring 
out product knowledge is   take on more responsibility really figure out 
what product you're working on you know see   how you can make an impact on that product and 
once you start figuring that out and like figuring   out like let's say if you're in dev or you're 
a developer how coding it in one certain way   will impact like you know impact let's say the 
user or impact you know the actual business   business that you're working for yeah yeah 
exactly i like that you mentioned you know   your entrepreneur you started out pretty much 
as an entrepreneur really when you were in   school still what was that like how did let's 
talk a bit about digital dash how did it come   you mentioned to me that you started 
in school tell me a bit about that   yeah i mean digital dash was was i guess a bit of 
luck in its conception but yeah i graduated in   2020 which was like the cusp of covid right so it 
was an interesting time it was like everyone was   sitting at home they didn't know what to do right 
so a bunch of our me and my friends my co-founder   actually like okay we got to make a little bit 
of money on the side so how do we do that right   and thankfully enough each one of us it's me cam 
and then our buddy javon who isn't here today but   had like a certain set of skills that 
worked well together so me on the design side   camera on the business strategy side and a 
little bit of development and then javon our   hardcore coder yeah so like we have like 
what it takes to make like a complete product   or a complete website so we were like why don't we 
just go out there and do it yeah so we did and   we got amazing feedback we got really positive 
feedback and we saw a real potential in it   like okay this is something we can we can we 
can do so like why not just pursue this we got   our validation and make this a real business and 
see where we can take this so yeah that's how it   started yeah very organically you know hey i have 
skill set you have a different one let's put it   together and see what happens yeah for sure and 
you know i make it sound like oh yeah it just   happened and it was like oh yeah we figured 
it out but of course there was like a lot of   like difficulty and uncertainty for sure 
but it was interesting for sure yeah   how did you navigate that difficulty 
or uncertainty or even you know i   i know this word this term is used a lot but i'm 
going to use it imposter syndrome when you're   first starting a company putting yourself 
out there i'm sure at some points you're   doubting yourself or doubting if this is 
the right decision how do you overcome that   yeah it's again these are amazing questions 
i want to hear you i'm so curious yeah yeah yeah   no that's great you know it does happen a 
lot because you know when you first start your   own company or when you're first starting out 
you always question am i doing the right thing   is this the right way to go about it right i 
don't think that ever goes i think you know   there's always some amount of impostor syndrome 
that you will always feel but the thing is it's   like having that courage right so you know 
people define courage as people think oh   people are fearless they don't feel that fear and 
they just go in and do it when they see people but   the actual truth is that you got to have 
courage right and what i define courage is   that going through with something going 
like actually getting something done even   though you have that certain amount of fear right 
i like that i really like that so it's more about   i guess the the mental shift that i made 
was that it doesn't matter right at this point   i am starting my business out it's okay to fail 
right but the thing is it's what i take out of   it yeah because no matter what step i take it's 
going to be net positive right so let's say if   i take on a project and have to make a certain 
decision and the decision wasn't the right   decision and i know things happened and you know 
the project got scrapped let's see right but at   the end of the day like at least know that that 
wasn't the right decision so if i'm putting that   spot again i know that i have to take a different 
route exactly so at the end of the day you're   always learning you're always growing so yeah 
yeah i like that yeah you know looking at it from   a learning perspective that even if you fail or 
it's not necessarily the right move or whatever it   is it's still learning and you know you won't make 
it again because of that yeah exactly yeah that's   awesome digital dash where do you see it going i 
know right now the three is it just the three   of you or do you have some other team members as 
well yeah yeah so well it initially just started   with three of us but we have a big solid 
team of ten which i'm very proud of yeah i was   gonna say i thought when i was creeping on you on 
linkedin i swear i saw there was more yeah so it's   it's slowly growing it's we're trying to 
sustainably grow as well so it's great trying   to grow in the right direction yes it's great 
but where we're kind of trying to take it is   you know when people think of development 
or they think of just making a tech product   they think oh we can just hire like a developer 
on fiverr or upwork and they'll take whatever   idea we have and just create it right yeah 
yeah but a lot of people don't understand that   it takes a lot more than just development 
there are a lot of pieces that move around   to just create like an impactful product that 
people can use right so that's kind of our   goal where we where we really hit at at digital 
dash is more than just development or just design   we really focus on the consulting and strategy 
side you know it's it's amazing because we   work with a lot of startups we work with a lot 
of people that have amazing ideas but they just   don't understand the tech side at all right so we 
take like their business requirements and then we   really translate that into like actionable like 
roadmaps into technical requirements and then   helping them build a product that really provides 
value at the end of the day right because you know   just being in the business and i'm sure you know 
as well is that there's so many people working on   so many different like tech products like every 
day there's maybe like thousands of tech products   being released right but a lot of them don't work 
out because they don't know how to provide value   to their user yes exactly that's what we really 
want to focus on i totally agree you know building   an app or building any kind of product is one 
thing that's one thing like you said you can go on   upwork or fiverr granted maybe it's not going 
to be scalable maybe it's not the right solution   the tech stack that stuff all you can provide 
too but the the other side of it of the value   and getting those it's hard to get users it's hard 
to get people to sign up and that is where that's   an art so the fact that you're providing that 
knowledge and that foundation for companies is   so valuable yeah because you know a lot of people 
think you know i'm going to make something great   and people are just going to come towards it and 
i'm just going to use it but yeah that's hardly   the case right you gotta really spend well i like 
to sl well the methodology that i use is you know   you have to spend 50 of your time and money on 
developing the product but the other half has   to be gaining traction yes because if nobody knows 
about your product and you release it like how do   you expect to have users right i know yeah i know 
it's so true and i think that's often missed   i get asked a lot hey i have this great 
idea we should build this we should do this   and i'm like okay but how are you going to 
get the users you know it's building is so   it's one thing but yeah 50. i like 
that 50 on the other side of things   that's really cool so i know you're you're 
expanding you're growing digital dash when you   were first starting out though now i'm sure it's 
much easier to find clients or find customers but   how do you find how do you f how did you find 
the customers when you were first starting out   it's like yeah i mean you know you got to start 
with your own network the network that you have   right i mean a lot of people don't realize that 
the value of their network it's because you   just need to be confident in the way you talk yeah 
right and confident in the services you provide   and then if you just keep talking about that 
with like the people you're around or the people   you network with or your friends or your dad's 
friends or your mom's friends yeah utilize your   family utilize your friends honestly and then 
you just keep talking about that and you don't   realize that a lot of people have ideas in their 
head they just don't know how to execute right   exactly so that's how we initially started i 
was just talking to people saying we want to   start this or we've been doing this and we're 
truly trying to build out this practice yeah   and a lot of my the people in my network were 
like yeah we really want to do this how but   we just don't know how to do this whole tech 
side of it right yeah so i think that really   that's how i made our first few sales that's 
awesome yeah but that was great and then i'm sure   from there it almost becomes word of mouth they're 
like hey we got this built for us it's amazing   yeah exactly it's like the referral thing right 
so if if you make a good impression on your client   good impression you do you do them right you 
create the right product you help them in a way   eventually they're going to talk about it right 
because they need to sell their product as well   right so they're going to be like oh it was such 
a good time working with digital dash right and   then somebody will ask oh what's digital dash and 
then that's how we get our next client but yeah   yeah i know a lot of i used to work in a tech 
incubator hub lots of lots of buzzwords in that   one sentence but i used to work there and there 
was a lot of different startups within that and   i would see a lot of times these startups face 
that point that many successful startups do where   they get asked the question of getting 
bought out hey we want to buy your company hey   we want to you know from other companies but 
it's like your baby so i'm curious to know what   are your thoughts on that with digital dash and 
maybe hey maybe your answer today is different   than it is tomorrow or maybe it's just i don't 
know yeah oh that's a that's an interesting   question because it has come up oh has 
and then we've also thought of it as well   but i think when somebody approaches you to 
buy your startup or buy your company that just   gives you validation that you're doing you're 
on the right track yeah i like that so if you   truly believe in the product that you're building 
or truly believe in the service you're providing   i would say keep going right of course it's it's 
it's it's attractive to take the deal now but   understand that if you truly believe it's going 
to go in the direction that you want it to   right because of course you're the founder 
so you've got to push it in that way   then just keep it it is your baby yeah exactly 
i like that i really like that there's a lot of   people who will probably be watching this who want 
to emulate what you have done whether it be   maybe a different for a different business but 
you know build a startup and grow it what is some   advice you would have to people who are looking to 
make that leap maybe they're working nine to five   now maybe they're in school but what advice 
would you give them for making their own startup   right well the advice i would give is that you 
know when you work like a nine-to-five job or you   have like something stable making that leap 
is well it creates a lot of uncertainty right   because you're going from something that's very 
structured and very secure to something that like   you have no idea how it's going to turn out right 
so the thing is the advice i would give to them is   trust yourself right because if you're really 
making that leap for something that you believe in   do it right regardless of like the insecurity 
it's gonna cause you or like the uncertainty   because at the end of the day right if you're 
really working towards something that you really   believe in it's like you chase that fulfillment 
you really feel fulfilled at the end of the day   like for me you know if i was working 
like a corporate job and worked the same hours   i worked for digital dash i don't think i'd be as 
fulfilled or like even want to work those things   to be honest yeah it's true because you know 
i've had days where like i've been working'   hours straight yeah i don't feel like it's 
worked to me because it's like i see where   the impact i'm creating immediately right yes yeah 
yeah yeah and it's your own mission it's something   that you fully believe and it's it's yours and i 
think with anything when it's yours you want to   work harder and more for that versus exactly the 
company it kind of switches because it's no longer   work right of course there are pieces that like 
you need to get done that do feel like work but   the chunk of your chunk of the tasks that you 
have to do throughout the day is quite fulfilling   because you see the direct impact right i have 
a question for you that this is something that   been on my mind a lot and i think you'd be 
a good person to answer it is so outside of   my business tiffin tech i work full-time at a 
corporate company doing software development   and i get asked a lot or get told i should say a 
lot by people tiff you know you need to do at   least you know i'm right now i'm four years in 
corporate total at least like five or eight   years before you go do something on your own and 
there's just you know there's that side of things   which i don't necessarily agree with but it makes 
taking that leap so it's it's always in the back   of my head and i think it's so interesting and i 
really really admire you for right out of school   going into your making your building your own 
business and believing in yourself and your   skills enough that you're like i don't need to 
learn from a corporate company i don't need to   do that i mean a lot of the things you learn 
corporate companies are old school anyways so   but i just it's really inspiring hearing your 
story about how you did that thank you thank you   i appreciate it but i think to answer your 
question which is related to how do you how   do you make that language right or like yeah 
how do you really push yourself to go into that   is well for me it was i understood that if i 
had a level a certain level of comfort with a   certain thing i would be kind of lazy to kind 
of push myself to go forward right true so for   what i did well it's very unconventional but 
i kind of took out like all my safety nets i'm   like you know what i'm gonna take out all the 
security i have because at the end of the day well   to be honest you need some level of desperation 
to push you to yeah that level of success or that   level of excellence right so for me you know 
taking that leap well and at the age that i   am i didn't really have a lot of responsibility 
so i was like this is the perfect time for me   to do it so i mean to your question where people 
like oh you should wait seven eight years build up   a certain amount of capital and things like 
that i mean there's never going to be the right   there's never going to be a right time you just 
need to do what feels most right for you right   exactly and you know i use a principle that my 
co-founder kind of taught me is that you're never   going to have a complete 100 decision you're going 
to be like 100 convinced in going one direction   it's just like what feels more right for you so 
what's the 51 percent for you it's so true yes   i like the no just the numbers too i always like 
to visualize numbers that that's a good one for me   last question i have for you and i ask everyone 
who comes on here this question is what advice   would you give to your younger self that's a great 
question again but my answer to that would be   i wouldn't give myself my younger self any advice 
oh i like this because i feel like i'm exactly   where i should be and the exact time i should be 
because if things didn't work out the way it did   in my past i don't think i would have been in 
this exact same spot and i'm truly grateful for   where i am and i'm very excited for where i'm 
going to be so you know each piece of advice   has come to me at the right time you know because 
even though let's say i could give myself advice   my younger self advice i don't think i'd be ready 
to accept it at that point yeah i'll be like who's   this old guy don't think yeah what's he talking 
about i like that each piece of advice has come   to me at the right time that's a great way to end 
this i think i really like that hearing about your   story and how you started digital dash it 
was so inspiring and and i'm leaving this   interview feeling really motivated and inspired 
so thank you for being here today of course of   course it's great chatting i think this was an 
amazing podcast i really appreciate it coming on   and thanks for having me awesome i'm gonna link 
digital dash down below so everyone can go check   more more about it out yeah you should definitely 
and we can help you out maybe yeah exactly good you
