hello everyone and welcome in this video we'll be checking out five of the most fascinating and useful features of the 2017 ram powerwagon a truck ram is so confident in that they claim simply no other pickup on the market matches its on and off-road capability to start off with the basics and essentials of a proper off-road vehicle this truck boasts an impressive 14.3 in of ground clearance with a four-wheel drive system sending power to 33-in goodyear wrangler allterrain tires but more impressive the first features i'll be discussing are the electronic front and rear lockers yes both axles can fully lock up at the push of a button so what does this mean for off-road use there is no system which provides more potential wheel torque when all four wheels are locked any wheel that has traction can receive up to 100% of the engine's torque assuming all three other wheels have no traction in other words the torque splits across all four wheels as traction allows for it the downside of having all four wheels rotate at the exact same speed is that while cornering the outside tires travel further so there will be axle bind or wheel scrub which is why it's important to only use the lockers when off-road moving on to the second feature one of the balances engineers have to address when designing an off-road truck is the amount of axle articulation allowed versus the amount of body roll allowed a stiff suspension means little body roll but not enough axle articulation a soft suspension allows for greater axle articulation meaning more contact with the ground but significantly more body roll the power wagon addresses this with an electronically controlled disconnecting sway bar for the front axle at low speeds with the sway bar disconnected this allows for significantly more twist of the front axle without the rear tire coming off the ground decoupling the sway bar allows for a total difference of 26 in of vertical travel between the center of each of the front wheels at speeds above' mph the sway bar automatically reconnects to decrease body roll though you can select to turn it on or off below this speed the disconnecting sway bar isn't the only noteworthy detail of this truck suspension design which brings us to point number three up front there's a three-link suspension with rams articulink a high movement joint located at the lower control arm mount which allows for additional flex and articulation of the axle in the rear there's a five link coil suspension a felink suspension can control the up and down motion of a suspension while negating side toide motion versus a leaf spring design this setup is better at preventing axle rotation and lateral motion other advantages of using coils rather than leaf springs is reduced unsprung mass and the elimination of slip stick friction between leaf springs the power wagon also incorporates a third damper connecting the top of the rear axle to the frame for additional control after all this is a 7,000lb truck moving on to number four the engine provides excellent low-speed control place the transfer case in four-wheel drive low and this increases the system's gear ratio by 2.64 providing a crawl ratio of 35 to1 this allows for better hill descent control as well as increased control going up hills or navigating over larger obstacles but it's not just about gearing here the 6.4 l v8 engine producing 410 horsepower and 429 lbet of torque alters several parameters when it sees the transfer case placed in four low the throttle response softens to allow for more precise inputs and the idle speed raises from 650 rpm to 750 rpm by raising the idle rpm the this helps to ease into the throttle more precisely allowing for smooth acceleration rather than jolting the vehicle finally at the front of the truck a 12,000lb worn winch is incorporated seamlessly behind the bumper so in the event that you get stuck or need to pull yourself up a steep incline safely or you know if your friend rolls their car over well in this scenario it's best to orient your vehicle perpendicular to the flipped car attach the winch over and across the top and slowly and carefully roll the car back to an up right [music] position this won't fix their broken windshield but hopefully their tires can serve their purpose again thank you all for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below for
