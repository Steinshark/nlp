hello everyone and welcome the porsche tycon turbo is currently the least efficient electric car sold in the united states according to the epa now many people have been quick to defend porsche here and say well what does it matter you know this is a car for wealthy people porsche enthusiasts folks who have plenty of money they're not going to care about efficiency they don't need extra range if they're just driving to and from home and those are fair points however there's also another very valid point about why these buyers should actually care why people should actually care about the efficiency of the porsche tycon and so that's what we're going to be discussing in this video so first let's get some context here just how inefficient is the porsche tycon turbo well in the united states it's rated at 69 mile per gallon equivalent or about 3.41 liters per hundred kilometers now this is still extremely efficient in comparison to gasoline or diesel engines it's a very efficient vehicle however when you compare it to other electric cars you start to realize how inefficient it is in comparison so compared to the audi e-tron which is rated at 74 mile per gallon equivalent and this is a vehicle that is significantly more heavy and it also has much worse aerodynamics the porsche tycoon turbo has insanely good aerodynamics so it should be in theory more efficient than this audi e-tron and yet it is not and then comparing it to something that would kind of rival the tycon turbo looking at the model s long range or performance from tesla these are rated at 111 mile per gallon equivalent or 97 mile per gallon equivalent and so you know both the tycoon turbo and the model s actually have very similar aerodynamics but you know there's going to be some efficiency differences within the drivetrain that are going to cause this difference that you see now one of the differences that you'll see is a significant difference in range so here we have the kilowatt hours of all the different battery packs they're all fairly similar as far as the size of the battery however they have very different ranges so you can see the ticon turbo and the audi e-tron 201 miles or 204 miles versus the model x up to 373 mile epa rating and so i also have the numbers here which porsche estimates for the turbo s at 68 mpge so the more powerful quicker version of the tycon and a range of 192 miles so significant difference between that and the model s now before you start with conspiracy theories about how the epa numbers are somehow wrong or flawed some research by car and driver provides all you need to know quote porsche says these epa numbers are merely confirmation of the numbers that the automaker itself submitted to the agency as is typical practice and porsche spokesperson calvin kim said that porsche is not rebutting the epa numbers end quote in other words these are the real epa numbers no question so why does the tycon turbo's efficiency actually matter so we're going to look at three different categories here being cost range and weight and see how each of these might apply to a buyer who's looking to purchase a tycon turbo and see if it actually would matter to them so first looking at costs the epa estimates if you drive 15 000 miles per year driving a tycon turbo is going to cost you about 950 dollars per year versus driving a model s performance that is going to cost you about 700 per year so that's only a 250 difference but now consider the fact that over the lifetime of these cars the owner of that tycon turbo still could not care less that all they're losing is 250 bucks a year in order to drive the ticon over the model s especially when you consider the fact that the taicon is about double the price of a model s starting at about 150 can go up to 200 pretty easily so cost is not the reason why a driver of a tycon turbo should care about efficiency so how about range well range actually is important and a lot of people defend porsche here by saying oh you know it doesn't matter you're just going to drive it from home but still range is always a good thing if you can have more of it it's great to have it if you can have less of it it's not as great so you know the fact that the model s is almost double the range here 373 with the long range down to 192 with the turbo s estimated on the tycoon so a significant difference in range and if you really do want to go on a road trip obviously the model s is going to be better for it because you'll have longer time between stops the ticon can charge very quickly the model s can charge very quickly if you're just driving it from home you don't need you know those 200 miles of range and you're always charging at home you don't need it for road trips yep the ticon will do you just fine and if you do need it for the occasional road trip it'll probably be able to squeak it out it's just going to be not quite as convenient as the model s again i don't think that's the huge reason here why efficiency is so important on this tycon turbo all right so now let's get into weight because this is where things start to really fall apart for the porsche so the porsche ticon turbo weighs 5 132 pounds now i have two other vehicles here to compare against the model s long range which weighs 4883 also a very heavy vehicle and then a shelby gt500 which we're using to prove that people don't care about efficiency with gasoline vehicles and i'll explain that in a moment but this vehicle weighs 4 171 pounds also extremely heavy for a sports car so all of these extremely heavy looking at this porsche turbo over 5000 pounds this is over a thousand pounds heavier than a base ford f-150 that is insane this is not good there is nothing about this number that is good so we should never be like you know it's fine that the porsche turbo weighs way more than a pickup truck that is insane 5 000 pounds this isn't good and the big reason for this is that this is an electric vehicle and so its battery weighs 1389 pounds which is a lot of weight now compared to the model s long range this is not a light vehicle so we're not here to just say oh the model s did great the reason why the model s here gets an excuse is because it has so much range so it's very heavy because it goes very far the porsche is very heavy because it's not efficient and that's the downside here so if you start to do a little bit of the math just to say okay well what if i wanted a porsche tycon turbo that could travel as far as a model s long range we take the range of the long range divide it by the range of the porsche tycon turbo subtract one from that multiply it by its battery weight this gives you a rough little estimate about 1200 additional pounds to add to that ticon turbo so if you wanted to have an equivalent weight or an equivalent range to the tesla model s long range the porsche tycon turbo would weigh about 6321 pounds and yes there's some assumptions that go along with this that the vehicle wouldn't actually need to be larger and you're just adding battery within it but regardless if the ticon wanted to move as far as model s it would weigh an insane amount 6321 pounds so this is why this is why it is not good that the tycon turbo is so inefficient because because it's inefficient if they want to have any sort of useful range the battery has to be massive and the vehicle has to be extremely heavy now why doesn't this matter why do we not care that the gt500 gets 14 miles per gallon so why is it fair for internal combustion engines to be super inefficient while it isn't fair for an electric car an electric sports car to be super inefficient well if you look at this gt500 which weighs 4171 pounds already about a thousand pounds less than the tychon turbo it only gets 14 miles per gallon combined rating and it has a 16 gallon tank which means it's only good for 224 miles it does have a rather pitiful range people are willing to forgive this though because you can fill up the tank really quickly and efficiency isn't as important here but the other big thing with this is that let's say ford said you know what we want the range of our gt500 to match that of a tesla model s long range for whatever reason let's say they wanted to do it well you take the range of the model s long range you subtract from it the range of the gt500 you divide it by its mpg 14 mpg that gives you 10.6 gallons extra that you would need one gallon of gasoline weighs about 6.3 pounds so you do the math and that works out to about 67 additional pounds of weight by fuel that you would have to add to the gt500 in order to match the range of the tesla here and of course yes you'd have to have a fuel tank as well and the extra space for it but really you're adding 70 pounds in order to match the range here whereas for this vehicle you're adding 1200 pounds so adding range to an electric car is very difficult to do because it makes that car heavy and doing so to a gasoline car isn't that big of a deal even if it's only getting 14 miles per gallon so that's the big thing that i want people to take away from this efficiency in electric cars is extremely important and the reason being is because the less efficient it is the more it's going to have to weigh in order to have a decent range now efficiency isn't the only reason why the tycon has less range part of it has to do with their battery strategy and it's actually pretty interesting to compare the different strategies that different companies are using when it comes to their batteries so with the tycon turbo it has a 93.4 kilowatt hour battery but they block off about 12 percent of that from the driver so you're only able to access about 83.7 kilowatt hours now the reason they do this is to promote the longevity of the battery if you're constantly charging a battery all the way to the very top it starts to degrade that battery much more quickly than if you only use that center range there and so that's the strategy they're taking where they cut you out from using that extra range and this promotes longevity it also means it's going to make it easier for them to you know meet their battery warranty of course they have to have this thing last eight years before it really starts to degrade in order for it to maintain that warranty and so the driver won't notice any range difference because even as this battery starts to degrade you've got that 12 that it can diminish and you won't notice that your battery has actually gotten worse so that's the the benefit of going with this strategy the downside being you know assuming this rating comes from the 83.7 kilowatt hours you know if you were to use the 93.4 you would actually get more range about 225 miles instead of 201. now this is quite different than the strategy which tesla takes which basically just says here's the battery do what you want with it now tesla understands that the longevity of this battery is dependent on how high you charge it which is why if you go into the screen it will say hey we don't recommend charging past 90 unless you're taking this thing on a trip but the advantage there is that you get a little bit extra a range you can charge it up to 100 if you are going to go on a trip and you need that extra capacity so the disadvantage here is that you're really relying on the consumer to make smart choices and you know some of us are kind of dumb so we might make the wrong choices so by going with tesla's strategy it's a bit more risky because let's say everyone just charges their battery to 100 constantly well that's probably going to give them some more warranty issues versus a strategy like this where you're keeping it in that safe zone and you don't have to worry about the consumer doing something dumb with your battery so you know it's slightly more risky strategy it's more dependent on the consumer i like that it gives you know me the choice rather than blocking me out so i kind of do like this strategy but i get why both happen now another reason why porsche chooses to block off some of that battery is that they have a very different regen strategy versus tesla and so when you're on the brake in the porsche you will actually use regen braking so meaning you're using the motors to slow the vehicle down rather than the mechanical brakes in the tesla the brake pedal is purely for mechanical brakes it does not get the motor involved so your accelerator pedal is what's changing whether or not the motors are involved in deceleration on the tesla model s on the ticon your accelerator pedal is used to move you forward if you lift off it it's basically going to coast so you're always going to have a consistent feel in your accelerator pedal this brake pedal can regen up to 265 kilowatts porsche says up to 0.39 gs of deceleration it can use that energy and put it back into the battery pack and porsche says this is not state of charge or temperature dependent so because they have this battery buffer there's always space to charge up a little more whereas let's say you're in the tesla you're at 100 and you're trying to slow down well you can't use regen because you're already at 100 there's no more energy that you can put into the battery pack and so as a result in the tesla model s your accelerator pedal feel will change depending on state of charge fully charged you're not going to have much regen even as it starts to go down to 90 you'll still have some reduced regen by the time you get to 80 then you can start to have full regen but it's also temperature dependent with the tesla so if it's really cold outside you're not going to have much regen so what all of this amounts to is again tesla's kind of putting it all into the driver's hands to figure this out rather than making everything feel the exact same always so the driving experience in the tesla model s the accelerator pedal will feel very different as you lift off depending on the battery's temperature and depending on the battery's state of charge so that's a big difference versus tycon which is choosing the strategy of the brake pedal always feels exactly the same the accelerator pedal always feels exactly the same i think part of the benefit of this porsche strategy and why they're able to get away with high regen even in colder temperatures not only being that the battery is reduced in charge but also by using that 800 volt system versus the tesla which is at about a 350 volt system so this is kind of you know the the like mainstream strategy of make everything always feel the same always this is the the driver probably understands their vehicle really well and they will do the right thing strategy so you know it can be concerning in the model s of hey i let off my accelerator pedal and it's not slowing the vehicle down at all if you're not used to that and you don't know why it's happening you won't have that happen in the ticon it's always going to feel the same the benefit of this system which i really like is it allows you to have one pedal driving so again both strategies here make sense i get why both do them and their advantages and disadvantages to each now it has been fascinating learning about the strategy of this porsche tycon turbo and actually there's some really cool things about it so i'm going to be making an additional video talking about just how quick i think this thing is going to be which i'm looking forward to so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
