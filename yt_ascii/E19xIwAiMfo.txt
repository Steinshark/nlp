this is it welcome to the galaxy note 10.1 paracin and in this video i'm comparing it to for most people what will be its biggest competitors the s10 plus the iphone 10's max huawei p30 pro + 1 + 7 pro on the far right what you're seeing right now is me using a looks ometer to calibrate display brightness i wanted to make sure more importantly than the mall being on max brightness that they're on an equivalent brightness level i just think that's a fairer test and it answers what i'd say is a more important question which one of these phones gives you more battery life whilst offering a similar viewing experience so i've started this test off with a game called battle ins royale i'd say it's mid tier in terms of how graphically demanding it is and generally speaking in this test we're gonna try and stick to relatively day-to-day scenarios just to simulate how long your battery would actually last in the real world now if you take a look at the specifications below the note 10 plus on the far left you'll see there's quite a few reasons why this is a really interesting phone to battery test first of all most importantly it has the largest battery out of any smartphone here and one of the largest batteries out of any conventional main line phone that's a good thing but there's more the phone is also using samsung's brand new xc90 825 chip and you might remember especially in the last generation samsung's exynos chips trailed their snapdragon equivalents by quite a fair margin and so this is something's answer to that even compared to the chip released in the galaxy s ten in the same year the note 10 should in theory be more efficient and more powerful however the note m+ as well as all these positive things also has the largest display amongst all these phones and so that might well work against it we'll have to see so right now we're actually on youtube we're watching older mister who's the boss videos and we've reached well past the hour mark and i'm gonna leave this on for around about another half an hour before we move on to the next thing and whilst that's happening if we take a look at the battery percentages on the top of the phones you can see that the hall where p30 pro is leading but just about in terms of the for android phones it's a really close battle so far with the iphone slipping behind and to be honest that in itself is exciting whilst i wouldn't call it a battery hero the iphone ternes max already has pretty good battery life and so if this early on into the test the other four phones are already this far had that bodes well for their longevity so right now i've actually pulled up a slimy simulator which is a weird kind of thrill but while this is going i kind of want to clarify a few of the things i've done to make this as fair a test as possible so for example i've set all the smartphone's to 1080p resolution except for the iphone which can't be adjusted the reason i've done that is because even though they may support a high resolution almost every android smartphone out there comes set to 1080p by default out of the box and so it is what 95 98% of people are gonna use myself included when it comes to your displays that you'll also notice if you look at the specs of the oneplus 7 pro that that display has a 90 hertz refresh rate is refreshing 1.5 times more frequently than with the other phones at 60 hertz so on one hand just bear in mind that that is probably going to hit the battery pretty hard but on the other hand it needs to because this is one of the primary selling points of the smartphone we've got a user i've also just made sure that all the settings on the phones are the same so bluetooth nfc location and wi-fi they're all on and all phones have the latest updates and the speakers are on 50% volume we're trying to make it as standard a use case as possible so back to what's happening in the battery test and you might have noticed i've been slowly creeping our way through increasingly intensive games peaking here at shadow gun legends and this has created quite a disparity in terms of what battery is remaining on each device you've got the note on the far left which is holding up pretty well with 59 percent and right at the bottom is the iphone closer to 30 so what i'm doing right now is recording 4k video from the phone's rear cameras and i'm gonna do this continuously for a loop of three times and then open that up in a video editor but one thing you are noticed is that on the note 10 plus the iphone tennis max and the p30 pro the displays have been dimmed drastically these three phones have clearly sent some sort of signal that they're overheating and so this is like a precautionary measure that the phone takes so those 3 device i had to restart them so we're now passing the 4 hour 30 mark and i'd say in a test like this once you get to 5 hours you could you've got a respectable battery life because not only are the screens continuously on but we're running some intense applications also if you're looking really carefully you might have noticed on the to sam's phones that there are bars of signal now none of these phones actually have sim cards in because that would make it an unfair test but for some reason this is just what samsung software does also worth noting just to make sure that none of the phones have started deteriorating i've made sure that each device here is a next to new version of that phone so less than 15 at charging cycles on each okay so we're about to have our first casualty the iphone tennis maxx and to be fair it's lasted nearly six hours so i'm happy and in that time a couple of interesting things have happened you can probably tell on the far right that the oneplus has settled into a comfortable last position it's nearly at 10% now but more interestingly the galaxy s 10 plus has overtaken the note 10 plus now i gotta say part of me expected this because the note 10 plus has a very minor increase in efficiency and battery size but a fairly major increase in display size the 6.8 inches on the note 10 plus it doesn't sound like a lot more than 6.4 on the s10 plus but it is in terms of raw screen area it is a sizable jump so we're back on youtube watching some even older mister user boss videos and it's good to see that all smartphones can cope with this watching videos doesn't cause much of a problem to any of them as we start to approach the 7 hour mark you can see the oneplus flagging and then eventually dying but to be honest that is a really good performance especially because of that 90 hertz refresh rate which i've seen a lot of people talking about on twitter people just love it and it keeps them coming back to that phone so for a lot of people the trade-off is clearly quite worth it down to three phones and any of these devices is gonna be fantastic for battery life but there is something about the p30 pro that just gives you ultimate peace of mind you mighta seen the video i made where i took that on a road trip for two extreme days of usage and it powered through the endurance combined with the charging speed means it's the kind of battery you just forget about it's not a worry anymore and the note m plus an s templars are not that far off by the time the note dies the s10 has about 3% remaining so i'm pretty much this kind of fast forward this test until all the phones are gone and then let's talk about the final results okay so in fifth position is the iphone tennis max with a time of 5 hours and 48 minutes this is the kind of battery that you're pretty happily going to get through one day you slip the 1 plus 7 pro was a leap in front of that this thing lasted almost an hour longer and day-to-day that is a kind of difference you're definitely gonna notice the note 10 plus was even more impressive in this with seven hours in two minutes and whilst it's not the most surprising result we almost could have predicted it based on the specs alone this phone could last you well into your second day the galaxy s 10 plus was even ahead of that but by a pretty negligible margin so essentially don't pick one of those phones over the other based on battery life alone and finally the p30 pro which didn't just win but also created a good bit of distance between itself and second place seven hours and thirty-one is an incredible time for a test like this and so while weight still remains the battery king and i can't wait to see what's next if you enjoyed this video i've got a ton of content on the note 10 plus the p30 pro and even a couple of phones that are yet to be announced coming very soon so if you could subscribe to that that would be amazing my name is erin this is mister who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
