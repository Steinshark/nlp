survivor was a serial entrepreneur wasn't it yes clive isn't one for sitting back and not starting up a business so there was already some plans for for a mobile version of the spectrum that he he wanted to bring out under under the project name pandora once he was free of the shackles of sinclair research he started up a new company cambridge computers and they come out with the z88 which is a z80 based machine the same as all the other spectrum range he was very wet to that z80 wasn't he it was yes and it's a cheap reliable good decent processor so yes they were tried and tested although there was quite a few changes which he made with this one so for example it does actually run bbc basic as opposed to the old sinclair basic but it's also got built-in apps for well there's the the word processing spreadsheet diary calendar is all enclosed in one app so that's actually a really really good good bit of software there as a a mobile type device in its own right it was groundbreaking you could actually do do computing on the move so yeah oh wow okay so diary right dream what's pipe dream pipe dream is it's a word processor and it's a spreadsheet and it's a calendar it's everything all in one and it is actually really good flexible way of doing doing business documents as opposed to a separate word document separate excel you can actually embed everything all in all in one package there did it get taken about and used it's the ideal machine for commuting into london by train you can sit there on the train you can do do your work on there you can plug it into a modem when you get home and upload your data back to the office it is quite flexible for things like that so when was this actually this came out in 1987. okay and at the time i think it retailed for 399 pounds which was probably a little bit over the price of what people wanted to pay and it and it didn't didn't go on to huge success but you know to consider the kind of specs now in in terms in terms of an ipad well you've got a 10 inch screen you've got physical keyboard you've got built-in apps there were other companies which made and sold their own software for it and there's the software packages you can get to upload data between that and your pc so you can copy your files to it there's a plug-in memory card for saving your data or loading new new applications on there there's a solid state so there's either a van chip or a rom chip in there and you just plug that in a bit like game packs i suppose yes there's there's there's three sockets under there and you can get it to communicate easily with other things and what the battery lasts about what a day or something the the battery lasts for just over 24 hours in continuous use or up to a month on standby it was a bit ahead of its time i think like a lot of things so clifford is doing yes let's not mention the car the sinclair c5 it's a new power in personal transport yes i've got one of those in the cave by the way we coded things like a spectrum on a tv with an rf aerial okay now i was wearing glasses for years and years and it was because of things like that right if you are so blurred if you actually go back and look at the display and think that we were sitting for sort of lots of hours 15 16 17 hours a day well yeah when we weren't working the planning we were in front of the
