okay you guys seem to really enjoy the last customize your android episodes so for the last week i've been working on something that is bigger and better also massive thanks to plain shop by amazon for sponsoring this video it's going to allow you to earn credit back while you play on your android device first up is fluid navigation gestures which doesn't need route but does need a little bit of tinkering on your mac or pc but it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes and it is well worth the effort it replaces your navigation bar but something that is not just aesthetically more impressive but also more functional you have not just back home and multitasking as before but you can also configure it to pull up an application of your choice or even bring down the notification bar in the last episode i introduced you guys to kl wp an application that makes it pretty simple to make some really impressive interactive live wallpapers well today we're going to build on this with two amazing presets the first one being materialized home which is based on four main pages you've got home weather music and then news and all you do is just tap on the page you want to know more about and it brings up a whole series of widgets related to that specific page when you first load it up you might have white bars on the top on the bottom that's pretty normal a lot of these presets just need a slight tweak to fit your respective device then we've got tidy which is a preset that really emphasizes space over functionality the grays and the whites with subtle brushes of color make your phone feel like a slick gadget from the future right we're going to build on this with kw gt which is all about widgets and i've picked out three different packs of widgets that i think are really distinctive and definitely worth downloading pick siliceous offers card style pixel inspired widgets with a heavy dose of neon glow it's not a stock look but bold while still being clean we've then got tropical which kind of feels inspired by the la sunset these are all vibrant and clean and work really well with a plain pastel colored wallpaper behind them then there's grad fire which is subtler than pic siliceous and falls back on bright blues and purples and i like how these colors combine with a flat white of stock android to create an alternative look okay we're gonna take it even further now with kl ck which really completes the customization package by offering complete control over your lock screen as wid the last two apps it's a little tricky to build your own way from scratch but if you use a preset you'll be up and running in no time just bear in mind it's very much in beta so a few things don't work quite as they should but if you're happy to stick with it i'm sure we'll get better so you might know that there's a google wallpaper app on the play store but the company actually saves their best wallpapers for their own pixel devices but there is an app you can download which isn't on the play store which once installed brings all of them to your internal storage and these are just stunning seriously crisp all papers that move in three dimensions as you scroll with little moving details thrown in for good measure and these are pretty much a match made in heaven for cpl launcher which brings us on to the next thing cpl stands for customized pixel launcher and here they're not taking the term customized lightly in fact i've never seen a third-party pixel launcher with this many options you've got control over how notification dots appear haptic feedback when interacting with the ui and it'll even generate new icons for you making your icon pack look even more consistent wonderwall is also pretty great because every wallpaper here is handpicked for its quality resolution and tone there's no rubbish here just beautiful landscapes and some incredible drone shots so far we've talked a lot about visual customization but audio is another area where you can actually make some tweaks i'm talking about boom which is not just a music player but an equalizer that can add virtual 3d surround your music as well as boost the overall volume i would say it doesn't sound great on the fine decks and a lot of single speaker smartphones but really good on the make 20 pro with it's slightly more capable setup now i can't not mention the pixel vintage icons which are exactly the kind of strange offbeat idea i end up being drawn to imagine the pixel icons but if they were hand wrong and painted with watercolor on a and verse it does some essien concept but looks beautiful in person and the pro version also comes with tweaked pixel wallpapers which are made with a similar finish to the icons so this video is sponsored by plain
