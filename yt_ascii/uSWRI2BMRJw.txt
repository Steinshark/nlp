i'm here at asus's booth at ces 2023 and we have so many fast gaming laptops to look at but all of it starts with this guy right here this is the flow x16 and they released it earlier this year but in order to fit all of the power into a chassis that's this small they had the heatsink go all the way along the back after they did that they were like huh that's a pretty fantastic idea we should just do that for all of our laptops and then they did look look at this david no it's just only heatsink the whole back of the laptop on all of them it's all heatsink i love it first up is the scar 16 and this thing is an absolute beast somehow in this well it's not exactly small or thin or light but for the amount of performance it certainly is this thing has an rtx 4090 in it with a tgp of 175 watts as well as the intel core i9 13980 hx which is just it's such a stupid processor it's absolutely beautiful eight performance course 16 efficiencies course 5.6 gigahertz all core this thing freight and rips i imagine they have done that by just heatsink heat sink even more heatsink now asus brought over a whole bunch of motherboards and a whole bunch of things like this the problem though there's no fans i kept on talking about we have a big fan we have another fan there's a whole other third fan down here that's new and we can't see them but i have a solution for that there's a few things i like more than taking apart laptops on the show floor it's too bad this isn't earlier at ces so that everyone would be way more stressed they still look very stressed one thing that i really appreciate in the past on their scar models asus had this rgb light but it was attached to the bottom panel so when you take it off there are these really fiddly rgb cables huge pain in the butt now it's attached to the front of the laptop so that might not be a problem aha look at that it's so small i like this one as you can see here the cooling in this is obscene just so much heat sink all the way around now what you might be wondering asus has vapor chambers on a whole bunch of their laptops but this guy does not apparently nvidia's new chips are so power dense that if you try and put the whole 175 watts through a vapor chamber she just dries up doesn't even work that's why you need all of these heat pipes or with all of that heat away and take it to well all of that right there also they added this additional third fan just sort of blow air across the cpu and gpu so you don't get stagnant air there and also apparently it helps with your keyboard temp so your fingers don't get all toasty after a long gaming session underneath this heat sink they're using liquid metal so it's thermal grizzlies conducto knot extreme and that has two main benefits first of all stuff just runs cooler fantastic the thing that's even better though is that apparently it just lasts for i don't know they don't actually know how long they've had it running in laptops for three years so far with no performance degradation but either way that's way better than the typical stuff where like your silicon thermal paste they sort of dry out after a while and then performance tanks you need to take this all apart replace it pain in the ass don't have to do it here while we're in here you have two upgradable ssds as well as two upgradable ram slots this right here is 4 800 mega transfer per second ddr5 it looks like i have 64 gigabytes of the stuff in here this this cannot be a cheap laptop also they have a 90 watt hour battery which i don't know how long that's going to last but given the fact that it's 175 watt gpu and cpu they can only do so much choosing a laptop gaming display can be a little bit difficult especially for gamers because sometimes you might have one that's very fast but it just kind of looks like poo or maybe you have won that on paper sounds pretty good but the response times are very bad asus wants to try and simplify that using their nebula standards so nebula at a minimum gets you 165 hertz three milliseconds gray to gray 500 nits peak brightness and full dci p3 coverage that is excellent and what we have on here but if you want to go even a step further they have their mini led displays with nebula hdr so that gets you 1100 nits peak brightness 240 hertz and this thing is just so good to look at there's 1024 dimming zones in this making it one of the best displays i have seen here the contrast ratio they claim is what is this a hundred thousand to one it's not it's not quite oled but it's very close and so much brighter it is very impressive below the panel things keep on being good this is so cool they have this plastic that it's made out of but it's translucent up in here apparently that was a huge pain for the designers of the laptop but they did figure it out in the end and i think it looks fantastic especially like back here look at that i really appreciate that people are having fun with plastics again as well even though it is plastic it is stiff like i'm gonna absolutely give her here that's about as much as you can get and if we look here like i'm gonna press on it that's almost nothing and of course with a stiff chassis that gives you a much better chance of having a good keyboard and i'm happy to report yeah asus is gaming laptops have had fantastic keyboards for years and this one's no exception here you also have a track pad and if you press right here you get a numpad look at that as a bonus just a little treat it's sort of thing you don't know if you're going to get with asus they have webcam on top who would have thought it and also the i o is pretty solid so we have headphone microphone combo jack right there love to see it can't take it for granted these days even from asus we also have usb type c that is wired directly to the gpu for all of your external monitor knees and thunderbolt 4 hdmi 2.1 2.5 gigabit lan and over on this side we have usb type a if 16 inches isn't big enough for you though we have the strixcar'. this thing has a massive'.3 inch display and even though it's only nebula and not the nebula hdr i don't think you're gonna complain quad hd 240 hertz dci p3 500 nits oh i didn't even match without a 16 by 10. i absolutely love that gaming laptops have 16 by 10 now it's gone past productivity and stuff like this makes it just like if you want a video edit on something like this which given you know the color accuracy you can just makes it easier so many more timeline bits the specs remain the same from the 16 inch because well you can't make it any faster nvidia actually just doesn't let you increase the tdp even if you can kind of sucks anyway it doesn't matter because you still get a rtx 4090 and i9 175 watts on both of them absolute beast this one's probably a little bit quieter you guys know probably probably it has a bigger fan we already know this but if you want to be just a tiny bit cheaper we have the strix g18 so this thing's not quite as powerful you only get a 4080 oh poor you you only get a 4080 geez that's about like a 30 80 30 90 and a laptop no one knows okay the cooling system remains the same on this guy although if you go for lower than the rtx 4080 you are not going to be getting that conducto not extreme not that you're really going to need it moving around from those big powerful boys to the more smaller ones but first of all ah you guys have too many awards jeez you need to move them so we can see the laptops the new flow x13 is an absolute monster not just like you know power wise you kind of expect that but it has a 75 watt hour battery in this thing i know it's friggin amazing how so small i love it for real i don't know how they crammed so much stuff into this so you can get up to an rtx 4070 in this and it's not even the it's not even that garbage 35 watt version it goes up to 60 watts in this on top of that they have an amd processor that gets you up to 55 watts 55 watts excellent yes this is better than most thin and lights and you can legitimately game on it how the heck did they do this of course the build quality remains excellent and the trackpad's 57 percent larger so you can look it's actually a track pad now it's not like a quarter of one not only is the trackpad bigger but they also managed to somehow make it 10 millimeters smaller i really like this thing i really want to get into our office and see just how long it'll last with a 75 watt hour battery although then again 40 70 maybe it's not too good maybe it isn't but either way they're finally putting proper webcams on everything windows hello facial recognition up there unlock the laptop super easily absolutely love it also full hd webcam just thank you for putting them on your laptops guys it's the absolute bare minimum but you're doing it now for the flow z13 they haven't changed a whole lot not that they really needed to we just get a very simple tdp bump to 65 watts on the gpu which given that microsoft still can't manage to cool the surface pro is very very impressive also this little glass panel on the back that's all covered in fingerprints right now it used to be kind of like out a little bit but now they've managed to get it in just flush with this so it doesn't i don't know it just looks better of course you also get a nebula display on here so 16 by 10 quad hd 165 hertz fantastic but do you know what's really crazy you know the g14 that like sort of small sort of not too small gaming laptop they've had for a while well this is a 40 90 in it now how yes it has a four it's not the full fat 490 like they had in the strix but it still has 125 watts and a laptop that's this big this one have the cooler that goes all the way across the back no well it still is very impressive you should have done that though i thought that was a thing that's what i said at the start they put on everything yeah okay apparently that is a vapor chamber that's why they said you don't need it but you need on the flow the big one anyway don't worry about it yeah it has an animatrix on the back the g14 also gets a display upgrade so this right here is a quad hd mini led display and it has 504 zones looks really good look at that we also want to look at is the new zephyrus m16 it's the same basic thing but just a little bit bigger this one have a heatsink that goes all the way across the back it does heck yeah there we go that's the theme of the video right there all the way across the back has an rtx 4090 in it once again but this one comes with a tdp of of a 140 watts in something that's this thin look at that it even goes all the way flat we also have some excellent i o here so micro sd card usb type c type a it's a thunderbolt 4 hdmi and usb type a rounded out with a headphone microphone combo jack it has the same mini led display as the scar and also it has a webcam with windows hello facial recognition again love to see it just on all of these laptops good job guys and finally for the 16 they brought the animatrix to it great big so many leds i enjoy putting like line of spaces on here rabbit's fun too finally we have their new tough gaming laptops this one right here comes with a new sand color it actually does look pretty cool now even though this is one of their more budget laptops i'm sure you can still get it obscenely expensive you can have options like quad hd 240hz display 16 foot again if you're topping this thing out i don't know how much it's going to cost but they also don't yet either so we'll comment on budget laptops later and finally i just a little cherry on top they have a gaming chromebook there's absolutely no reason that you should ever get a gaming chromebook but i can think of one and that's because these keys are orange and i do appreciate that what i also appreciate is asus sponsoring this video huge thanks guys so hit like get subscribed and just have a fantastic cool day see you later
