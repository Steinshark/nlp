optical mems are a special subset of mems microelectromechanical systems that steer modulate or direct light today people are trying to use optical mems for products like lidar there's a lot of potential there but the first major commercially successful optical mems product was the dmd a system made up of millions of extremely tiny mirrors moving in concert to reflect high powered light today optical mems-based systems dominate the high-end theater projection industry for this video let us take a look at the micro mirror array that took over the image projection industry and won an oscar to boot but first i want to remind you about the newsletter check out the newsletter to read the entire scripts for previously released videos including those you might not have seen before the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show the bigger the room you need to project in the more light your system has to push through these needs have to be balanced by cost size heat and weight concerns for some of the largest rooms theaters basically we need a system capable of producing a picture that has to be very bright as in thousands of lumens while at the same time retaining very sharp details various projection systems have been in use throughout the century but for 50 years the primary system for an extremely sharp and bright image in a very big room was an oil film system like the idaf4 projector this projector has a fascinating history i want to credit mike harrison from the youtube channel mike's electric stuff for doing some amazing work on it i recommend his talk at hack a day for further information the original concept was dreamed up by the swiss engineer fritz fisher then at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich fisher was studying a projector proposal from the optician bernhard schmidt schmidt's system proposes using a spherical mirror to collect the light from an extremely bright cathode ray tube to project an image onto a movie theater screen fisher did not believe that cathode ray tubes can ever supply enough light to illuminate an entire movie theater if they tried the resulting projected image would not be crisp legend has it that fisher sketched out the new concept on the back of an empty cigarette box while commuting to zurich via train convinced that it would work he eventually set about to build an industrial prototype he named it idle for which means image bearer in greek inside the projector you have a light source and a light valve to vary and modify the light the light valve in this case was a mirrored disc later a concave mirror covered in a thin film of oil about 0.02 millimeters thick when the system is in use an electron gun fires a beam of electrons at the mirror disc affecting the oil and deforming its surface the id4 system used a very powerful light source the super ventark lamp it is basically like the sun the supervent arc was a carbon arc lamp capable of producing a stunning 375 000 lumens when the light passes through a deformed section of the oil film it diffracts off its normal path and enters a system of mirrors before entering the projection optics and then finally out to the screen fisher and his team eventually built two prototypes but on christmas 1947 fisher died unexpectedly from a heart attack at the age of 47. without fisher work on the idol 4 languished until it caught the eye of his friend dr edgar gretner gretner owned a company later to be called gret tag that seemed to specialize in this weird engineering stuff other things gret tag owned was a carbon arc lamp and a cryptography engine he saw that the ida 4 had a lot of potential and in 1948 he purchased the rights the invention but he needed some finishing touches like projecting in color so gretner license a disc based rgb color system from cbs and integrated it into the idaphor gretner took the product through the american movie industry movie executives looked at the super bright 15-foot movie screen and immediately saw a weapon they can use against the growing television industry 20th century fox purchased the first production idafor and installed it in the pilgrim movie theater in new york city in 1953 life magazine wrote it up calling it the 15-foot weapon against tv over time and for decades the idafor became your best option for any projection screen where you needed to deliver four thousand to ten thousand lumens to the customer they were used in the nasa space program universities for lectures religious events and tv studios the closest competitor was probably the ge talaria projector which worked on similar principles to the idaphor ge built the talaria has their own version after working with gretag for three years overall the later ida4 systems were reliable and easy to maintain gratag produced idafors with vacuum tubes germanium transistors and finally silicon integrated chips as late as 1991 there were 600 units in use around the world that being said they were massive expensive 500k and over engineered the electron gun itself was a formidable piece of work and at one point required a vacuum to operate there were also technical issues with the oil maintenance issues associated with bombarding an oil film with electrons for so long people felt that there might be some opportunity to replace this awkward oil film system in 1975 rn thomas jens goldberg and harvey nathanson inventor of the first mems published their work announcing the first micro mirror array at the time referred to as a mirror matrix tube fabricated on top of a sapphire substrate the array featured aluminum coated mirrors about 50 micrometers wide and 450 nanometers thick there were about 500 meters per square inch the team described this device as a new light valve system that can potentially be used to project images onto screens of varying sizes this first identified the projection display market has a very large potential market for an optical mems system to enter interestingly enough the company that eventually entered this market never intended to do so at the start in 1977 the defense department hired texas instruments to research a deformable mirror mems for modifying or controlling light the mems was to be used for optical computing ti chose dr larry hornback to lead this research team and after a few years the team eventually produced what they call then the deformable mirror device or dmd the original dmd was an analog thing an early patent in 1980 describes how a transistor can trigger an analog voltage that can deform a suspended metalish membrane this concept would greatly evolve over the years manufacturing concerns led the team to turn the membrane into a discrete micro mirror with a sort of cantilever design the ti team envisioned that it couldn't be used to build a better copier or printer but how to control it the team found it difficult to consistently control all these micro mirrors using analog signals despite working with very small rays of just 2 400 mirrors and pushing a lot of voltage through them the mirrors did not reflect light together in a coordinated fashion hornbeck and his team struggled with this problem for a decade but the system never met expectations so they pivoted from using analog signals to digital ones digital meaning one or zero the mirror can either be on or off when it is on it turns and reflects the light onto a specific spot when it is off it turns off and no more light simple as that it kind of reminds me of those card stunts they pull at football games and there is a piece of folklore floating around saying that that was what inspired the whole thing larry hornbeck has denied it though the dmd abbreviation was later retconned from deformable mirror device to digital micro mirror device fabbed using conventional cmos processes the micro mirror device is made up of many thousands of mirrors the original had about 840 micrometers but modern dmds can have millions each aluminum alloy mirror spans about 16 micrometers on each side the mirror is mounted on top of a yoke which is then connected to two torsion hinges at the very bottom is an sram memory cell which controls the individual mirror's behavior when activated electrostatic forces cause the mirror to tilt about 10 to 12 degrees one of the most exciting things about the modern dmd is just how reliable it is those are mechanical hinges and yokes under each individual mirror yet the mirror has to flip billions or even trillions of times furthermore conditions can get quite harsh theater quality light sources can get very hot the massive light source for the old ida 4 projector produce so much infrared heat that if you were to hold a piece of wood into the light beam it would burst into flames the original dmd lasted just 100 hours at 65 degrees ti had to develop entirely new testing equipment to inspect and test for failures today modern hinges can go through over 3 trillion mirror cycles without failing texas instruments first used a dmd for printing airline tickets these used to be done with red colored carbon copy paper but were switching over to digital paper printouts ti used a micro mirror array of 840 mirrors lined up in a single row to do fast printing the dmd 2000 airline ticket printer then in 1989 darpa set up a multi-million dollar research initiative to explore future hdtv technology ti signed on and created a high definition dmd chip ultimately though going the television route at the time didn't make sense everything back then was still analog however a subsidiary of rank corporation a british film conglomerate liked what they saw in commission ti to help them build a projection system using dmd technology hornbeck and his team immediately abandoned the printer idea and started retooling their work to better suit the projection industry ti built a dedicated wafer fab to produce all those dmd optical mems ti started producing this new technology at the right time a new generation of technologies were sweeping through the projection industry starting with lcd lcd projection systems which work by sending bright light through polysilicon panels had been in development ever since the 1960s for instance in 1976 westinghouse had a six inch by six inch lcd display but it was not until the late 1980s when the technology finally began to become competitive in 1986 seiko epson released an lcd projector with a resolution of 320 by 220 pixels and a 70 lumen output certainly nothing for the idaphor to be afraid of her right however these technologies continued evolving as the industry obviously wanted a successor technology to these old and extremely expensive light valve projection systems in 1992 the barcode data 5000 named the light cannon came onto the market this was the first lcd projector bright enough to match up with the oil film systems with a pixel count of 756 by 556 and putting out 1250 lumens light cannon warmed up far faster than an oil film system and was disruptively cheaper too a talaria capable of 1 250 lumens costs about eighty thousand to ninety thousand dollars like canon on the other hand cost just forty seven thousand ge was so concerned about this new product that they bust a third of their division employees to go see it in action a flood of new lcd projectors soon entered the market forcing ge to exit the business in 1993. the idaphor quickly followed the larger company gretag went out of business in 2002 the last ida 4 was removed from service in 2000 a rapid decline from 600 in less than a decade similar transitions occurred in the consumer business and home theater markets with little lcd projectors finally replacing older incumbent crt technology so by 1995 the 4.6 billion dollar projection market was going through a massive technology transition so it made a lot of sense for what ti would call the dlp chipset subsystem to make a splash ti eventually produced two versions of the dlp subsystem a one chip and three chip projector the one chip version came out first in 1996 for the business conference room projector market here is how it worked first the input signal is broken down into three rgb versions red green and blue white light is then shown through a spinning color wheel to create a colored light which then falls onto the dmd let's say red light for this example at that exact moment the dmd flips over its micro mirrors to reflect back the red version of the split input signal that primary color image then gets flashed onto the wall or whatever for 1 60th of a second you're slow and incompetent human visual system is too slow to perceive the individual primary color image so instead it matches the string of single color images into a full colored image ti worked with projector oems like infocus systems nvue and proxima providing component kits for the oems to incorporate into their products kind of like how nvidia provides the chips for its board partners to make into graphic cards that in 1997 ti released its line of high brightness dlp subsystems which used three dmd chipsets the subsystem uses a prism to split white light into three primary colors which are then routed to its color specific dmd chip this allows for much greater perceived brightness since there is no color wheel so each color gets its own continuous light stream because the dmd chipset is a light valve that relies on reflecting light rather than filtering it like with an lcd projector more light from the light source eventually makes it to the wall in some cases the overall light efficiency can get over 60 percent which means a brighter image these digital projectors arrived at the perfect time with the movie industry making the transition to digital they work closely with the major hollywood studios to round out the specs tuning the product for blacker blacks and higher resolutions then in june 1999 the dlp cinema system displayed its first full-length feature film star wars the phantom menace george lucas ran a head-to-head bake off between a dlp system and an lcd projector from the leading competitor at the time a perhaps bizarre joint venture between japan's jvc and the american hux aircraft company called hjt dlp won the test with hjt's projectors showing unstable color reproduction and streaking artifacts the industry rapidly shifted to dlp and hjt has since receded from the theater market today dlp optical mems power a significant portion of our cinema theaters with laser projection as probably its most significant competing technology it has since become one of ti's more profitable businesses in 1998 dlp and texas instruments received an emmy for their work in 2015 larry hornback won an oscar for his work in developing the dmd chip optical mems still have much to do for humanity down the line but we should appreciate the massive impact the space has already had on our everyday life experiences at least in this tiny aspect of it all right everyone that's it for
