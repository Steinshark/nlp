previously on coffeezilla we're not gonna take millions of dollars to [ __ ] our fans ever bro we won't take any sponsorship money nothing bro like i can't i don't do that for selling t-shirts it's actually impossible now coffee now is there a way where it's like to just make this like right [music] so would you do it oh most definitely do you see where i'm working 12 million dollars a year would go a long way yeah that's exactly the problem though money can make people do almost anything if i had 12 million dollars i'd go crazy the first thing i do is buy pants lots and lots of pants i mean for that kind of money people can justify literally anything i don't even think people notice to be honest all they see is the shirt but it's surprisingly drafty back here and i just feel i need to commit one way or the other people are committing crime i'm wait are you listening to me oh sorry coffee something something ethical dilemma right look let me help you you've got these guys by the balls right but what you need is i don't like where this is going you gotta squeeze them hard coffee like a pair of tight jeans all right yeah i've heard enough i'm leaving no wait i'm serious what i mean is there can't be breathing room for these influencers like a nice new pair of tight jeans you gotta make an airtight case here starting with why this whole offshore thing is unethical in the first place come on you don't think the audience already knows that we're talking about your average milk viewer oh that's a good point okay i think you're right i'm gonna go back to the 10 million dollar studio and work on this thanks for the drinks i'll pay the tab next time yeah yeah internet detective ladies and gentlemen the reasons pushing gambling on people is bad is obvious but i still want to explain it for people who still might have questions like this what's the difference between steve promoting rubet and literally every sports broadcasting network promoting sports betting you know what it's a valid point both are gambling and with gambling yes you're gonna lose money and gambling addiction is a very real thing people's lives are ruined especially from things like slots but this isn't a dare presentation okay there is another side to this you know gambling can be a lot of fun so i want to make it clear i'm not against gambling i'm not anti sports betting i'm anti promoting fake high stakes gambling to young audiences from illegal jurisdictions with little or no help for gambling addicts i hope that clears my position up all right fine let me break this down a bit let's start with the fake money these streamers use or sponsored money as it's called you know i've heard a lot of people say that these streams promoting gambling is the same as promoting any vice like smoking or drinking the same way that there's laws with drinking smoking right right it's advice and this simply isn't true for one when advertising most devices you're at least taking on the same risks of the vice as the people you're promoting that vice to for example if you're a streamer and you want to be sponsored by a cigarette company and you're being paid every time someone picks up smoking part of the deal would be you'd have to smoke and that smoking would give you cancer just as fast as the people you're promoting it to but with casinos and fake money that isn't the case is it the price of a gambling vice isn't a hangover or bad lungs it's just being poor and broke and when you're playing with fake money you don't have that problem and we know these streamers are aware of that fact because they've been literally caught talking about it if i started like putting my own money in this i feel like i feel like if i just filled myself before thousands like right like i feel like i could like but also it could it could be dangerous but i see that there's no point of putting my body in your mind through that type of stress don't need the stress don't want to put your body through that kind of stress these guys are unreal steve is literally saying here the thing that i'm putting my fans through i would never go through myself i mean who needs it i don't need it and by the way just so we're clear the people maddest about this fake money stuff it really isn't me it's actually the real money gamblers who know how ridiculous these fake high-stakes gambling streamers are i'm considering these sites scamming with all their fake [ __ ] pieces [ __ ] streamers how dumb are you you think these guys are betting 70 million dollars a day you are [ __ ] dumb and stupid 25 wow sometimes it really isn't what you say it's how you say it all right fine if the ethical thing really doesn't get you up in the morning how about the fact that many of these people are literally illegally gambling in the u.s and know their fans are gonna do the same for example here's steve in his miami condo no no wait pause right there do you see that howler head whiskey logo pay attention because in some of steve's gambling streams you could see the same logo from the background which is weird because i thought he was going to mexico this is illegal because rubet can't operate in the us but here steve is in miami playing on rubet but of course these guys don't really care and of course the same is true for aiden ross we've caught him as well in america gambling here he is in his room on dual bits so what does this actually mean though well it means that the fans of these streamers who are sometimes gambling in the u.s then go out and use a vpn to also gamble from the us and they discuss this pretty openly quote it's banned in the u.s use a vpn they know their users are using a vpn as long as they enforce global laws they are safe so they don't stop you from using a vpn at happy i'm broke lol any good vpns i'm a djin gambler wasted 94k you can just use a vpn i've wagered effing 300k on rubet and made steve rich off referrals guys can you play live games on rubet with a vpn yes but just in case none of that convinced you i've saved my best argument for last my trap card if you will for all these gambling streamers the one thing that they will be unable to defend offshore crypto casinos are completely indefensible because of their lack of iding people and responsible gambling controls because right now if you're a gambling addict you can go to your local casino and ban yourself if you have a problem it's a very common practice called self-exclusion but online crypto casinos don't let you do that as gambling addicts who i interviewed told me yeah so i think that the biggest problem is like typically with any other regulated gambling site you have self-imposed restrictions you sign up to it they take your details and they ban you from any gambling websites betting websites anything like that and it's brilliant that was probably the thing that that enforced my recovery the most because you know as much as i wanted to gamble i couldn't if you tried to make a new account you can't you'll last for about one second before the system says hey no this is you and you have a gambling problem with crypto casinos it's it's not that they don't really care why would they have to care they're in curacao they don't have to worry about i mean yeah no doubt eh i mean i didn't have to give a passport any kind of id any kind of verification of who i was so you know i could have been a child and it just so happened i was a vulnerable adult i mean you can close your account they'll do it for you but you can sign up with a new email under the exact same id that you just uploaded not even a different picture the exact picture and continue on your way a lot of people talk about the harm to children that this might bring but there's a lot of adults out there who have a gambling disorder which is a brain disorder and they're being prayed on by one of the most exploitative and profit-making industries it's it's absolutely sick in my opinion he's right this is the real problem with offshore gambling in curacao the fact that anyone from anywhere regardless of their age or if they're addicted to gambling they can just jump on these casinos any time and by the way that doesn't just apply to rubet it also applies to steak and dual bits as well all of these crypto casinos located offshore and these companies the reason they make recovery for gambling addicts a million times harder because they don't let themselves exclude the reason they do that it makes them more money and because they're offshore nobody can tell them otherwise why would you turn a potential customer away after all a gambling addict is a great customer for a casino and the craziest part is that this shady scummy business is being pushed not by criminals not on the dark web but by the biggest streaming platform and influencers in the world and why have you ever asked yourself why are almost all the top streamers all sponsored by crypto casinos instead of more regulated casinos the answer is actually quite simple offshore casinos have less regulation which means more customers allowed in which means more money which means more money to spend on influencers which means they get the contract right it's actually pretty simple when you think about it but remember where that extra money is coming from from gambling addicts and people who shouldn't be gambling in the first place at this point i want to confront steve will do it already you know we've talked to nelk already now it's time for steve but before we can do that we need to find some hard evidence to confront him with and i realized i still have questions so i started digging around and i created this let's go to the conspiracy board real quick so this is rubet or at least the money flowing into rupet the center is what we call rubet's hot wallet on ethereum where all the money flows in and the outside are all the wallets depositing money into the casino and the reason i made this wait why did i make this oh yeah because it looks cool and because it demonstrates the scope of rhubarb's operation because the first thing i wanted to know is how much money is rubet making right how much are any of these crypto casinos making and so tracking the money that flows in is a big part but of course casinos don't keep all the money that flows in only what players lose so in order to estimate the profit we also need to see the money flowing out and so i made this these are some wallets that some ordinary gamers and i tracked down as being key to some of the owners of rubet we'll talk more in part six about how we did this and who owns these wallets but for now just know this gives us a very rough idea of how much money these guys are making in total all these crypto wallets over here deposited a total of 1.2 billion dollars in ethereum into rubit and over here the top 10 ethereum wallets many of which are owned by the owners of rubet have pulled out 300 million dollars of that meaning i should start an unregulated crypto casino i'm just kidding no actually it just means that this is an insanely lucrative business obviously and this is only ethereum we haven't even calculated bitcoin yet which is probably worth more it's just a little harder to get an exact number on that for reasons i won't bore you with but the point is not only are they making a lot but we also know the crypto casinos are a low expense business meaning most of it is profit really the only cost is licensing the slot machines paying some employees and really marketing with these influencers ultimately all these casinos care about is getting more numbers on the board more people in the door it's a very simple game for them so this is where influencers come in right these guys actually are the lifeblood of these casinos they're the ones who drive fresh meat into these casinos to gamble which explains why they get paid so much and by the way just so we're all clear rubet which we focused on because the biggest clowns promote it isn't the biggest crypto casino actually rubet is the baby brother of the offshore casino world but in the way that shaq is maybe the baby brother of yao ming he's still massive but you know it's just all relative the truth is there's an even bigger crypto casino we haven't talked about steak think about it this way ruben has done 2 billion wagers on their site by comparison stake has done 45 billion wagers making steak over 20 times larger and a billion dollar business so maybe a good comparison isn't shaq and yao ming but more like peter dinklage and yao ming either way they're both absolutely raking in the money now you may know steak because of the influencers like train wrecks who gamble with them they're really no better at all than rubet especially with the kyc issue which we've already flagged as being the most important thing these people just let gambling addicts in and ruin their lives but many of them many of these influencers will claim that they tell people not to gamble to not bet more than they lose are these influencers really impacting anybody well to find that out let's go to the main desk sorted out but here's the thing i wanted to know exactly how much of an impact these streamers were having so i decided i needed to dig into affiliate numbers remember these are the codes that these guys give you like code steve will do it code bradley martin code logan paul's friend these numbers tell us exactly how many people these guys are bringing into these casinos now luckily for us steve will do it in particular accidentally leaked these numbers in a stream not once but twice once in april of 2020 and once in may of 2021 actually giving us a really nice one-year sample size of how many people someone like steve will do it will bring in a given year so here's his numbers from april one year ago you can see he has almost no deposits only 173 depositors and 546 deposits this was at the beginning of his streaming career but fast forward a year later and this guy has 22 000 unique depositors and these people have deposited 324 000 times in total now if we zoom in here and actually have the computer enhance we find that steve will do it has made 1.7 million dollars off of affiliate codes alone so let's understand what this means steve is a mid-sized to large gambling streamer and in one year he brought in 22 000 new accounts and those people deposited on average about 15 times each and mathematically three to five percent will become problem gamblers or addicts which means steve onboarded about 600 to 1100 gambling addicts in one year going off the statistics good job steve and the price for doing that was 1.7 million dollars but of course that isn't the only way steve made money from reubet that's just affiliates he's making much more but it was hard pinning down his income exactly we found a bunch of other things like his ethereum deposit wallets and a bitcoin deposit wallet but every time we confronted steve with a wallet we thought belonged to him it was like patrick starr and manta ray in spongebob aren't you steve will do it and this is you playing rhubarb i found this deposit wallet in your stream and if that's the case this wallet belongs to you that makes sense to me then take accountability it's not my wallet yeah suffice to say i was going crazy okay you know here's this guy saying he's gonna be a billionaire in three to five years but in dms it's a totally different story ladies and gentlemen steve told me not only is he not a billionaire he told me he doesn't even have a million dollars he sent me a screenshot of his bank account to prove it quote i don't even have a million dollars and he said right after that look at my youtube videos bro look at how much i spend look at how my parents live and what they have i'm not claiming to make a little i'm telling you i spend 100 of what i have on my youtube videos i haven't saved a dollar in like five months now okay i'll be honest i felt this was a bit of a cop-out right he's claiming to spend 100 of what he makes on youtube videos but his youtube videos are just him spending money on assets like watches and properties i mean are they dumb purchases yes but in watches alone he spent two million dollars in two months two months steve spent two and a half million he's crazy touching three almost after this week so when steve says he hasn't saved money in five months he means cash but he has gained assets however dumb they are and i confronted steve on this and he told me quote i own seven cars but bought 20 for other people i own nine watches but i've gifted ten i own four properties but i've gifted three properties away and i replied so you're worth more than three million dollars oh my gosh this is making no sense he says you don't understand my youtube channel now he is right about that i don't understand it but even though he's worth way more than a million dollars i really did kind of think this was a bit pathetic i mean it reminded me of these professional athletes that make millions of dollars and end up broke like i mean this guy's taking private jets flexing watches but at the end of the day he's spending everything and it just all struck me as so pointless like especially when considering where the money came from getting his fans addicted to gambling now before we go further there's one other thing i should mention and it's that steve told me that he made so much money on rubet not just because of the gambling but because of what he had been doing for whizza as well he told me it in dms you don't even know why i make so much i asked why he replied i promote whizza completely free that's the only reason i make money off ruben i was offered a bag not cryptocurrency for promotion of wiza i said no because i can't do that in youtube because my whole thing is no paid ads on youtube that's why when i go to mexico i was able to stream with 1 to 2k viewers and make good money off stream wow it is true that steve constantly is telling people how much he promotes wiza for free because they're his buddies i'm doing this for them they're paying me zero dollars i know like there's been some controversy to talk about this like wizard thing right yeah and and i know firsthand like that you do not collect money from that because you're grateful for the other opportunities that the people who who like basically created that company gave you but what he's telling us here contradicts that he's simply saying because he doesn't take a paycheck with wizza he gets more of a paycheck over on ruben which totally contradicts wizz's whole point to myself and mudahar that they're totally separate from ruben remember wizard this whole time has been trying to convince everybody that them and rubet are completely separate entities but steve will do it is saying very clearly that his relationship with rubet is dependent on how much he promotes wiza he said it even more explicitly later on quote i only started to make good money because i would do these wiza ads for free like if i would have accepted taking money from wizard my rubet numbers would be significantly lower hmm poking a few holes in wiz's story there but at this point i realized it was kind of going in circles trying to get him to fess up to how much money he's making it was time to quit the foreplay i decided i needed to get steve will do it on the phone and i decided to ask him the golden question can you just tell me how much you're making on brew bet like is it 1 million a month is it 2 million a month what is it i mean it's really like how much like how like how much do i am i able to go and travel it's whatever like i really want it not what i want it to be like it can't be like a lot but yeah i mean it could be it could be like 500 to sometimes like closer to the million like per month wow annualized that's six to 12 million dollars a year pretty wild especially since he's probably lowballing this either way it's insane 12 million dollars a year to spin some slots on twitch but the craziest part of this conversation came when steve started talking about why he even partnered with rubet in the first place you won't believe this it's just one of those things i love to gamble i gambled a lot it kind of was kind of disgusting and it was kind of like a great you know a great way for me to not gamble with my own money right what he partnered with a gambling company as a way to gamble without spending his own money it seems insane and like do you see that as a problem i mean because i literally have a clip of you being like you know i i thought about putting my own money in but who needs that kind of stress and it's like oh this is insane because basically what you're doing you're an ambassador for a company trying to get your fans to gamble with their own money but then you yourself don't want to gamble with your money you don't you know what i mean you know how that comes off yeah though i hear what you're saying i mean i do gamble as in sports and [ __ ] still but i do i do get what you're saying i just i stopped playing at the casino why because i have no control man and i have a and what is it a credit no control i mean i gamble if i go to a casino i gamble and now it's like little money but but wait but wait but don't you see the problem there is like if you're saying like oh man i gotta stop gambling i have no control and then you're making the majority of your money from getting other people to gamble while you yourself don't really want to do it anymore like isn't that kind of like a problem it's it's definitely it it could be a problem because gambling's not good wow not good is right steve is admitting here that not only does he have a gambling problem his solution was to get a gambling sponsorship so that he wouldn't have to stop gambling but now his losses are just his fans losses and he makes a ton of money it's insane now to steve's credit unlike a lot of other gambling influencers he didn't shy away from the fact that oh yeah this is bad but again what's weird here is and i couldn't believe it during the conversation it seems that steve never seems to have had this thought before that offshore gambling might be bad in fact not only has apparently he never thought of it he says no one in his inner circle of friends ever mentioned it either maybe if you were like my friend like in real life and you no one's approached me and said anything like this that hey steve you know what you're doing is wrong this you know i've never been approached like that you know yeah yeah like you know no one's even he's close to me he's ever said like yo like you should really rethink what you're doing it's wrong you know i've never had that and i never thought that i was doing anything wrong personally this is just sad honestly you know i can't read steve's mind i'll say right up front he could definitely be lying about this whole thing but i don't know if that's the case here based on what i've seen if steve will do it i believe he actually thought to himself oh i'm the good guy i'm not one of those scammers i'm the good guy and it was weird to hear him sort of in real time it's sinking in that oh maybe this rubette stuff was really bad now coffee now is there a way where it's like to just make this like right like we like because i'm i'm i'm i'm not here saying oh no nothing's wrong with gambling and [ __ ] like like is there a way to make this right with you like i mean i'm because i'm here i don't need to do rubet ever again wow i don't know about you but if there was ever a confession that's it steve admitted here that what he was doing is wrong and that he would quit he later says it even more explicitly well no i've already made i've already made that decision like before saying that is right if i thought like it's already that's already decided you're done with rhubarb yeah i mean unless i unless there's a way to do it right but yeah right now i'm done i mean unless you get on the phone and be like hey this is how you do it right let's be honest is steve doing this mostly because he got caught and not all because of some ethics realization yeah probably let's not be naive this is good for steve's brand to stop gambling at this point but nonetheless would steve quitting offshore gambling be a good gesture yes because ultimately this isn't a story about steve will do it making millions even though it might have started that way this has become a story about the gambling addicts who are suffering because of the offshore crypto casinos who are relentlessly targeting them and even one influencer standing up stopping and saying this was wrong that matters however that being said there was another part of me that after this call i couldn't help but think that steve is just one influencer in a chain of influencers all of them attracted by insane money and not willing to look at the result of their own actions and willing to look the other way and the problem is it's sort of an endless supply of steves as soon as one steve will do it won't do it another steve will do it you know what i mean i learned this when talking about that aidan ross clip i put on twitter that clip of aiden ross demeaning himself in front of tens of thousands of people and i said would you do this for one meal a month and i meant it as a joke but the answer was overwhelming basically y'all all would and that kind of seems obvious in hindsight but it made me look at this case a little bit differently and it brought back some things people had told me along the way about how to approach this whole thing we can do what hassan and ethan did and spend hours arguing with trainwreck about you know how morally bad this is and you shouldn't be doing this but if somebody came to me tomorrow and said i'm going to pay you a million dollars a month i'd say yeah you know even in my position as somebody who's been through the harm that gambling can cause you know i understand that people need money that's a really good point if ultimately the goal is to stop offshore gambling preying on addicts how do we solve that is it by showing people getting their lives ruined by gambling because i can do that i've talked to so many gambling addicts over the last week and some of their stories were so brutal that i was literally at a loss for words how much money are you in debt right now more than 30 000 i can't sleep and they have like people i need to pay by the end of the month and i'm just like mentally completely completely destroyed and i before i called you i was watching the video how to end your life that's how that's how bad is getting into me right now i'm like i feel like so stupid it got dark and i can show you over and over and over again clips that would horrify you these people are saying the same thing they're relapsing because unregulated gambling doesn't let themself exclude i can make that case five ways till friday about why unregulated gambling is bad and i might convince a few people or maybe shame a few influencers into quitting this garbage practice of selling out your fans but again we know there's always going to be some scumbag willing to look the other way because it's life-changing money so what do we do obviously i'm no expert in this stuff so i decided instead to just ask the addicts i talked to what do they think should be done i think twitch need to stop every stripper that promote unregulated casinos i mean personally i'm i'm in favor of just shutting it down on twitch altogether simple as that promote casino that there are regulated beings i can play on them and if i if you know if if i think i'm becoming an addict it would shut your account and things like that i don't think a platform with a platform that knows that the percentage of young people on their platform is what 17 20 whatever it was they shouldn't be allowing this especially not promoting it suggesting it so there you go that's what they say should be done and for what it's worth i agree twitch needs to do something and i think they understand that because they've already been removing gambling affiliate codes from their influencers pages but is that enough ultimately for an industry that is completely dependent on influencer marketing twitch could make some big changes that would radically help gambling addicts and lead to more compliance worldwide because let's be honest if these billion dollar crypto casinos knew for example that it wouldn't be tolerated on twitch for them to not check ids or allow vpns you better believe they would change their rules and shape up they have enough money to do proper compliance they have billions of dollars the only reason they don't do anything is because twitch doesn't care right now but i don't mean to ignore influencers here either because the solution involves them too we've shown today with numbers how many people this is hurting and we've demonstrated that without these influencers these casinos wouldn't work so if you're an influencer you can be part of the solution too just consider not partnering with offshore unregulated casinos but hey that's just my suggestion and what do i know i'm just a guy in his 10 million dollar studio doing my research research that is about finished waiting for this drink maxwell come on what has happened to this place's service oh and like you're one to talk about making people wait here you go speedy gonzales don't forget to pay your tab this time thanks and sorry listen the reason i'm in here is i want to tell you about a little project i've been working on secretly never been released tell me it's an actual flying lambo and not just that cgi looking thing no it's not an actual what are you really breaking the wall right now i don't have
