if we interpret the fall as the fall into metacognitions in metacognition then i would say empirically that's obviously true we broke our relationship with the harmony of instinct before we were prepared and what happened was that we became able to develop technology because of metacognition but without the empathy required to apply the technology wisely as opposed to that very narrowly contracted field of personal benefit which is exactly what we leverage when we use technology so it's yeah the fall happened before it was a good move on the part of nature or on the part of the divinity it was too early and the evidence for that is life as we leave it today and the risks that we bring to ourselves and everything else that lives on the surface of this planet this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] hey welcome to our christ my name is marcus today i'm joining us again with two brothers and gentlemen jonathan pajel and dr bernardo castro jonathan is a french canadian icon carver republic speaker and youtuber exploring the symbolic patterns that underlayer experience of the world how these patterns emerge and come together manifest in religion art and popular culture he's also the editor of the athletics arts journal host of symbolic world blogging podcast bernardo is the executive director of essentia foundation his work has been leading the modern renaissance of metaphysical idealism the notion that reality is essentially mental is a phd in philosophy and another phd in computer engineering so i suppose just to begin then i'd love to know really what was what stuck with you gents from the last conversation we had and maybe some of the trades that you'd like to follow up then if you start with shop jonathan i really enjoyed the last conversation i thought that it was i thought that i was able to understand bernardo's thought more and also able to connect it with the let's say the errors of thinking and research that i'm involved with i'm more i'm definitely interested in exploring more of the the question of mind as it applies applies to higher beings or distributed consciousnesses the different ways that people are phrasing it i've been thinking a lot about that even more now and so that's something that i'm interested in exploring still seeing how we can make sense of agency in terms of agency that appears above us as humans yeah on my side it was a delight to to sort of get a live confirmation of the fact that there are people out there still that consider it important to have a symbolic religious life religious symbolism religious icons and consider it important to nurture those as well i find it surprising that even amongst many many christians catholics protestant christians the value of symbolism has largely been lost and there is a over emphasis in my view on morals which is something that can legitimately be derived from religion but morals are not the sum total of religion there is much more to the religious life than morals and symbolism to me is crucial to that and and jonathan is sort of believing embodiment of that attitude in the world that frankly begun to be lost during the reformation already and the reformation was inspired by legitimate good and important reasons but as almost everything human beings do it sort of careens out of control and throws the baby out with the bath water and religious symbolism iconic symbolism has been lost even to the catholic church and today is kept alive only by the orthodox churches across the world so it's nice to see that that vein in the human mind is still nurtured and kept alive thanks verano and would you like to phrase what you just described as a question then jonathan take over there sure i mean so maybe i can just so i've been thinking a lot about the the problem of we know we talked about the idea of for example that the china like the angel of china or something like that the idea that there is some kind of agency there are agencies which act above us the above the human level and seem to constrain us in our own agency let's say as we act and this is something with john vivek we've been discussing a lot he tends to be willing to use the word agency though he really wants to avoid the word consciousness in those in in that question and so that is really the what i'm really curious to explore a little more based on our discussion maybe i can start with this so we talked i talked about this idea of let's say the angel of china let's use that word or the principality of china and you were you were diff you were bothered by the notion of how is it that it exists let's say how is it that it exists outside of the time that china exists in the world so right does it have prior existence does it continue to exist after after its its existence china that's the other question where do you find the spatial boundaries well i think that the the i was thinking about that later and i was starting to wonder if that's not the same problem from in the in the case of humans as well right this the idea that we have permeable boundaries humans do as well both mentally but then also physically our physical boundaries because they're at the level of our perception we see them as more solid but they are they're they're they're permeous and the same would be for a higher being let's say a city or a state it has you can still locate it even physically in the world you can locate it conceptually but it does have permeability on its edges and it seems to so you can't fix it that way it's so like here i'm i'm really going to be more like neoplatonic in the sense that you can you can only fix it in its higher aspect you can fix it in its identity so it's actually its name use the name used more in a more ancient way that fixes it and then it's manifestation or the the quantity of it will always have permeability and change so it's the ship of theseus problem right it's like is the ship of theseus still the ship of theseus even though its parts have been have changed have been and my answer would be yes it is because it's actually held together by by name by memory by attention by all these these mechanisms before i comment on that can i ask you a question inspired by something you said if i don't ask the question now it will be lost yeah sure sure go ahead you said john viveki was comfortable using the word agency for higher levels of mentation but not the word consciousness do you know what difference he makes in his mind between the two and why this this distinction well he seems to he seems to for well he seems to think first of all that the conscience is a very specific aspect which has to do with certain amount of speed and so speed of connection is what would give rise let's say to consciousness i mean i don't really agree with that myself but that is that that is his main argument he might he might say i'm not getting him right so let's be careful here but this is the understanding that i have of his argument is that is that in the human brain there is there's a certain amount of speed of connection and interconnectivity which can give rise to a state of consciousness but that you can't perceive that let's say at the city level the connections are slow you know like writing emails and writing letters and and and you know people talking amongst each other in order to organize the the activities of the city you would have a you'd have a slower connection and so i don't to be honest i don't i don't mind that i think that there are just different types of consciousnesses i don't mind the idea that that it would be a slower consciousness or just a consciousness that has a different function than the human but that that's that is the argument that i've heard him make i think i understand i think he's basing that on information integration theory which i think applies to meta consciousness self-awareness by metacognition not necessarily to consciousness in the phenomenal sense pure experience so i think he is probably conflating the two like a lot of neuroscientists today conflate the two but but i understand where it's coming from i also don't agree because when i talk about consciousness i talk about phenomenal consciousness not matter consciousness but but i understand the motivation now back to your point what i would warn against jonathan is attributing private conscious in their life to anything we have or can make up a word for because words are cheap what is china does it include tibet and hong kong and macau or not and depending on the decision you make here whether china includes these three things or not does it affect the ontological reality of there being an angel of china or a separate angel for china and another one for hong kong and another one from macau and another one for tibet you see what i mean the same applies to a table in the case of pen psychism if the pen psychist says the table is conscious has a private inner life of its own if i pull out one of the feet of the table one of the four legs do i create some kind of dissociation and i create a new conscious entity and thus that new conscious entity emerges with the table if i nail the leg back to the table or a rock that detaches from a mountain does it become separate from the mounting the then in your life private in a life of its own and does it reunite every time it touches the mounting as it bounces off the slope so we create a mass if we if we see everything identifiable through a noun through a word as an agent as a conscious agent because you know the way we apply words is arbitrary the way we define sets subsets and sub supersets in language is arbitrary it's nominal as philosophers call it it's done by convenience and doesn't necessarily reflect any ontological reality okay so there are two things i would i would say to that or that it would that made that i think when i hear that one is i can apply again the same the same problem to myself if i see myself as a conscious agent i can ask myself when i cut does my hair participate in my conscious agency you know do my fingernails what about if i cut a finger off does the finger now you know so i can ask the same question that is why that i i tend to think that that categories are captured in there in their name game or in the place where they come together rather than try to find them contained in the place where their multiplicity has a possibility of of breaking apart let's say i see your point but i think you miss the one criterion we have to define the boundaries of us as as individual agents with private conscious in their life of their own and it's an it's a criterion that applies to us and doesn't apply to objects doesn't apply to the table to the mountain or to china and it's the following if i pierce the chair i'm sitting on with a needle i don't feel it but if i pierce my arm i do feel it yeah if a photon in my study hits the wall behind me i don't see it but if it hits my retina i do experience it so that there is a objective criterion for defining the boundaries of the human being and that is what you register as an experience when something interacts with it and what you don't register as an experience when something interacts with it now i acknowledge that based on this criterion there is a question that is valid which is are we the totality of ourselves or are we only our nervous system because it's only the nervous system that registers you know that there there are no nerve terminations in your hair so it's not part of you but then i would say well there are no living cells in your hair either it's just keratin the same applies for your nails so i see that there is a question there but i don't think it's a free-for-all i don't think no i don't think it's a free-for-all either for sure but in terms of china for example i agree with the table it's it's it but let's say if you look at china the question that you ask could be answered in terms of china so in terms of boundary so you would say so imagine there's china and then there are a bunch of people that are that are coming in and taking things like from another state you know they at first they they take refuse maybe they take the trash on the side and when they do that they don't hurt china and china it doesn't matter doesn't doesn't care but then at some point maybe they come in and they start to take things or they take part of the land or they they take certain things that are that china perceives as belonging to it and then then china will react very much like a pain reaction we'll send out soldiers antibodies and will re will push away the threat that it's that it is feeling on itself and so if you see it that way then at some point the the question of tibet or macau or the or these are these other identities would be something like you could you can imagine it like it's a conflict of of identities it this is what's happening there is a conflict of an idea where china wants to extend its body to include these smaller identities and those identities are resisting you can almost imagine it like someone in the forest hunting a deer and wants to to to integrate the deer into himself and the deer is resisting my my street has a neighborhood watch so if there is a strange person doing funny things on my streets it will be ejected by the nervous system of the street does my street have an angel is there an angel of the street where bernardo lives yeah i don't know these are the questions that i'm asking questions like to what like where how can we perceive like to what because there are some for example there are some theologians that go all out with this they'll say as soon as two people encounter themselves there's a third being there as soon as two people have a conversation there's a third b and and it's like that's i don't know it's like i'm not sure i want to go there but i'm just saying that these these these problems have been thought about in different ways to try to account for the manner in which in which there is a higher in which when two people come together there's something more than just the accumulation of the two and we experience it that's what a team is right if you if you play on a team you realize that there's an agency beyond my individual agency or just the accumulation of agency that seems to manifest itself when we're dancing together towards a common purpose i think the crux of the matter is what one means by agency if agencies defined in such a way that an agent has its own private conscious in their life then i think it's tricky to say that there is a third agent when two people talk because there is no evidence that in addition to the private inner life of the two there is a third private in a life constituted of the combination of the two can i disprove it no i cannot but there are countless things one cannot disprove and yet they don't entertain because we have no reason to entertain i would caution against conflating concepts with antique realities like an agent with its own private conscious in their life well this is not i don't think it's concept so if we it's a if you notice for example that you that conversations you have with different people have different flavors they they have different implicit rules that sometimes you can't even say like there's some you act a certain way with your brother with your your parents and then you act a different way in different relationships and there's a there's something which is binding the the conversation which is beyond even each of our own wills so so we couldn't decide to make our relationship something else than what it is there there's a there's a kind of binding let's say and that that that is a there's a kind of agency that binds the relationship in a direction and so that these are the things that i'm i'm just trying to understand because it's not it's not just concepts it's an experience even on our side like to to be the member of a team and to be playing basketball and going dribbling down the the field and not having to look and then passing the ball because you know that the person is there and they know that you're going to pass it before you do and that and you've seen it in a play and then people exalt i mean when they see something like that when someone sees multiplicity joined together in a common goal in a way that looks almost like it's it's one body there's a joy that we experience we experience that almost like as a kind of ecstasy which explains the reason why sport is so is so one of the reasons why sport is so popular so those are the types of behaviors that i'm trying to figure out how they relate to because they can be reduced to just i don't think they can be my allusion to concepts was motivated by the analogy you made between the army of china and an immune system and why is that conceptual well because it's an analogy made at a very high level of conceptual abstraction because there is no similarity at all between the army of china and an immune system if you think about them literally you know what is an immune system and what is the army of china they are completely different things you do find a valid similarity but to find it you have to operate conceptually at a high level of abstraction and then i warned against attributing private conscious in their life to something to some similarity or based on an analogy that operates on a very high level of conceptual abstraction because that may have nothing to do with the actual reality of the situation regarding teen dynamics i i'm totally there with you that something emerges weak emergence something emerges when when entities interact and that emergence can be a very well synchronized dynamics across the members of the team i don't think that provides reason to say that there is a higher level agent that has a private conscious in their life of its own just because of amazing team dynamics or because of the way i don't know birds synchronize their flight in the late afternoon and even from the fact that your personal inner life your inner experience changes when you are involved in dynamics because look every conscious agent always stands to see something happen within itself once it interacts with the outside world including other conscious agents so that's not a surprise we change ourselves the moment we interact with the not ourselves with the world out there with others out there but i don't see a logical reason why this should imply that there is a higher level conscious agent with a private conscious in their life of its own that corresponds to that basketball team or to the ant hill there may be i think the argument is stronger for the ant hill actually than for the basketball team but i i don't think the suggestion is strong i think we can account for all that just based on system dynamics but look if i if i'm there is a thing called cellular automata and computer science one of them is called the game of life it's a very very simple game based on a matrix of cells yeah and obeying two very simple rules only two rules extremely simple if two or three of your neighbors are alive then you are alive if less or more then that cell dies because it's overcrowded or doesn't have companionship and then you program a system like that and you set it off based on these extremely simple rule applied recursively to itself and you see amazing dynamics emerge and you see guns that fire projectiles you know you see populations of seemingly living entities emerge but but we know that that's the simple dynamics of applying a simple rule recursively and we need nothing further than that to explain that amazing collective dynamics so yes to me that's the the recursive the recursive structure that is the one that i'm attached to let's say that is the notion that the notion that let's say i am made up of smaller mentations if you want to if i'm going to try to use your your try to come close to the language you use it my idea i recognize myself as one to a certain extent and i see myself as one but i can also notice in myself a multiple agents in me that are sometimes fighting towards with each other sometimes acting in collaboration with each other and when they act in collaboration with each other then i experience more unity and when they act against each other when they fight with each other then i experience disunity and it can get to a form of despair if it's too strong if there's too strong a disunity among my constituents then i can experience i can experience despair and so that and so what i noticed is that that recur that recursive pattern within me i can notice that i seem to be participating in similar patterns above me and i can't have like just as my as from above i can perceive my mental states fighting with each other i know that those mental states can't perceive me like they can't perceive the unity that i experienced that that sees that multiplicity and so in the same way i noticed that i am participating in the same type of fractal behavior above me in groups and and and and in and i can see the same pattern where it is that if members of a group collaborate then we ex then there's more unity towards the purpose and if we don't collaborate then there's more disunity to a point where the group can die or can can actually can actually fall apart and so that is the thing that i'm interested in and noticing the recursive nature of this layered structure we could say that move seems to move but down below us but also seems to move up above us first just a very quick comment to to to clarify what i meant by the term when i when i said recursion applied to the cellular automata what i meant was you apply a rule to define the next state of a cell and then you apply the same rule to that next state to generate the next state and then you apply the same rule again and so forth and i didn't mean fractal self-similarity when i used the word recursion i sympathize with your intuition but i would say the following the logical logic question we have in front of us when we sort of take this intuition seriously and i have the same intuition by the way so i i take it very seriously the logic question is the following are we talking about one mind that seems to be many or are we talking about many minds that somehow integrate to be one or less i would suggest that the very fact that you now can sit there and say i notice myself being many suggests very strongly that the direction is top down and not the bottom up it suggests very strongly that you were always one mind and and that you just seem to be many when there is conflict across different mental processes in yourself well i see it i see it both ways this is the way that i that i see it i see there's a top-down and then there's a bottom there's a bottom-up aspect which seems to be represented in different ways in in different in at different scales but let's say it's something like love this is maybe the best word to use that that there seems to be this notion that if we love each other then then we actually are becoming you know let's say i use christian language that if we love each other then we're becoming the body of the god man right could say it that way but that but then it also is a top-down process which is that you know he is the head we are the body you know the the the highest mind is also the cause of the lower minds but so it's you can experience it seems like you can experience it in both ways so let's say let's say if if the intuition of the scaling i know that if i want my family to be one then it i'm not going to experience it as a top-down experience i'm going to experience it as an effort to love my wife and to love my kids and ultimately it can be a top-down reality like i can you can come to realize that it is in some ways higher a higher mind which is imposing itself and that the the the conflict that we had was with the distortion with an illusion once we've resolved it but i i definitely experience it top bottom up when in my in my behavior maybe is the best way to say it towards these towards the i don't know if that if that makes sense it it does but i would suggest if only the the experience that you're going bottom up is consistent with top down being fundamental in the following way if the apparent fragmentation of mind in this universe you have your mind that have mine and the amoeba in swimming my turret has its mind and my cat has another mind if that seeming diversity and separation is illusory because illusions are part and parts of experience so one mind can have the illusion that it's many and we know that that happens because people suffer from dissociative identity disorder which is now clinically established as established as a fact and they experience themselves in in exactly that way they experience themselves as being many because of the association and yet they are not they are one mind that has the illusion of being many you experience that even without pathological levels of dissociation when you repress your memories repress your emotions when you experience cognitive dissonance now if that becomes the starting state the illusion of separation the illusion of being many when some of that illusion is dissolved then you come one step closer to the reality of the matter you will experience that as if it were a bottom-up process well in fact it's not it's a return it's not going forward it's a going backwards to where it all started so i i think for sure i mean i think we agree fundamentally not the illusion part i get to that but like fundamentally in terms of you know like to use christian language again we could say you know like grace grace comes first without grace it has to come from above first everything has to kind of flow from above but the love part the reason why i think it's important is because love doesn't annihilate the multiplicity love actually preserves the multiplicity and that's why i think it's such a fundamental concept in christianity which is that love will say something like we can be both one and many at the same time and so i can both move towards unity and perceive the multiplicity and see them as of course not having an equal ontological state the unity is superior to the multiplicity but the multiplicity can fully participate kind of indefinitely as is this indefinite variation in multiplicity in the the one and so i find the language of illusion i tend to find the language of illusion more dangerous like in terms of in terms of morality and what and the implications of what that that means you know you see that because because i it seems like the notion that multiplicity is illusory and that unity is is the only thing that's real the one mind is the only thing that real seems to lead to something at least in in the the the ways of thinking that it brought this about it seems to lead to something like degradation in multiplicity where the multiple is is is lesser in in almost in a moral sense where you see that in the caste system we see that in agnostic cosmologies where creation is evil in its in itself and love seems to be the way that christians tried to to reconcile that with greek inside you need multiplicity together i i didn't mean to pass any value judgment on illusions at all i i used the word in the you know in the very dry technical analytic philosophical sense which is when things seem to be something other than what they in fact are it's the seeming that is an illusion but i didn't mean to pass value judgment only illusions meaning i don't see it as good or as bad i see it as something that happens it's one of the potentials of nature and it happens and the usefulness of the idea is just to distinguish between what seems to be and what we have reason to think is actually the case then we know that a person who is suffering from dissociative identity disorder only seems to be many because that person can be cured can reintegrate all of its alter personalities and remember the memories of each one of them and know that the person was one hour long and it just seemed to be many now using a pathology as an example may suggest a value judgment because you know pathology is bad so illusion is bad and that's where my my metaphor went wrong i didn't mean to pass on it at all but there's also there's also i think there's more at least in my vision there's more than that because there's a sense in which so if there's so obviously i'm i'm making a lot of leaps here but just hopefully you can indulge me but let's say we talk about this fractal system of embedded beings you know in in each other and that this is a reflection of the one mind and this fractal manifestation of how the one and the many coexist in each other so we have that sense there's a way in which because when i see that in many of the the thinkers that i admire i see that for example c.s lewis had some very beautiful imagery to talk about that where he would talk about how as you get closer to the one the multiple becomes more real it it actually it actually shines with more reality because it's connected to the one and it's when it's disconnected so you could say that about the multiple personality person the problem with the multiple personality person is not that they have multiple personalities you could say but it's that those personalities don't know each other and don't aren't united above but if they're united above then you notice that you do have within you a multiplicity of desires and of thought patterns and of directions and that you could something like love all these multiplicities and give them the reality they deserve let's say in in the the human existence i'm totally with you there okay sometimes i speak of myself as many when i say that i have a diamond and the diamond sets you know the direction base and tone of my life and that i've learned to not try to resist that anymore to just apply some kind of adult more of supervision to the diamond because the diamond is a force of nature and it doesn't really pass value judgments so i even speak of myself as many and i'm totally with you that to mature not only as a person but even as an entity in nature entails giving space to the multiplicity within us accepting the existence of all that exists within us giving it its time under the sun as opposed to trying to slash it away to mutilate yourself or repress or pretend that it's not there that doesn't work so i am with you there my pushback comes from that nuanced subtle and very tricky tricky boundary when we cross from speaking metaphorical language which is meant to evote something evoke something in the mind of another and we cross it into some literal statement and crossing that boundary can be tricky because it may involve for instance in my case saying that there is a actual diamond inside me that it's that is not me and then it becomes a demon but a diamond and it's a fundamentally separate entity it sort of tricks me into doing its bidding then it goes wrong that's where it goes wrong and and i sense that if we are too relaxed in terms of defining entities we cross that boundary and we start projecting angelic entities everywhere in anything that we can use a word for and conceptually distinguish from its surroundings then the reason i find it tricky jonathan is the following it's not limited to the discussion in you you and i and i are having it it sort of gives the tone to everybody's world views even in the west mainly in the west which is the conflation of nouns with entities we have nouns for all kinds of sub entities that are part of the world the world but these objects these sub entities are carved out in a completely nominal way in other words it's an arbitrary separation an arbitrary inner boundary within the totality that we call existence for instance where does the river end and the ocean begin why do you say arbitrary it's a functional it's a it's a purposeful distinction one which fits our our purposes as conscious age agents and so it's like the dis the difference between the river and the ocean is an important distinction because you can drink from the river you can't drink from the ocean and therefore even though there is a buffer of of of inter interdeterminate the indeterminacy those categories are nonetheless they serve our consciousness we could say yes what i meant by arbitrary is that it's nominal in other words it's determined by convenience and use and does not necessarily reflect a ontic aspect of the world it doesn't necessarily reflect the world as it is in and of itself for instance there is a subset of existence that we call a car and we say well the car ends here and the surface of the tires and you know whatever and if i ask you okay give me a clear criterion for criteria for determining what is part of the car and what is not because the car is made of components and pieces that are just brought together so are the spark plugs integral to the car and you might say well yes because without the spark plugs the car doesn't function it doesn't move and then i will latch onto that and say okay then the engine is part of the car yes the tire tires are part of the car yes now let's go ahead if there is no road for the tires to grip the car doesn't move so the roads are part of the car no no wait a moment if there is no gravity to pull the tires towards the road it doesn't grip either and it doesn't move either so the gravity needs to be part of the car where does the gravity come from from the total mass of the planet so the car is everything it's the entire planet oh actually not because the planet is what it is because it rotates and skipped within a stable orbit of spirent star so the star the sun is part of the car and i will go on and on and on and on with this and never so that's why you don't that but that's why you don't you don't the boundary of the thing is not in its physical quantities or in its it's actually in its name or in its purpose that's what that the the it's the limit of the car appears in its lim in its name or in its purpose rather than in its if you so but you could what you're saying is true of everything like anything that that you even your even conscious agents like you know you can stretch that either that you cannot find a a fixed a fixed boundary between things they are all permias there is one exception to this every carving out of existence is nominal i've stopped using the word arbitrary it's nominal it's done by convenience so it's epistemic it's not ontological it reflects our convenience and not the actual states of affair affairs in the world but there is one exception to this and i already mentioned that the boundaries of us as entities are objectively determinable because if i stick a needle in my chair i don't feel it but if i stick a needle on my skin i do feel it it's the only thing the boundaries of living minds as determined by what they can experience and what they can't everything else carving out the inanimate universe into objects is nominal it's done by convenience and therefore i don't think it's logical for us to say well something i carved out merely by convenience has a private inner life of its own why because it it's akin to taking an abstract painting and saying i will nominally determine that the subset of all reddish pixels on this painting are a thing yeah and now there is an angel for the reddish pixels on on the canvas why that carving out was completely based on convenience or taste or whatever it doesn't necessarily reflect the states of affair beyond your own mind that's what i was warning against no i i attributing a conscious agency to everything we create a word for yeah well one of the ways one of the ways that i it seems this is something i've been thinking about recently and and some people watching this are really going to struggle with what i'm gonna say but that's fine we'll say it anyways so there's a there's a sense in which in the in the bible there's a figure that appears the son of man right you see this figure appear in the book of daniel you also see it appear but not named in the in the book of ezekiel in the divine vision where there's the shape of a man on the on the divine chariot and philo of alexandria develops this idea of adam cadman or universal manner heavenly man different ways to talk about it of course in christianity we have the sense in which christ is that incarnation of the heavenly man but even if you don't believe in jesus christ you don't even need that yet in order to understand the notion of positing man at the right hand of god ruling over the angels and and the sense would be that that there's a manner in which i think we talked about it this last time which is that all perception of of agency in the world is reflected through human agency so it's actually mirrored through the human the human that we can perceive images of agency in the world both below us you know or on the same level but also above us so the image for example that you know the image that the son of man rules over the angels the son of man is above the angels and and the sense would be that the angels serve man you see you hear that in christian theology but that could have a more technical meaning which is the notion that the the perceptions of agency that we have are the cohesion that we see in the world actually are in the service of man that is they they are they are real to the extent that they serve human in the with the man with the big m you know the mat the the the the man with the big m so that is for me at least it's been a way that i've been trying to think about the problem so if you think about a team for example right so higher agencies like china or all these other higher beings that seem to have some kind of agency over us that if we have the notion that they ultimately should serve man with a capital m then they it seems to make more sense that although they have agency over us ultimately they are mirrored through our consciousness as something which is there for us because basketball is there not for you know it's there for us it's it's it has it has a human yeah anyways i don't know if what do you think about it no no i'm totally with you now i converge fully with you it is insofar as it helps us in some way even if they're not metacognitive way to project agency onto the world according to delineations that serve our purposes best i think it's perfectly all right to do that i would call it a metaphorical carving out of the world and i do that with myself even it it helps me regard my own mind as a multiplicity and talk of talk of the diamond the diamond reflects its usefulness to me i create the diamond by looking at myself with those lenses so in that sense i'm playing the role of the son of man and i determine what are the angelic entities within me based on what will bring me forward in the most productive teleological you know morally positive way i'm totally with you there and so could you perceive that this would so so the idea would be the way that i see it would be that that could also go awry that process so it could also become parasitic where oh yeah where where where you know we have we have we project if you want to we use that term or there are angels that are supposed to serve us and that have that hold beings together that have agency over us that become that become twisted because they were they were created with with with with parasitic desires or whatever it is or these multiple personalities that were were acting at a higher level so i think about like facebook for me is the great example of that you know where it's like we we create this thing and then the person the people who created it did not understand the they didn't do it in wisdom you could say they didn't understand the side effects of the being they were unleashing on the world and so now facebook has agency over people it actually it actually manages the way that they pay attention the way that they communicate the way that they come into relationship with each other and now all the side effects of that are starting to show themselves and you know in hyper politicized groups and all these types of things that everybody's been complaining about facebook for for years now but that you can see the process of the the process of a of a good angel that would manage our behavior together going awry and becoming parasitic let's say yeah i i think we don't even need to go to facebook we can stay within the universe of our own mind i think anybody who pays attention and has paid attention for a while in their adult life knows that demons are real not real in the literal sense in the sense that my demons would still be here and exist even if i were not around no that that crosses the line to literal territory and i think that not only is wrong literally but it flattens the message of you know of the metaphorical world too much but if i don't cross that line that there are demons within me it's a it's an obvious fact of existence there are the demons of addiction within me that are insatiable and will eat myself alive if there aren't the angels of teleology and meaning that keep them in check [music] you could describe almost the entire depth and richness of human conscious life with the language of angels and demons and and i think therein lies the profound truth of religious language but i would i would push back a little bit on saying that they don't exist outside me and the reason why i would say that is because because i can gain insight about my demons from others and so i can re i recognize that other people are dealing with the same demon that i'm dealing with it's although its manifestation is purely individual right it you could you could say that if if there's this fractal if there's this fractal structure let's say that there's a there's an anal there's an analogous aspect in me a passion this is the way that the church rathers talk about it there's a passion in me that's out of control and that passion corresponds to something which is transpersonal this transpersonal thing will hook on to that and then we'll run like a program in you and we'll we'll let's say we'll run this parasitic program inside you and so so i if i i can read a church father from the 5th century and that church father can help me deal with my a demon because they had to deal with the same the same demon let's say i will agree with you even there the distinction is how we use the word i right because you said well there are things outside meme what is the mean i think if we call the eye our core subjectivity i think there is nothing outside that because the course of objectivity me is the same as that in you and it's the core subjectivity of the divinity itself it's it's that field of transpersonal subjectivity that underlies all nature nothing exists outside of it so all angels and demons exist there and they are outside my ego my angels and demons are certainly outside my ego and that's why it's useful for the ego to talk of them as external entities but i don't think they are outside my core subjectivity right so if you understand the fact that like when you would say some like the fact that you are connected to the ground of being at the core of who you are like the divine spark or christ in you or you know different ways of expressing it in tradition that that at the very core of you is the same right is the is that is that one yeah yeah that one ground i'd say yeah and that's why there is a sense even though you may not like that sense because of the use of words but that's why there is a sense in which i lost my train of thought now but there is a sense in which unity is fundamental and not diversity because all diversity unfolds within that one course objectivity that's what i meant when i said that multiplicity is ultimately an illusion which is not to say that there aren't levels in the hierarchy of being where those illusions are very real it still has illusions but very real for every conceivable practical purpose yeah well for sure for sure in in christian theology they try to make put multiplicity right at the highest right there right you know the trinity is is the the really the expression of the multiplicity at the at the very core and that that one in many are the very principle by which all things exist like there that this loving relationship between the one and the many is that the mode of being of all things and in that context are there transpersonal angels and demons based on my own inner experience i would say yes there are i personally have very little doubt about it if any i see three levels of identity one is the ego that narrative we think of us as being that narrative that little person born on that date married to that other person who has this job and so forth that's the ego that's the first level the next level is what is yours personally but it's beyond the ego in jungian terminology the personal unconscious it's all your of your repressed stuff your the stuff that you don't acknowledge about yourself the memories that you're not recalling it's still you as an individual mind but it's well beyond your ego and it's much much much bigger than the ego but it's still you as an individual agent and then there is a transpersonal which in union terminology would be the collective unconscious which is still psychic it's still mental it's still phenomenally conscious it's just not meta-conscious and there are psychic processes there psychic complexes that young called the diamonds that may not have a physical correlate which evolution did not have a motivation to creating as a perceptual apparatus capable of picking those entities out because they may not have a direct bearing on our ability to survive may not pose a direct physical threat to us so we didn't evolve the sense organs or the the perceptual apparatus to pick them out but they may still be out there in that in that ocean of mind of which we are apart and within which we are immersed as individual agencies and they may impinge on us they may not have a direct bearing on our ability to survive but they most definitely have a direct bearing in our ability to be happy or be depressed or be sad or engage in addictive patterns of behavior of being capable of developing a certain degree of self-insight do i believe they are there i think well speaking as an analytic philosopher under the premises of analytic idealism i would say it's a virtual statistical certainty that they are out there because what are the chances that we would have developed the perceptual apparatus that is required to pick out everything around zero that's not how evolution works that that's not that's not how stuff works so there are semi-autonomous psychic complexes up there which you could call individuated agents to some extent still part of this single course objectivity ultimately still part of the one but behaving as a distinct aspect of whatever is going on that have subtle bearing on on our conscious in their lives sometimes even less than subtle bearing on our conscious in their lives there are there is a tune called the collective shadow which can grip an entire country an entire civilization and on the other hand there are the archangels that can grip entire countries and entire civilizations as well and they are not us as individuals they are not us as egos even less but they are in us as core subjects core subjectivity so from that perspective i think unity is fundamental but in practice diversity is what life is about i know marcus if if you want to pipe in if you have something that you're that this is making you think about so one of the things that's coming across to me is the once we reach the limits of language as it were that we arrive at the series of paradoxes and i got the same impression whenever you were speaking with john verbaki that the nature of reality led suffered as a skin narrative pattern but also this known logical and collapse it into one is damaging and then sort of wanted to ask bernardo a bit about this as a scientist too the science itself even a point beyond itself in this kind of paradoxical way with things like heisenberg's uncertainty principle or goodells and complete theorem things like that and read in somebody like mcgilchrist's work it's the work that he seems to do on the brain even seems to suggest this where he's using the best science to point beyond science and he ends up resorting to things like music to conveys deepest reflections does that make sense and i wonder what you would think about that in philosophy there is a serious and significant school of thought that puts forward the notion that true paradoxes exist and they can be as trivial as language paradoxes such as the following statement this statement is false this is a true paradox because if this statement is true then it is false but it is false then it's true so this statement is either both or neither and the law of excluded middle one of the five axioms of aristotelian logic is out the window something as trivial as a phrase this statement is false is a true contradiction from that sense but it is a contradiction only under the axioms of aristotelian logic and namely the law of excluded middle the notion that something is either true or false never both and never neither but as every axiom of logic this too is a fundamentally arbitrary axiom we adopt the axioms because they seem to us to be self-evidently true but you cannot logically argue for the validity of logic without incurring circular reasoning or begging the question so i i take this notion seriously having said that i think abuse to science is proving that there are true contradictions in the world world are misleading at the best and probably flat out fallacious for instance this notion that particles can be waves or can be particles at the same time is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of quantum theory there is no such a thing as particles being waves and being particles at the same time the waves in question are models of probability distribution the particle itself isn't a wave and isn't a particle either what we are talking about is the probability distributions of making certain measurements and if you truly understand that then wave particle duality is not an instance of a true contradiction in the word in the world at all that that's based on very superficial misunderstanding of the science involved so and that's a pity that people do that because they don't need this misrepresentations and misunderstandings to make a strong case that aristotelian logic has brought us so far but cannot bring us further that we need to revise our basic axioms of logically logic particularly the law of excluded middle and get rid of it like a dutch philosopher called lautson brower proposed in the very early 20th century get rid of that axiom because it leads to ridiculous situations for instance let me give you an example because we think that everything is either true or false never both and never neither i can prove that a completely unknown and undefined thing exists even though i have never seen it even though i can't even describe it i can't say what it is but i can prove that it exists by proving that it cannot not exist now that's insane that's ridiculous that's taking our epistemology and projecting it onto the world as ontology it doesn't work to prove that something exists at the very minimum you have to describe precisely what it is that you're saying that exists but the law of excluded middle if it's taken into our axioms allows for something that i don't even describe to be proven to exist which is nonsensical so i i'm all for revising our logic and maybe adopting intuitionistic logic which is the technical term for for the logic proposed by lauten brower but i think it's fallacious to say that quantum mechanics proves that the world is illogical no it i think that's based on misunderstanding of quantum theory and what is your view on is it giga renser and people like that and his notion of unconscious intelligence bernardo have you come across much by him that kind of russian rationality beyond racialism which seems to suggest that for well one humans are not primarily rational and that's kind of smaller sense but also that we are in canary study impressions as if they could be reliably and rationally predicted i think that we can easily break patterns but different populations produce different candidate results and tests very economic professors and things like that because austin or choices are so hard to predict in part and multifaceted if we have this kind of say economic system built on these prior myths that were primarily rational in that criter sense and free choosing agents so then as long as we maintain that bias will we see these more impoverished results and misleading metrics then and i'm interested in harry that that's built into our institutions and do you see any examples that concern new year i'd prefer to call it spontaneous intelligence as opposed to unconscious intelligence when people refer to it as unconscious intelligence they are implicitly defining consciousness as meta-consciousness in other words the ability not only to experience but to know that you are experiencing that's meta consciousness and the denial of that people call loosely unconsciousness well in fact it's just a spontaneous intelligence is when you take several steps in your line of thinking that you are not explicitly aware of taking but those steps steps are still conscious you just don't know that you are experiencing them but you are experiencing them if you know what i mean so you could call these this form of reasoning spontaneous intelligence which is a form of intelligence that unfolds without being under the microscope of explicit introspection i do i believe this exists absolutely and the proof of it is the universe the universe is the product of the spontaneous intelligence of nature can start talking about the fine tuning and all that stuff although i find that stuff disconcerting and probably human projection is involved here but even if the order of the universe is a human projection and there is a very strong case to be made that it is and i personally believe that it is but even if it is that then then it's a projection of spontaneous human intelligence because we don't catch ourselves constructing the order of the universe if you know what i mean it's just there once i made an experiment i decided to i am i'm amateur chess player and no no i don't play in tournaments or anything i just have fun playing chess and i don't want to ever go beyond that but once i decided to do an experiment and play chess without what chess players call calculations which is the difference is the following sometimes you look at a position on the board and something in you knows how you should go forward what your next move should be what you should try to do but you don't know why you know that you don't know why you think that this is the right move and what you do is you start calculating you start playing out the moves in the imaginary board inside your head often you will catch chess players like this they are not napping it's just that they are calculating 20 moves ahead and if they're watching the board in front of them it disturbs those calculations because they are seeing pieces not moving while they have to see the pieces moving now and the board the physical board keeps on bringing them back to that position doesn't let them calculate or you often see chess players doing like this nakamura which is an american chess player he's often like this and you're like what does he see in the ceiling no he sees the chess board 20 moves ahead that's calculating i decided to play three chess matches without calculating just following my intuition and the results were well above my yellow rating i had a much higher score than normal and then i started believing in this and i played the fourth game totally spontaneous and i lost miserably [music] and what what i'm trying to say by this is the following spontaneous intelligence definitely exists it's definitely very powerful but if you indulge in it's too much you can step on mines it can go wrong so the ideal situation is how to find a balance between explicit intelligence in which you take your steps of reasoning explicitly and you cross check them and the holistic approach of spontaneous intelligence which is not focused on discrete steps but focused on seeing the whole pattern at once finding that balance is is the key to being successful in many aspects of life not only at playing chess no i i think i'm i really i i find it very interesting what you're talking about because you can find examples you find types of people too types of people that have followed that spontaneous you know and for example the franciscans for a short part of their existence they would get up in the morning they would just turn on their on themselves and then whatever direction they would stop they would just go in that direction and then and then they would just think you know without food without anything and just encounter whatever it is that they encountered you know and so like ronaldo said it probably led to some great things but it also led to some pretty some darker like moments like because i know people like that they they in christian terms people say something like we follow the holy spirit like the holy spirit guides us this kind of intuition that they sometimes it goes great and sometimes it goes horribly like just worse than any i mean it's like if you get up in the very worst place so so i kind of understand that can i make a quick comment on that channel just yeah just to make sure that people understand my position i don't think the holy spirit ever gets it wrong no i know of course not no i agree but you know people just go with their no no no without that's the point yeah when it goes wrong it's not the spontaneous intelligence of nature that failed it's when we take ourselves to be the subtle intelligence of nature yeah you see what i mean yeah it's a very very subtle state of mind to be in tune with the subtle intelligence of nature that underlies us and everything else and believe your own yeah so don't you think though in in case of in k in terms of the chest that that the training that you gave yourself let's say for many years i imagine playing chess is also the proper body in which to maybe let that intuition go because if you just get someone who's played chess once in their life and say yeah just just follow your intuition they might not make it very far like there's there's as if there's any you have to i mean imagine like a a sports player too you you play your ten thousand hours or whatever and then at some point you stop thinking you just act because it's so integrated in you that it's almost leading itself into into realizations i get that when i'm carving now when i'm carving carving for so long that i i just just go and i don't and i i just experience this this flow of movement where i don't have to think about what i'm doing it just happens i think in practice you're you're right training is what allows us to sort of synthesize to that frequency that carrier wave of subtle intelligence in nature if you're not trained you can't connect to it but i think and now i will go now our roles will be reversed stop being the analytic philosopher now i think we are lying on top of a vein of subtle intelligence that is not ours at all and it doesn't depend on training at all it's just very very it's extraordinarily difficult one to synchronize with it you know to to resonate with it and two once you do resonate to distinguish that resonance from your own like my fourth game of chess i thought oh i can win everything if i don't think i'll just play the first move that comes to my mind and boom then i lost because i mistook my own for the subtle spontaneous intelligence of nature but i i will tell you another part of the story that i was not planning to tell and i don't know how you're going to judge it but several years ago as a philosopher of mine i thought that it would be an accept unacceptable for me to talk about mind and consciousness without studying my own mind and consciousness in every way available and one way available in my country where it's legal is to use psychedelics there was another time in which i played those games of chess during the re-entry of a psychedelic trip and i don't know whether you have ever taken psychedelics you probably don't need if you leave a symbolic symbolic life you probably don't need there i have i had a very very hard mind so i i needed to take a hammer to it to sort of open myself up to certain things so i did in need it has been used for it's a phase of my life that is behind me now i don't feel compelled to do it again but at the time i did it has been very helpful but one thing you anybody who has done psychedelics know is that during the re-entry when you're sort of beginning to reconstitute your daily self your mind sort of reconstituting its narratives reconstituting its cognitive associations that web of associations that gives it a sense of personal identity during that transition you there's no way other way of putting this you can't think straight you're very open as if you weren't dreaming when you're not thinking straight your the imagery of a dream unfolds spontaneously and that characterizes that phase of a trip when you begin to come back you can take certain decisions there there is a sober part of your mind standing behind you but you can't think logically in other words you you can't calculate in a game of chance and i played games of chess in that state and i won all of them and if you ask me was that based on my training no because that that mind standing behind me was saying to me i have absolutely no idea why i want to play this move no idea whatsoever it looks like a completely absurd move to me why am i doing this now 15 moves later to be clear why i absolutely needed to play that move and i knew it was that because of training no i think it was a very very difficult subtle state of mind in which you plug in to a collective stream of spontaneous intelligence in the mind of nature and if you plug into that for briefly before your ego reasserts itself and mistakes it for its own that brief window of time you you you are manifesting spontaneous intelligence that has absolutely nothing to do with your training look at that let me be more objective now there are people who suffer from so-called acquired savant syndrome in which you suffer head trauma damage to your brain ordinary brain function is no impact it's damaged and they become geniuses like they can do enormous mathematical calculations instantly as fast as a computer and if people ask them how did you know the result they they will invariably say i don't know it just came to me i looked at it and i knew the answer they don't take explicit metacognitive steps of reasoning to arrive at the solution to a mathematical problem you just do it and and that is a possibility that's a capability that is unlocked by damage brain damage lightning strikes to the head uh head trauma from car accidents even the progression of dementia can unlock a quiet savon so how do you make sense of that i would say the only way to make sense of that is that damage is so specific they got so lucky in the kind of damage they suffered that instead of the damage impairing their normal metacognitive intelligence or in addition to impairing their normal metacognitive intelligence it unlocked a part of the human mind that blocks out the spontaneous intelligence of nature in order to benefit a metacognitive intelligence in other words deliberate reasoning deliberate thinking deliberate decision making which probably had all kinds of evolutionary advantages because it's based on the notion of an individual self that needs to survive and and that somehow obfuscates the spontaneous intelligence of nature that is always at at the the foundational level of ourselves and the whole of nature and and when that is unlocked by of all things trauma damage then you see through spontaneous intelligence at work that has nothing to do with training required savant didn't train yeah didn't train musical composition they didn't train mathematics they didn't train any of that yeah no i i've seen the examples that this was one guy who all of a sudden could see he saw geometric shapes everywhere like you could see extremely complex geometric patterns underlying reality and would draw them just freehand they've got these complex geometric patterns so i know i i seems like you're there's something there for sure i i have a question for you because it's something that i've heard you talk about and i hear you you brought it back again in this conversation which is let's say the difference between cognition and metacognition and let's say the fact that we are meta conscious or self-conscious do you perceive or do you do you think that there are other beings that are that have that that characteristic or do you think that at least at least as you know only humans are self-conscious i think to the degree that humans are self-conscious or metacognitive only humans are i think there are and there's enough evidence to very seriously contemplate the possibility that cetaceans and pachytherms and perhaps some other higher primates primates are to some extent matter conscious but not to the extent that we are and the reason i say this is the following in the evolution of meta-consciousness there is a point in which you cross over a crucial boundary and that's the boundary of instinct when you become extremely meta-conscious you stop listening to instinct you stop listening to the spontaneous intelligence of nature and you will listen only to your deliberate planning your deliberate action taking and that unplugs us from the web of instinct that keeps nature balanced and that's why we risk destroying the planet in ourselves while destroying the ecosystems of the planet we'll never destroy the planet give it a million years and it will be full of trees and animals again but we would destroy the present ecosystem why because we have become alienated from the ebb and flow of instinct given our extremely high level of metacognition and even if cetaceans and pachyderms have a degree of metacognition it clearly has not yet been enough to unplug them from instinct otherwise they would be building technology by now okay and so so i imagine that when you look at the story of the fall of adam and eve you see that in that story which is the shift between cognition and metacognition and the the knowledge of good and evil let's say yeah that's when we were expelled from the garden what a beautiful metaphor for when you are expelled from the web of instinct i mean the the story in genesis it raises the hairs in my body when i think about that story because the level of insight in that story if you have the eyes to read it and you don't cartoonize it by taking it literally the the depth of insight there is is amazing and when you think sorry if i go on a tirade stop me if if i shouldn't but when you when you think of how long it took us to see the truth in that story and how much effort it took us it it raises the question how did the jews exiled in in babylon two and a half thousand years ago come up with that stuff how on earth could they i mean it it's astounding only very recently when we've discovered that the rise of symbolic thinking in humans occurred only thirty to fifty thousand years ago about 150 000 maybe 250 000 after whatever genetic mutations happened that made us anatomically modern humans we have existed as an anatomically more than humans in you know biologically modern humans for two to three hundred thousand years but only thirty to fifty thousand years ago did we begin to think symbolically in other words did we develop metacognition which is astounding because whatever mutation has led to our unique ability to think symbolically happened and was fixed in the genome thousands of years before it was of any use how on earth this contradicts evolution in a certain way and there is a famous guy ian tattersall the curator of the american history of the american museum of natural history he is on record saying in his book masters of the planet he's saying the only reason we have to believe that such a thing the fall that such a thing could ever possibly have happened is that it did happen otherwise it would be reasonable it's beyond implausible it's downright ridiculous that it could happen and and the jews excited in barcelona in babylon knew it two and a half thousand years ago that that boggles my mind i don't know about yours but you know i i just i become disorientated with it yeah well i mean because you see for according to the to genesis we didn't fall into humanity we felt as humans that's an important differentiation which is now what we know scientifically was the case sorry sorry to interrupt you no no no no that's fine i so so this is i mean this is really where my question is leading to this this problem because i've shown you even now you were talking about the unconsciousness and you're talking about say the ground of being or the ground of subjectivity as being an unconscious and so you seem to be you seem to not like the idea that meta consciousness is so let me rephrase this so there's a sense in which you see this in the mystical fathers you see this in san ephraim and and several of the church fathers where they talk about how the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil the reason why it made us fall was because we were not ready for it and that it is ultimately a blessing but it's a blessing that had to be prepared you could say and so either either adam and eve would have sometimes adam and eve represented as children you see that in saint irenaeus for example and that that this fall is necessary for their it's like an educational process in which they will then come back up on the other side as having integrated both the consciousness of good and evil and the garden and the image of that of course is something like the heavenly jerusalem we see that at the end of the bible and so there's a sense in which at least in this type of vision that conscious meta consciousness is what brings about the fall but is ultimately which actually makes us similar to god and and because i've heard you talk about god more as this kind of unconscious or basic consciousness that doesn't have metacognition so i was wondering if what your thought is on that which is that at least in the christian understanding and i think in many other religious understandings the idea that god is unconscious or is just this this very very basic form of conscience that doesn't have meta consciousness seems to imply that meta consciousness is is a degrading from that or that it's a fall again that it's only a fall or that it's it's a it's a that it's a less it's less than what where it comes from well there's a lot sorry in fact there jonathan go back to to my true story and how i played chess extremely well while lacking meta consciousness because i was under the effect of drugs if you regard it from that perspective meta consciousness was limiting because a limited but deliberate form of intelligence meta-conscious intelligence obfuscated a spontaneous much broader but less reliable form of intelligence in other words the spontaneous intelligence of nature but the guy who won those games was the spontaneous intelligence of nature yeah unobfuscated by my explicit deliberate reasoning from that perspective it is a step backwards because it contracts intelligence but whatever stays within the field of metacognition which is a contracted field vastly contracted field it's like looking down a microscope you only see a tiny part of the world but that tiny part now is visible so you are as far as that tiny part is concerned it's better you see it more clearly it's like looking down the microscope you see one square millimeters but you see it more clearly it is better but it's worse in the sense that you don't see anything around it anymore and to me that's meta consciousness and that's why meta consciousness was favored by evolution because as far as survival is concerned you only need to look at the tiny subset of existence that is in your immediate surroundings because that's what has a direct immediate bearing on your survival and your ability to reproduce so meta consciousness is like a microscope it blinds you to nearly everything but it makes you see much more clearly whatever remains within its field it obfuscates everything else but it amplifies what it focuses on so it's both a step forward and a step backward now in the bible it's written that the serpent tells eve that after she takes a bite from the fruit of the tree of knowledge she will be like god now you may interpret that as god being meta conscious but i interpret it differently and i'll show you with you my own interpretation the key characteristic of the deity is the ability to create realities that's that ultimately is the single most defining feature of the divine mind is the ability to create realities a non-metacognitive mind cannot create realities because it's always in the present that's the eastern advaita and buddhist approaches you're always in the present in other words you're always in the world created for you by the divinity but when you metacognize and you identify yourself as a subject of your experiences as opposed to the experiences themselves metacognition is what allows you to say i have hunger as opposed to i am the hunger if you're always in the present you are the hunger body you don't have hunger you are the hunger you are the world created for you but when you become metacognitive you invent futures and you manipulate pasts you create worlds you create realities and i think it is in that sense that eve would become like god having taken a bite from the fruit of metacognition and that is a fall in in the same way that looking down a microscope is a fall it's a contraction it obfuscates everything else you become blind to everything but it is a step forward in the sense that it allows you to see that tiny subset more clearly so have you ever thought about creation that way which is that if you read the creation account in genesis you have at the outset you have you know heaven and earth the earth is chaos and void emptiness and void and then god creates names at the outset and if you see the way it works is that god says let there be light and then god sees and god says it is good it is good right and so there is that narrowing it seems like that narrowing is actually part of the the separation of phenomena itself because the the the the the the the un completely un bridled potential or just like you know the the un un anything that has no identity yet that is completely just potential is not in you can't inhabit that like even when you took your psychedelics you didn't if you if you had well you i mean imagine that some people say they do reach that point of complete you know but then you would you couldn't stay like that for you we couldn't stay there for very long right because you would probably just die of hunger at some point or you would you wouldn't but there has to be this focus where there's a contraction and pointing and then a recognizing of the good so so that's why i that's why i mean i really like the idea that you're saying that there's a sense in which meta consciousness is part of the creation of worlds i seem i think i see that in the in the genesis creation narrative itself i will agree with you i'm not going to interpret evidence differently just to fit my narrative so i will agree with you that that part of genesis where god passes value judgments on his creation is an indication a indication of metacognition because value judgments can only be passed through metacognition that's why animals are amoral they are not metacognizant so they can't pass value judgments they they carry no moral responsibility we do and the bible does suggest that the creation the creator divinity was not a conscious in so far as it could could pass value judgment so i'll give you two answers based on pure a purely analytic approach in natural sciences and no empirical evidence rational thinking i would say we have every reason to believe that the broader mind of nature mind at large is not matter conscious why because meta-consciousness seems to have been something that evolved at great cost through eons of evolution by natural selection it seems to be an ability that forms in response to a challenging environment and an environment that requires appropriate and timely responses to environmental challenges and and therefore that narrowing of metacognition that allows for a more efficient localized narrow but much more efficient and clear response was favored by natural selection so if meta consciousness is something that evolved then it was not there in the beginning and the divine mind or the mind of nature that especially unbound field of subjectivity that underlies all nature did not have to put up with the challenges of a local ecosystem so it wouldn't have meta-consciousness another reason is we don't seem to see meta consciousness in the simpler forms of life on this planet the evolutionarily speaking earlier forms of life there is a clear correlation between more evolved species and increasing meta consciousness pachyderm cetaceans and higher primates primates are highly evolved species if you look at paramecium or paramecia which are single-celled organisms that go after food and run away from danger even though they don't have a nervous system they react instinctively crocodiles are very instinctual creatures you can tell precisely how many inches you have to be close to a crocodile before it tries to laundry and new it's not a deliberating meta meta consciousness so from an analytic and empirical perspective i would say you we have every reason to think that meta consciousness is evolved and it's not there from the beginning it's not in the mind of nature it's not in the mind of god which doesn't mean that nature isn't intelligent because spontaneous intelligent isn't metacognitive and spontaneous intelligence although doesn't amplify things it has a very broad view it's the telescope as opposed to the microscope it doesn't discern the microscopic details but it sees a lot more now if i ignore analytic philosophy and natural sciences and we speak purely from religious scripture and religious insight then i would have to acknowledge that there are plenty of suggestions throughout the religious traditions of this world this world that the creator divinity even if it's not the ultimate divinity like in gnosticism the creator divinity was meta-conscious that seems to be suggested throughout do i think there is a possibility well certainly it is a possibility but in my mind it's a possibility that would require the following it would require this reality to be a deliberately created reality and not a spontaneous naturalistic unfolding of what is not a product of nature but an artificial creation with rules set in a premeditated premeditated way for a deliberate purpose in other words a kind of theater that was set up for a purpose by a meta conscious intelligence that's what it would require do i see external empirical evidence for it no not do i see conceptual reasons to entertain the possibility no none do i have intuitions every now and then that resonate with this possibility yes i do yeah and so if we if we take that again so let's say we go back to this notion of of metacognition as being in some ways a fall and a narrow way but there is also a manner in which we act once we have it we act in relationship to that that is that for example spontaneous intelligence a berserker has spontaneous intelligence right that's actually a good example like the berserker enters into a state of flow where they can kill indeterminately with a strength of of 10 men and and it's a it's an ecstatic moment but but so so there's a sense with that natural intelligence or that that spontaneous intelligence that we see in animals does not have this does not have a a sense of the good at least not the way that that we do yeah and so and so once we have that then we act that's why it's also the knowledge of good and evil that's why at least in scripture it it is related to it is a fall but it is also an entering into something which can bring more let's say we value judgments more yes exactly and so yeah and so so that's why i because the the thing i'm worried about in the way you describe it is that if if we if we don't let's say i'll say i'll say it in very in very gross religious terms like if we don't have a god that's good then we have a problem down the line which is that at some point there's no justification there's no ultimate justification for the superiority of our of our ethical intuitions to the intuition that would drive a berserker to rape and pillage and kill everybody in a village you know and so where does the where does the sense of of the superiority of one over the other like what is that even where does that come from most of what you you will see or hear me argue is what i cannot give for based on analytic reasoning and evidence and if you put me against the wall and a gun to my head and say okay now make your best bet about what's going on if you're wrong i'm gonna shoot you then that's the position i would hold the position informed by analytic reasoning and an empirical objective evidence but i entertain other possibilities in my mind which i don't talk about because i can't argue for them i cannot write a book by saying well i have an intuition that it isn't that yeah okay yeah thank you very much but why do i care right why would they really care so i i would try to defend the point you're making from an analytic perspective which doesn't mean that i completely reject the point you're making okay i'll just try to do my best to defend it from an analytic perspective i think the responsibility for morals for morality in a naturalistic universe in other words a universe that unfolds spontaneously because it is what it is as opposed to an artificially set up environment that follows a premeditated plan in a naturalistic universe the responsibility for moral judgment is stronger for us then it is in a universe created by a meta-conscious divinity that has its own moral book because in the latter case we are just ignorant somebody has the the right answers so the responsibility lies more with that entity which then raises questions like if god knows what's good why does it allow the berserker to do what it does who has ultimate moral responsibility for the berserker doing what he does the berserker you and i or the god who created this whole thing and set it all up who has the moral responsibility for what's happening in ukraine right now in a universe that was meta-consciously and in a premedited premeditated way set up by a thinking self-conscious divinity is it you and i is it putting or is it the divinity that allowed for a putin to exist in in this reality in a naturalistic universe universe the responsibility is ours including the berserker and now you might ask well how do i know who has the best moral call the berserker or me there is no outside answer for that question that's the price you pay in a naturalistic universe nietzsche has been brilliant in the late 19th century picking apart christian morals and to this day it's difficult to refute some of the things he says from pure purely logical and evidence-based perspective and that was the genius of nietzsche that he could just trounce things that seem to be morally obvious to us and and and and actually defend the very opposite you know the superman the the morals of the strong as opposed of as opposed to slave morality so the answer is i don't have an answer jonathan i just would defend the notion that whatever the answer is the responsibility for finding the answer is ours we carry the ultimate moral responsibility in a naturalistic universe that has no pre-written book of moral codes because people tend to think that unless morals are etched in stone before the rise of human beings then morals don't exist the moral responsibility doesn't exist unless it's grounded on something prior and external i would argue the opposite it's the very fact that in a naturalistic universe there is no tables of moral codes it's that very fact that imbues in us the ultimate supreme moral responsibility to the the responsibility for discerning between good and evil the responsibility for reacting to what putin is doing now so it's not a satisfactory answer but it's the best no no no i but i i understand and i think that you you obviously put your finger on the most difficult question like the the problem of evil or the problem of suffering is definitely always the one that makes all religious people you know stand back and and and and wonder and and question because that is a definitely a that is definitely something that the way that christians would would defend the the the answer would be that it is something that is related to the fall somehow that there's a relationship to the fall that we have an intuition in us that there should things should be different okay at least frame it that way that things that there's something awry about the way things are there's something which is not aiming properly towards the good that isn't properly aligned towards the good and we represent it in this in this story of of the fall and so there is a sense in which the the fact that things are not good is due to is actually due to us so i i do think that in the also in the christian cosmology like the real christians cosmology if there's a sense in which their responsibility does come back onto us because although it's not you can't it's not something that you can describe scientifically because it if you try to do it it gets weird but that intuition is real the intuition that something is wrong isn't right and and we have the the responsibility to aim ourselves towards the good and that that is the best thing we can do to to reshape the world let's say and if we're willing to to end it of course the image of christ ends up being the ultimate image in the christian cosmology of of that it's actually through self-sacrifice that that this will happen that if you that if you are able to give yourself to the good then that's the best thing you can do but i agree that that for many people that that's not enough especially in a in a scientific frame because they'll say things like like you know things have been dying and eating each other and killing each other for millions and millions of years before humans woke up let's say but nonetheless i think that if we understand it more as as an experience i would say that would be the the best way that i would frame it there is something you said earlier that there is some theology suggesting that the fall in and of itself was not bad it it was the timing it was too early it was before we were prepared for it right we're eating or eating the fruit was before we were ready yeah if we interpret the fall as the fall into metacognitions in metacognition then i would say empirically that's obviously true we broke our relationship with the harmony of instinct before we were prepared and what happened was that we became able to develop technology because of metacognition but without the empathy required to apply that technology wisely as opposed to that very narrowly contracted field of personal benefit which is exactly what we leverage when we use technology so it's yeah the fall happened before it was a good move on the part of nature or on the part of the divinity it was too early and the evidence for that is life as we leave it today and the risks that we bring to ourselves and everything else that lives on the surface of this planet the fall is nature's biggest gamble if it was a gamble or nature's potential biggest mistake if it was a mistake and from that perspective i think the language of we are born in sin makes sense not in a literal sense but to your born in sinning so far as we are born metacognizant having said that and while acknowledging that metacognition is is the the founding head of suffering psychological suffering there is this other thing that is horrible and doesn't depend on metacognition at spain and and nature has copious amounts of it you know i i always refer to this documentary that impressed me very much a few years ago a pride of lions isolated a grown elephant from from its group and brought it down and ate this elephant from the hind legs upwards for six hours before the elephant passed out that's nature you know earthworms are being cut alive into wiggling pieces by ants in your backyard every day that's not good if you ask me if i were the divinity and if i were meta conscious i wouldn't do that on the other hand and that's when i surrender to everything you said what we consider good or bad is largely dependent on scope if you don't have a broad enough scope to see how what seems very bad locally is automatically good then you can't make a wise moral judgment the philosophers have a problem that illustrates this the problem is the following there is a trend coming and there is a y split on the railway and on the one side of the split there is a guy tied down to the rails and on the other side there are four guys tied down to the rails and the railway setup in such a way that the train is going to go to the one guy as opposed to the far and it's going to kill that one guy but the other four will survive and you have your hands on the lever that allows so sorry the train would go to the four guys would kill the four guys if you don't do anything and the one guy would survive you have the hands on the lever and you can switch the rail line in such a way that the train kills only the one and not the four yeah but now you're killing it now you are the one and you only see you you don't see the other four he only sees himself and you with your hands on the lever and he sees you moving the liver so the train goes to you to him from his narrow scope you have committed and in an unfathomable act of evil but from a broader scope you've taken the decision that one should take so who are we to judge who are we to judge whether that elephant shouldn't have suffered for six hours i have to i have to go but i i love this guy thank you so much for this conversation bernardo i i think like i still feel like we're always just scratching the surface though that's the thing we do a third round i enjoy it very much i really enjoy it i appreciate it and i'd definitely be willing to to go for another round so thanks so much and thanks marcus for organizing this well thank you jonathan thank you bernardo it's been a pleasure to listen to you both for the most part again and yeah i'd love to do it again with you guys of course online number one and number two i was thinking if either of you are interested in coming to ireland they say next year for an impression event that would be fantastic i know we had a great event recently with paul vandertley and paul kings north and that so god willing we can make it happen and i don't know if you have any interest in that i would definitely be i mean i'll be probably traveling a few times to the uk the next year and so if we can organize it i would love that i know how bernardo's probably super busy too but if it could work i'll be there i i cannot promise i would even say it's unlikely i get them i would say i have to deal with lots of requests yeah which is a great honor and it's not something i complain about at all it's humbling but every time i have to jump on a plane it's not only the time of the event but two days before and two days after yeah and that can be very tricky so i'm not going to promise you on the other hand one of the holes in my life is i have never visited ireland have gone around the world multiple times and i haven't been directly acquainted with the green fields of ireland so who knows no problem thank you so much again gents and have a lovely evening god bless you thank you guys all right
