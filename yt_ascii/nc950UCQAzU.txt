okay if you've seen this meme before i'm sure 
that's how a lot of us have felt the past year   when or the past few years really technology 
is continuing to change at such a quick pace   it's hard if not impossible to keep up with it 
alongside that though i often find that myself and   others i'm including myself in there too because 
i think we all do this to some degree when this   new technology or maybe it's not new but it starts 
getting hype we went from web3 being super popular   and you know getting paid these crazy salaries to 
now everyone's switching into ai and that's where   to be it can be overwhelming do i go in that area 
do i focus on that direction is it going to just   be is it actually going to stay a trend or is it 
just a hype there's a lot of questions and a lot   of things to unpack here and it also brings up 
the question am i going to become irrelevant in   this video i'm going to share with you different 
insights and advice backed up by data that i have   around the big question which is how to stay 
relevant in the tech industry this question is   more important than ever as tech continues to grow 
at a faster pace how do we stay relevant how do we   stay in demand where should we put our focus and 
our learnings if you haven't already make sure to   hit that subscribe button for more tech encoding 
related videos and let's get into it [music]   speaking of staying relevant and keeping up 
to date with all these tech trends i want to   share with you one of the tools that i've been 
using for my email automation collaboration and   getting statistics behind it mailjet mailjet is 
an easy to use marketing platform for designing   sending and monitoring email marketing campaigns 
also including newsletters and automated emails   so whether you are a solo entrepreneur or 
you lead a collaborative team mailjet has   a drag and drop email editor that helps you 
create beautiful emails that connect with new   and existing customers i know for me the drag 
and drop editor has been a huge game changer i   don't have to go in and code anything it's very 
easy to use and to kind of expand on that point   you can create and send beautiful emails without 
having to touch a single line of code so the email   editor makes it easy to create engaging email 
campaigns newsletters and also automated emails   in literally minutes also too they have a ton of 
different pre-designed templates so you can focus   more time on different tasks versus the design 
of the templates what should i use for me that   has really helped and you know i love numbers 
so they also have statistics you can actually   get actionable insights to create engaging 
campaigns so you can track the performance   of your email marketing campaigns in real time 
see what works what doesn't work and learn from   that two other things i want to highlight one 
being segmentation so you can send customized   emails to your customers that they actually 
want to open so so with mailjet segmentation   feature you can send specific and targeted 
messages based on each customer's interests   attributes and behaviors so you don't have to 
send a blanket email versus you can actually   send customized emails to different segmentations 
and also do automation you know anything automate   that i can automate i am here for so you can 
streamline your email workflow so you can engage   with new and existing customers at the right 
moment with the right message so maybe you are   like me and you're managing your own business 
while working at a company you can't be doing   both at the same time so this is a huge feature 
to automate emails they can arrive at the inboxes   when you actually want them to thank 
you again to mailjet for sponsoring this   video i love you and i also link below down 
below so you can try them out for free today and when it comes to developing your technical 
skill set we often think about our well our   technical skills which makes sense the problem 
is a lot of times we put too much focus on just   the technical aspect what we should be learning 
next where the trends are going what technology is   going to be in demand and in turn we forget about 
the importance of our soft skills developing soft   skills such as communication collaboration 
negotiation leadership these are all skills   that will help you work better in teams and at 
the end of the day i really truly believe that   yes technical skills are so important especially 
if you're obviously in a technical role but   regardless of that it's important to not neglect 
the soft skills all right we're heading to my   co-working space need to get out of the house 
today i'm feeling a little a little housebound   but at the end of the day people hire people 
and i know some of us or sometimes we go why   do i have to focus on soft skills i just want i 
got in tech so i could focus on technical skills   or maybe you're someone who's very focused on soft 
skills you're thinking why do i need to learn or   understand the basics even of technical skills 
we all have our strengths and our weaknesses   and the reality is though people hire people i 
can't emphasize that enough it's so important   because it might not seem fair it might not seem 
right but a lot of people would rather work with   good people who can learn technical skills than 
people who have these great technical skills   but not the ability to communicate to collaborate 
now let's get a little bit into the data into the   numbers well for one thing according to forbes 
the demand for cloud computing engineers will   increase by at least 26 by 2023. this year today 
and the jobs for artificial intelligence could   grow up by 28 this year those are big numbers 
now why am i sharing them with you what relevance   does it have to do it's kind of round of tiff 
well the relevance is this i could continue to   go on in this list for different roles in tech 
that are continuing to go in demand and increase   so why am i sharing these with you because i 
want to put your mind at ease that you don't   need to necessarily chase the latest and greatest 
technology in order to be in demand i just listed   two completely different areas that are continuing 
to grow in demand and i mean we could go on let's   see here what else do we have roles related to 
big data analytics may increase by 39 percent   stated by forbes again continuing to grow and 
grow so there are so many options and the last   thing i want you to do is as you are seeing 
especially right now with ai or with web3 as   you're seeing these things become so hyped and a 
lot of times for good reason i'm not saying there   isn't reasoning behind them but don't just keep on 
pivoting from one to the other rather stay focused   on your path now for example let's give a good 
example as to how you can continue to stay in   demand say you are a web developer i'm just using 
this as an example but this could be related to   really marketing to any kind of skills you have 
you're going you're focused on your path well the   best way to kind of continue to be in demand other 
than networking and building those soft skills and   relationships is just get curious now what do i 
mean by this all right we are off even based on   those stats and numbers i just shared with you 
it should be even more reason to realize that   maybe the best way to stay relevant and stay in 
demand your job your career in demand is to do   this opposite of what everyone else is doing so 
what do i mean by that the more i think about it   and the more i strategically think about my 
career i realize that rather than just going   with the trends and focusing on what everyone 
else is doing the problem with that is you're   never going to actually become an expert in any 
area you're going to try out this trend and then   you're quickly going to realize there's a new 
trend coming around you know web3 ai whatever is   next and you're never going to actually become an 
expert in the things that you're learning there's   no problem with being a generalist but if you're 
a generalist you need to be able to pick up new   things very quickly and that's the purpose you're 
purposefully a generalist if you're just picking   up new things because you want a higher salary 
it's not going to work or at least in the long   term anyways one of the best things that i really 
like to do is really helped me thus far in my   career is being open to evolving and growing and 
being really open to new technologies but having   a short-term or medium-term plan so meaning the 
next five years what does that look like for you   are you staying at the same company you're at 
and obviously this can change as you grow and   you your experience has changed but having a rough 
timeline and then as these new technologies come   up it's less tempting to be like i need to enter 
into companies around ai or i need to enter into   companies around x y and z whatever it is but 
staying focused on your plan because in turn   it will give you time first of all to see how 
these trends pan out the other thing we'll do   too is position yourself as an expert position 
yourself as an expert in whatever role you are   in industry or in in tech or sub industry what 
would you call it niche industry i don't know   and it will just give you more credibility okay 
you know what i'm gonna film the rest of this   video in my car i feel like we're intimate we got 
a good vibe going on let's just like wrap it up in   this way one thing i wanted to touch on though 
is there's no right or wrong way to stay relevant   and that's why i'm not providing a specific 
prescription you could say like if you do this   and then you do that you will stay relevant but 
it's more so about your mindset and i hope that   really came through through this video is it's 
less about okay checking off these boxes i did   this step now i will be in demand and your mindset 
of first of all taking a step back and looking at   the bigger picture of all these trends coming up 
second of all yes following the data following the   numbers i shared some stats around cloud around 
data analysts there's so much more out there as   to where the trends have been consistent for a 
long time and where the demand will continue to   go but it doesn't mean you need to today pick 
up a cloud computing course or pick up a data   analyst course if you're not interested in it you 
know stay focused into what you are interested in   what you are working on and then maybe pick 
up some learnings as you go maybe it'd be 10   minutes a day maybe 10 minutes a week and 5 know 
what that thing is that you are really passionate   about and grow in that direction i think that's 
really important to note otherwise you're always   going to be chasing the latest and greatest trend 
and in turn just get nowhere what does that say   a dog chasing its tail i think it is i don't know 
he might correct me on that i hope you really   found this video helpful i just wanted to share 
my thoughts around it and because i got really   sucked into when these trends come up focusing on 
okay now i need to learn how to code like to be a   blockchain builder now i need to learn how to be 
ai specialist ai i'm really interested in though   not just because of the trend but just i have 
been for a while but regardless find out what   you're passionate about focus tune out the rest 
of the noise and also to gotta touch on it again   remember to network and also use your soft 
skills just be a good be a good person be a   good team player don't just rely on your technical 
skills all right everyone i need to go get some   work done all right i hope you enjoyed this video 
covering all the ways to really stay relevant and   in demand in the tech industry and i think it's 
important to highlight there is no just one way   but it's whatever way works best for you this 
looks different for everyone and i really hope   this video also put your mind at ease that there 
is nothing to worry about continue to be a forever   learner i think i see that in like so many of 
my videos but because it's so true continue to   upskill you're going to be fine don't you know 
spend all your waking hours or even your late   nights learning new things it's not about that 
it's about being open to technology as it comes   your way being open to learning building those 
relationships and you will get there alright   friends i hope you enjoyed this video make
