you've probably already heard a ton about google's new pixel fault so i'm gonna keep it simple we're gonna unbox the phone and i'm gonna try to answer the question is it worth it so taking the lid off the first thing you're gonna see is both smartphones that have just been announced the pixel 4 and the pixel 4 x l and below that a compartment containing both retail packages but also a whole bunch of other google goodies the retail packaging the box you'd get if you went into a store and bought the pixel 4 it's pretty nice it feels high-quality sturdy and minimalistic and if we slip that lid off it's pretty standard stuff but three things to note you get a usb a 2 usbc adapter which just means you can quickly transfer stuff from your old phone by cable you also get a usb c 2 usbc cable to charge this phone and below that an' watt fast charger in terms of the goodies that came alongside this there were four little google branded packets and so opening the top one turns out it's a fortune cookie and within about five minutes i'd eaten all four and so below that there were pop sockets which have these little sticky pads and you stick them onto the back of the phone and they become a holder or a stand there's also a star map symbolizing the new astrophotography feature which i have played around with and i do have some thoughts on but finally in this unboxing experience we've got some google branded stickers so there are six important characteristics of these new phones we've got design display camera software the new motion sense system and finally value is it actually worth it so design and i don't really need to tell you that google has taken a new direction here this is one of the first phones with a square camera bump and it's got a matte rear finish combined with matte black sides i'm a fan i could definitely see some people thinking it looks a bit like a toy especially with the bright orange finish and colored power key but it doesn't feel like one we're still talking metal and glass construction and the finish makes life a lot easier when it comes to keeping the phone looking clean plus everything from the body to the buttons are super solid and they've managed to build in ip68 water resistance as well as wireless charging there's no headphone jack but on balance i think they've made a lot of good decisions with the design and that leads us onto the front where the interesting design choices continue instead of the knotch they had last year google has opted for a pretty mass if top bezel primarily to fit all the sensors needed for their new motion sentence technology which i'll come to it's a bold move i don't think the phones look bad from the front but at the same time it's side-by-side with some of the other devices released this year there is a risk of the pixels looking a little 2017 but there is no doubt that the display panel itself is good this is the second key point you get a full hd or quad hd + oled display depending on which phone you go for and more importantly these are ninety hertz panels which gives them this extra touch of responsiveness and google has also managed to somewhat sidestep the extra battery drain this can cause on a normal 90 hertz panel the screen just refreshes and ninety times a second regardless of what you're actually doing on it whereas on the pixel for its contextual it depends on first of all what application you're in but also if you're looking at the phone the pixel for is aware of what your eyes are paying attention to and we'll adjust frame rate accordingly you're getting a good panel - brightness hdr support color accuracy an a+ viewing experience but just not the largest displays out there v4 has a 5.7 inch panel and the xl model is 6.3 so in terms of screen size they're both smaller than their iphone counterparts ok so the cameras on this phone are quite possibly the most hyped feature ever since the pixel to this line of phones has been well regarded as producing the best images on a smartphone and so with this kind of expectation in mind i'm part really impressed but also slightly disappointed the disappointment comes from the hardware the main new addition is a 2 x optical zoom camera which combined with google's super resume you should be getting crisp shots at even 5 times magnification and that's great but i would have loved to see an ultra wide camera here we've had them on devices as cheap as $300 and it really would have added a massive amount of flexibility to this setup on top of that part of me was hoping for a sensor upgrade but the main camera is basically the same as last time on the other hand the magic happens in the software and there are some things i just can't wait to spend more time with the pixel falls more powerful chip compared to last year means images process in almost real time the high dynamic range or used to seeing only after you've taken a shot is now visible whilst taking it and this allows you to do something even cooler on tap on screen brings up two sliders one for brightness as usual but also now want to adjust the exposure of dark areas so all of a sudden you can take balance looking shots of scenes that would otherwise be almost silhouettes i will need to spend more time with this though to find out if the effect is something that could just be achieved using an editing app so do subscribe for the camera test coming soon that would be amazing oh yeah and you might already know i love a better night note and pixel four takes it further with astro photography and if your phone is on a tripod or leaning against a stable surface at night it'll automatically capture 15 frames and fuse them together for some apparently next-level photography on the front we've actually lost a camera the previous group selfie cam from the pixel 3 is gone but i don't think it's a huge deal the front camera here is already pretty white so taking a look past camera into software and we've got the obvious stuff like this fern shipping with the latest and greatest android 10 and guaranteed updates for 3 years but there's actually quite a bit more going on google assistant for starters is smarter than ever and is now built directly into the operating system which means that it's a faster than before and b can understand context i could for example ask it to show me taylor swift on twitter and then just say now on instagram and the assistant would understand that i'm still talking about taylor swift i did notice though during the presentation that the pixel 4 no longer has unlimited full quality photo storage that the past pixel phones had and so that's kind of a shame considering that the actual internal storage is already pretty low starting at 64 gigs and maxing out at 128 what i did think was really cool is the pixel recorder that can record entire conversations automatically turn them into text and then allow you to search for specific things that have been said just by dictating them all without data it's also of course a vanilla software skin free from blow wear which might in some part help to save battery but with these phones especially the smaller one battery is something i'm a little worried about the pixel line of phones is historically efficient with the battery that they do have the issue is that this capacity is pretty small you get three thousand seven hundred milli amp hours on the xl model which is passable but it's the 2800 that you get on the standard small 4 and ver i'm a little worried about i've not seen that capacity battery on an android in quite a long time but google still promises all-day battery so i guess a test is an order motion sentence is probably the most unusual new feature you've probably heard of radar it's a system often used in airplanes to be able to detect nearby objects well google has spent five years getting this into a smartphone basically to give it an awareness of its surroundings with three potential benefits the first being presence pixel fault will know if you sit down next to it and it can turn its display on in anticipation and probably cooler the byproduct of this is that it can power itself down when you walk away which saves battery the second is reach it'll know when you're reaching for the phone so it can get itself ready to unlock instantly plus the depth sensor in this top bezel it means you have secure 3d face unlocking although no fingerprint scanner here third is air gestures and you might have guessed i've got mixed feelings about it on one hand we've seen this a lot of times before and it's never really been anything beyond a gimmick but it is a little different here being able to silence alarms just by hovering your palm over your phone is something i could see myself using and the skipping of tracks as well just by swiping above it i'd use that even though this isn't the first time i've seen this feature it's the first time i've seen it done well the main difference here is that your gestures don't need a huge degree of accuracy it's not finicky it just works with the natural motion of your hand combined with all this new software the pixel is starting to feel like a more aware smartphone that needs less physical input than ever before ok finally value does it actually make sense to you buy these phones and it's a bit of a tricky one because if you watch the launch event you might know that google came up with their base price of seven hundred ninety nine dollars and compared to the thousand dollar iphone 11 pro that actually sounds kind of reasonable but if you did want a good sized battery you've got to go for the excel model and if you wanted a decent amount of storage the kind that's almost a base storage for many other phones you've got to pay another hundred dollars and so you end up at 999 or a thousand dollars anyway so price is not a reason to go for the pixel it's also not the most powerful phone with the snapdragon 855 instead of the a 55 plus that a lot of other phones have and six gigs of ram instead eight or twelve we also lose the front firing dual speaker setup before and that's replaced with a single downwards firing speaker complemented by the earpiece so when i put it that way am i not sound great but i actually really like the pixel for phones it's a combination of things the hardware feels incredibly solid the display is awesome high refresh rate great contrast stuff just looks good on it plus i like the direction the software is moving in it's becoming simpler whilst actually being smarter under the hood and even this new radar system whilst i can't see everyone using hand air gestures the fact that it knows you're reaching for the phone and can prepare its face scanner in advance is amazing it's the kind of technology that people won't even realize is being used and yet it makes their life better also the pixel just feels good to use it's got great haptics and so you get a really nice tactile experience so on balance yes some features you need further in-depth testing and yeah there are some notable disadvantages as well with the pixel it's not a perfect phone but it is a good phone i like a lot of things about it and it's one of those devices where i'd recommend you actually pick one up and try and use one for yourself because it's almost better than its spec sheet would suggest thanks for watching and i will catch you in the next one [music] you
