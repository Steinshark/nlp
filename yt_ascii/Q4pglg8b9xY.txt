it is okay to to use a totally different language from industry standard language like o cam for web backend why not i mean the thing is industry standard whatever that means right industry standard does that mean java right remember go is now pretty popular java's pretty popular is russ getting popular typescript has been on the decline which is great and so it's one of those things where what is industry standard a but b what is the purpose of you building a web framework or not building a web framework but building something in the web in oaml is it so that you learn oaml yes you're going to learn oaml but what else are you going to get out of it you're also going to get out a distinct knowledge of how and like to how to build a website which is completely transferable between languages languages are just a way to express an idea and when you have the idea understood expressing it is much easier even if the syntax to the expression is unknown right it creates a mode around your job because no one knows o camo boom right yes industry standard equals dx which equals what i like fair but what i mean is that you you learn what something means and like how to scale it how to do things and so you don't need your side projects to always be excelling what you do in your full-time job typically how i think about it i think about it like this honestly let's just do this for a second because i think this is kind of important cuz i see this stuff all the time thank you for val i see this all the time which is people have this notion that what they're working on their work which maybe is in go java whatever it's how about it's typescript in front end and when they build their little side project right that they get in the lesser hours of their day right however long this looks like you know their fun side right they literally use typescript right they they just do front ends right they use all the same stuff from here into here and i don't do that because that's not what i want to do is because there's a future point that i think exists where i'm working on something different future work what i want where i want and what i want to do is i typically try to make my future work oh let's reverse that arrow i make my fun side reflect where i want to be in the future for the last two years i programmed countless hours of rust for my side projects without being paid ever a single dime to write rust i now write rust 20 to 30% of my time at netflix was it worth that absolutely i'm telling you develop the skills of where you want to be not the skills of what you're doing currently you will master this particular thing at your job over time this on the other hand is for where you take the next step and i really really really want to make sure people actually do that because it's super super important okay anyways the name is the primagen like and subscribe why haven't you liked and subscribed this this was great advice
