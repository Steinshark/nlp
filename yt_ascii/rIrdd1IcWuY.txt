ladies and gentlemen chess is a difficult game have any of you tried it have any of you studied it have any of you practiced it or do you just participate in the occasional youtube video and then move on with your day-to-day business well today's game is a fascinating matchup and there's an interesting story behind it it was sent to me by a subscriber named philip and it was sent to me in 2021 and i actually told philip that i would make a video about it and then i forgot and i saw this game url on my sticky notes on my computer desktop and i went wait a minute i haven't made a video about this game until today this was a battle of two six hundreds this was a battle that will be heard around the world and it's part of my how to lose it chess playlist because good lord isn't spectacular now since both since then both of these guys have moved on in their chess careers they've both gained hundreds of points nowadays philip is probably around 900 sagar is around 1100 at least sagar's name on his profile is sagar shah i don't know if that's a dedication to chess base india's soccer shot or if his name actually just so happens to be soccer shop they both have honorary grandmaster titles and folks you are not ready buckle up put me up on your screen here we go e4 solid start to the game black plays the move d6 alright so clearly two six hundreds who kind of more or less know what they're doing i love this from sagar d4 if your opponent doesn't put a pawn in the center you should put both pawns in the center this is why since then sagar has went on to gain 500 rating points g6 okay so black is playing a king's indian black's playing appear it's king's indian depends on if white plays the move c4 and he does soccer's like you know what you're not taking the center i'm gonna put all three pawns directly in the center why not why not put all four right it's completely reasonable you can also play night you know bring your knights out and he does that on the very next move so knight f3 is is excellent excellent stuff now the way that black plays this is to apply more pressure here with either you know c5 or e5 i like to play this with black by pinning the knight to the queen which also because these two pieces now have to interact kind of takes their eye off the center and you pressure that you pressure that like this so i like the move bishop g4 before doing this knight d7 is fine but for beginners i i would not recommend that move because you're blocking your own bishop so the more you block your development i'm sure you know the newbies watching this know when you play without space in chess it can be very very cramped now i don't like white's next move which is the move d5 this move just doesn't make any sense it would have made sense if the knight had gone to c6 because at least you can argue well i'm attacking the knight but yeah here you're not attacking the knight there's just no night there in fact that move just opened up black's bishop what white should have done here instead of repeating multiple moves with the same piece right which violates some opening principle it's just open castle like you need to make improvements to your position this is this is not making an improvement to your position this is the equivalent of sledgehammering your own wall in your bedroom and and then building a window there like you you already had two windows i don't know what you needed a third one for like you just broke out you know a giant piece of wall not really necessary but okay you've got a window fine e5 now here obviously all seasoned veterans of chess know that white has a move which is called and seasoned veterans of chess also know that if ampersant is on the board it is forced you have to play it as a tribute to the chess gods unfortunately sagar violates that and plays the move knight to c3 but folks i gotta tell you so far in the opening i mean give these guys credit no i mean this is this is the best opening two six hundreds i've ever played if you took a sample size of a million games between two 600s and this was their opening position i mean they are following all principles right literally everything is being followed now this is pinning this but there's not a lot of pressure on that so when the next move black is going to go here right and kick out the bishop so what does white do here white stops the move h6 white stops the move h6 by playing queen d2 i mean you 600 600 playing queen to d2 i mean are you kidding me that stops h6 completely and now black has to do things like knight c5 and try to like expand over here it's a little bit too complicated black plays the move h6 so black blunders and the problem with that move is what you should do here with black is you should absolutely not take the bishop and black does that and now black is completely lost because if you just don't move i'm gonna go here then i'm gonna prevent you from moving your knight because it's gonna be made and i'm gonna attack you with my bishop maybe bring my other knight maybe h4 g4 like i can castle long and just launch an attack over here because you already committed your king that's the thing you got to pay attention in chess as a beginner you are taught castle quickly but if you ever want to be an intermediate advanced player you don't always have to castle especially if the position is safe for your king if you see that the king is castled and all this is coming you don't need to commit your king there so unfortunately black does not realize what the idea is also just playing too fast like starting a 10 minute game but spending three seconds on the move h6 is just philip not good not good stuff philip take take and yeah black is completely lost just hopeless there is basically one remaining thing that i would recommend for black to do it would be either to bring the knight here and stop mate so this knight can move or play queen e7 and try to trade the queens and if you can trade the queens you're only down upon okay being down upon is not the same as getting checkmated unless you're also down upon and happen to get checkmated in which case you're just trash but in this case that's what you should do you knight c5 just does not address any of that and if you look at the computer evaluation slowly but surely it went from you know plus 0.7 to plus one to plus 1.6 now even here is plus 1.5 if black doesn't take now black takes is plus two and a half now black goes here it's plus 2.8 now black goes here it's plus four it's like every move is making it worse and worse but still maybe you can trade the queen right yeah black is just not interested in trading the queen i mean bishop e6 is just plus 10. i mean bishop e6 is like your car has you know one of your blinkers is faulty and and while you're driving it to the body shop you know you drive off a cliff i mean really it's yeah not necessary you don't need to do this this is completely this is not a good move and sagar with white is just ridiculous i mean he takes it like this dude is playing lights out chess spectacular chest now pawn take c6 is is the beginning of of the fun so black should play knight takes or rook takes is even better than pawn takes because every time a pawn moves in chess you need to think about what it starts doing and stops doing just like with any move it stops guarding this this is me wherever the king goes there's a mate the king goes this way that's mate if the king goes this way that's mate so queen g6 just wins the game on the spot and now unfortunately the 600 ism kicks in you see in chess everybody has this part of the game where they you know like your elo in chess is based on how you play throughout the game if you're 600 in chess it doesn't mean you play as a 600 at all times sometimes play like a 1000. in this game for the first half white is playing like a 1 000 400 points above now white plays like a 200 it doesn't see checkmate in two and that balances out so your your goal is to make that range tighter and raise your floor don't raise your ceiling but raise your floor so you don't plummet off a cliff yeah queen g6 white plays this move in actually a lot of thought white spend 20 something seconds on castling that's not good doesn't see queen g6 black plays rookie seven still this is a decent move but what white should do now is find a way to get some help over there to the king like you know maybe bring the rook get the night out bring the rook maybe f4 pawn break okay white plays a3 that move makes you literally zero sense but and and white spent 40 seconds on the move a3 like i like that you're thinking but a3 is completely meaningless now what should black do right black is down a bishop and black is under a very big attack so when you are under attack it's actually okay to trade pieces if you're losing because at least you're not gonna get mated like now that you're not mated the next phase of the game begins and maybe you can still make a comeback but what you should not do when you are being attacked is spend 40 seconds and lose a night i mean it's just a clean night i mean just lost the night for no reason you're down a bishop now you're down to knight and a bishop that has not improved your situation i would argue it's made your situation worse i know that's a hot take like what are you doing why are you just taking things you get but soccer goes queen g6 all right now black goes here if white takes the knight white loses the knight if white takes the knight like this white loses the queen how does white win this night and not lose his own knight give a check take check then take this now you're up tonight and that's a little hard though that's tricky all right and that doesn't happen and instead soccer takes this and we have this all right still losing for sure white can play a four open up the position white can go grab a pawn white can set up a battery white can bring the rooks you gotta know how to use your roots all right you gotta know how to use your rooks you got a rook lift right bring the rooks up and over that's that's sort of the idea so rook g5 played and now it's i need to check my phone real quick this is important it's about my puppy okay he's fine just got a text about his well-being rook takes g5 rook d1 queen d7 and now we go back to playing several hundreds of points above our level and we play this move c5 now c5 make domestic c5 is way too way too sophisticated of a move the point is that you're like well this is pinned and you know if there's this i'm gonna win yeah bro just take the pawn like just shut up and take the pun and then while you're at it shut up and take this pawn too just take the pawns it's free pawns it's nothing complicated now if the queen comes here or here and mates you that's one thing just guard that anyway c5 rook f8 and now we have queen h4 that attacks the rook the rook comes here check here check here and in this position the players shuffle their pieces and made a draw just kidding that didn't happen white gave a check king h7 and now took and took okay status update white is up a bishop the evaluation of a bishop is three points but it's plus nine why is it plus nine instead of plus three it's plus nine instead of plus three because in chess to evaluate a position you need to consider four factors number one king safety number two material that's kind of a tie right peace activity space and pawn play in this case the king is just not i mean that is not a safe king so first of all bishop d3 just picks up a rook that is just the cleanest of pins right rook d3 played though is a rook lift and white wants to go up and over and i don't i don't blame white i mean that's mate i like the move rook d3 queen c6 played and now queen g4 just ends the game there is actually like no way to stop this you gotta go here and try to block and then i can still do this and you can't stop my plethora my cornucopia my ubiquitous checkmates all right we have h3 though which i don't understand queen c6 h3 i mean you just rook lifted like what okay you block your pieces rook g8 queen h4 that's very lucky that's a check by the way because that's mate queen g2 is mate like black is actually doing a decent job here but now it's over now it's over and it is over in a multitude of ways it's it's over because first of all you can play queen to d8 check and take this rook it like that is just the cleanest of finishes queen d8 queen g8 now it's also over because you can just and just trade pieces trade pieces win an end game it's also over because you can go here and now deflect the king away and that's it five minutes on the clock for soccer there is an m on the evaluation he is completely winning queen to c2 and it is made in so many different ways rook g7 and latter rook g7 and trade bishop to g4 and queen e6 like you you cannot tell me there is not like 80 mates we have this block and that's a free queen i mean queen c2 queen h7 it would have been made the guy blocks that's a free queen 100 free unfortunately now white starts playing like a 200 and only looks for checks and i got news for you it's still good because queen f6 is a free rook and that's made in one 99 ways white goes here okay black blocks with the rook check here white is now up two rooks and a bishop that is 13 points of material and is up two minutes rook h7 queen c7 queen c7 is a brilliant move by the way because it stops queen d8 mate now rook hh check is look it looks like mate it's not but you win the queen so rook hh check is a good move after queen c7 but okay soccer goes here i don't hate that move d5 is getting a little closer right he gets a little closer he's trying to set up a mate somehow maybe queen g8 black doesn't know what to do he's just pushing pawns now here's sagar plays a move that if i was in the same room with him i would grab him i would scream at him so loud you have a rook a bishop and a queen directly surrounding a king it is inexcusable to play the move g3 i mean are you insane what what is g3 g3 is the beginning of the end let me tell you something right now if you made it 15 minutes you are about to witness single-handedly the biggest catastrophe in chess history this man is up 13 points of material his opponent has 56 seconds remaining 56 you could just check the guy until he loses on time just check him just keep checking him you're gonna win his queen d4 played queen f6 that's it thank you thank you this mate is now unstoppable that maid of the queen moves unstoppable any bishop discovery is made in one in a move d3 and that's it he's done it rook h8 is made and no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no king g2 you have a queen of bishop and two rooks and five pawns why are you moving your king for what what is the reason how dare you to spend three seconds in this position and play king to g2 oh god all right all right enough dilly-dallying please check mate what i think the idea of this move is this this i think i i think that's the idea i don't but now you can't even do it but you can move your bishop literally any bishop move any bishop move is made in a couple i mean any rookie traders man but queen hs he takes the po oh god he takes the pawn he takes the pawn no no no no now black oh god oh god rookette shade is made again i mean it's made again damn it it's made okay fine you know what i understand i understand it's scary rook t1 i understand i get it it's your rook is hanging you gotta move it check okay now king is under attack when you are under attack with your king you gotta think i gotta get my king to safety and i have to make sure there are no more checks this is not a complicated move god forbid you bring the queen back you trade queens god forbid your opponent has 19 seconds on the clock 19 said you could do anything you want in this damn game you know what you can't do you can't start chucking pawns you know why white played e4 because he's still a fiend for me he still wants to play queen d8 that's the only mate that he sees he doesn't see any other mate can't move his bishop can't move his ring he's refusing to see anything else okay now white has one two three four legal move five legal moves the king can go anywhere and the queen can come back four of these moves win the game foreign this one in one of the biggest catastrophes in one of the biggest top anime betrayals of chess king h2 loses the game and it loses the game because you lose your rook with check and then you lose to a check and a promotion and you're mated
