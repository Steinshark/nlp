soft robots are robots that exploit their compliance to be highly adaptable and be able to deal with the environment that are not structured highly dynamics and they can provide also a safe human robot interaction despite these fantastic advantages they still rely for their control on electronics and so microcontrollers and also some of them can be also controlled by pneumatic actuation so limiting a little bit the usability so today so you can see actually here several examples of soft robots we mainly use to fabricate these additive manufacturing so multi-material 3d printing so we can actually make them several characteristics in terms of mechanical properties of the material and here you can see actually what it takes to control this system and for example like we need a lot of valves that of course cannot be embodied to avoid that they can impair their movement and also their compliance adaptability so today i will show you how we are going to solve a little bit this issue towards what we call soft matter computing in particular what we want is to achieve in future electrical free electronic free soft controllers that can be embodied in in the robot body and also can perform computation so we don't need to rely in future to electronic microcontroller and and valves in particular what we are doing is to 3d print these kind of systems such that in future they can actually be manufactured together with the robot body and have a highly integrated solution we usually use this multi material 3d printer to print the valves and so we can we are able to actually 3d print the the valve with the different mechanical properties of the material the one for the soft membrane the bi-stable membrane and also the the spool and thanks to this so we can actually be able to manufacture this so is that more than one head printhead or is it just use the same printhead this is a polyget printer so he has many heads and they use acrylic-based polymers that are released as a drop and there is a row that actually pass through it with a uv light for the curing so that is the way in which this is different from maybe fdm 3d printers so these allow to achieve very high accuracy and that's the reason why we can use it also to make soft robots with the like empty chamber thanks to the accuracy of the printer we can print so many valves all together in one batch without the tray and after the printer can like perform all the manufacturing for us usually what we do at the end of the print we put the parts that are like covered with the supporting material in a chemical bath so for that will dissolve the supporting material so providing us with the final part that we can assemble today we show that sr latch that is one of the basic element of computation with a soft bulb so sr latch i think you probably already saw the videos on computer files about latches so you can actually go there to to check their functioning with a d flip flop we can store a single bit of information we design a manufacturer a soft bulb that can actually functionally replicate the similar behavior of an sr latch what we do is use a bi-stable membrane to actually switch state between one and zero and this bistable membrane is also connected to a spool valve that allow to actually get the output that will be connected to the soft actuator that you see here so the energy supplies of the whole system comes from the compressor here which is basically a pneumatic reservoir which provides us the energy however how we distribute energy to the robots depends on the state of these memories so by resetting and setting the state of each valve which refers to each bit of binary information what we can achieve is to differently distribute the predator process the information and activate the software the left-hand side the number one valve we are showing here is the bi-stable structure we use to store the information and in order to convert that information into the pneumatic signal we use to control this arm what we do is for the second one here we attach a spool valve on it so that we can convert that information into the configuration of this robot for example now if i send a set signal what we can see is that the robot will be activated and if now i reset it the robot will restore to its equilibrium position where do you see these sort of robots as being used okay so soft robots can be used like in general they have been considered idle effectively for example for manipulation of soft produces for example in agriculture or like in the the food industry that's because they are like very compliant they don't require a very complicated control and the knowledge of the model of the object because they can actually like adapt to it and be able to grasp so this is actually tree jaw gripper by controlling it with even in open loop is able to grasp object with different shapes and that is actually something that have been considered very advantages for for like in general for this kind of manipulation application but also you can see here a soft arm and you can imagine when you want for example to do pipe inspection or you want to navigate in environment that are really cluttered so you want to be able to dexterously navigate through the environment and reach something so like the rigid robot again require a lot of control because when they navigate this kind of environment you don't want to damage the environment or the robot itself or maybe like have a not safe interaction with humans while because of their compliance this soft robot can actually achieve a very dexterous configuration and also they are safe so they can be in contact with the environment and without like damaging it and you know the kind of soft vowels and things you've been obviously talking this through do you think they were scaled down will they be scary that is actually the next stage of the research because at the moment we achieve that kind of science but to be able in future to of course embed that kind of system in the robot body and perform some computation we need to be able to to scale down that of course require some technological advancement from the additional factoring point of view materials so soft robotics actually need a lot of inputs from other disciplines to be able to to progress further because it's effectively yeah like you need it to work in like biology right yeah i mean there is a cellular size here very small yeah exactly we need to definitely try to achieve like a very immune material is a software to be able to build a logic gate and and actually perform computation in future there you go so here we have different quadro pads today we're gonna see the spot one yeah just to give an idea of where we traveled this is all the way from where we were before here with the round table
