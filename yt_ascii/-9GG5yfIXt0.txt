[music] i had to reinforce that all right welcome back to the show everyone today i'm really excited because we just hit 500 subscribers at tekken turn and that was yesterday and i checked it today and we're already at like 5 30. by the time this video gets out it'll probably be like i don't know 5 60 or something like that i'm having so much fun i got a message earlier today let me get my phone my phone's recording of course i can't get my phone i've had people messaging me every few days like they're they're really enjoying leap party they're really getting advice and they're really applying it to their lives from these videos and i'm really shocked at the response like i did i expected it to help maybe one or two people but it's really starting to help a lot of people and i'm really really liking that so as a result of that i want to thank you guys for watching and subscribing and sharing all your love and support so i want to do something pretty cool for the 500 subscriber i don't know thing and and i have a few ideas but i want to hear what you guys think so i posted this prompt on linkedin asking people you know what they what they thought and i'm also gonna monitor the comments section below and essentially what i'm thinking is there's three different things we could try first off i'm always getting people asking me for resume critiques now i love doing it but i get so many requests it's hard for me to do them all so i could just like offer like a five resume critique giveaways or 10 resume critique giveaways or something over the next few weeks and then you know anyone that comments on the video or likes or subscribes or something i enter them in a raffle i could do the same thing but instead of a resume critique giveaway i could paired program with someone and build a feature in lead party of course the party is this open source software that we made here at tech intern to help you competitively code with your friends but since it's open source i could jump on a call with you paired program with you and help you build a feature and deploy it to 200 users so that would be really cool to get on your resume too but that's only one person that wins as opposed to like maybe five in the resume critique giveaway last option we could actually do a coding competition now i think this could be really fun so we could use lead party and i could say all right well the winner gets 100 150 i don't know 200 i'll come up with the amount maybe second place there will be a second place prize maybe there will be a third place prize and then you know set up all the pairings and then have you guys code against each other what i really like about this option is first off i'm helping someone pay for their university a lot of you guys are at waterloo second off it would help you guys meet each other you know that could be a really cool opportunity to help build the tech and turn community so i think that would be really fun but you know i want to leave this up to you guys if you have any other suggestions please put them in the comment below or go you know follow me on linkedin and leave your comments on the linkedin post whatever you want to do it's up to you anyway i'm starting to ramble now thank you guys so much again i'm i'm really ecstatic about the 500 subscribers and let's get to a thousand
