all right this is wild are you ready for this one i don't think you guys are ready for this cuz it took me a moment to even see what was happening here okay it took me a long time okay i i i don't know what's going on here but i saw this and i i'm confused okay so for those that don't know what catfishing is catfishing is where you create a fake online persona with the intent of duping somebody okay so that would be catfishing so creating a fake online persona is not catfishing trying to dupe people is all right so now that we have that kind of thought out and understood let's look at this so this instagram post was was from around 2018 so let's first look at the the instagram post and then we'll go on from there okay so you have mrs always right some data structures in programming coding unicorn which is a fale switched from sublime to vs code and enjoying it okay nice okay nice that's a positive that's a positive that's a positive right all right so this is where things get a little bit confusing okay and and we're going to have a little bit of a a little trouble wrapping our heads around this all right so i hope you're ready for this wait a minute it says the site was made by coding unicorn but the photos all look like stock or ai is this whole persona fake too so got a whole fake potentially thing king no discovered that where you can see file directory up on the screens the user is eduard c okay what users eduard c huh coding unicorn eduardito eduard no okay so didn't plan on the user's path caught in 14 in 144p caught low k quality low definition all right wait the the hole goes deeper why does linkedin profile for linkedin.com coding unicorn we're going to go check it out coding unicorn let's go coding unicorn here we go we're going and we're getting it and we got the data okay and we're here coding unicorn julia okay is a craftswoman software craftswoman and tech insta inst instaf fluenc on instagram okay coding skills give you an edge over non-programmers this is a fact of life like honestly i could outcode every non-programmer out there okay go ahead give me a non-programmer right now we'll go mono mono on leak code and i'll kick their ass every time 100% of the time this is a fact but to gain an edge over programmers you need more than that also true in fact this statement is so true that i'm going to take this statement i'm going to highlight this statement i'm going to copy the statement i'm going to go to my profile on linkedin i'm going to view my profile i'm going to remove all those cu those are all just like hey come on

license ai get wrecked get wrecked ai get wrecked okay so say they work at dev tube but only o the same name i i mean i love the fact that you have your username on your laptop matches your twitter name but it's just not a good it's just not a good move you know what i mean is mentioned in the foot credits i'm 99% sure that coding unicorn is welcome the cost i forgot to turn off dang it dang it i was so close now you just have to like and subscribe i hate saying that i don't dislike and unsubscribe right now let's see is not let's see is coding unicorn either use photoshop or a model to impersonate a woman developer dev tube the best developer videos in one place oh what what a oh my goodness acts like they have no affiliation to devity in posts tech conferences i usually attend so few i can count them on one hand but this year i'm definitely going to devity oh you know what i just realized you can create an incredible network here created a fake he catfished for marketing it's just marketing whoow it's so smart i did not even see it coming tom the genius is behind this tom is behind this tom has to be the one behind this but how wild is this how wild is this entire situation going on here you know what i mean that there there's this thing that exists oh anything organized by dev events is the same organizer who creates these fake women speakers oh wow gley even found i didn't even realize that okay look at this look at this this is like a whole series i didn't even i didn't even i didn't even realize this was i didn't even realize this was a thing oh my goodness just following this thing out not realizing it how crazy it is imagine a tech conference having no call for proposal as they reach out to speakers directly they successfully attract some of the most heavy hitter men speakers in tech and three women speakers now imagine my surprise that two of those women are fake profiles they do not exist i contacted let's see i contacted speakers i know about this they had no idea one of the fake women profiles is supposedly a core ethereum contributor and staff engineer at coinbase no such contributor no one heard of her at coin coinbase now or before why do this sad to say going forward but if you are invited to speak at a lesser no conference do your diligence if other listed speakers actually exist okay now that's this is not on my bingo card for 20 23 this was not on it for all of the things that could possibly be on my bingo card having to learn about speakers that actually exist was not on it this is this is a paid online conference large number of paid attendee workshops sold out what a mess to be very clear this is about organizers creating fake profiles to spell it out why the conference conference generated fake women speakers because the organizers wanted big names and it probably seemed like an easy way to address the diversity concerns incredibly lazy which conference well where anna boo staff engineer at coinbase and ethereum core contributor is speaker her she doesn't exist except a listed speaker at a prominent online conference or another java conference by the exact same organizer where microsoft and mvp and whatsapp senior engineer alina bronda is featured speaker would you know there is no such microsoft mvp and meta employee speakers listed out these conferences had no idea i talked with the or the conference doesn't have a call for papers because they follow the hollywood principle that sounds made up by the way i mean to be completely fair if you've ever played enough i mean honestly if you've ever played enough uh what's the car soccer what's the car rocket soccer game car rocket soccer game what's the name of it gosh what is it what's car rocket soccer game rocket league that's what it's called then you would know holly hollywood principal okay is obviously a very popular band hollywood principal okay so it's not made up it's real if you knew i mean you would know this if you played car soccer obviously not playing car socer okay he he's not playing car soccer at all okay car rocket soccer not being played for instead we follow the hollywood principle don't call us we'll call you i mean it does sound badass i mean if we're being honest here if you went to a conference where it's like we do not do a call for proposals we call you it's like oh whoa that's a prestigious conference oh that's a that's a hot one if you bought tickets to dev eternity on the 7th and 8th december you've been duped with fake speakers anab bole who is still on the website a madeup profile ai image with no staff engineer at coinbase some other listed women speakers who actually don't actually talk damn damn that's crazy this is crazy i didn't even realize it was this bad when i thought i just thought it was a dude cat fishing a girl on instagram data driven design is ddd to find out that it's not a dude making an ai profile which i naturally we all thought that was going to happen right that's kind of where my mind first went this guy went full enterprise on it make it till you make it taken to the extreme domain driven design yeah domain driven design i said data driven design domain driven design i mean this is extreme fake it to you make it i honestly did not i did not see this coming duplicate duplicate driven design i knew it the guy replied the guy replied dear reader if you know me well you know that i have high standards of work and professional ethics [applause] you know that dev eternity has been my life's work and dev eternity is the event that i love and deeply care about we've always delivered on that promise and the event has been highly regarded by both speakers and attendees it's all the result of hard work and ethical work eight years in a row i won't be responding directly to mr or oros oro gges gges right i don't know how to say his last name i got to learn how to say his name he has a video where he says it i should just i should just learn how to say his name accusation and won't even link it here given that mr oros didn't bother contacting me and sharing his concerns he went straight to the socials and using the power of his social network shared all of his assumptions without validating them damaging my life's work and reputation i don't know what his intention was but harm has been done nothing good only harm so instead i'll explain okay let's let's hear a good explanation because maybe we're wrong we could be wrong here i'll explain what to you what happened and then you decide if my life's work and the upcoming event deserve to be ruined and i ought to be lynched i've been deeply concerned about inclusion and diversity and i have been working very hard to make de eternity inclusive for everybody and it isn't limited to female speakers which was the majority of mr oro's post our code of conduct clearly states our our policy and it's not my words if you've attended the conference you know that it's an amazingly safe friendly and inclusive event this year despite our attempts we achieved a worse than expected level of diverse diversity of speakers it's far from what we wanted to achieve and there's a lot to improve there have been thousands of events chasing the same small sub group of female speakers as a result from all the ladies we've approached the ey ladies who had experience in topics relevant to our program we ended up with three brilliant female speakers sndi julia and chris and i was happy when they said yes but then the worst dream of the conference organizers has materialized two of our ladies dropped out sandy for health issues and julia switched to helping with the organization you can't do both speaking and organiz organization sandy and julia didn't make it to the final schedule but they kept appearing on the website while i was looking for a replacement this partially led to an accusation that since they are not part of the schedule we've probably added them just to meet arbitrary diversity criteria that statement is bold and unfair sandy and julia confirmed their participation they should have been part of the final schedule but dropped out for reasons out of our control at the worst possible time ask sandi or julia did you ping him could you like link him so we ended up with only one female speaker chris so while i was looking for a last minute replacement hoping i'd find it sandy and julia were still mentioned on the website what about the other things like they didn't exist at coinbase i think that's like that's the that's the thing i'd like to understand did they did did he accidentally miss att tribute to where they worked okay here's the real one right like where's the real like it dressed below okay okay okay so so far this seems a little weird here okay the problem is that together with sandi and julia who were intended to speak there was also a demo persona from our test website version i let's see i should not be there but okay it should not be there as it's gotten there by mistake it's autogenerated with a with a random title random twit twitter handle and random picture really a random title it's odd that the title was so well put together like contributor to both a blockchain and staff engineer at coinbase i mean it seems it's it's it's incredible how random that title is this is a very smart ai i mean i don't know what service they pay for for placeholders but that has to be an expensive service for placeholders man that's an that's an expensive faker js the classic the classic hotwoman faker js i've heard about this one i noticed the issue in october but my busy mind suggested delaying the fix until we finalized the program because one it was not quick fix but it was just placeholders couldn't you just delete them out it i mean sounds like it's a quick fix cuz placeholders are usually like just literally just there they're just just a piece of data or it's hardcoded like it's easy it's like the opposite of of difficulty two it's better to have the demo persona while i'm searching for the replacement speakers i can't say that that's true so like let's just say this is all a mistake granted it's all a mistake we can all agree it's a mistake it's a mistake that's not right you have a that that that that doesn't smell good like that that doesn't feel good i feel like this is not ethical like you mentioned ethical many times so why is it better would be my question what are you trying to say without saying it that's a very important thing i do hope that we get number two specifically addressed here because number two seems really really important three and the persona isn't part of the schedule anyways so it can wait no harm only good intentions well no i would say that number two is not good intentions it's actually bad intentions it's used to mislead people either mislead people you're asking to speak or mislead people trying to buy like i don't see i i i cannot see i cannot see a positive reason to keep it right i cannot or right let's remove the word positive i cannot see an ethical reason to keep it the lazy argument i could totally buy when he said i was too lazy i was like  i've been there you know okay maybe it's not as quick of a fix as i'd like cuz they're using wordpress and he forgot how to delete a row out of the wordpress cms whatever it is library yeah the demo thing totally viable i'm really stuck on this one i'm really stuck on this one because this feels nefarious right this feels like i know what it does perceptually and i know that i can use this perceptual thing to dupe people into doing what i want therefore i will keep this perceptual thing around that's how i read it right it doesn't feel like negligence it feels like intentional issues right the persona isn't part of the schedule okay then it's not a problem so it can wait anyways no harm only good intentions the bug backfired has become a feature since snd and julia and persona were all ladies we ended up with three ladies in the program who are not part of the final schedule and since nobody asked or checked with me the wrong conclusion has been made we've done that to boost diversity and that's a big a big and wrong ouch well again number two is how am i supposed to read number two that's my problem is how am i supposed to read number two other than that so here i am 12 days before the event with my family my team and our speakers concerned yeah i mean i feel bad for that obviously if you truly thought you were just doing fine things and again the problem with eth eics is legal legality involves intention but ethics often does not involve intention it doesn't matter if you have a good attitude or only positive feelings you can definitely do bad things and you can do unethical things even with good intentions that's the whole problem romero like john romero romero like the doom guy romero that's a pretty big ass that's a no wonder they call you not me okay well that that's not a big change that's not a big change okay so i mean okay again you really got to be super careful so if i am to believe 0.1 it's not a quick fix and then i see this which is as quick of a fix one could have okay it's an md f oh it's a yaml file okay yam it's yaml it's harder i get it it's yaml it's seven lines of configuration you could mess up the whit space fair fair fair take so it's hard for me to believe number one number two seems super unethical and number three it sounds like don't worry about that which is hard i mean again this is all hard for me to be able yeah what about the coinbase one they can't even inv validate that that person exists so the person helping organizing who's no longer a speaker people aren't convinced they're real to begin with right so i let's see i fixed the code and redeployed the websites as soon as i received an email from one of our speakers it's fixed now and it won't happen again i wrote a test for it i'll ensure a a safe and inclusive environment at the event like it's always been no doubt about that i'll increase my efforts 10x to make sure that next year if one of our ladies drop out we'll have a fallback plan i also want to say sorry to any speaker who's been confused used but the damage has been done so my message to mr orose instead of checking your assumptions contacting me and respectfully discussing the concerns you have you use the power of social media to damage my me and my conference reputation by spreading lies about my ill intentions my lack of concern about diversity and that people should not attend the events so it sounds like i mean it sounds like he was expressly concerned about diversity which led to these really confusing situations i don't think they're lies i think that he pointed out great things he could not find these people existing in real life in a staff engineer or a microsoft mvp like those are real titles where people can really find out if they exist like if this julian person comes it should be easy to verify right it should be easy to verify if that's that's right or wrong i'll be eager to debate you on the topic publicly we can schedule time for that my email is this damn threw it out there on the o never throw an email out on the twitters but that's okay so i mean he must really believe that he is perfectly in the right to for this debate you can reach me anytime if you want you can attend the conference and see how inclusive safe and good it is i won't scam you instead you'll have to you'll leave inspired and learn a thing or two i promise meanwhile i will go and spend the weekend putting up the fires out the fires you ca mr orus make love not war dead people or dear people  thank you all edwards okay did i mean is did did did he say like hey everything is good did have they come to some sort of understand it check out dhh retweet response okay what is can someone leak dhh is i'm okay so now dhh is in this one remember other people did digging and found lots of damning evidence as well as fake posts from fake people posting about the conference and he's done this for years yeah that's that's kind of what it's looking like what a strange tale never seen anything like this in decades of speaking at conferences regardless of what may ultimately blow be up or down here i'm out i think that that's i think this is a good move by dhh i think he's i think he's right i'd be super concerned about any conference that has this kind of stuff around it because it is quite wild it is very very wild and again point 2 was the most concerning like if anyone read this and they did not get deeply concerned about point 2 i'd be very very very concerned about it kelsey hi tower kelsey high toow is another heavy hitter in the conference world as someone who helped organize and help run large events i can understand how challenging it can be to put together the programs and oversee events from start to finish yes he actually he's very experienced he's a very talented individual however based on your own telling of events i take issue with continue to advertise speakers who have notified you that they will no longer be speaking at the conference you are charging attendees money and they might be making their purchases based on these decisions of the list so this is point two it's like exactly like that's called a scam so the so the so i think asmin gold does a great job breaking this down where he talks about the pokem man cookies is it a scam she is not scamming anybody it's overpriced that's different a scam is where you buy one thing and you get something else this is to its definition a scam misleading is scam right when you do something like this this is pure scam you're charging money for people who either don't exist or b they will not be speaking like that is scam now the health food part yeah that would be a scam and even asmin gold talks about that but the the intentions over the price not necessarily the health part all right however let's see you are charging yes okay i may i have made mistakes of my own and i'll show let's see and so i'll show some empathy by not calling out everything i would have done differently in hindsight yeah that's good that's fair i will say this the pool of qualified speakers is much larger than it ever has been this is also very true there's lots of very talented people this isn't all on you by the way as a paid speaker i also need to take a bit of accountability given the allegations and your response i can no longer participate in the event and i have asked that i be removed from the program and removed as a listed speaker on on the website gi up repository in any future promotions of the event there you go so he even he's a paid speaker so obviously they're paying for the speakers they use the conference per the conference money to pay for that rebase it out rebas it clean out dev eternity has fake women speakers listed for years here's a fake and a boy's colleague fake natalie straddler claimed to be at coinbase no such person ever worked there course i checked she spoke in 2022 just incredible i mean at the end of the day like you should know that this is like this is just playing with fire for years software crafts woman yes it feels bad because you know you know like the problem with this kind of stuff is a it it does hurt hurt women right because now there's going to be now there's just more skeptic skepti ability right it just makes it worse for everybody involved now i know it's it's it's literally the worst outcome of it all which is just the worst thing and and so it's it's just like it doesn't this doesn't help anybody the people who purchase tickets are being scammed the people who are speaking there are being scammed now you have all this happening and it's going to be even worse it just feels bad because it it undermines everything that whatever you're trying to achieve did you discover his fake female instagram account 120,000 [music] followers that is painful i understand that this is really unfortunate turn of events however i am not sure whether i can trust you or saying given that you claim that anna was an was an autogenerated demo persona from our test website version git log seems to say say otherwise wow i mean that yeah that that's bad right this is really bad because now now you're getting into a situation in which it it looks intentional so it's it's even harder for me to believe these statements so i mean to me it just seems like we have now officially caught i am the coding unicorn we're all the coding unicorn i mean the problem is is at this point you know like i really wanted to give this guy the benefit of the the doubt i didn't want to like dunk on him too hard but i mean it's hard it's hard not to say that this is 100% a scam this is 100% a scam at this point do you have any other concerns other than a single poor random lady who actually never made it to our final selection i double checked never for eight years in a row attendees were getting what they were paid for every single time well the problem isn't that is that it's said that this person existed and doesn't exist maybe i mistak by adding a poor random lady what but it is that single random lady is this single random lady worth all the hate holy cow dude you got to just take the l just accept that you you know you know you know what i bet you if he would have taken the l early on no one would have dug nearly as hard and he probably would not have been caught nearly as deep right i mean this is some the problem is is once this happens once you do this you really just just you just you really do this this is the problem this guy no he's not even gaslighting gaslighting is at least like a believable lie that you feel discomforted with until you feel like you're going crazy there's no crazy here no one's being dup this is just straight manipulation dear sweetness yes marketing y'all yeah yeah marketing would have been so much better honestly marketing would have been so much better dude just leaning in and being like yeah i used it for marketing he's either yeah either it is delusion he actually believes it anna hey if if by the way if this is a real person i'm very sorry okay anna if this is i don't know if this is a at this point in my life i don't know if things are ai generated or not i can't even tell anymore but hey if you're a real person sorry genuinely feel bad for you i hope that your name's not real and that you're just just like some other person in some related version this person does not exist.com it's a random lady she is she is in pornhub if that's to be believed okay i can't believe anything now now i okay first off i don't want to link i don't want to link okay i don't want to link i don't want to link right here okay i don't want to link i don't want to link so let's see so i've been called out and canceled by listing a person on my conference website who never actually made it to the final program just a random person on the conference website cancel for all the good work i've been doing for 15 years no see again yeah okay so obviously the problem is we don't need to read the rest of this he's just claiming victim but the problem here is is very very simple you used it to your advantage it's crazy you know what i mean it's crazy and i feel i i genuinely feel bad for the speakers for the speakers in the past i feel bad for the attendees buying the stuff because they think they're getting something and they're getting something else sad the name the name don't commit fraen okay it's it's like don't it's that simple
