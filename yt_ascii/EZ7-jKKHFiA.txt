ladies and gentlemen thank you for clicking on this video this one's going to be pretty special today we're going to be covering a subject that has become really popular in the year 2024 and that subject is cheating and chess but we're going to go a whole lot further today i am announcing my direct participation in the organization of a first ever live chess event of this type i am helping organize a one-on-one high stakes chess match and we're going to get into all the details in just a moment first i'm going to give you an update on some massive cheating drama then i'm going to announce this one-on-one match tell you all the stakes involved and as always we are going to analyze a few chess games sit back relax and enjoy this one-of aind experience this all begins with the 14th world chess champion grandmaster vladimir karnick who over the past few months here in 2024 has been posting a lot about cheating and vladimir's posts are always very fascinating some i completely disagree with and think are wild and crazy and some i actually kind of look and listen to and and that's kind of part of the problem is that it's it's a little bit all over the place and and not fully perfect but he has been posting a lot about cheating every single tuesday he plays on .c and and calls it cheating tuesdays he doesn't even call it title tuesdays and he's fighting in theory what should be a good fight for fair play in chess for stronger anti-cheating measures but in particular one of the people that he posts about a lot is josam and if you don't know who jpam is josam is jose martinez jose eduardo martinez alcantara is his full name he now plays under the mexican federation but he is peruvian and vladimir krck posts about him a lot saying you know josam left no chance as expected and they've played many games against each other and actually josam has won a lot of the games that they've played against each other but in all of vladimir's posts about anti-cheating this man's name appears a lot and vladimir even on a post of jose martinez having a film crew at his house a film crew went to jose martinez's house and he still finished second place still posted a bunch of his games went deep into the analysis here and still does not fully believe that josam is playing fairly in fact he played him in a tournament and this is what he said at the end of one of their games and i apologize if the volume is low okay resign yeah another game of 90 something i suppose for him let's see g review yeah anyway i play 95.7 yeah no i mean yeah i think it's my last game i will simply not play against him anymore because it doesn't make sense anyways i'm going to lose so in my title tuesday i will just announce i'm not going to play against him anymore just resign immediately so vladimir plays against josam and says i will not be playing against him anymore and i'm going to resign if i play against josam in one move i'm not going to play but then he says but offline with pleasure i will play with offline with pleasure i will play with him offline with pleasure i will play with him and by the way vladimir is a man of his word because he resigned against jose on the next game they played in one move vladimir played one move and then he resigned that's that is what he did and this is the head-to-head score of josam versus karnick the only game that vladimir has beaten him in was january of this year they played i guess they played a couple of games jose has won a lot of the games he's a very good online blitz player jose is rated 3100 i mean he just is all right and he's beaten karnick a lot because maybe kick's a bit older maybe he's a little bit slower with the mouse maybe he maybe playing online is is tough that you know that's just that's but anyway i'm goingon to what did he say i'm not going to play against him anymore just immediately but offline with pleasure i believe offline with pleasure and so ladies and gentlemen may i present to you the first ever live event that gotham chess is organizing along with divas and pepe from the spanish speaking site of the chess world david martinez pepe quena the clash of claims vladimir karnick jose martinez here is the information june 7th to 9th in madrid esp in the grand via casino they are going to play dio paras i don't know how to say over theboard in spanish that was the end of my spanish they're going to play' games over the board and' games on computers face to face with a high stakes prize fund we will be broadcasting the games live in madrid i will be in spain spanish speaking audience see you there and this is it this is just the description and you can read this you can pause if you'd like i'm not going to read it to you you know how to read this is what we are organizing and like i said we're also going to analyze some chess games today shout out to the clash of claims shout out to david martinez and pepe quena from the spanish speaking audience they have been amazing and i'm so so excited to be a part of this and let's see it this is literally the equivalent of 1 v1 me irl i mean this is like what you used to say to people in video games when they would when they would beat you you would say 1 v1 me in person and now they're going to get a chance to one v one there's going to be a prize fun there's going to be interviews if you want to sponsor the event you got a company reach out i have a business email in the contact reach out i mean seriously like we're trying to make this thing big and this could become a big series this type of one-on-one heads up type of stuff they have heads up poker we could have heads up chess now i did promise you in that in all of my videos we're going to analyze some games why was vladimir kramnick so frustrated playing against jose martinez that's a great question it's a great question that we're going to find and by the way this was an official game he vladimir karnick resigned in protest and by the way after resigning in protest he got an email from chess.com that he was you know that i think that that was a violation of some sort of rule like you can't deliberately resign a game but these were the last two games that they played and and jose won this one and and and that was it so we're going to analyze both of these games we're announcing the clash of claims and i i can't wait and yes if you're reading that and you think it sounds eily similar to the clash of clans yeah great game it's an awesome game and it's played by 100 million people every month so if we could even get a fraction of that in chess that would be that would be really really swell i'm super excited for this and here we go so josam opened with e 4 and vladimir played c5 the sicilian defense and jose played the system with c3 h3 bishop d3 jose plays this system all the time it's one of the most absurd and stupid looking systems against the sicilian defense i've ever seen and yet test okay that was really weird my microphone just died i guess my my my microphone did not like my microphone like i got a notification from my windows that it it didn't like the the usb device that's just you know t tp typical windows behavior anyway i'm going to i'm going to adjust a couple of my things here and then we're going to be good apologies anyway what i said was if you're wondering why the pawn cannot be taken it's because queen a for check that that is the point is that you would be losing material here and that is not how karnick lost this game knight c6 and jose's plan here is actually very interesting he wants to play two pawns in the center of the board but what he doesn't want to do is he doesn't want to play into a mainline sicilian so he wants to put the bishop back here which is weird that's not normally where the bishop goes and then he wants to play d4 which is why vladimir plays e5 so vladimir gives up a little bit of equity on the on the light squares and he says you know what jose you can't play d4 i'm not going to let you have an easy opening jose plays bishop c2 and jose likes these positions because they're just easy they're just easy positions to play you take a sicilian player completely out of any sort of theory you're going to trade this bishop for the knight you're going to rotate this knight probably to e3 and just play positional chess not allowing your opponent to come forward the position is completely equal but jose clearly with some experience puts the bishop on the b3 square and basically says look i control d5 that's all i wanted i just wanted to control the center vladimir castle jose plays knight bd2 and before jose castles he is trying to play knight f1 and control this completely before he castles if you castle to you know like this and then you try to get this plan black will play d5 if black successfully plays d5 he's just better it's just better because you no longer control the center so knight f1 you'll notice that jose is not thinking he has 303 he's gaining time every move not cuz he's hacking because he just knows the position we need seven 93 and you'll notice vladimir is down 50 seconds on the clock so clearly this is some sort of opening disparity between the players like jose clearly a bit more familiar with the ideas clearly a bit more familiar with the plans and you know he's just he he's going to try to execute them all right so h4 that's an interesting move so instead of castling he plays h4 because vladimir put his king there it's a very tough spot for vlad like is he going to play h5 well he probably won't because then you can play knight g5 check you can also play g4 because white never castled so hg knight g5 king h8 you have takes takes queen g like look at this attack you're just completely winning you just rip open the position so vladimir's got to be very careful so he plays queen d7 jose plays h5 why does he play h5 because he's winning control of the light squares that is the entire strategy of the white position everything white is doing he's trying to win the light squares g4 right knight f5 is on the way knight e7 queen e2 we're going to have a big maneuvering game but vladimir creates counterplay very quickly i mean he's the 14th world champion for a reason right he plays a5 a4 now jose plays bishop d5 very interesting again we're battling for the light squares here we're trying to restrict black's position not let him in like anywhere black can move he can't go anywhere so we have rook b8 vladimir now looking for b5 ideas jose plays rook h3 again going to be a big game of shuffling and controlling bishop takes pawn takes imbalance has been created black can now lash out with b5 b4 or f5 if he waits like if you play b6 white plays rook f3 you will never play f5 now which is vi vi which is vi which is why vladimir plays f5 right now and pandemonium breaks out finally he's gotten out of the position but one two three four five five pawns on dark squares five pawns five pawns out of seven on dark squares means the dark squared bishop is really not participating and it means the light squares in the black camp are very exploitable if a white knight lands on one of those squares it's over it is a migraine for black to deal with knight takes f5 and now jose actually in this position the best move is queen g4 to put pressure he plays a bad move i mean i don't think he's i don't think he's cheating like i'm not this is not like a to cat aat it's not it's not what this i'm just saying like i'm just saying you know if you want to cheat you could you should probably play the best move knight takes f5 rook takes f5 knight e4 and this is just what jose is going for he's going for good night bad bishop and then he's going to say good night to the bad bishop oh bars knight to e4 now i got to say vladimir's got a nice position here i mean he is doing a nice job fighting back the queen is open the g pawn is open pressure everywhere rook g3 rook f8 long castle and here comes b5 and i mean jose really brave castling with the rooks pressuring with the avalanche coming down but he has a 25sec time advantage he's also half his opponent's age like we can't we we honestly in chess he can't really understate that like it's just the truth and like in scrambles he's going to be a little bit sharper that's just what's going to happen so rout g1 both guys are looking to create their own attacks vladimir plays queen b7 jose plays c4 c4 is going to destabilize a couple of things but it's going to really strengthen in the center and knight takes d6 as a threat by the way in some positions takes takes now what's very unclear about this position is if black is attacking white or not at all that could be a weakness that could be a weakness again if the knight ever gets to a light square the game is just over so queen e7 queen e7 apparently stepping off the file is a bad move and so after queen e7 jose plays rook e3 the idea of rook e3 is to move the queen wasn't the best move apparently the best move was rook a3 rook a4 like i said that pawn is a is a liability for black it's not an asset rook h4 both guys scrambling but one guy has a weaker king so he moves it now jose takes on a4 rook h5 however there's something very important brewing here which has been sort of understated we've talked the entire game about attacking and the kings and opposite side castling but if you just pause right here hit the pause button not actually don't actually pause but if you hit the pause button white has something black doesn't have an a pawn he has a pass pawn and this pawn in an endgame is unstoppable it's unstoppable if you traded the queens and the rooks right now it's game over because black literally will have to crawl to that side of the board so all of a sudden jose has an advantage and he plays a very simple plan he attacks the pawn on d6 and and now a4 he has a 30second time advantage and he has a red carpet he's going to put the rook behind the pawn he's going to push it because this bishop was just a non-factor which i told you about at the very beginning the bishop was going to be a non-factor so a4 a5 jose's got three more squares three if he trades the queen he trades a rook it's just game over the rook is going to come the king is going to come up he's got double coverage rook h4 good move by vlad putting pressure on the knight pawns down two squares away from queening pretty straightforward crck down to 25 seconds plays queen a7 now like i said there's a lot of plans here the best move is f3 defending the knight to enable the movement of the rook instead jose plays king and after you swing and you know f3 suddenly you're being attacked over here so vladimir doesn't see that he plays rook b8 rook a1 but i told you this was always the plan right i mean the plan is just to invest in the pawn and vladimir can't do much rook f4 rook a3 right again the plan is rook a3 maybe to trade the rook maybe to play f3 just kind of safeguard everything rook b6 and vladimir bl blunders he blunders he loses the game loses the game on the spot because you can just sacrifice the queen you just go here and sometimes this is possible sometimes when you have a rook escorting a pawn and you have very deep coverage in the opponent's territory you can just sacrifice remove the blockader and a7 and white's king is completely safe this is protected which is protected the there's no way to get to the king vlad plays queen b4 and this is a check you can panic or you can just make a new queen be a big boy queen c4 and there's no more checks queen f1 knight d2 you can take and just rook f3 and that's it and jose trades the rooks and this is easy rook f3 is not only an attack on the queen it's also a skewer and it's going to be mate momentarily because again there are no checks honestly overall relatively smooth game and the guy's rated 3,100 all right in no way shape or form did i look at this game and go oh that was he cheated like that's not that would never ever cross my mind why because he played an opening that he plays literally thousands of times it was a pretty straightforward game i mean the h4 plan like you know g he lost the advantage it was very complicated back and forth but when it's simplified at the end of the day it was good night versus bad bishop that was what happened and you know suddenly in this position it became very clear that taking the pawn and pushing the a pawn was going to win it just sort of seemed like this game came down to a few critical moments never in a million years would i look at this and it was one blunder with 15 seconds on the clock it happens you know okay that's that so jose beat him and then they played a few hours later so this is the game you'll recognize the end game this is the game that callused the clip that said i'm not going to play him anymore online i'm only going to play him over the board and then we set that up okay so they played online by the way this might look familiar this looking familiar let's see where they deviated e5 oh ah okay so this morning in this position karnick went for g6 he played a slow game right he played it very slowly he did not touch the d pawn well later in the day he did a little homework obviously so he showed up and he said you know what jose you are not going to close the position we're going to open board you're not going to get to play me in a in in this type of thing oh pawn takes d5 queen d queen e2 and d3 slowly right controlling the movement of these pawns castles knight bd2 position looks completely ridiculous by the way like it looks so silly we teach beginners not to play like this not to shove their bishops backwards you know shuffle like the piece three times in the opening none of that matters because black can't actually do anything black can't punish you so kranck plays actively right jose puts the knight smack in the center which is a nice looking move c4 doesn't work you take it attacks the queen so rook d8 i mean karnick is doing absolutely everything right and and so here again jose plays bishop g5 you'll remember bishop g5 to take the knight yeah he did it in the previous game as well so even though the position is different the idea is overlab because one guy has played this position like a thousand times so he plays bishop g5 right k goes here and i don't think jose has to do this but he does he takes because black either takes and ruins the king or takes like this and now the bishop is bad and so here jose plays a very interesting idea a very very interesting idea he plays g4 okay he spends 17 seconds on this move i mean this move is is is wild again not castling ready to just walk his opponent down with the pawns and controlling the light squares the same strategy he had in this game controlling the light squares it's clearly a central idea of the opening whether the center is open or not b5 very principled by vladimir he's trying to undermine the stability of the white position h4 threatening h5 threatening g5 it's not even a matter of take like if you take this end game is just slightly worse for black because the knight is kind of stuck and white's bishop will be better you'll kind of instigate you know black can play like b4 but this structure is always better for white you shove the bishop back you play rook d1 you put the bishop on d5 you just have an endgame advantage forever because this knight can't get in that's it that's literally the advantage c4 and the sides are clashing vladimir is trying to punish jose he's trying to play as aggressively as possible punish jose for his strange play right jose captures vladimir takes and like i said we go to an end game we go to an end game jose plays h5 and gets this and i just talked to you about this end game slightly different version but again the knight cannot get in white is going to be slightly better forever white has a bad pawn but it's very easy to protect rook b1 also you can castle also so after you castle you can put a rook on e2 this bishop is going to get shoved backwards right so rook d6 now a big question is do you trade bishop for knight no this bishop is a monster and this bishop is stuck behind his pawns which is the same thing that happened in this game the bishop was stuck behind his pawns because that's life okay these these positions they have overlapping themes i'm just saying like they they look similar rook d1 why rook d1 because after you trade white is going to just try to win this pawn that is literally all white is going to tried to rook d8 take stakes king up now the question is would you trade the second rook knight a5 is the best move rook d1 try to win the end game it might be because otherwise what do you do you could play g5 bishop d8 what's the next move if you don't play rook d1 how do you get rid of you can't take this because if you take this i get my bishop in the game me personally i might consider g6 but there's no need the best move believe it or not is simply to trade the rooks jose plays like this because he can't lose he plays like this because black's winning chances have now dropped to zero you can't win this with black it's not winable you got a massive weakness which you're probably going to lose in a second because it's on the same color square as my bishop and if the chess gods are willing they will save the game for black but black can't win bishop h7 now vladimir could have played h6 but after bishop d5 and bringing the king he can't move you just can't move in fact there may be a distant future where you get your knight trapped with something like b4 how are you saving your knight your knight is literally trapped on the edge of the board so this is very very bad very bad king f8 jose is now up a pawn now he shoves the bishop back now he's up this spawn right by the way taking that might have not even been the best but he does reactivates black's position and now just knight f3 back and cr down two pawns i mean i can't really explain this to you in in in any cleaner than i already am this is a pretty straightforward game white has two extra pawns bishop g6 knight d2 we'll see if vladimir can make a comeback knight f1 knight e3 both guys have about 30 seconds but now very simple knight d5 check you take you take because you're up you have five pawns he has three now the plan is very easy boop boop boop or boop or boop that's it black just can't defend himself and that is exactly what jose does relatively straightforward game vladimir resigns say he's not going to play him anymore this was march 5th their very next game i think was a week later march 12th he resigned this made news and we decided we got to start talking about getting these two to play a match and that is how the idea of the clash of claims was born all right and a friendly reminder
