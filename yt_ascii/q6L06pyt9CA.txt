previously on numberphile, james grime made a video about stacking cannonballs and i'm a big fan. he told the brilliant story about raleigh asking harriot to work out how many cannonballs he had in a pile, but he did not mention the number 4,900 which has at one point been my favourite number. there's the elite club of numbers, which have been my favourite number at some point in time. (brady: it seems bigger than doesn't - its not a small club) it's not a small club - it is still exclusive!
- (brady: it's finite) it's finite, exactly which is tiny, compared to all and roughly zero percent of numbers are in that club. there's a lot of numbers. for a while, my favourite number was 3,435. so i'm gonna be talking about my favourite number at the moment which is the number 2025. one of my favourite numbers is 16. when harriot sat down and did the working out for the cannonballs he came up with the great equation that you end up with: n outside of n+1, outside of 2n+1, divide that by 6. so for a stack of cannonballs n high, that's how many cannonballs you've got in there. and people looked at that for a while went okay that's kinda fun, after raleigh had done his work people were like, well, that's a square based pyramid, what if they were just in a square? (brady: as in like a cube?)
- just like a big old flat square on the ground. and so people started to wonder they said hang on, hang on. can you find some other number, squared, which gives you a square based pyramid? this is it - 4900. so this was in'75. lucas, of lucas number fame - what a guy! best numbers. "and that's why i think the lucas numbers are vastly superior". fibonacci did nothing on this, right. lucas found 4900, which can be a cannonball stack. so like james showed you could take these and put them in a square based pyramid 24 layers high - perfect square based pyramid. or you could arrange them into a giant square 70x70 flat. and it turns out it's the only number that can do that. how exciting is that, right? so - and it wasn't proved until 1918, someone managed to prove 4900 is the only number which can be both a square and a square based pyramid which is why it's called "the cannonball number". (brady: cool!) the next question should be: are there any others? right? because i've just said it's the only square and square based pyramid. (brady: well, then, why would there be a question about are there any others?) (like you've told me, you've told me there's no others.)
-  james showed us there are other ways to stack things. you can have different based pyramids (brady: ahhhh) when i first saw this, big fan of lucas, i was like, oh, that's great. really cool. new favourite number for a while. and then i was like wait what about other based pyramids? so i wrote a little computer program because - i mean this one is easy enough. there's your formula which will give you number of cannonballs in a stack of a certain height, that's the formula for the area of a square - very straightforward. there are more complicated formulas for the area of a pentagon or a hexagon or an octagon of cannonballs. the pyramid is just sequential adding up all of those numbers in a row. so what this number actually is, it's the only square number which is also the sum of a sequence of square numbers starting at 1. so i was looking for other "shape numbers" whatever-agon numbers which are also the some of those same -agon numbers starting from 1. same shape all the way. (brady: my hope is that for each shape and its accompanying pyramid, there's a 1 number for each of them) oh, wouldn't that be great? ok, pentagon's - none. (brady: definitely?) well, i can't prove there are none but i couldn't find any. i gave it a go, couldn't find pentagons. found a hexagon! 946. you could take those cannonballs and put them into one giant hexagon with sides of twenty-two cannonballs down every single side or you could rearrange them into a hexagonal based pyramid 11 high. and there's only 1 so there you are! (brady: but there could be another one floating out, how high did you go?) errr not that high. [laughs] i can't remember exactly, i got bored. and then i wrote another bit of code. so i only found 1 although i got some bad news about octagons - there are 2. okay, i got 1,045 and i've got 5985. they both can form an octagon and they both can form an octagon based pyramid. so uh, sadly there was more than one. 
- (brady: does that make you sad or happy, that, that discovery?) i was kind of happy, because it was not what i expected, right? because i set it going and then it spat out only one for hexagon, none for a heptagon and then boom - 2 for octagon. and then i was like well, how far can we go? lets just set it going. so i coded it up, i hit go and i went to bed. and then i woke up the next morning and staring me in the face was: 90 billion, 525 million, 801 thousand, 730, which is a 31,265-agon number. it can either be arranged as one giant 31,265-agon, and each side would have 2407 cannonballs each, for each of the 31265 sides, or you can make a 31,265-agon pyramid which is 259 levels high. so this number works for both the shape and the pyramid for this ridiculous sized shape. and i found it first, right, so that number - i don't think anyone else had ever bothered doing this, right? so this number has existed since the beginning of time, as all numbers have, and it just sat there waiting for one day someone with enough spare time and a laptop to discover it. and so i walked out in the morning, i looked on my laptop, and this number was smiling back at me and i was like you've been waiting a long time number, but someone finally came for you. someone finally came for the 31265-agonal number which is also a 31265-agon based pyramid. (brady: matt? 
- yeah? 
- (seriously) (i'm proud of you!)
- really? is this what it took? i know i was so pleased when - i was like, that's mine, i found that, and it's cool. it's not useful but i love it! and so that's when 4,900 stopped being my favourite number and i upgraded to just over 90 billion. so the people whose names you're seeing on screen at the moment, these are supporters. they help us make better videos, make more videos, put music in them, pay for animation... if you'd like to join them there are links on the screen and down in the video description. and if you want to show matt parker some extra love why don't you consider his book, humble pi - this is what it looks like, it's all about mathematical mistakes. it's a great read, it's becoming a best-seller, which is unusual for a mathematical book. use the link down in the video description if you want to get a signed copy from matt. at the time of recording the book hasn't yet been released in the united states. but - and this is just between us - you can get it using that link.
