finance bros and stock pickers on tv and youtube love to tell you guys where to put your money but the dirty secret of this industry is that they are very often raw so today i want to show you guys what happens when overconfidence gets met with reality so i grabbed a financial analyst found the worst finance predictions that aged like milk immediately after and today we're just gonna play a referee and have fun with this and rate them how bad of a call were they really let's begin ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode of the coffeezilla christmas i'm your host coffeezilla in the 10 million dollar studio today we have a very special guest richard coffin of the plain bagel he's an investment analyst say hi hello guys how's it going coffee thank you for having me on absolutely let's begin very strong earnings these stocks are they do i don't even know them what do they do excuse me what is upstart too well i'm i'm i'm sorry what kind of company is it yeah i'm not you're you're breaking up oh well i guess we've got an audio problem there i don't think it's an audio problem that's that's a bad call i think we can agree that i wanted to start with the baseline that's a bad call that's pretty close to it as pretty close to a 10 as you can get i think yeah we're doing a one to ten scale one is bad luck it could have happened to anybody a 10 is a bad call that's just a bad call that hurts me to watch that it's i feel genuine pain yeah it's your job as an investment analyst to know what these stocks are that's why you go on shows like this this guy ostensibly is some kind of a expert right my guess would be he's like a technical analyst to some degree like more short term and there are technical analysts who like don't really care what the company does they just look at the charts and stuff but i mean i think you'd like google the company before you know yeah exactly that's it makes me lose a bit of faith in financial journalism all right dude we're calling that a bad call i think that's a 10 that's a 10 for me bad up next we're going to look at some of the historical bad takes that aged like milk starting with the dot-com bubble the investment bank's stock analysts went on television and touted stock after stock after stock at the heart of it was the mad scramble by bankers and venture capitalists to take hundreds of unprofitable young internet companies public say the internet is so revolutionary that the usual rules for valuing a stock such as revenues and earnings no longer apply [applause] profits don't matter anymore it's sometimes sales don't even matter which is which is encouraging you know what i've heard recently actually i've heard the same argument being like propped up again by crypto by certain i just talked to a guy finance guy he's like yeah i think meme coins like they don't need to do anything they're valuable because of the meme i was like that's exactly like what these guys are saying hey if you if you're hype enough you don't need profits you don't need to do anything that's going to be the next iteration of the cfa curriculum when you become a financial analyst chartered financial analyst it's going to be you know measuring the memeology of stocks and discounted mean flows yeah yeah that's kind of mean plus i love that yeah okay well i'm gonna go ahead and say another pretty that's a bad call pretty bad yeah some people can argue when it comes to starting off not making money is okay as long as they're gonna keep growing but you know if sales don't matter profits don't matter then nothing matters nothing the memes matter i guess all right let's see the next one what do we have up here so this is richard quest i believe he was a bnn business journalist at the time and he's talking about the the dot-com companies at the time by the way this is documentary from 1999 so like the year before the the bubble burst so it's it's it's a chef's kiss type of clip i'm not normally described of as described as perverse but you've got to be perverse to say the market's going to crash it may have a major correction but with low inflation low unemployment low interest rates strong corporate earnings i would be a certifiable lunatic if i said the market was going to crash [music] wow [music] why the slo-mo [music] god bless so bad this is not a fad this is a revolution that's affecting the way we do business and live our lives and that's why it's so profitable wow so this was a year before the the burst 1999 yeah yeah right before the crash glove.com was like one of the most famous dot com bursts like it was i think it's a record for the biggest ipo basically like a social media company at the time you know he's right about the internet like obviously he's right it's not a fad it ended up changing our lives right you'd have to be insane to say there's going to be a crash coming literally the year before it happens yeah i i'm kind of more of a five with this one right i'm more in the middle i would i would give it maybe a like a a six or a seven just because you have to be a certifiable lunatic i'd have to be a certified that's true it's a little aggressive yeah it's so aggressive but you're absolutely you're right there is there's a certain luck element to where he could have said that in a year but doing it right before the crash that's incredible he said something about earnings like the dot-com bubble famously like earnings weren't there like and you know it kind of touched on it earlier like analysts were saying no profits don't matter right now so that was kind of misguided like saying you know that's why there's so much money being made well there wasn't actually that much like maybe for investors at the time and investment banks especially but you know not really for the com companies themselves so wow okay well i think i think we're roughly on the same page there our next clip we got here is from 2006 right before the big crash a warning was given let's see if they listen 45 unemployment rate gdp is growing the demographics in other words family formations all the things that factor into housing playing in here and as that is why we might not have to crash most of the profits that people have in real estate are going to vanish just like the profits in the in the dot coms in 1999 2000. it's a fantasy people can't sell their house the inventories are exploding all over that guy's so smug it's pissing me off it's making that's so fast that's the face everyone imagines when they think of the finance industry i think oh laughing no you think this is gonna ever end no we're gonna the party's gonna keep going houses are on the market for six months a year there's no bidders so the prices are gonna fall through the floor you guys were diluting yourself we heard it loud and clear we have two people here right we have peter schiff who's actually making the accurate statement but peter schiff is kind of like known as being a perma bear like he's negative nine out of ten days yeah and he's always peddling things like gold and stuff so you know take out the grain of salt but you know with 2008 warning signs in 2006 and talking about essentially what played out and then we have mike norman i think his name is and just hard to watch this guy right here right the guy who's like what what so what yeah i'm gonna go ahead and say this is a tin bad call on his part because here he is literally someone's reading him his rights as far as like hey this is exactly what's going to happen and he's like what it's going to be fine yeah it's it's over confidence at it it's sort of like yeah home prices are up therefore they will always be up like that's rarely ever held in in economic history but again one of those things really age like milk give it a score here so i'm gonna give it an eight there were warning signs but also you know times were good and money was being made but also that laugh i'll bump it up to a nine just from that laughing all right next meme not a meme next clip it's without being flippant to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions wait what am i watching here and who is cassano this guy's face is unbelievable so this is joseph cassano he was an executive at aig which was one of the companies that really proliferated the issues of the dot com the 2008 financial crisis not to get too technical but they sold credit default swaps which were one of the things behind the financial crisis and that's what he's talking about he's saying you know without being flipping it's hard to say hard to imagine that we lose any money on these financial products they were essentially insurance contracts on things like mortgages so when mortgages started defaulting imagine an insurance you know provider having to pay out millions of millions all at once for all these institutions that's effectively what we're seeing in 2007. it's called the 2008 financial crisis the warning signs were coming up in 2007 that's when things started to default that's when people started to realize oh there's an issue here kind of late in the game to say that you don't expect to lose any money yeah i'm finding a lot of these i'm just finding these to be bad but maybe it's all because of hindsight i'm gonna give this a seven i'm gonna give it a nine next clip oh this is gonna be good oh i'm excited about this one should i be worried about bear stearns in terms of liquidity and get my money out there no no no bear stearns is fine do not take your money out this is real if there's one takeaway other than a plus 400 somewhere bear stearns is not in trouble i mean if anything they're more likely to be taken over don't move your money from fair that's just being silly don't be silly don't be silly oh no here we go bear stearns shares down 90 this morning and it's not just bear pretty much every single bank don't take your money out of air if anything they're going to be taken over oh gosh jim cramer that's rough i think so bear stearns they were taken over by jp morgan at 10 and i think they were at around 100 before things really hit the fan so pretty bad call yeah jim cramer this this was a rough one and i think he tried to paper over it later but there's no the clip the proof is in the clip and then there's the the second clip which is kind of like a follow-up to that so we saw the bear stearns clip kind of lesson from that learning from jim cramer you want to sell low right right once things have hit their bottom that's when you sell out this is the second half of that you know that's only half the statement and this was after the 2008 financial crisis so for investors what is your advice today okay whatever money you may need for the next five years please take it out of the stock market right now this week i do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock market even if you would take a tremendous loss and selling your stocks at this decline you say take it out i don't care i do not care where stocks are i do not care where stocks have been i care where they're going but if you need it after five years then don't touch it well yes she kind of she tossed him a bit of a life jacket with that you know what about after five years he's like oh yeah it's like you know i kind of in finance kind of a rule of thumb is if you're if you need the money in the next five years not to put in the stock market like let's say it's a down payment i think she was kind of like throwing him a life jack to be like oh but what about after five years but selling everything you need for the next five at the bottom sell it all at the bottom buy high and sell low right that's nice that's how you make money right jim cramer he has a bad reputation i don't want to be too harsh on him compared to like the aig and stuff i'm gonna give him six or seven i think it's a little alarmist and and obviously that's not good financial advice that's kind of how everyone was feeling at that time so i don't wanna no mercy dude this guy has deep finance backgrounds i'm giving him a 10 out of 10 bad calls all right so far we've seen a lot of bad calls a lot of age-like milk moments but this next one hasn't aged like milk yet we're going to find out this is a present call this is very recent let's see what you think about this one richard i want to hear your take all right of course worries of relationships between el salvador and the imf does any of that matter to some of the investors that you're talking to no i don't think a lot of these organizations like the imf or world bank are really relevant in the world based on on bitcoin they're only relevant because they can print money they can make the sdr you know they can make money out of thin air you can't do that on a bitcoin standard oops i'm going to have to go ahead and call a foul on that one that's a red card i think i just i just want to point out to everyone if you missed it he's wearing a tether shirt while saying at the same time oh the imf can just print money that they're irrelevant they're relevant to bitcoin they can just print money you can't do that in the bitcoin standard yeah well maybe maybe maybe not we'll find out i mean i think time will quickly tell on the tether debacle but either way i'm i'm going to go ahead and call that a seven or an eight because i don't really know if it's a bad call i'm gonna preemptively call it a bad call but we'll find out all right yeah that's fair i think that's fair and i do love the you know saying the imf is irrelevant you know one of the largest financial bodies in the world and irrelevant dude i'll give it a seven so far you know it is it is preemptive it is preemptive but i've seen i've seen the coffeezilla videos i know i know what's up so all right we'll see fair enough richard while you have gone through the gauntlet looking at these with me thank you for rating them with me now i have someone credible actually doing it and of course my of course genius calls as well and that's basically it i hope you guys at home learned something go follow richard coffin at the plain bagel for some common sense investing education and with that being said ladies and gentlemen that's it i'll see you guys in the next
