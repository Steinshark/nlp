i think a lot of people that that struggle with the beauty aspect of the churches are people that look at let's say the story of christ and look at his crucifixion they look at the the poverty of the images in the gospel and so they're like why then do you have these golden temples and why do you have all this powerful imagery and the truth is that orthodox christianity tends towards fullness tends to like a yes and right we don't have a no but it's like yes and and one of the images that's important in scripture is the eschatological image although christ even in his life the way that he lived very simply and walked you know with sandals on the ground he also presented this vision of the coming of the son of man as this glorious finality where all things will come together this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world so hello everyone it is my great joy to be here with david patrick henry and father turbo this is something that has been preparing itself for quite a while i've been looking forward to meeting father tro we've had a lot of conversations know in in messaging and email and stuff so it's great to finally meet him in person and and so david patrick from the channel of the church of the eternal logos so you can check that out is going to lead the conversation we're going to talk about beauty about icons and so yeah take it away david yeah i was really excited thanks again jonathan for having us on when we talked a little bit about the beauty of logos theology we mentioned that you you had been wanting to stream and have a conversation with father turbo and i have the great fortune of him being both a a spiritual father to me and also a friend and we wanted to talk a little bit about aesthetics orthodox beauty iconography and all these things and i thought it was perfect for you guys to come together because both of you have done iconography and both of you you again jonathan with your work with the symbolic world has touched on these topics at nauseum i guess you could say but to begin just for father turbo i thought he could kind of set the foundation of how is beauty and aesthetics under understood and utilized in the orthodox church when protestants engage times they would make claims that we're over ornate that we worship pieces of wood that we you know we we worship idols and all this different stuff and they don't understand why aesthetics and beauty is important to our liturgical worship to the church to our theology and how we engage and participate with god and i so i thought to open it up and we can go anywhere is father turbo could lay out exactly how aesthetics work and in the greek greek word symbo sim balo throwing together two realities that a symbol from an orthodox worldview is so much more than just a sort of an empty meaningless thing as you've talked about jonathan but it's it's the bringing together of two realities and so father if you could then lead us into how aesthetics are understood from an orthodox fra well i think the first thing to understand is that it's about leading us into reality which is god and the incarnational aspect of it is absolutely imperative but i think sometimes we stop short because we'll look at an icon of let's say you know this is very common you give a tour in a temple and you know every priest is done this every you know lay lay leader has done this and you kind of break down the iconas if you're blessed to have a a a dome with a ponto icon in the dome you're blessed to be able to you know have those not every church has those unfortunately on on a kind of like majestic scale but you say like oh you know christ the incarnation and this is all very good you know but i think it isn't just about the incarnation meaning the logos becoming flesh but it's also about us being brought into the life of god and that incarnational aspect you know think of it going both ways i think is key because worship is a about this bringing in of the finite the created the broken into you know infinity eternity into the you know never actually reaching but being able to be drawn and approach the uncreated being broken and being brought to healing those are all things that you know aesthetics the aesthetics of the church facilitates it brings us to a place of not just the abstract of theology but the the real tangible which is what we need to be healed to experience love and symbol does all of that in a shorthand you know i i try to instruct people when they think about symbol in the life of the church you know it's it is imbued with something higher than itself and so when we encounter a cross we can look at a cross and you know a whole unfolding of understanding happens you know in a mill second so it's a shorthand that brings us into increasingly deeper levels of meaning and experience and that and it's really a bringing in and i think that's really key because when we view the icon or when we view architecture in the church when we also you know it isn't just visually when we experience chant you know there's something that happens to you when you're in a service and then you hear the e song you know the e song is the kind of like low droning note for those who don't know what that is enchant and then just all of these you know this this wave of of melody that's melismatic and it's just it's undulating and it's just it's living and and it brings you into this heavenly space that's all a part of it and it's all a part of being brought being drawn you know invited into into god and so so that's that's its purpose and it and it's done in such a way to communicate the ineffable to us that which is you know beyond our normal way of being able to articulate understand and that's what i mean by layers of of meaning and really love and experience this is what symbol does it's this you know however you want to call it bridge you know comic book fans will call it a boom tuo i however you want to look at it it just brings you to this place and that's that's what it's always been and especially for us now in this modern time it's it's even more so a rich experience because we are inundated with a plethora of images we're inundated with a plethora of sounds and there's something so cle it's cleansing it's cathartic it's it's it brings us to this this place that i think although we suffer in many ways from lots of things that you know the ancient people didn't have and the ancient people where this aesthetic was was formed through we have a unique blessing in the sense that we can in some ways appreciate it on a different level because we're coming from a place of of absence we're coming from a place of being you know like i said inundated and it helps us to see this one thing which is beauty is the revelation of christ and i think that's you know the kind of period i would put on it it's it is the revelation of christ and everything from you know harmony symmetry you know and even you know areas where there isn't symmetry even those reveal christ so that's how i would explain it you know well and i love that you talked about the symbol is it bringing it into ourselves because it connected with a stream that we did on the devil's iconography which is a famous quote of father s from r talking about pornography but then through these black mirrors our our phones that we're seeing that especially those who aren't of careful discernment spiritually that they're they're bringing in demonic iconography within themselves and it's it's impure as you talked about a sort of purifying effect of true beauty i think we're also seeing an attack on aesthetics within our society at multiple levels and this is affecting the interior reality the spiritual reality of people themselves i know this something that jonathan has spoke about a little bit father tro i think he really brought it all together maybe a thing in terms of helping especially christians that don't understand why it looks the way it does or why it is the way it is in our church i think a lot of people that that struggle with the beauty aspect of the churches are people that look at they's say the story of christ and look at his crucifixion they look at the the poverty of the images and in the gospel and how christ lived a simple life you know with fishermen and so they're like why why then do you have these golden temples and why do you have all this powerful imagery and the truth is that orthodox christianity is tends towards fullness tends to like a yes and right we don't have a no but it's like yes and and one of the images that's important in scripture is the eschatological image that is the way that although christ even in his life the way that he lived very simply and walked you know with with sandals on the on the ground he also presented this vision of the coming of the son of man as this glorious finality we all things will come together and the glory of the throne will be will be shown and you know and the the the the authority and the glory of god will fill the world right you see that already in the prophetic text even before the the coming of christ right that the glory of god will fill the entire earth and that is what we are that is what we are participating in in our church service we are participating an eschatological reality which is piercing in know piercing in from the future piercing in from the final revelation and giving us a glimpse of of how we can participate in that glory and so many people they like why are you doing this old testament stuff like you know why are you why are you still doing like the old testament now that jesus has come that's changed but the image of the church is not based on the old testament as much as based on the book of revelation and that's true even from the early churches if you go to rome and you see the very early churches that were were built in the 4th century they have eschatological motif you know they they they're representing the 24 elders and you see you see christ on the throne and there's a sense in which that's what the liturgy has always been calling us to participate in and so in some ways it's the proper ordering of reality when you read the the heavenly jerusalem you have this beautiful vision of how civilization how all the activities of humans you know architecture music the the relationship of the natural and the artificial all of this is properly ordered in glory to god and that is what we that is what we're participating in when we when we go to church and i think that that's really important to understand because the thing even in terms of the idea of beauty and of ornament and of proper ordering and all this stuff these are all things that exist also we have to understand it's like one of the things that that happens is that you know if you look at the the the early bond period for example when people started criticizing the christian church and the excesses of the christian church all of a sudden all that ornament and all that excess got put into stateb built things right and so that ex that desire to celebrate and to kind of lift up and to make beauty and to make even like even to to to a certain excess is something that's part of our of our nature and if we don't dedicated to god we're going to end up dedicating it to something else and you're going to start you're going to start with this is how bad it is it's like you're going to start with making government buildings ornade and huge and beautiful and you're g to end with some pop star looking like decked out like queen with gold and and jewels and everything right that's how you end and so you start you start with you want to remove that glory given to god and you end up with like an image of a kind of [ __ ] that that is completely you know decked out and make up put excessively ornamented right and so we have to be able to direct our desire for for that kind of exuberant beauty in the right in the right place yeah i think you make a great point in regards you you don't get away from the ornation in society one way or another but it's actually of a selflessness when we give it back to the church when we give it back to god and we give the as as as much as we can do in a temporal setting the beauty the transcendent beauty and i wrote down timeless objectivity because as you pointed to the sort of eschatological dimension the piercing of beauty inside of a parish or personal relationships wherever people encounter it insinuates the objectivity of beauty the objectivity of morality and the objectivity of the truth which is a who not a what it's jesus christ he is truth incarnate and so the ornation isn't something that is paganistic or idolatry it's actually actually something that we want to give the best back to god and we want to live in sort of that transcendent beauty that beautiful reality and you look at protestant societies and as you said they don't have saints so then beyonce johnny depp the hollywood celebrities the stars elevate themselves as now the the role models the leaders for those in those societies to look towards to orient themselves in society and like you said the ornamentation now is due to you know these these modernist asymmetrical art museums or these new understandings of of beauty this is a displacement of the lack of true aesthetics within i would say protestant worship not that there aren't great people of course there are but you look at the the m the mundaneness of many of the inside of their churches i think that that that that instinct and that pursuit for beauty then gets transposed to the world and not back to god which is the ultimate offering and i think that's really key because the instinct is in everyone and that's part of the problem it has its points depending on you know what we're talking about especially like in a pical sense in regards of something being pagan or christian but i i think especially in this sense it's important to realize that you know why did why do pagans you know what quote unquote pagans right people little citizens you know why why would they have beauty because it's it's innate in us because god created us and the awareness this is one of the things in regards of having a disposition very much like what john was saying about you know yes you know and both and in the sense that you know recognizing god as creator and you know god is and being able to see god in the other person but also in their expressions and even if they are devoid of you know truth and to a greater degree you know obviously the truth and the awareness of who christ is you can still see the imprint of god in that and and i think that's really important because this idea that when you know it's funny jonathan said that because it i had this i got transported back in time i had a friend i remember during my time of conversion i think we were just made cumans at the time and i had a good good friend and i i invited her to a service and there was already contention it's like what is this you know i heard you're becoming orthodox like what does all this mean and i remember just her you know kind of being in shock and and on i remember especially you know the great entrance happens and then she like got up and left you know she just she got up and left in little c i was like wow that's that's i don't know what happened you know so i didn't you know what's wrong you know and after the entrance i you know went to go talk with her and she said you know christ wouldn't christ wouldn't do all this and i remember her saying that to me and i remember feeling so sad not just because my friend got up and walked out the service but be but because this reality that christ is ruling and reigning now that that's what made me sad because i knew she loved god you know as and as best as she could as what she understood and that that is a very powerful thing to be able to recognize the potential for people to experience the god that already is you know kind of imbued them with the desire and the ability to pursue truth and beauty and i think this goes all the way even back to when we're talking about with like well why you doing all this old testament stuff well even that had the eschatological reach even that was the echo from heaven even there and i think this is really key because when people set up this kind of dialectic of like well well you do it this way do it that way it it it's they lose this reality that this is about revelation that although yes you know certain aesthetic from a period of time you know that we call quote unquote byzantine right but the reality is is that those are just the means by which god is revealing himself to us and one of the things that the church does through her aesthetic is trains her trains her people you know trains the people of god to have an increasingly astute accurate pure but expansive view because we will never be able to contain you know we'll forever be approaching the fullness of god and so if we find our vision becoming you know more and more limited and circumscribed we have to be careful that it isn't really about becoming more accurate but maybe we are losing we're going in the wrong way if that makes sense you know because one of the things that you learn when you enter into orthodox worship if you're not orthodox is it's incredibly familiar and incredibly foreign at the same time how is that possible and that paradox that tension that's a very spiritual thing being able to keep that tension and i think that's one of the things about are being quote unquote orthodox in this modern time is that we can see it's like another example i remember taking one of my kids to the bank for whatever reason greatest greatest you know kind of anecdotal story but you know my my daughter she's like i think she was like 11 at the time she's like this looks like a church right like the way the way it was decorated you know it had this you know it had a very art deco feel to it but art deco has this kind of very byzantine aesthetic baked into to it right and so she could just discern that naturally you know and i said well yeah i told her i i told her this is a temple but it's a temple to mammon you know and so we kind of had a little bible story there while we're waiting for the teller but my point with these stories is that it's it's already in people and and i think for a lot of people outside of the tradition you know in love it's this this dialectic like well you guys just kind of invented this and you just kind of take this took this from the pagans and it's like okay even even that even that even if that is the case what you i think are missing my friend is that god who created all things this is this is the revelation of how he's getting back to i s earlier drawing us closer you know yeah and but it's important to to understand like you you you said about this woman who said christ wouldn't do this you know and and when you talk about the paradox in the orthodox tradition we do have that paradox very strongly represented which is we both have the aesthetic living in a cave you know eating like carrots every day or whatever for the for his entire life and we also have you know constantinople and hagya sophia and the the absolute glory of of of this eschatological vision and the truth is that those two not only can coexist but in some ways they reinforce each other right it's like we if we only had the the the great celebration and the kind of royal aspect of the tradition we would we could you could say that we would have something missing but that's not how it is we we have and you see it sometimes like you know you you see it we pay attention to this if if people who are careful you'll see some priest like come to the parish you know and you can see like his ratty this ratty thing and and it's like you he's got his hat and it's all fraying and it's like is like is like you know it's like you can see and he's got he's got his prayer rope that it's like it's kind of slick from the oil of his fingers or whatever right and it's like you know you see the the the priest come in and then and then he puts on right the vestment and then he enters into the worship and and part participates in this glorious thing but it's like that's the that's the contrast you know and it's it's a very important contrast to have it's as strong as the contrast between the cross and the throne of christ which are both true and both re manifest the fullness of what christ brought to us and so it's important to understand it even in terms of what you said in terms of the city for example like this idea of of bringing in the pagan elements into the know the image that that we see in revelation is the image of the city being converted right it's like the holy city now becoming a vehicle and it says in scripture in revelation it talks about the heavenly jerusalem it says the kings of all nations brought their glory into the heavenly jerusalem right and so the glory of all the nations is brought into the heavenly jerusalem so it means that it's not it doesn't oppose that which is good in all the cult cultures in all in all the world it's rather that the best of rome the best of different cultures can be brought in as an offering to become a vehicle for a participation in the heavenly liturgy so you both have this image that the the image of the liturgy is a representation of the the the description in revelation of the angels that are surrounding the throne and are sensing and and doing all these things that that we do in church but then also of the heavenly jerusalem that which is happening on earth as this image of because a lot of the forms that we have in church it's true they're roman right they come from rome a lot of the architecture a lot of the even some of the vestments uh there are certain things that have brought in from rome but that is the image in the book of revelation right there's both there's two rs you could say in revelation there's the [ __ ] which is the evil aspect of the city the evil aspect of of civilization that beast and that [ __ ] together but then there's also this other image of all of human activities bringing up their glory in service of god yeah you speak go ahead father i just want to say i think it's important too to kind of like dive you know kind of drop down a couple thousand feet and even just looking at the fact that the quote unquote again byzantine right roman the aesthetic even that is a synthesis you know when we when we experience it it it isn't just this kind of pure aesthetic just that popped out of any where it doesn't have you know influences from different nations i mean what jonathan just brought up about the eological aspect i mean works i think what i'm what i'm failing at trying to get across too is that that you we're experiencing that now to a veil degree or whatever you however you would put it because even in regards of the aesthetic of the church there are these sematic influences asian influen persian influences and you know this is one this is one of the things that when you see that already you're already seeing it if you see what i did right there like you're already seeing it happen and i think this is really key because one of the big problems when we veer too far one way with something is that we we we miss some of the details that are very important like for instance one of the things that i you know i don't do them as much but i used to do lectures and iconography like a lot and one of the things that i would do that would just you know kind of scandalize people i would talk to them about fume portraits f portraiture and i mean it without fail especially at that time this isn't like the like mid like 2005 2006 2007 and i would you know do these slideshows and i'd show them and i talk well you know the about the origins of the quote unquote byzantine style you know quote unquote and you know some people would start getting kind of uncomfortable you could see it in their eyes because they have this idea that it just kind of like drops out of nowhere drops out of heaven yeah you know what i mean and and it doesn't and it it it is this which god always does right god takes the synthesis of of human failed yes and fallen yes but but human effort human experience and he wields it together he baptized it he purifies it he illumin it he imbus it with his love with his presence that's what the love of god is it's his presence if god shines his presence on you it's because he loves you how you how you respond to that that's a different thing but it's it's always out of his love and we see that revelation is a very unitive one of the effects of the revelation of god is it's unitive it brings it brings synthesis it brings things together because that is the repentance that's the undoing of the fall that dis that dis unification on a lot of levels it's taking seemingly disperate parts and bringing them into harmony and i think that's one of the things that maybe should be emphasized a little bit more because as the world you know and i mean it like the world like the passions you know in the flesh and the fallen world and all that and and the fallen powers are are continually seeking to imitate to even greater and greater degree the life of the church and and the the glory of god for the sake of deception and all these things it's important that we discern that you know ultimately you know the love of god is is what could never be triumphed over and that love it it conquers you know love covers a multitude of sins but in this sense the the the problematic multiplicity which jonathan has talked about at you know at death and at nause but that problematic multiplicity of culture and and all those things it it really does get reconciled in the church i mean st john the baptist the holy mother of god always on the iconostas i mean right male female the aesthetic the heavenly queen like right there it's it's always there for us to see andrew ghoul the architect has pointed out to what extent hagya sopia is persian like that that even in like the sixth century they have a roman building it's still a roman building clearly it and but that a lot of the ornamentation was brought in from persia and there seems to have been this this desire like you said to to bring in things and to join them in synthesis it's like it's the opposite of mixture it's the opposite of confusion right confusion is when disperate things don't play together towards a common goal that's when you have confusion so you have a bunch of different things and they're doing their own thing and they're not coming together towards towards towards purpose whereas synthesis is when you do have several things but they're all let's say kind of dancing together and you can feel that they're joining towards a common a common purpose and so christians are not how can i say this like christians are not against or for diversity and and against against the idea of different things it's rather how is it that they come together in love in participation in the life of christ that's all really that matters you know and and the liturgy ultimately plays that that that great role like you said like if you look at the iconostasis and even the way in which we we are like we are the people you know saying the amen there's the choir there's the there's the there are the priests and the clergy and there's all these elements and they're all they're all in a great dance you know they're all coming together in the worship of god well and i wanted to pick up on a comment that you said a few ago in regards to the tension between beauty and aestheticism jonathan and i think that we look at the contemporary culture and i totally agree with you that's what the church does it holds the both and together and i when you're talking what popped in my mind is that the growth in hedonism and pleasure seeking actually erodes the beautiful tension and distinction between beauty and asceticism and as we become more hedonistic one we can look at the informal of our society i mean it's stark contrast to look at the beginning of the 20th century on how the average person dressed verse in the beginning of the 21st century and again the the informal of the way we dress the informal of the way we talk to each other but maintaining boundaries something that i kind of reap on a lot and harp on a lot on my channel is that this is the point of the logos is that it maintains the order it maintains the boundaries between things and that i would argue moving forward at least what we're seeing in culture is this continual dissolution of boundaries and distinctions between things and so as formalism breaks down as boundaries break down you're talking about how discipline is tied to the coming of a forward purpose well we're living in a culture where discipline is under the under attack essentially meritocracy is under attack that we have new understandings of the way that we move through our societies and that beauty and asceticism are necessary because if you just have beauty you're going to end up in hedonism you're going to end up in in overindulgence which we could look at the roman empire we can look at the american empire we can look at our own context and culture and so i think again the the church what it does is it holds these things in the proper context and that beauty is true and beauty is morally right and morality is true and beautiful and that all the the good true and the beautiful they play on each other and i think pleasure in the per in the lack of the crucifying of our own will is actually leading to the eroding of all these things in our society to one degree or another and you you'll see it's interesting because you know that image that i proposed at the at at some point when i talked about the priest that comes in you know kind of you know a little ratty and a little kind of disheveled or whatever and then and then moves into the glory there's a sense in which the contemporary culture is the very opposite of that right it's like in some ways the church asks you to come to church broken right it's like come broken my friend like you know come in confession come in come contrite come not not like this you know it's like come broken and if you come broken then you get this glory you get to participate in this beauty and this glory and the contemporary world says go out and like enjoy right do it do it all like enjoy and and get participate in excess and the result is that you are accidentally broken right you're not broken in the christian sense of recognizing your loneliness and entering into that but you're made low and then you suffer for it right you're you're broken and your relationships are broken and everything gets broken so it's like a weird inversion and a caricature of each other like if i could if i could just throw something out there though i mean i think that so with hedonism there's something that happens in the sense that you know hedonism and it pulls it not only pulls someone out of the potential for that experience right but it perverts intentionally in in in many ways i would i would submit because when you begin to you like for instance the inability to see the beauty in the aesthetic the inab the inability to see the beauty that is in in the poor right the the inability to see the beauty that is in those things that are not pleasurable right and i think that's the thing is our society conflates beauty with you know something that is dazzling or pretty or it's not when when the church speaks of beauty and i think this is one the things when the church speaks of beauty people can mistake it for simply just you know that which is grand and you know that which elegant is is a is a good way and a better way i think in many ways to begin to explain to people what the how what beauty is because elegance can often times be very subtle the sublime is another way because you know the sublime and and there is a at times this catching of the breath at the sublime you know this this landscape which is terrifying you know in its beauty this i think this is important because our culture seeks to pull all that away and just give people you know the sugar you know the the hot pink you know what i mean and the ice and and and you know and the bling but that's not beauty anyways like there's nothing beautiful really about that it lacks transcendence it lacks transcendence because because of it's but it's it's absence what and what makes it transcendent is that transcendent isn't isn't a disdaining of the whole but it something that's truly transcendent not only in cap ulates but its ability to encapsulate it it moves above it it's above it not doesn't disdain it per se it's above it it's it's beyond it right is's another way to i think to see it and so i think this is really key because what could happen is that someone could begin to see the beauty of the church and if they don't allow the beauty of the church to do its work they could very be they could very easily begin to lose the ability to see the beauty of the church what i'm saying because if you are coming in and if you see beauty and you see only the aspects of the beauty of the church which are self-serving right order is self- serving right we see it right all these things are self- serving because we want to be safe we want to be secure all those things but you you'll begin to miss it because then you're you are extracting because of your own desire for comfort to have those things which you're only titilating and appeasing to you right but the reality is is christ calls us into especially he gives us eyes to see where the beauty is found in the aesthetic in the beggar i mean if you think about christ the logos incarnate walking among men walking in the height of civilization the roman empire that's that's the height of civil civilization on the planet right quote unquote and he's pulling together like and how does he do it like talking to the samaritan woman and he's talking you know to these and he's he's doing all these things alluding to the coming of the gentiles and his his apostles they bring in the gentiles i mean all of this is just it's mindboggling but that's absolutely what christ did in his ministry was to show where there isn't anywhere where he didn't touch right i think that's really important for us because if we lose that sense and people can lose it especially especially as people see the beauty of the church as a beacon of of and it is a beacon of safety but if it's always just that then there are these places where christ is calling you and you will not be able to see them because they're not things that he's forcing upon you they're things that he's inviting us into and i think this is why the aesthetic tradition in the church isn't just about you know the frustration in the body experience but the icon for us in a modern time imposes a fast on us in ways that i don't think people understand you know that the icon imposes a fast on our senses and calls us to really reject the sugar and the pop and the you know the the kind of you know visual kinetic energy that's given to us like all those things is it it calls us to to actually discern that the the pop and the twinkle and the hot pink isn't really beautiful and you need to have the bitter herb you need to have the salt you need to have those things to really help you to to apprehend that greater scope of beauty right i think that i think that's really key because if we don't have that then what can happen is people no longer are entering into the heavenly realm and they do just make it you know a place which is like a museum with gold you know ornamentation and they and they begin to lose what the icon of st john the baptist is communicating they they begin to lose the sense of what the church is is ushering us into and then it really does become flat and two-dimensional in the wrong ways and we lose the ability to enter into that ecological experience because now we're just you know spectating on some sort of very interesting and exotic kind of amalgam you know and that's that's not what's happening you know right yeah i would i would argue that the lack of beauty in our society coinciding with what you're saying it's bringing us down to more of a base level of reality and just the pursuit of our pleasures because what what does in in 2023 walking through america what gives somebody the sense of all i mean is it the empire state building like what exact bring somebody to a transcendent awareness of asking deeper questions about themselves about the world about each other and that's again part of the as jonathan highlighted the eschatological purpose of beauty in itself of aesthetics and how god is working through the beautiful to reach us directly yeah and think about your saying father tobo and and my question would because there is that like in the the in the church there there is definitely what modern people now would call the the bling right that is if you look at the mosaics you know that are that we still see in rena or you know in the in in hagya sofia it's like it's something i mean it is over the top you know and then even the vestments right the vestments are over the top like hand embroidered you know with gold thread and and all that and so how do you you see that like how do you see because i i kind of saw you pulling back and saying we have to be careful not to be also deceived by by that that that those moving pictures or that kind of kind of excess of luxury and i mean i see that in the tradition right i i see it you know the you see it in st john chris system who in some ways is kind of criticizing you know the the overly overly ornamented altar and then ends and says but if there is gold you know you should you should use the goal but it's like you should be careful and it reminds me also of the the patriarch of constantinople when jinian built hagya sopia there's a legend the story i don't know if it's true but there's a legend that that he wanted to make the the templon or the door i think it was the door of the church out of gold or the templon out of gold or something like that like there was something some massive thing in the church he wanted to make out of gold and the patriarch said he said okay you can do it but if there's one beggar left in in antin ople after that it's like that's on you right that's on that's on you and so he kind of had to pull back you know and make it out of silver or something to kind of find that balance and so how do you see that because i mean i'm not a pastor so i don't have to deal with that as much but how do you see that even in in managing a parish for example how to balance the charitable aspect with the beautification with the the you know the the the the two kind of the tension that you seem to be wanting to to bring up to be careful not to be also seduced by just this kind of external beauty yeah i mean i i think the first thing is it's i'll just give this this insight i i hope this is helpful you know our parish is in kansas city and it's you know in the middle of the hood you know like the hood and when we were you know it's a old baptist church which we brought down to the studs and then you know renovated and when we were doing it you know i was being very particular about things and there was you know murmurs and some people that were upset u they're no longer in the community god bless them but they were upset because they said you know why why would you be spending all this you know why you going to put a baptismal font here why are you going to have a marble inlay here why are you doing that and then i sat down and i i told one of them the story of you know the baptism of rose you know and the whole story of like sending out the emissaries st vladimir sending the emissaries out to you know all these places and you know we all know the story right the missies went here there and they finally went to aio and they're like we didn't know if we were in heaven and earth and that revelation of beauty wasn't just about you know the the the incredible mosaics in aguia at the time it was it was chanting it was the music it was it was the spirit that that was em bibed in the people and we know that it's if you know that it's valid because when you look at the life of st vladimir i mean he he ceases being a polygamist he ceases being cruel all these things begin to affect him and begin to affect the russian people who were illiterate and pagan and barbarus and all that stuff right and then they became people of god now i say all that to say this the reality is that you know beauty will save the word but you have to know what beauty is first and that's part of i think what the church does is the church always you know it's the it's the the yes and you know it's the fullness it's we maximalist but we also understand that there is a a place where you must ascend from excuse me you know you must you must ascend from this place and the way that i i think you really begin to do this for someone is you begin to understand what's your intent because the intent if it's of the worship of god and the worship of god necessitates the bringing of the lost sheep then what happens is there's a real sense of invitation that's in there and i want to make this not so abstract i think that there are moments in people's lives when they can if you've been orthodox or non-orthodox you've traveled around like why is it that you can get a sense of something a warmth of a community and it may not have all the quote unquote acont that like a huge perfect parish has but you feel like you're being ushered into the orthodox church you feel like you're being ushered into something that's just as valid why is that well it's because of the the beauty the the actual material of that's used to express the beauty is precisely that it's just the material to express the beauty dph has behind him an icon of st maximus it's right there i was just looking at it right and it's like well the problem is that people have these passions and they become attached to things in a disordered improper idolatrous way right it's like st maximus is famous is saying it's like you know gold is an object woman is an object right but gold connected to a thought of luxury which is fundamentally about self right then becomes a passion you know it becomes this thing that becomes idolatrous and so i think the way i would say this is number one i recognize that it is possible for someone to become unduly enamored and therefore you know begin to fall into an idolatrous relation to the expression of beauty in the church church and we see that when they begin to this is what st john chrs is talking about when they begin to disdain the beauty of christ in the beggar or whatever whatever context that you want you want to look at but ultimately that horizontal you know the vertical of the cross right you do the cross you have the vertical of me seeing god me seeing the transcendent you know me seeing all these things right and ultimately it's still about me right seeing that thing and being connected but then if we begin to lose the horizontal of that reality which is the humbling aspect of seeing the other and seeing the beauty in the other i think that's where people begin to lose it and that's where you see people feeling like it's not even so much that this person's you know disturbing you but if they come in it's like oh do they look unkempt you know like that that happens in parishes and i think that's i think that's important because a parish which you know someone i'm not talking again about someone who's you know maybe having some some mental health issues whatever i'm talking about just if a if a human being wanders in doesn't know what they're doing but maybe i know this is crazy to someone maybe god is leading them to to that church to see something so that they could have a place of conversion and people could flip out and be like hey you know gota get that guy out of here right and st peter talks about this about hey be careful about having you know the wealthy person brought to the front and the poor person bought brought to the back and i i think that is really key because if we don't acknowledge and we if we don't have the humility to admit that we we could become beguiled it's not the fault and that's that's where i think a lot of the protestants evangelicals miss it is that they think a person they realize that that can happen but they think it's the fault of the icon or the fault of the mosaic it's not the fault of the mosaic or the icon it's it's the person who has not kept that tension of you know the transcendent beauty yes but also the beauty that's that's humble you know the beauty of of of the beggar st john c yeah i mean and father turbo you can you can treat the bible as an idol too absolutely that's not hard at all like i've seen people do it all the time when you talk to someone and they're seing about the word of god the word of god the word of god and you're like what are you talking about and it's like it's like it's like it's not christ the incarnate logos it's the bible that's the only word of god and you're like really i don't know it's a little weird man it's the spell book they have and they treat it like it's a spell book you know right and so so yeah i mean it is let's say any this is the this is the you know i've been looking at exodus a lot because we did this exodus seminar you know a while ago and i've been thinking a lot about some of the images in the book and the the the the character of aaron is a really interesting figure because in some ways a aaron is a tool that god gives to moses to communicate to the people because moses is like i can't communicate i need something so god gives him an external he's like here's this other layer that you can that that will now speak for you and will be like your representative in front of the people and so he's like he is in some ways that tool that god uses to manifest himself but then he's the one who makes the golden calf it's like that's the duality of of externalization that in some ways it's necessary and inevitable that is all things that come down to to us from god you know are externals in the sense that there you know the glories of god appearing in the myriads of things that we that we see and that's real and that's true but they are all everything in the world is in danger of becoming an idol if we are not looking through them towards towards that which is transcendent so it's just the reality of external so and the idea that in some ways our particular form of worship is more endangered of becoming an idol i think is nonsense it's it's just the reality of of the externals yeah yeah i was wonder if maybe we can tie a few of the different topics we've discussed with we're talking about symbols bringing them into ourselves this this timeless beauty the eschatological importance of these things with us being living icons because it seems that in a sense that's what father turbo was getting at in regards to me and my relationship to the transcendent but then the horizontal is me enacting out the beauty as a living icon of christ and that this is the goal of all of us and this is the beautiful transformation of all of us through theosis through the engaging with these uncreated energies of god i was thinking maybe father you could speak a little bit to what what for those who may not be familiar with windows of veneration how we understand icons how does that relate then to the individual person having that relationship with christ and becoming a living icon well i think this is one of the things that's really important is because man you know i don't know if i can talk without throwing something out there that might be you know kind of hard to swallow but i i just there is no christianity without an aesthetic aspect it's just it it's just you can't have it it's a it's a caricature it's a distortion and the reason why i'm saying that is because the aesthetical aspect of the life of the church it's there to do it's there to it's it's there to help keep this tension that we're talking about right and it's also there because that tension's necessary in the sense of development like if we're going to look at the powers of the soul and the need for the powers of the soul to be you know honed and strengthened and disciplined and the powers of the soul being primarily the means by which we actually experience you know the unseen god right because god is the maker you know the father's maker of all things visible and invisible and so that reality which is a reality just because people are unaware of it doesn't mean that that reality isn't there and what the church does especially for us is it wakens us up to this reality and it does it through the athetic tradition but it does it also first and foremost i think through the iconography through the beauty of the church the architecture of the church through the the beauty of our hypography and our chance and the reason why i say that is because what happens is when you even if you are not aware of you know the kind of the historical you know accidents of what different cultural aspects brought together this thing when you encounter it even if actually let me flip that actually forgive me let me flip that because oftentimes the the the movie producer and the director is the guy who can't watch a movie anymore because he's he's so aware of what went in there that he's no longer able to kind of like suspend his knowledge to actually enter into watching a movie you know what i mean it's like the artist who can no longer appreciate something in in the way that he used to back in the day because you know he's he's become to some degree like so jaded by his knowledge right i think what i'm trying to get at here is that this reality when you experience something and it's sometimes often just a flash and it pulls you to i don't have a better word except for potential you maybe might be able to say hope but you you get this flash of something out it's otherworldly and and i don't it's nothing that i that you give an image to i'm not talking about seeing flying you know horses or anything like that i'm talking about a hope it's forgive me let me digress a little bit if you've ever experienced something very tragic like the death of a loved one or you know i see this whole time being a priest ministering someone where i'm with someone who's dying or they know that their parent is dying or you know something really difficult is happening and my my job my my work is not so much to bring them to this place where they can like kind of make it through through that's really up to god in many ways and up to them but my work is to be present with them just being present because my presence is only pos my presence is valuable in so far as i'm trying to just be present to bear witness of what they're going through and god willing to bring to be some sort of conduit for hope right and that flash of hope in the face of the imminent this i'm trying to describe what this these flashes of eternity these flashes of something transcendent in the real way that's what if you if you're being guided well and you're actually not just looking at the icon and the church and all these things is trying to you know find a solid ground in a temporal sense meaning like yes our society's crumbling yes our political systems crumbling yes our morality is crumbling all that but like it's always crumbled byzantium crumbled you know quote unquote holy russia crumbled like what has kept the people of god grounded it's these things and it's actually in the face of these very terrible moments that like we get to see that hope being purified and to some degree not purified but freed from these things that were at once they're given to us as aids but we we want to hold on to the crutches to some degree and i know this gets into dicey territory because people are like whoa whoa whoa father then that's isn't that the isn't that the mindset of like you know the puritans and all these people and i'm like yes to some degree but it was again not for the reasons that i'm talking about because we can talk about all of the i can give the legend to how to read icons right this means this and this means that and someone can become really adept at being able to break down like oh this symbol means this this equals this but see what what what they what you don't understand and this only comes from like really kind of experience and striving for it is if the more adept you get at being able to kind of like read the code the easier it is for you to begin to miss it because what happens is is you're now leaning into your ability to wield understanding and information for the sake of wielding it right and that's magic that's not that's not what this is about this is about being brought to this place that only god can bring us to that's what the icons there for the icon is there to sure on a real basic level even though this isn't the case but there's truth to it right that the icon is there initially to you know pedagogically instruct those who couldn't read but that's not really you hear this but that's not really the case because it's like we we are retrofitting our understanding of how people learn in pedagogy and experience on the ancients right it isn't just about reading right it's the gospel is meant to be heard see people that's not satisfying to people when they hear well they the go gospel being mean to heard no no because if i can read it's meant to be read because yes it is meant to be read but not not just exclusively right because communal activity it's a communal activity and and not just communal in regards of like the horizontal right but think about i think about the children who hear the gospel you know week in week out week in week out and some of them are not gonna many most of them are not going to go on to be priests they're not going to go on to be you know quote unquote church workers but they're gonna be plumbers they're goingon to be moms and dads and they may not even be picking up the bible daily although i hope they do but something there's a seed that was planted deeply in them hearing those the hearing the gospel there's there's something that's very powerful that's opened up to them when it may not even be a well executed icon quote unquote but what is it they'll remember that icon that was in their church when they're growing up why because the icon facilitated something called communion called connection and and that's the thing is if if we don't kind of really keep that i think in the front of these conversations it becomes very easy for someone from outside of our tradition or anywhere else to like oh that's cool and learn this and that's where that's where you get people who are like yeah yeah i know about icons and it's cool and blah blah blah blah blah and i have one here right and they they're they're treating it like like it's a saeson print that they got at big lots or something you know what i mean it's a commodity it's a commodity and and the reality of it is is that yes there is a whole thing about you know inverse perspective and we can talk about all these things and we should i'm not saying we shouldn't but i think what's i think what's appealing and what's captivating for people is that for instance why do people keep listening to jonathan because jonathan's a wealth of knowledge but i think the thing about jonathan is you still get the sense that he's in awe and wonder still you don't get the sense forgive me for talking like you're not there jonathan like he doesn't you know he doesn't it isn't just kind of like he's just throwing like yeah d d d and this is this and this is that right that you can tell to some degree that he's still searching that he's still being pulled into that he's still he's in communion with someone that's what we're that's what we wna that's the engle we don't want to just know like the why of something but it's like what you're saying dp about like the who and and i think if i i i really think that's important to bring forward because one of the hardest things for someone who's coming out of let's say a reformed tradition an evangelical tradition is that they they see the icon they see the liturgy they see all the mystery of the church and they want to pierce that mystery but the thing is is they have to understand you can't pierce that mystery in the same way forgive for being lude but you can't approach it the same way a guy kind of wants to you know go for the hunt you know what i mean like some guys like the chase and they they they you want to you don't want to approach it like you're you're gonna conquer something and i think that's what happens when we view these things in just almost exclusively like kind of pedagogical like approach we have to remember like what like what is being revealed here about who yeah i think i think father turbo what you're saying what you're getting to is important in terms even in terms of the question that you asked there david that you know the the one of the main purposes of the icons is to bring into remind us of the communion of the saints in which we're participating when we are in prayer and in liturgy and so that's why we have these standing saints that are just there kind of standing in the church like as if they're standing with us and they're worshiping god and you know we you know you talked also you you asked a bit about how how we treat each other in terms of the in terms of becoming icons and that is something that i i i this is a speculation on my part but i think part of the reason why we kiss icons has to do with the st paul's asking us to greet each other with a holy kiss i think i think that there's at least part of it which comes from that which is in the same way that i bow to the priest and kiss his hand the same way that the priest comes out of the altar bows to us and asks for forgiveness in that in that way in which we receive christ in each other in the church and we and we signify that through different ways in the same way that we encounter the icons and the saints as a continuation of the same process that that we encounter each other with and so i think you're right that there is a connection definite connection in the manner in which we are meant to encounter each other as icons it's more i think it's more best formulated not that we're to become icons that's i that's difficult it's like it's more that we should encounter others as icons like we should when we meet others we should see in them christ that should be our focus and if we do that then we will be becoming like christ if we do that but to have to be in that disposition where we see like this person in front of me you know is is is a is a little christ to me and i should i should i should treat him that way that's hard that's a tough one but that's what we're asked to do i very early on when even you know just coming to the church and people were like okay what's this what's that blah blah and i would explain to them about my time when i was in the balkans or even in iraq and i'd say look you know like i was missing my wife and at the time two kids and i'd pick up the picture i'd kiss it i i would do that i'd be on the fob and i'd be you know missing my missing my wife and my kids and i' kiss the picture and people would go like yeah they get it they would get it because they've had something some kind of experience somewhat like that and they go like there you go we can move past that if you want and you know i can talk to you about fus kto and all that stuff but like that's not going to get you anywhere right now like what you want to know is like okay like well how's this helping out how's this helping out the person actually in the church not just the priest you know not just the educator but what about that kid what about that old grandma what about working class gym with his family i mean i'm really into this because i i think one of the things is that for for for the people the leos for the people it it's all there to bring them into it because they're they're the people of god it isn't just about the educated and the illumination that the church brings comes from love it comes from love and and when we begin to have like that's the thing people have relationships with these saints they really do like if someone you know it's like i'm in the serbian church and the tradition of the slava and you know you have this patron of a family and often times you know generationally like they turn to st john when there's actual problems st john isn't just like we have st john up here because he is a figurehead of resistance to government power like that is such an interpretation we would we would give which it's valid i mean i'll i'll go there all day i'll go there all day but i think what's really important is that not everyone should strive to be a jonathan pou a david patrick henry like i think people need to strive to be good faithful men who work their agback job who go to church and love their neighbor and when they do that they'll be able to experience the glory and the profundity of god like that's that's reality and and i i'm all for that because that's what transfigures the world right if we have more forgive me forgive me i mean as you move into the in the life of the church then all of a sudden you know like you said at some point you realize that the saints are there they're there and you know if you're if you're attentive to it you'll see see them kind of you know act in your in your life and act in the life of others and you know that's a that's a great joy because it reminds us that they're alive in christ you know and that they they're they're they are still in the church and they still pray for us and that just like we're meant to pray for each other we can kind of experience it when we see the saints move among us and and move things you know among us so it's a it's a testimony to what the church is yeah forgive i just want this one thing i tell people about and and i know it's i'm taking liberty with it but when i get my explanations you know i tell people the think of the halo in the icon as the wedding ring and the the unification of god and and that person right there's your theosis right the unification of god and that person and that wedding ring which is a symbol right i mean and then you can even have someone touch their wedding ring it's like you know put your hand on that wedding ring jim you know put your hand on that wedding ring you know joanie and recognize like what is that yeah that's metal yeah that's gold yeah that's an ore but like the effort that you put in jim to work those extra hours you know to get joanie that really nice ring right that that's an actual manifestation of your love for joanie and your love of you know mark and lucy who are your parents right because you're holding to this tradition and you're you're loving this tradition and you're giving of yourself in the real world right blood sweat and tears to bring forth that love which is immaterial in the sense of you know it's invisible but we're you're you're manifesting it and that's a real thing and that's what icons are icons are a window to heaven okay well what's heaven well look at an icon ion and what's in an icon every icon generally speaking there's going to be a human person right and a halo there you go god and man that's what heaven heaven is the union of god and man right anything else we begin to kind of like get into other stuff but we know that's what heaven is persons with god and god in persons that's what it is that's what the kingdom of heaven is and so when we be when we're able to bring it down to that level and show you know joanie and jim that the symbols that are even on their body on their ring finger can actually lead them into that understanding then you start to approximate the purpose and the function of the icon isn't just there to give you you know a high level theological understanding of you know blah blah blah but it's actually like to ground you which is incarnational like that's the thing is that being incarnational is about being grounded and and i think this is really key because one of the big things that you want to do that i wanted to do is i wanted to pass on the tradition yes but the life of the church to my kids right i want them to become citizens because this is the meta the church is the meta culture right everything gets sub you know everything is subsumed into that meta culture and if there's something valuable and good it gets baptized it gets illuminated it gets you know impregnated with with god's wisdom and glory and then it becomes something blessed right and that's that's why we have to keep this reality in front of people and that that's what the icon does it keeps that reality of what god is calling and has already ushered you into you know yeah you remind me of the conversation i had with bishop max ma maximus on participatory versus propositional understandings of god and how we relate and that this is what we're hinting at through the entire ation was this participation in god participation in the experience of beauty the creation of beauty participation in the uncreated energies of god which is related to all this different stuff so we're talking about saints we're talking about men that with their free will chose to choose god chose to love chose to participate this the icons then are windows of energetic realities of heaven in which that you participate in as you said you don't just decipher it like a coat it's a it's a living reality even though it's just a piece of wood with paint on it and so this participation is this mystery of orthodoxy that i think is what's so beautiful it's not this overly scholastic propositional understanding it's not just a sort of bland lack of aesthetic due to the fear of idolatry it's it's again it's bringing all these tensions together and allowing you to participate in these realities and that is then becoming a living icon is the fold of day after day after day choosing to participate in this and hopefully god willing in yourself you then can be a as as abbott treon says an an angels unaware you can be somebody in somebody's life say it's the the man who's disheveled and and smells and comes into the church that you are now in a position to actually be another window for somebody into the kingdom and that's the goal of all of us and that i think that that's it's subtle but it's a different emphasis than maybe you get in other flavors of christianity because it's not so participatory i think i think your point is right and father tribo your point about the wedding reading i think is a great way to help people understand sacramental reality when they're not used to it right and you can you can reduce it to very simple things like a good i try to define this the most the simple example like a handshake right a handshake is a ritual right a handshake is a means a handshake is all these things but you know you still tell your child like here's how you shake your hand right this is have a firm handshake don't just flop you know hold the hand not too long like you the the child has to learn to shake the a hand properly and but the purpose is not the handshake obviously just like the purpose is not the wedding ring and also the purpose is not this piece of wood with paint in it the purpose is that which we see through and so and we're used to it because now once you internalize it and you shake someone's hand you're not thinking about the handshake at all right you're seeing through the handshake to the person that you're encountering and seeing it as a method to greet and to enter into communion with them it's the same with a kiss it's the same with all these gestures and the icon is the same it's like you know when you when we encounter the icons we are see them as means of encountering the saints of of of of remembering them of of bringing them to mind bringing them into prayer and and and and asking them to pray for us and that becomes as natural as a handshake once you have kind of entered into that life but like you said father turbo if you just kind of sit at home online and you like interpret icons like i'm i've interpret icons more than anybody right like i spent a lot of time interpreting icons but obviously the point is ultimately for them to become vehicles for for our participation in the life of the of christ that's right i mean i think one of the best ways to understand it and and especially i really hope that this helps a lot of people people kind of get some over some of those hurdles of barriers of entry and that they don't worry about what people think or whatever and they just want to approach god right and this is what i mean by this all this is necessary in so far as it becomes tacid because that's the that's the space in which you begin to really get it and you get into it for instance your example about the driving about the handshakes perfect let's do another one driving a car right you know my i i had first day of school today my 16-year-old he's said can i drive dad sure right and you know he's taking turns too wide you know all the stuff all stuff and it's not pass it yet he's still thinking has totally like ent it's like okay break distance right and then there's going to come a point when it becomes tas and what's interesting is the more all of those parts are tacd the better of a driver he'll be right it's like more he forgets what he has to do the better of a driver he'll be it's the same thing as you come into the church the more that you forget these things that you it's it's not forgetting them forgive me that's absolutely the wrong word forgive me well yeah well not not putting your attention on the means that's the right way to it's right forgive me strike that from the record it's not forgetting it's the more that you internalize yeah there you go the more that you internalize these things the more that the remembrance is constant you're present it's there you don't have to take the energy to recall right yes because here here's the thing there's people who are living in the liturgy all the time the animis is happening from them all the time they it's not that they've transcended it but they've they've internalized it so much there's no need for the recall right they are they are in it and then when they're actually in those very explicit moments it just shoots them up another level if i could use that language but it's it's tcid and so that's the thing is you get to this place where the remembrance of the saints prayers i mean that's that's one of the purposes of the quote unquote practice of the jesus prayer is that it becomes this tcid thing that is so you know you've em bibed it to such a degree right this is this is the key thing to understand but you have to go through that process of understanding so i'm not not disdaining or denigrating that process of learning at all i'm just saying that because of our culture the emphasis is so much on it because of our tendency for control and for we our want of power our want of security and that's what keeps us wanting to stay in this very kind of scholastic mode because it's like if i'm approaching everything through this kind of zoological framework i'm the master right but like love zoological it's like got to be able to name everything gota understand everything that's going on before i ever engage you know yeah yeah and and ultimately here's the thing you hit these you you know if you come to the church it's maybe two years maybe 12 years whatever but you hit a hump you hit this kind of flat point in this plateau and then you can often say to yourself okay i'm just kind of like going to the motions so is it tacd now okay sure but like here's the thing that's where getting back to what we talking about earlier some of the dark parts of the mosaic become important the dark parts of the mosaic are death horror you know seeing the reality of of the fallen world for what it is in the light of christ right not not needing to you know put a a false lens on seeing it for what it is if you embibe all these things then what happens is it's not so much that you become a window to the disheveled guy who's smelly but actually he becomes the window for you right and that's the thing he becomes the window for you because one of the problems for us is that we get a sense of i got it and things are tcid let's say and then you do begin to plateau but you're plateauing not because god isn't giving you anything but because and you you have hit this place of your own glass ceiling of experience and understanding you it it becomes self-sufficient supposedly y and what happens is god then has to really kind of put he has to turn everything upside down to wake you up he has to use you know the car accident the disheveled beggar whatever thing to like bring you out of this place where you thought okay i'm good i'm clean i got all the boxes checked everyone looks to me as whatever it's like no like that's nice but here's another level and that level then becomes and that's where the cross now becomes a whole another thing for you right because it takes on a different understanding and you begin to now move in what you've already been doing in a different way because i think this is the thing my son he'll become more more you know it becomes tacid he'll become a better driver blah blah blah and he'll enjoy that for a long time but there will come a point god willing where the driving now takes on another meaning for him and that meaning is going to be about transporting his siblings right or transporting his own kids one day and it's gonna change everything and things that he was maybe able to do maybe at some point he's able to do some donuts in the parking lot and got some good control that's great but something's going to want him to move beyond that and to not flex and to not show off and i think think this is key because god again hasn't forgotten him and god says okay son there's still more there's there's there's still more to enter into right and that's why you need to learn this stuff and allow it to become everyday life that's why prayer rules and the mundane are are are are valuable right because you don't become adept at something quote unquote by entering into it in this in this it only happens when it becomes a part of your life intentionally and and that takes work you know what i mean so yeah and to sum up the conversation i think this aesthetic dimension of orthodox is one of the most important that speaks to the contemporary world because i would say most people are feeling the world's getting less and less beautiful and many many regards and the church allows us to see what beautiful behavior is how in a new context for beauty his father was speaking you know somebody may think that the beautiful picture is everybody dressed nice at liturgy sitting in standing in the right places but it could be the homeless man it can be the the un beautiful in conjunction the both and that from an orthodox perspective is more beautiful that that the bringing together of all these things together in the worship of god that is more beautiful than everybody wearing the right pet colors and standing in that's almost too contrived and that's not reality but keeping the tensions between things and beauty doesn't necessitate you know large rational understandings of our theology it it doesn't demand complicated explanations for correct behavior utilitarianism deontological ethics virtue ethics anybody can engage with beauty and for me coming out of the new age and the psychedelic and the occult it was the beauty that felt so comfortable because it's one of the things i liked about the visionary art and all the colors and all the all the pictures and all the aesthetics well orthodoxy has that but it's so much deeper and so it offers a i think a really great entry point for people that you don't have to know the intricacies of the energy essence distinction or iconography to see oh wow this is really beautiful there's something here and i want to engage more in that in in in our worldview so mystical and it's so participatory that as jonathan and you said it calls people in and i think i think this aesthetic dimension is one of the most important things that the orthodox church can offer to especially the contemporary western world yeah oh i think it's a great place to to end i think we we had a it was great to meet you father turbo finally you know after all this time i'm really happy first conversation and david thanks for for hosting us and and and kind of prompting the
