thrust in 100 seconds let's go rust a memory save compiled programming language that delivers high level simplicity with low level performance it's a pop i feel like people really the high level simplicity i i feel like people don't appreciate that moment can we just take a moment on that one i know we're only like six seconds in on 100 seconds but it's just so true when you use c and you have to create a server and you have to go through berkeley sockets and you have to do non-blocking and you have to do all these things or you do you do anything in a really low level language it's so hard to do whereas russ has a lot of these things that it just feels really simple right it feels simple and i i love that right but but on the other hand it's really easy because it is so simple to create terrible performance by accident it still performs better than every other language pretty much but it's really easy to create bad stuff you know what i mean yeah compared to c like c is really hard people forget how hard it is and i do think russ does feel a little bit python-esque right popular choice for building systems where performance is absolutely critical like game engines databases or operating systems and is an excellent choice when targeting webassembly it started as a side project upgrade on horror in 2007 who named it after the rust fungus it was sponsored by mozilla in 2009 and has been rust fungus okay well i didn't know that so all these jokes where people make things like oxidize and all this other stuff so what you're saying is that we should be calling it damn it what is what is the last of us fungus called i can't even remember and rank the most love programming language every year since 2016. with its fans being known as restations traditionally high-level languages provide a garbage collector to nerf your control over memory management while lower level languages provide functions like free and allocate to shoot yourself in the foot rust takes a different approach it has no garbage collector but achieves memory safety with a concept known as ownership and borrowing by default every variable in rust is immutable and this model's value used to be used in the stack map so i think one thing that they you know like when you really think about it just for a second this whole free and malik thing like if you know free and malik you can totally understand kind of what is happening underneath the hood right it's just like you could imagine that like where you declare it you have a malik and then a cast it and then at the end of the scope it has a free i know that's not exactly how it works but you can imagine that's just like what is actually happening underneath the hood and when you think of it that way it does just make things easy exactly rust of free and malik are just done automatically for you i feel like once you get that concept and you just kind of look at it that way it makes it really really really simple you know also you go oh okay yeah i see what's going on here memory which has minimal performance overhead however mutable values or objects with an unknown size at compile time are stored in the heap memory every value i'm pretty sure this last thing that he just put there i don't think that's actually valid rust oh shoot now i have to actually find out hold on here we go let mute hello equals hello world okay yeah all right just checking it's just mutable to the reference okay everybody else program is assigned to a single variable known as its owner when that variable goes out of scope the memory allocated to it is dropped automatically in some cases now they want to pass a reference to a different part of the program borrowing allows you to access a reference in memory without taking ownership of it there are a ton of rules to go along with the system that the russ borrow checker will validate at compile time these rules keep your code safe while providing absolute control over performance rust also has a package manager called cargo where each individual package is great to get started install rest then run cargo new from the command line in the main.rs file you'll find a main function which is where the program will start executing declare a variable with let followed by its name and type the value can't be changed or reassigned by default so add mutt to make it mutable reference to its location in memory how did i scroll down multiple times don't call it mutt okay i hate i hate the term mud is it just me or is it anybody else i just hate the term mutt i just it just it drives me nuts i don't know what it is it feels like you know you know the what's it called you know the phoebe you know the phoebe one the phoebe whatever it's the phoebe chandler oh my goodness this is a phoebe chandler meme moment this is a phoebe chandler meme moment right how do you spell phoebe i don't even know how to spell phoebe phoebe chandler oh my goodness chandler meme right yeah that one that one that's the one i want phoebe oh gosh i'm way off on phoebe look at dude i'm gonna have this forever everyone is it joey that's chandler right i do i never watch friends phoebe's crazy i didn't know how to do it okay i i i i i am huh do i have oh i have light readers on dark readers has screwed up somehow look at this it's dark when it's off it's light when it's on and all effed up i don't know what happened what's the on what's this one called that's the one i want joey friends is that what is that really what they call it is that joey foreign damn it there we go that's the one i feel like you could do something like this or it's like right it's like mutability mutability mutability muteable mutable mutate mutate mutt it's just like how did you get here how did you go how did you do that how did you do that oh it's mute oh man it just drives me it just drives me nuts i don't even get it i don't even get it how does this happen how does someone get here with their life and tweet this is a great one this is a great one all right let's go back to this where are we all right it drives you money you did it wrong no i didn't do it wrong phoebe's saying the right thing it's he is saying the wrong thing right thing wrong thing right thing wrong thing this is how i feel this is yeah i know you guys are actually trying to argue because you just want some crappy crappy version of this oh i know dude i i totally misspelled that and as i did it i knew i was an idiot i knew i was an idiot okay i admit it i'm an idiot by the way can you guys make this get over a thousand likes so tj is required he has to be required to he he's saying this most cringe thing in the universe and he lit he said this on the internet can we just like this really quickly and force him to have to upload it that'd be fantastic all right let's get back to this thing we can be borrowed by other parts of the program by prefixing it with an ampersand then use a macro like print line to log the value to the standard output rust also comes with a standard library that contains modules to handle i o the file system concurrency among many other things now compile your code to an executable with the ruskin piler you just built a memory safe execute who uses everyone just cargo come on cutable that can handle the most performance intensive system requirements this has been rust and whoa whoa whoa what fireship is on windows are we having a hot windows exposure right now oh no oh fire shift why you why you gotta do us like this fire shift no no [music] and to think i loved you hey do you think it'd break the internet if fireship and i did a photo together do you think that would break the internet if i took a selfie with fireship within the next two weeks 100 seconds hit the like button and subscribe if you want to see more short videos like this and leave a comment if you want to see a full rust tutorial thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one because it's gonna happen all right that was great i love fireship okay i don't know what this guy he this he is the best tech youtuber i think out there honestly i think fireship right now is the best there is he just is so good i wish has half i wish i wish i was half as good as him you know what i mean not subscribed this is my alt channel i try not to subscribe too much on my all channel because yeah here's my here's my actual channel this on the other hand is right 49 dude i'm not even close to 49 of fireship fireship is so good he is so good like his his ability to describe and get to the point and tell you about something is incredible okay in fact can we do one more
