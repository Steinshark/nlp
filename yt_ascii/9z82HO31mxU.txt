all right so i i gotta show you guys this because tj messaged me in the middle of the night last night practically and it was just like look at this okay look at this this guy jt i have no idea what he does or anything but he resigned all of his roles from wrestling immediately so that's already kind of a little strange you know what i mean like i wasn't i had no idea what was going on there i don't i i don't you know that already seems a little strange right but then when you follow this whoopsies well that's way too fast if you follow this the strangest waste of resources of energy in a long time he's this person i don't know how to say his name is no longer speaking at ruskov right and so for anyone that doesn't know anything about conferences and what it takes to speak at a conference my general rule of thumb i have for a conference talk is for every one minute of a conference talk it's one hour of preparation so like real talk like so when you're preparing a talk it's a lot of effort and this person was doing a keynote so my guess is is that that's like two hours of preparation for every one minute of talk right so it's like it is a lot of effort to do a good conference talk a very good conference talk is like really painful and so here we go so let's let's read this thing because this just seems crazy right here i'm no longer speaking at the rusconf 2023 and possible future for compile time programming okay so what the decision happened after i was reached out to by the rust conf 2023 organizers in a call on may 26th 2023 around 11 45 a.m sorry i got that wrong my bad my bad 12 45 p.m montana time are the call is about taking my talk and degrading it from a keynote to a regular talk i figured this was for scheduling or time slot reasons or because they found someone who was a better fit none of these were the case like that's okay so a little wild right a little while by the way something i do want to say about about rusconf they rejected greg the creator of leptos so obviously their bar must be really really high greg is probably the nicest person in the rust community and one of the most talented engineers i have ever met in my entire lifetime right so going from a keynote to a regular talk that that's already that's you know it's very interesting right so there are two wise to answer here the first why is or the first is why am i writing a blog post i've noticed the reason i've got an influx that follows is because rust conference program was released and has my twitter on it sure enough a bunch of people especially russ related and ones with the typical calling of the programming language and the sacred crab crablang by the way that's a crab blank shout out followed my socials i was i was also told congratulations by a few close friends who sought and were paying attention again thank you and let's see if i have to individually explain the reasoning and behavior that is going on here to each person my fingers will quite literally fall off and i absolutely do not want to waste everyone's time by giving partial retellings over and over and over and over again okay okay i see what's going on here i mean i i agree generally with this take i think it's probably better to explain it in a comfort or in this kind of format anyways because if you explain in this kind of format you're going to you're going to avoid a lot of confusion because you can really think about your words you know it's good all right all right so let's keep on going all right let's see let's see the second the second reason is a lot weirder than i had anticipated or thought about it has to do with how this happened and the strange behavior coming from the rust project about this but first a little background how i did not submit a talk to rusconf 2023 i had given a special link to register my talk in a sessionize or in sessionize after the deadline because i was not anticipating to do a talk until 2024. when the compile time reflection work could be done okay so obviously some real complicated work this person's doing the reason i had to submit the talk specifically was because it was at the behest of the conference organizers more specifically i was nominated by the rust project leadership to be exact with the wording to give a keynote start of the day shared slot with somebody else 30 minutes about something rust related given that my only public rust work up until then was my mega midterm report on compile time reflection in conjunction with one other group that is that is a type that is a title it literally like you could even see in the hyperlink it's like this is the longest table i've ever seen in my lifetime i figured that that was the best thing i could give a talk on all right all right i was not quite or shy about this i was very social with everyone i was in contact both inside rust conf leadership and with the rust project leadership who are even remotely in the same discords etc as me about what i would give a talk on i would talk about compile time programming my ideas for it sourced from the rust foundation grant work i was helping with and to make sure it was very clear that it was possible future for compile time programming not the exact future the title of my talk was very clear a very quick walkthrough of possible compile time reflection bunch of question mark in tarot bang right okay this sounds exciting i'd watch that i you know because personally i love zig zig comp time is like the coolest thing in the universe and i would love something like that because one hard thing about doing good macros is that they're really hard to understand in rust it's it's really non-trivial work whereas with with zig it's almost like it's effortless to do a zig compile time item so this would be like this this sounds like an amazing potential future right i think zig did it right i'd love to see that so emphasis uh emphasis mine on the word possible i also feel like i have been more than forthcoming with this is nobody's idea for compile time programming but our own that is here's the top level disclaimer at the very beginning of the compile time report all right as a general purpose disclaimer while we have spoken with large number of individuals in the specific places about how to achieve what we're going to write about and report on here it should be expressly noted that no individual mentioned here has recorded support position for this work whatever assertions are contained below it is critical to recognize that we have one and only one goal in mind for this project and that goal was developed solely under our shepherd oasis's own ideals and efforts our opinions and our are our own and we do not reflect any other wow this is like the most jargony speak ever i ca you know it always is a little shocking that people have to write so much prefaces other than like hey this is just a possibility everybody there is no support for this yet boom done right like the legalese required to type anything is just nutty right i'm not sure is this like oh is this a rust problem because it seems like every time i see rust say anything it said it's they say things what you could say in five words in 50 words i didn't understand the the disclaimer literally said what we're working on has not been technically approved it is just an idea right what about oracle i think they beat oracle i cannot imagine it is not clear where whose ideas these were and that they did not represent rust foundation rush project or anybody else's orthodoxy ortho up upright or doxie but that was a technically a technical report based exclusively on our ability to go through the syntax data and benefits of existing code you can imagine my surprise then when i was told by the rust conference organizer that my talk did not want to be endorsed by the rust project and that is what a keynote is meant to be for remember when everybody was really kind of a little worried about what when when we talked about how the rust project and how they were really that their endorsement and how they could take down sites and stuff based on whether or not they feel good about what you have to say remember how we all were maybe a little worried about it and a lot of people were saying that we were overreacting again i have absolutely no trust that these what's going on you know it just it seems terrifying i know the bruss project does not equal the rust foundation but they're all together and i don't i feel very untrusting of all of it as of right now it feels very difficult to understand what's happening they feel it feels very difficult to understand why they make you know decisions at least from an outside perspective purely an outside perspective yeah to be clear rust comp's keynotes often cover topics both near and far to the rust project's goals and needs never before has a keynote suddenly had an almost holy indication or an indication of the direction of the project goals nor did presenting about any given topic before seem to have any explicit goals of endorsing a specific result or a specific future all of their talks are available through ruscomf 2021 2022 etc playlist right here verifying this is a as easy as going back through their talks to the note that there is plenty of heterodox and competing viewpoints spoken of by past rough cons well this is such a hard sense to read keynotes and invited speakers it is also explicit policy of the rust conf in prior years 2022 and earlier to bring in speakers with different outside viewpoints so even if this keynote's contents were not endorsed by the rust projects explicitly that only increases its appeal to the least intended and stated values kind of interesting huh so it sounds like it sounds like whatever this project is i i could be a big fan of this project i haven't read anything about this project i should probably actually read this project and try to understand what it's about i'd love to understand what it's about right likely we got a little like a c plus plus likely in there but i'd love to understand what it's about because it seems really cool okay this or this is again also in the face of a conference talk titled about talking about still developing nature of this work a cl i mean to be completely fair the work is being paid for the work has a grant it isn't an effort to make the language better this seems like a great keynote right like this is obviously high high visibility high excitement something is going on here obviously i don't know about so i'm a little surprised about this a let's see a clear indication in publicly available materials that the work is not endorsed by any individual organization or collective and the clear indication from me personally to the rust conf organizers and rust project leadership that this is what i would be presenting on and it's contents before i commit it to anything at this point no one should or at this point should anyone have thought that i would be capable of misrepresenting what the rust project wants out of its ecosystem or that i had somehow overtaken competing proposals in the space as i always do with technical work that i'm involved in it is made to be entirely transparent deeply open and very clear based on the technical merits of the work all the explanations in the modern or midterm compile time programming report for the rust were technical in nature and it critiqued all of the available work based on the merits of its work i really i do how do i not know anything about this compile time programming business i'm actually like right now the biggest takeaway right now is what what the heck is compile time stuff and did this compile time stuff did they quit is is that team getting like broken up i don't know i can't because i know some minimally one person has quit which seems which seems intense whoever this jt i so i don't really know a lot about this this jt person right here he quit and so seems tough seems real tough all right so whatever's going on it sounds tough you know what i mean let's see therefore it is baffling to to first be nominated and accepted as a speaker rush to ensure i provided the conference organizers with everything they need to present the materials accurately to the public with the explicit blessing of the rust project leadership didn't have to add its direct behest only to be pulled back later it is also deeply confusing and ultimately insulting for them not to contact me beforehand and simply ask me if i would disclaimer my work to make it clear that they did not explicitly endorse this direction multiple times before the rust conf schedule and program was released i made it obscenely clear that there was not there was not going going there there was not a going going to be an rfc for the work i'm not sure what that means i don't know what a going going is there there was not going to be an rfc for this work let's see is going going a phrase that i'm unaware of or is that just an oopsie daisy i think that's just noopsy daisy that's how i'm gonna i think it's just an oopsie daisy but you know how there's weird like at netflix we say there's a there there you know sometimes you have these weird they like i don't know maybe a going going you know it's not a going going okay it's not a going going we're not doing that yet but you know it's a going going you know it's a little going going you know i might start using that phrase because it's kind of like a there there you know there's a there there or there's not a there there is there there you don't know if there's there there right it's a very you know these phrases are important i was talking about let's say hold on okay so let's see that might be a buy let's see all right here we go that this might be bias folks and whether or not it would be let's see okay to do this individuals in contact with me both inside and outside rusconf leadership made it abundantly clear that this topic was perfectly fine furthermore they had already met to discuss my work beforehand so at no point should anyone be confused about what my intentions and goals are spending my resources to play weird games i don't even know what that means it is patently obvious that somebody is pulling very weird strings behind the scenes here at multiple junctures it is said it would be a fine if we did not do this or i am unsure why they picked me but at multiple points let's see but i had multiple points i was told i should absolutely keep going and it was explicitly encouraged for me to go all the way with the keynote like i said at the beginning you know how hard it is to write a good conference talk like it is is this nerdy game of thrones this might actually be nerdy game of thrones this makes no sense like all of this makes no sense again this is again i really wish i really just wish things were more clear from the rust side of things it always feels so weird the rusted wedding the rusted wedding can i be jamie wait no wait i don't want to be jamie what am i saying i don't want to be jamie oh i'm just hey oh i was like i want to be jamie he was a great sword fighter but then i realized he also really loved his sister and then i was like hmm no you don't want to be lit you don't want to be a little finger i know i know the whole love loving the sister business okay i you know i messed that up anyways it just always feels like i mean a personal opinion again i have no idea how true this is but maybe i'm just not involved enough and this is a completely ignorant point but it always seems like there is just there's an a very deep in crowd in rust and then there's communication that feels confusing on the outside that's like my general take and whether or not people feel that way or that is the case like in technical reality the perception feels that way that people feel very confused about a lot of the directions things are you know being taken for the rust project involved individuals to speak to me directly and without room for misinterpretation that i should be doing this after their group pushed me to do to the forefront is bizarre it is also doubly dubious i love the term dubious i need to be using that term more often that rather than any individual contacted me directly from the rust project leadership including the folks who nominated me in the first place i was given this mandate from rust conference organizers so that's capital o organizer so that must be like an email who admitted they had no influence over this decision if someone objects to the direction and content of the midterm compile time programming report i have been and will continue to be available to discuss the merit of my work and whether or not it is a good fit for the direction of rust in general but to date shepherd's oasis is shepherd's oasis is this some sort of firefly reference i'm not sure what shepard oasis is what is what is this and i have not received any email communication regarding is that someone's name shepherd's oasis or is that a group i assume that's a group i have no idea i don't know what shepard's oasis is i think it's his company oh it's the company okay yeah that makes sense i think it feels like a firefly reference like if i were to make a guess that feels like a firefly reference and i have not received any email communication regarding the work or any concerns from the rust project shepard's oasis and i have not been given any warnings or asked to reconsider things through any kind of instant messaging a communication or otherwise zulub discord etc from the rust project and shepard and i always are shepherd's oasis and i were not the original ones seeking to give presentations about the subject material until we were explicitly asked to the sudden reversal smacks of shadowy decisions that are non-transparent to normal contributors like myself it is brutal introduction to the way the rust project actually does business that is not covered by its publicly available procedures and practices and absolutely not at all mentioned in its code of conduct see okay the only one that's slightly confused okay slightly confused i would love to know more of what's happening i think we would all love to know more of what happens okay i'm trying to read fast it's boring i you i try to operate on a on a youtube 2x time frame okay as the russ foundation had trouble with its trademark rollout and the rust project presented itself as the capable group that can do the right thing i find myself in the opposite situation here the russ foundation has handled the grant work with utmost grace respect and professionalism for myself and shepard's time contrarily the rust project i don't know what that i don't even know what that i don't know how to say that word okay [music] how do you say that word can someone dained dained deemed dained deemed dined did i thank you for respelling it so i was like ah easy dinged daned the roger brother deigned to effectively pass several mandates down through opaque process that affected me while refusing to air to this minute unknown grievances with the direction of the compile time mid to midterm report i have already committed a lot of time to continue exploring the direction detailed in the report the entire goal of the report was to let everybody know early what we were doing he's restated this quite a few times but i get i get this idea i get the total idea of what's going on here i feel totally bad oh look at this yearning for a different direction entirely a la zig's comp time direction which i responded to directly about its implications and impacts or challenges of oh this is awesome that's what i want i love ziggs compile time that was that it was incompatible with the current rust model okay on ctfe i don't know what that is how and why was never fully detailed but most of these conversations have gone into sufficient depth to get to that point or explain what specific parts of the compiler or technology would make this impossible to implement to invite me as keynote speaker and then quietly cut my legs at the last minute i think that's a joint is that a joint absolutely not this is a mark of both a vindicated vindictive behavior and severe unprofessionalism that i expect from various organizers i am forced to interact with from day to day as a human being living in a flawed world but not the rust project sure i need to ask the organizers that was going to cover expenses to refund everything before it's too late which perhaps as the only benefit to the situation they have released themselves early enough that this should be easy to do and sure i no longer get to stand up at rusconf the most prestigious rust affiliated conference there is and talk originally i was thinking of attending the london rust conference to talk about this instead sometime in 2024 if it was still around this was after me repeatedly trying to weasel my way out of the engagement but failing to tame my usual two powerful urge to talk about x or y but truly there is only one winning move okay what is the winning move i don't know what the winning move russ nation is good too okay yeah i have never watched a rust conference talk i don't know let's say what let's say not to play i think that honestly that is always the best move is not to play when things like this happen my general my general thoughts are don't play right when you can't when you can't understand decisions that are made or you feel like they're targeted for some reason other than technical right like like some sort of emotive type like response the best way is just to just stop playing honestly like there's like this recent twitter drama i'm sure some of you are pretty aware of it where people are where there's an individual that's kind of like causing some harm and a lot of people are talking about it and blah blah blah there's been tweets all over the place like the best move is don't play the game don't play the game you can just get completely out and so i'm in the don't play the game mode right now avoid all the things you know i didn't think my asthma tweet would go so wrong i know your asthma tweet good job all right this let's see if this is a game then as painful as it is and as much as i love indulging by neurodivergence to get up front of a large body of individuals and start info dumping my heart out i must not play if i give the talk after it has been downgraded then i acquiesced that the grotesque behavior is something i personally slash professionally am okay with if i try to negotiate my way back towards a keynote while constantly asking for the reasons for this out of the blue decision then i'm accepting their framing that this decision making and process is valid and that i must abide by their opaque governance i choose neither this is great i think this is a great way to put it right i think this is a perfect way to state this which is you think that what they did was bad therefore you will not just you will not you will not continue to give a talk nor will you try to negotiate back so i think this is a big thing i see a lot is when something bad happens people tend to try to negotiate back into like good graces or to change something about it which often is just the wrong move because let's imagine that you do get the keynote back the problem was is that you had a target or something odd was on your back beforehand and now you're back in well guess what's still happening that same target's there but potentially larger more difficult even worse experience so it's just like you know it could be really really bad and so i don't know just a thought i sure hope that everybody you know i feel really really bad feel genuinely bad for just the work that shepherd's oasis and i don't even know this person's name angelicus i don't that's me making up how to pronounce it feels bad you know feels really bad that's all i have to say is that this sounds like like literally the worst possible outcome sorry brcus bjarkis the arcus okay anyways genuinely feel bad all right i guess we got continuation i didn't realize there was a continuation the way governance currently works in the rust project is yet again in a broken state resulting in the project-wide decisions without proper process or consensus which results in people getting hurt the sooner the new council is formed the better yeah i mean that that's rough that's real rough i get it i don't know what the new council i don't i don't quite know what that means or what it would take but i mean that has to i mean it sucks that that happened big shame to see i recently dropped multiple clients whereas multiple clients and products in the past couple months due to rust drama copyright big brother stuff and client concerns okay dude it's hard to read what i i can't tell what you're trying to say so i'm moving to zig and odin i wish odin was as easy to use with sea libs as ziggas okay uh also you let's you should look at this holy cow there's even more the phd all right so that was the article let's see as someone who has just let's see as someone who has just as little idea of what's going on as anyone else here this is my best attempt at a summary of the situation based on the information contained in the post the author has been working on a proposal for an experimental experimental language feature which has been facilitated by monetary grant from the rust foundation their work through attention on the rusconf organizers who invited the author to give a keynote okay the author chose to make aforementioned proposed language feature the topic of their talk and this was clear yep at some point afterwards the rust conference organizers contacted the author to inform them that their talk was being downgraded from a keynote to a regular talk apparently at the rest leadership as a result the author was through their talk entirely noting that ironically as the rust foundation has had trouble with its trademark rollout and the rust project presented itself as the capable group that can do anything right i find myself in the opposite situation here yeah which is funny because i i i'm kind of under the personal thing where i'm not i'm having a hard time trusting any of it i mean i feel bad it feels really bad in the sense that i really love the language i really really love what's going on with rust i think it's a i think it's i think this is a really great thing i'm gonna keep looking at the comments below don't worry it's just honestly this hurts me it hurts me because this just shows this is like a classic example of why power given to humans suck right like we all can't help it everybody gets awful i would not want to be in leadership because i know for a fact that you know anytime you get in leadership it's like it's impossible not to get it feels like it's impossible not to get corrupted it feels very sad i feel very sad about this chat gbt is worse chat gpt has just codified human bias into a machine that's all it is it chat gpt would only be a thousand times worse because you'd have no idea how decisions are made and it would be life and death right like i would hate ai overlords they would be a thousand times worse like literally a thousand times worse at least there's a human that gets disposed of by time and then new humans have to come in it just i feel completely it just sucks because this is a great language and there's plenty of great people in the community i still think about greg leptos greg is one of the nicest people i've ever met i think about ben ben whis or benny both from from the wrestling a lot of bands out there just amazing great individuals huge respect for them i love what they do love how passionate they are is just fantastic and so it's just it always makes me sad you know what i mean kids will turn to ai i know kids will turn to ai anyways okay let's see this seems the sort of thing that calls for a response from the rust project leadership but is unclear right now since the rush project leadership is currently completely overhauled its government structure if i may assume good faith from all parties here the charitable interpretation is that the ongoing overhaul to the governance structure is causing crossed wires and dropped packets i i hate this i art i hate this response right here because that means i mean the problem with the problem with this response means that it's it's all good natures and oopsie daisies it it the thing is is that if that's true then the communication would become clear right instead you're just blaming an a nothing right someone needs to step up and take responsibility who made the decision someone at one point there's one or more people who made a decision they need to make a decision and make it clear what happened there's no oopsie daisies lost packets right just be clear with your communication always err on the side of over communicating then under communicating tom well tom's a genius he wouldn't have had this happen to begin with so yeah the disappearing perpetrator yeah let's see this is just not a misconvenience i hate that exactly i hate that too i i hate that that oh it's just a miscommunication oopsie daisy it's just like okay then communicate try again take a swing right like do a good job help us out here i'm attempting to use my contacts in order to find the proper person to bring this to the attention of in the meantime since nobody here has any more information and all we can do is uselessly speculate i will be locking comments to minimize the drama i also dislike this let the people talk oh this is just the worst of all looks oh this is just this is literally a thousand times worse than like this is somehow the worst aspect of it all like the thing is is that you just let people speculate it doesn't matter you put a nice pinned comment up at the top and say hey this is all the information we have everything here below is pure speculation we will try to get the right person on on board right like that's all you have to do and it's honestly it makes it easy like like because this is just like a pure version of censorship because the worst part is that you can't even have a singular place where communication can happen now you know where communication happens now right here now you have me talking about it which is like i don't think i'm a good representative of it i don't know what's going on here i'm not the right person you know what i mean there's another post there is another post does anyone want to anyone leslie no comments on my jay diesel on his threat i know does anyone want to link me another thing because ah this is i'm genuinely disappointed by this you know i i'm sure you're trying to do your best okay mr kibwin but this ain't it like this ain't it like no one feels good about this no one's going to feel good about this right this doesn't help anybody and it feels bad i mean this is the classic thing where you know this is why everyone hates reddit truly why everybody hates reddit you know what i mean is because it is it is more moderated and more authoritarian than like any other platform right you just have one mod that can just destroy anything right the mods are the worst mods are like little tyrants right and that's the problem is that it's it's their will and sure it's their where whoever this person is they get to be a mod it's their will that's how it works that doesn't mean i can love it i don't have to love it i think focusing on the solution is the best idea reform can you look at the rc i could look at the rc i think that is the best solution is obviously looking to reform but somebody has to like you also have to just like the worst thing you can do is make everyone be quiet where all the eyes are at because then all the talkings are distributed among everywhere right it is a thousand times better to have people in here saying yeah but that's speculation yeah but that's speculation yeah no one has actually said that yeah but that's speculation yeah what you're doing is you're just making stuff up right like all those words could be there and then guess what everything that's said right here would be all dispelled right away right but the structure is ambiguous and then no one knows who the person is to step up and say something that's why you need clear yes well yes i mean that's a rust that's a rust problem but this is a reddit problem right this is different i don't know it just makes me sad i think in general in general this makes me sad i wish it wasn't this way again my favorite language i've ever used and i feel bad about it that's all i don't i i you know i'm not i'm not a person that can tell you exactly i i i'm someone that i'm someone that i don't think i know the exact right answer and so is this answer better than letting people speculate is this answer better than telling everyone to shut up is this answer better than suppressing knowledge or the opposite trying to get people out there right away to talk about it i don't know what the right answer is because i don't know anything but i can tell you that the only thing i know is that more transparency is better feels bad feels bad sorry for the person's affected sorry for the deleted comments sucks yeah rust is great but yeah you're right like how they run the leadership just it seems sucky it just seems sucky this is what i hate about open source yeah open source can be really tricky you know and i get it that rust has a lot of money coming in they need a foundation they need people running the ship they need people making decisions i i'm on that team like you need that you have to have that it makes perfect sense how's the zig leadership it is something it is something that i really do need to look into more jt resigns from the roles of the rust project i'm also curious about this here's the hacky durham post for it so i don't have alerts on i i'm gonna say there's a lot of thank yous i need to make i mentioned on twitter but i'll also mention it here i've resigned i wish there was more so this is i mean it's truly this is why all of this was done so i have no idea what happened feels bad feels bad do you like rust because it's as powerful as c but with safety i like rust because of the expressive type system i love the trade system i love a lot of those things i don't love i don't necessarily love the safety aspect of rust i mean that's why i'm very o camel curious is because i could love oh camel real talk oh camel could be the thing i love i love the type system and so that's why i'm just curious about anything bro literally send a message on link on reddit that sends to a twitter absolute social media addiction there is a very convoluted thing oh camel oh crazy oh baby yeah and so real talk that's why i i wanna i wanna get into oh camel i want to get into that i have an htmx yet i really want to get into that because i really love the type system i love traits i love the ability i just love what it does to the language it's beautiful so
