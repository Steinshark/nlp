foreign mexico is a special place for me a place where i started my filmmaking career met some of my best friends in the world and also where i nearly died in the cartel ambush [music] so when i heard that a big group of my favorite people were all meeting in a little surf town in baja i knew i couldn't miss out [music] i'll be totally honest i didn't really expect this to be a vacation i actually had a whole bunch of plans to film the short dock and to do bts content for the channel and to rope a bunch of my really overqualified friends into helping me out the problem was once i got here i just didn't want to do it for a couple of days i tried to force it but it really just didn't feel right and then it hit me with my work full time in the film industry and the crazy hours i put into this youtube channel i've pretty much been doing nothing but working seven days a week for the last year so i made the executive decision to put the camera down and just enjoy being here with my friends and don't worry i'm still going to do a bunch of short docs i've got huge plans for the channel for 2023 and there's going to be all sorts of bts so none of that has changed but i honestly think that deciding not to work for a little bit has been one of the best decisions i've ever made apart from starting this channel so in this video instead of giving out career advice or talking about the latest gear i'm going to switch it up a little bit and instead show you some of my personal life outside filmmaking and then talk about why my new year's resolution for this year is to put the camera down more often [music] [music] it can be easy to think that if we're not constantly shooting posting and editing videos that we're not making progress in our filmmaking career and this is just as true for me as anyone out there our culture emphasizes this obsession with productivity above all else and i feel like we're bombarded with garyvee quotes telling us that sleep is for the week mr b sleeps in the studio and casey neistat posted every single day for years to get his channel to blow up the message seems to be that if we're not always working we're falling behind [music] so even though the point of the trip was to spend time with my friends after i booked my flights to mexico i immediately started planning out how i could leverage the trip to get a bunch of content for this channel as soon as i got there i realized that this wasn't the vibe at all but i tried to force it anyways i'd wake up in the morning and instead of watching the sunrise or going for a walk in the desert or just sitting around with the dogs and enjoying it i was thinking about work and even though i thought at the time that this is what i needed to do a little voice in the back of my head was yelling at me to stop and so i did and it was the best decision i could have made for the next couple of weeks i did essentially no work at all at first i felt guilty but as the days turned into weeks that feeling went away and slowly i began to relax i started getting up at sunrise and swimming in the ocean with my friend shooting a makeshift bow and arrow until my fingers hurt and essentially basing my entire day around our nightly barbecues i even started to film a bit of it but not because i had to because i wanted to and that part is important because honestly i can't think of the last time i picked up a camera other than an iphone to film something only for myself i've been lucky enough to turn my hobby into my job and in the last 12 years i've been able to make my full-time living through a camera but in the process the passion became obligation if it wasn't for a job then i wasn't shooting it and that kind of sucks foreign to me when i felt the old urge to film for filming's sake come back and i have to say a really nice one i basically just shot my version of home movie footage of us hanging out at the desert but it was fun and filmmaking is supposed to be fun terrible stressful fun that makes me question your life choices sometimes but still fun if i hadn't given myself permission not to do it i'm not sure i would have felt the same way so my new year's resolution for this year is to set aside more chunks of time just like this where i'm free to do absolutely nothing if i shoot home videos great if i just stare at the wall for 11 days also great obviously doing nothing for too long isn't conducive to a successful professional life and even though i'm saying all this i do care a lot about my career and i want to keep working hard at it i want to direct another feature and grow this youtube channel and keep traveling the world with the camera like i have been for most of my adult life i'm not going to throw all of that away and move to a tropical island to live the quiet life so don't worry there's lots more videos in bts coming but i will or maybe i should say i have to take at least a few weeks a year to slow everything down the only rule is that i need to do it with people that i love and preferably with dogs around so that's it from mexico for now i hope you found something in that video that resonated with you wherever you are and again this doesn't change anything about the huge plans i have for growing the channel this year and all the short films and bts content i'm going to make and i really am super excited to bring you all on that journey with me but if you're in photography or filmmaking or whatever and you think you might be getting close to burning out i hope this video helps to let you know that it's okay to take a break and it might just be the best investment you make in your filmmaking career this year see ya [music] production [music] [music]
