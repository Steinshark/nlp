well it's finally over logan paul apologized coffeezilla your slime is he is a lopsided journalist with an agenda more like an internet criminal oops wrong video that was the first response he actually apologized in another response the defamation lawsuit that is happening because this is wrong this is hold on wait a second that's not it either turns out it's actually on his secondary channel that's why i couldn't find it it's entitled thank you coffeezilla it's the third response from logan paul and it's a pretty big change in logan's attitude so far so let's see what he has to say to us coffee zilla is not a criminal oh that's a relief i thought logan was gonna hire me but in all seriousness this video does have some major admissions in it i want to go through for one logan apologizes to me i called him i apologized my initial response to his series was that of of a fire an ego not only that logan also pledges a 1.3 million dollar refund plan for people who bought his nfts i am personally committing a thousand each to this which is about 1.3 million dollars in addition to the that he also promises to finish cryptozu which was left abandoned and then step three obviously finish and deliver the game as outlined in the white paper now i'll be honest this is a big change in tone and honestly a lot of this is good news it's great that victims are going to get something back logan seems to acknowledge his continuous lapse in judgment he's not suing me which is also cool and frankly this new response is just way better than his last two i think we can all acknowledge that while also acknowledging that it's not really a perfect response either there are still major problems here like for example many of the victims just have been ignored in this response a lot of accusations have gone unanswered and worse logan still seems to be playing the victim a lot so in this video i'm gonna do my best to give logan credit where credit is absolutely due while also sharing moments where i think this apology fell flat and let me start with a positive for example i think if you are an outsider who is not affected by this scam and you wanted a reason to love logan paul again i think this nails it i mean he's giving back some of the money he's apologizing so if you're a card-carrying member of the low gang you can rest easy here logan says he's sorry he says he's making things right and i think that's the point of this video is to speak to his core audience to tell them he didn't scam anyone and for what it's worth i think logan succeeds here the problem is i don't think i or the crypto zoo holders were who logan was really addressing here and this is where the response falls more flat because he doesn't adequately address the real victims of crypto zoo which i i think they're rightfully angry about and i wanted to spend some time talking about that because again they've been the heartbeat of this whole story and they feel very differently about this response than logan's core audience does they don't feel like it's enough and i want to talk about why starting with the 1.3 million dollars repayment plan because obviously this is the strong longest part of logan's entire response actually opening up his wallet and i don't want to minimize that in this video i just do want to put it in context because 1.3 million dollars is a lot of money unfortunately the scam was much bigger than 1.3 million dollars so the fact is most victims are not going to be made whole by this plan just in zoo coins alone blockchain evidence shows 7.7 million dollars was stolen by logan's team depending on who you believe and this refund does nothing for those victims it doesn't even apply to the holder of zoo coins at all you get nothing if you bought this in-game currency this refund only applies to current egg holders so they can cash out that nft for the initial mint price in crypto which matters sort of because crypto has crashed a lot so even though people spent 2.5 million dollars on these eggs in order to refund all these holders at mint price it now only costs 1.3 million dollars in in today's money which again is nice but doesn't do enough because the zoo coins were most of this scam i mean that's where most of the money was spent wasn't just on the nfts it was on this in-game currency which logan seems to have no intention of refunding and his response for why is pretty bad he responds to somebody who lost eighty thousand dollars who told him i hope this isn't just doing what you have to do technically to not get sued logan replies with a screenshot of his white paper and later explains to another member of the discord i believe there has been a misconception here as outlined in the white paper zoo was created to support cryptozoo and was not intended to be an investment vehicle when you sold or bought is not my decision and look to be fair to him there was a misconception that zoo was an investment vehicle but it's a misconception that he created i mean he's the one who said kryptos who was a fun game that earns you money and how it earned you that money was that your nfts earned you zoot tokens you know things that were supposed to have value that was the whole point of the game so to suggest that these coins weren't advertised as valuable or an investment vehicle is insane especially since logan's own team had rules for selling based strictly on the value of said investment vehicle quote rules for selling no selling until a 200 million dollar market cap so i think it's fair to say if logan's own team were buying zoo coins early waiting for them to go up in value to a certain level and then selling them that sounds like an investment vehicle albeit a very stupid one so this explanation definitely doesn't hold water and logan obviously just doesn't want to be on the hook for zoo coins instead he just kind of wants to refund the much smaller part of the nfts what makes this even worse is that this refund doesn't even apply to everyone who bought these nfts because some of these people sold their nfts at a deep loss thinking that crypto zoo was over that it was abandoned and and there's actually a way you could have tracked this whole thing or logan could have and you know found a way to repay all the people who lost money on eggs but instead this refund only applies to current holders meaning nobody who sold during the year and a half this project was abandoned gets anything back which is a large percentage of the actual victims and this is pretty bad this was brought to logan's attention by one of the people in the discord joao says quote logan paul what will happen to the people who sold everything at a loss when the project appeared to be quote abandoned well everyone who minted be able to get that refund or just the current owners now in reply to this someone in the discord said if you sell you lose common investing knowledge and logan replies seeming to agree with this idea which is just kind of a terrible perspective for logan to have when he seems to be saying that he wants to refund these people and he's the reason a lot of these people left and this is where logan's new apology starts to ring more hollow a it's in all of the follow-ups after the response video because i don't know if he can help himself from betraying how he really feels about this because in another discord exchange logan says please do not put any more money into cryptozoo which by the way is quite reasonable to say but then somebody follows up and says guys can someone explain what he said with not investing but rather than replying oh guys i just meant like i don't want anyone else losing money or you know i don't want anyone else recklessly gambling logan replies instead quote i will no longer be the scapegoat for anyone's financial decisions which is a wild response for someone who's claiming to refund people because it implies that he thinks he's the victim here and this is just insane to say as the face of this project which got everyone involved because i think it betrays how he feels about this situation he doesn't seem to see anything wrong with advertising a game that will make you money it never delivering millions of dollars being stolen by criminals he hired and then when all of those people want their money back he feels like he's the scapegoat like oh these guys shouldn't have believed me when i advertised to them a fun game that will make you money it just doesn't make any sense i mean logan had a simple job to do all he had to do was just come out apologize get as much money back for the victims as possible but he himself can't help but play the victim here in fact i have a third example of how logan might really feel because logan tweeted right before this response he says quote the matrix is real pray you never become its target now i guess he's trying to channel andrew tate here unsuccessfully basically saying like ah i'm getting attacked not because i did anything wrong or scammed anyone i'm just i'm just too much of a truth teller i'm just an enemy of the system that's why i must be getting attacked but if that's the case we didn't have to wonder did the matrix force you to apologize did it force you to hand back 1.3 million i just think comments like this go so far to undercut his apology because it's very clear that instead of actually like caring about the victims he feels like he's a victim i mean he's saying like oh pray you never become its target who's the matrix though logan like is it your fans who got robbed who are the agents coming after you i i know it's not me i know you're not saying i'm the matrix here in my 10 million dollar studio because after all you're thanking me you're thinking the matrix like what is this response it's so childish the way he speaks about this stuff and again this isn't to be dismissive of logan's actions if he follows through because there is a lot of good that 1.3 million can do and you know what if he goes back and he finishes the game that's also good but it's just so frustrating when the good that logan seems to be doing he's doing the bare minimum of at the last possible second with motivations that seem to be in the proper context to say it lightly irreparably tainted by self-interest now i'm not going to address logan's other two response videos which are mostly like attacking me because logan sort of walked those back now he's apologized he said he was going to delete them i think he deleted one of them the other one's still up i don't know if the impulsive episode's gonna go down either way it's just much less interesting now that he says he doesn't like mean it anymore he's not gonna sue so i don't feel the need to publicly defend myself if you're curious about all the wild stuff that was wrong in those first two responses i'll put the video live on my patreon but i didn't want to release it at the time because i thought there was a better chance at getting a good ending for the victims here if i was a bit more diplomatic with logan at this critical juncture when he was deciding whether he was going to give money back or not i don't know if i succeeded in moving the needle but that was certainly my intention either way now that logan has responded with his plan and i've given my perspective on how much i think it's rooted in you know self-interest versus a genuine you know attempt to help out the the victims i think this is about as much as i'm going to be able to contribute to this situation i mean i do think it's incredible that even 1.3 million dollars came of this while i also can acknowledge that it's not nearly enough for the real victims of this i'll follow up in the future to make sure that he actually gives that money away but for now i think most of the crypto zoo victims if they're still hungry for justice are going to have to take it up with logan in ways that are different than i can do on youtube here which by the way i think some of them are in fact i just saw a lawyer on youtube attorney tom he's going to start the legal process going after logan using stuff like the arbitration clause in their terms of service so i just wanted to say if you're a victim of cryptozoo you can check out that video which i'll link to you if you want or consult with a lawyer because i'm sure for the people who lost a lot of money this is certainly not the end for them because they didn't get a full refund and i'm sure they'll be seeking one but even though it's not the end for them it is the end for me for now this is the end of the crypto zoo saga and i wanted to say and give a huge heartfelt thank you to everyone who viewed this and supported me throughout this it's been insane the level of support when logan was threatening us and i do not take it lightly there is an alternate universe where if that hadn't happened logan would feel emboldened to sue me and probably not give much back to the victims so it's your support that made all the difference and got the victims at least something so that wraps it up thank you for watching
