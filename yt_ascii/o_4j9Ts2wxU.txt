in scripture we have this important passage in the new testament when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his glorious throne all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats if you put the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels so this is of course a very famous text the text looks uses the symbolism of the right hand in the left hand in a way that is very intuitive to us and makes a lot of sense but this symbolism is very important and it appears universally i think in most cultures it's related to the experience that we have of having a hand that is strong a hand that we can easily use and a hand which is weak and a hand which is more awkward it's also related to the right and the left eye and so what i'm going to do with you is i'm going to go through some basic notions of what this could mean in terms of more than just a metaphor but as the basic experience of how beings coalesce towards their unity but also break apart into multiplicity this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so a lot of my difficulty let's say with the symbolism of the right and the left hand comes about in my unders my interpretation of this particular image so this image is one of the very first images that we have i think probably the first image that we have of the last judgment and so in this image we see christ in the center to his right we see the sheep to his left we see the goats to his right we also see a red angel and to his left we see a blue angel in his right hand is exposed and his left hand is hidden and secret now this is one of the first images and this image will last quite a long time in the in the history of christianity and it will become a a kind of standard and will be explicit in different ways it will come all the way up to the iconostasis because in the iconostasis which is this separation between the sacred place and the nave in in churches in the orthodox church very often we will find what is known as a deisis and the deoces will have christ on our right let's say but also in the day says he's often in the middle and then on his right will be the mother of god and then on his right again will be this red angel which has come to be represented as saint michael come to be understood as saint michael and so on his left now will be saint john the baptist and then will be the blue angel which we saw earlier who is has been come to be understood as saint gabriel the archangel gabriel this will of course also go all the way into the icon of the last judgment it's very important to kind of understand that this image of the deises is an image of the last judgment every time you see an image of christ in the center with the mother of god and with with saint john the foreigner and or saint peter and saint paul as you can see saint peter is here on the right and saint paul is here on the left these images will be images of we could say the last judgment or the eschaton or the final moment where all we can kind of see the cosmic structure of the universe separated into two with paradise on one side with death and hell and breakdown and animality on the left side with christ in the middle in this one i like this one very much i keep showing the same image i'll put a link to the this is a contemporary icon so i'll put a link to it in the the in the description although although it is really a condensation of all the old all this all the old icons of the last judgment and so we see we see christ raising his hand up we see the sun on his right hand we see christ with his hand going down and then we see the moon on his left hand so this is a moment of ascension we could say going towards christ or going towards heaven and this is a something going down so it's coming down and away from christ into death and into hell but not just that of course these saints that are on the left of christ are not you know in death and hell but we'll see how it all kind of comes together in the symbolism as we as we move forward and so one of the problems that we have is that when we look at the symbolism of the right hand we'll find something like opposites which seem to be in the symbolism and so that's one of the reasons why it's so difficult and people will flip from one to the other without realizing that they're doing it they'll kind of switch from one aspect of the symbol to the other and i think i understand why now but it's taken me a quite a long time to understand why and so the four sides of this we could say that the right hand is concentric if you remember the words of christ it says he says to the sheep come into the kingdom right come toward me enter into the kingdom and he says to the the goats you know move away right go away and so what you end up seeing in the symbolism of the right and the left hand is you'll often find on the right hand you'll find symbolism of a foundation of establishing gathering together law of course the symbolism of the right hand is of course the symbolism of something which is straight you know in many languages the word for right and the word for left like in french for example we say draw which means straight or right hand and gauche means awkward or you know crooked it can in different language you'll find that the the the right means straight and means also you know has something to do in the sense of also a stand in for the center or sometimes the word for right or the notion of the right hand will almost be like a stand in for the center itself but then also on the right hand if you look at you know the image of the last judgment you find that on the right hand you have something like mercy protection often the right hand is symbolized by blue or by water already it's starting to cause problems in your mind because that image i showed you at the outset has the red angel on the right hand and on the left hand is often represented as wild as strange as the exception as excess as crooked and so often it's related to the passions to to dissipation dilapidation all these types of this type of images but if you look at the the story of the last judgment in the gospel it's also related to rigor because christ says to those on his left hand you know go away like he's using a very harsh a rigorous language he's applying the law to them very strictly in order to push them away and this is will also have the symbolism of fire and the sword and so what i'm going to propose to you is that we're looking at a kind of crossover we're looking at at the two sides how depending on your point of view they cross each other and they tend to represent something they seem to look like they're representing the opposite of what they were in the first place and i think that this will be very important it seems like it's just arbitrary and this is not a big deal but it's actually going to be very important understanding the relationship between myself and others the relationship between you know my interaction with other people and how in some ways that which moves away from me is received by the other and so there's this switch that happens in between and that switch is sometimes hard to conceptualize but i think with a bit of effort we will be able to understand it in a way that isn't too too difficult that it's actually pretty simple and this also seems to be i think what is captured in the symbol of the caduceus which has been brought into the church through the symbolism of the bishop staff which is that you have a center you have a central axis at the top of the axis you have a golden ball you have something like the source the light the sun you know the caduceus is also represented with wings and so it's the idea of the spiritual thing above you know the sun above the source of light the source of things the the source of being and then wrapped around it are these two serpents which represent two tendencies and you can see how the serpents move towards the center and then away from the center towards the center and away from the center and on one side one serpent will move towards the center and then we'll cross over and then we'll move away from it and then return back towards the center and i think that this is actually a very important structure it's a it's also a structure when we look at it we it's very satisfying to us to look at this image of a of a straight axis and something moving a serpent around it it it is i think it's a very primordial structure which is why it appears in every single culture right you know the the the the europeans were probably surprised to come to south america and in central america and to find the image of this serpent wrapped around a pole with wings you know as they they encountered the the these empires that were in central and south america but i think it's because it really is one of the probably one of the oldest symbols in a very very universal symbol and so as you can see the imagery can be represented like this like here's an image of the last judgment from the medieval medieval tr in the medieval western style that has christ in the center and then on the right on his right hand he has a lily which is a representation of mercy and then on his left hand he has a sword now this of course is just a just a just a version of this right with the hand going up and the hand going down you know there are different ways to represent it here it is the lily on the right hand and the sword on the left hand this had their different representation of this they're different versions of it but it's really important to understand how these attributes the the lily and the sword became in western and also to a certain extent in eastern art represent you know the the attributes of the angel the attributes of gabriel and michael and so here is an image of a coptic agonist that is again the the wall that separates the holy place from the nave you can see that in the econostasis gabriel is holding a lily and michael here is not holding a sword but he's holding a lance often he can also be represented holding a sword here's a close-up where you can see gabriel holding the lily now once again the issue is that in in this image you can see that it is in some ways the opposite of this one because at the top you have you have christ and you have the blue angel on his left and the red angel on his right and this is of course the the issue this is the problem that we're trying to figure out and i think that the fact that we see the duality in the the art that continues on until today but that often we will see that duality flip has to do with the very problem of what it is that is going on in this image so here is a version of say michael of course holding a sword a russian icon of saint michael and a coptic icon of gabriel presenting the lily to the mother of god so if we look if we look at the angels themselves they are they do seem to be related to the right and the left hand so in the early christian times for example in the book of enoch there is a description of saint michael as being the right hand of god is standing on the right hand of god and this of course makes sense because the name of saint michael means the one who is like god he who is like god and so he is the right hand of god he is the one who is like god and that relates him to the right hand i've mentioned this idea that the right hand is something like a stand-in for the center it's like a foundation it's that which represents the center below the center and so when we look at the image of of of the mother of god on the right hand of christ we wouldn't be surprised to know to notice that that image the the image of the mother god will also be in the center for example in the image of the ascension we will see christ above and will see the mother of god below st as a stand-in for the center in the diocese we also have saint peter who is on the right of christ and then in the image of saint peter we have the same notion which is that christ says to saint peter right on you are the stone and on this stone i will found my church you are the foundation of the church and so he is in a way a stand-in for the center being on the right hand okay so all of these things hopefully make sense to you and so what why this is important is because we have to understand that all identities whether it's you whether it's a group you're participating in anything that has a logos that is recognized recognizes having a purpose will have something like a right hand and a left hand will have a concentric element and an eccentric element and so if you think about a you know think about a a team for example or think about let's say a company that is building robots or i don't know building something let's say they're building robots this company will have aspects that they will deal with which will be concentric that is aspects which will move towards their purpose and then they will also have access aspects that they'd have to deal with which will be eccentric which will be moving away from their purpose or further away from their purpose we could say so we can understand that that is of course something that you have to deal with in your your own life there are some things which move you towards identity towards let's say a kind of strengthening of identity and there are things which which will tend to move you away from identity and so this is the current we could take these kind of cosmic currents that that that move towards the center towards logos or the and move away from the center logos identity you can see that in the image of the last judgment christ is saying it very specifically right those on the right hand will come near and then the left hand will move away now in that story it's represented just as positive and negative in the sense that moving towards the center is positive moving away from the center is is negative but that's not of course always the case as i've often said which is that saint paul has that imagery to him he is the apostle to the the strangers right the apostle to the non-jews but everything about saint paul right how does he convert he falls off of his horse back off his heart he becomes blind he he he he talks about how he is a shape-shifter how he is uh he said that he's an aborted apostle right that he is you know he all his imagery is about this dissipation and this kind of brokenness but in his case it is not it is not bad although there are some bad aspects to it it is not bad on the on the opposite side you see saint peter who is you know the the one who speaks up at pentecost the one who kind of represents christ the one who is the foundation the one who is the shepherd for the other apostles all of this as they kind of stand in for christ and so you can see how neither one is positive and negative but how does it work in terms of why is it that this the center and the left and the right hand seem to have kind of two opposite aspects of symbolism coming together so i think the way that it's represented whether it is in the diocese whether it is the caduceus whether it is these different ways we try to represent the relationship of opposites is is it's difficult to represent visually because in some ways you could see it this way so this is the best way that i understand it so if we understand the notion of the right hand so think about sorry this is the right hand it sounds it looks like left hand to in your your experience but from the from the point of view of the logos okay so from the point of view of christ from the point of view of the identity from the point of view of center you have the right hand which is concentric so it's moving towards the the center and you have the left hand which is eccentric which is moving away from the center so the idea would be that the way that i experience the right hand of the logos that i experience the right hand of that which is facing me that which is that i'm engaging with it could be the logos but it could also be the other it could also be the person that is facing me is i experience it as a kind of mercy a loosening right there's a kind of loosening of the standards in order to bring me closer to the center closer to the logos but this right hand in myself is a is something like discipline it's something like self-containment you know it's something like holding together and so if i think about how the right hand applies to my relationship to myself then it is seen that it is seen as that which establishes my identity that which holds it together so it has a kind of hardening to it has a kind of solidity to it has to do with con that which conforms conforming but if i am facing someone else you know or if i'm moving towards a a purpose then what i experience from the moving towards that is has to be a kind of loosening on that bringing in a a kind of mercy at my own fault or else there would be no way to move into that that identity or move into the person across from me and i think that on the other hand you have the same thing because the left hand is eccentric then it appears in myself as a form of dissipation so my left hand in regards to myself is something like awkward it's dissipation it's loosening it's deforming of the central identity but if i experience the left hand from the other for the or the left hand of the purpose in which i'm trying to move then it's experienced as a rigor as a judge because it's the hardening of that of that identity that i'm moving towards which is pushing me away because it's not leaving room for me it's it's holding me away from itself by applying a kind of rigor and a kind of hardening to itself and so you could see it in the other way around again when it's applying the right hand in order to bring me into it it has to open itself up it has to apply a kind of mercy and a loosening to to move into so that we can move towards each other so you can understand that this is true of course like i said of identity and logos but it also is a reflection of the manner in which we actually experience the right hand and the left hand because if i'm going to shake your hand with my right hand i'm going to cross over there's going to be this crossing over which which will happen and my left hand will be a crossover to your left hand and so there is actually a really really profound because it has to do with our very experience of facing someone our very experience of encountering a person has to do with how these actually flip in our in our just immediate immediate experience but also conceptually in terms of the way in which we let someone come towards us or we push them away from us so we can understand that this is let's say in a positive way the way that i've represented it but we can also see it right as let's say flipped in terms of the way that i represented it up here means i have the positive side you could say but i also have the negative side here and usually that's what it is usually the right hand is something like positive and the left hand is tends to be something like negative not always but it often is that and so now we can understand how if i am in myself my right hand that is my tendency towards my own center my capacity to to be in myself and to to move towards myself can be experienced as pride as self-sufficiency whereas in a more positive way on the other side on the left side you can understand that my the left hand in regards to myself can be seen as a kind of exteriorization a possibility of of glory even you could say that is something which is not just in my center which is kind of emanating or moving out or or let's say overflowing from me can be seen as the as this left hand and so you know when we say things in the church when people say things like how you know the fire of hell is the fire of pentecost you can kind of understand it now like why that would be why is it that the the fire of hell as this kind of burning will be experienced by those who are let's say will experienced by those in a certain condition as the rigor and hardening of god but that for others will be experienced as a kind of glory as a kind of expansion of their of their being depending on their disposition depending on how they are related to relating to the the logos we could say so you can see that it's not a system it's really important because if you try to see it completely as a system then you're going to it's more like a poem it's more like a it's more like rhyming it has this it has an intuition of structure but the structure always kind of eludes you because because it is i think it really is very very basic in terms of our experience and so this is where we can kind of understand saint peter and saint paul more easily and the relationship between what we call the daisies so now again this is the this is a daisies with christ in the center with the mother of god on his right hand with the with saint john the foreigner on his left hand and john the baptist with saint peter on his right hand with saint paul on his left hand and so we can see now the different symbolism so in the in the case of the mother of god we have this containing we have this gathering in we have also this idea of a kind of standing for the center in the relationship of heaven and earth all of this is so she is gathered into the center and in in some ways she's also hidden because of that she she has a a she is also seen as the one who provides mercy provides you know a kind of softness to us so all of this kind of symbolism comes together if we can understand the different aspects of it and then saint peter he appears also in a way as a stand-in for the center as a boldness towards the center as a kind of representative again as being the shepherd the one who is a stand-in for christ in the world and now on the left hand then we have saint john the foreigner who is out in the wilderness he is wearing animal skins if you remember the image of in the last judgment where you see all these animals on the left side he's wearing animal skins he's yelling he's making a lot of noise he's telling people to repent and so there's nothing secret about him it's all outside it's all this kind of outer aspect and now the same again with saint paul who is like i said he's a roman citizen so he's almost a stranger he is a shape-shifter he says he's all things to all people so much about saint paul is about this if you're going to understand it you can kind of see why it is that saint paul represents himself with all these types of characteristics he even he says right that he's a that he is a an aborted apostle that's a pretty strong statement in terms of the idea of something which is rejected and and dead and you know and and is kind of far away but at the same time we can see how one leads to the other you know one side leads to the other and so think about saint peter and think about how saint peter is his symbolism is always the same right his symbolism is always the one who is bold but then because of his boldness sinks right the one who moves in a way from the right hand to the left hand so because of his boldness he he walks out on the water then he sinks he tells he tells christ that he will never betray him and and then he does he tells christ that that christ doesn't have to die right he's like no you don't have to die you can contain yourself you can just be the center in the sense of the right hand and the establishment and the and the the solidity but christ says to saint peter get behind me satan get behind me you oppose her so you can understand how this symbolism of moving from the right to the left and how let's say the one at the top is the kind of the opposite at the bottom is happening in the symbolism of these two people and you can so you can see that the the sin of saint peter is something like pride and so in saint paul you have the the one who falls off the who falls off the the the horse who does all that and his first sin is something like the thorn in the flesh you know and he it seems to be some kind of sensual sin related of course to a woman because this idea of the thorn is the consequence of the fall then also a thorn in his side which is related to the idea of eve coming from his side so he has this whole idea of of what it is that his sin is which seems to have something to do with sexuality though it's not totally clear but then also people are getting mad about this but there's also saint paul has the kind of opposite sin or i don't know if it's a sin but it's a tendency which that which that saint paul is always boasting he's always boasting without boasting he's always saying you know he he he has a very strange behavior in the in his letters where he's always saying you know he's boasting about he says on the one hand that he is nothing that he's all these things but then he kind of secretly boasts as he's doing that so that seems to also be part of this crossover that we find in the right and the left hand symbolism and so now we can understand there's a citation from saint gregory from saint maximus the confessor that i'm always quoting but i'm going to quote it to you again because i think it's a very powerful grasping of what the right and the left hand are in terms of the negative part of it so say maximus talks about the demons that combat us by the lack of virtue are those that teach us prostitution and drunkenness greed and jealousy so we can see that these these sins right they are the sins of dissipation the sins of dilapidation the sins of passion in the strict sense right of of becoming a slave to something outside of you that that dominates over you and then he says the demons that combat us by excess of virtue are those that teach us presumption vainglory and pride and who by the vices of the right secretly place in us the vices of the left so here you can actually see this crossover which is that that which begins in pride ends in dissipation and dilapidation and we can see that this is something which is true in the story of saint peter who starts with pride he starts with boldness and then ends sinking in the water sinking in the mire he ends denouncing christ of course he ultimately repents but we can understand the pattern that say maximus isn't taking this from he's not just pulling it out of his hat he has such a deep intuition of scriptural symbolism and the scriptural images that he's able to to show to show it in our everyday experience and so this also seems to be suggested in the image of the transfiguration so in this image of the transfiguration i like this one particularly because you can see on the right of christ you have christ going up the mountain and then on the left of christ you have christ going down the mountain so this this movement of moving towards the top and moving away from the top is there in this version of it it's not always there but in this version it is and then you see on the right hand of christ you have elijah now elijah is interesting because elijah you know is the one who calls down the fire of god he's the one who mocks the false gods he is you know and even the way he looks he has that wild kind of saint john the baptist aspect to him but look at he's on the right side of christ and then on the left side we have moses who is the one who brings the law who is the one who who brings the revelation but who also his sin his the same sin is saint peter right the sin of moses was to think that he was the one who would bring the water to the israelites and so you can see that saint said moses kind of up here is related to peter down here also because moses is a is the stand-in for god in the text i mean god says crazy things in exodus he says he says you know like i'm setting you up as my you know as my servant and then you will be god to aaron and then aaron will be your your your servant you know towards the people so he's kind of setting moses as a little god in the world who who acts on the others and so he is the stand-in for god in the story and then if you look at the bottom now it flips so moses is here saint peter is here and interestingly enough saint peter is looking towards the center right so he is looking towards the middle but then on the left hand you have james who is falling over backwards kind of like saint paul on the on the donkey and he is facing elijah here who elijah interestingly enough you know goes up in a flaming chariot and so in this case you can see how the flame and the chariot and the flame and the glory and the chariot as well because the chariot is a is a added aspect right it is a supplement a chariot is like a vehicle which is added to the identity it's like a body and so he goes up in this chariot this flaming chariot going up into heaven and so it's very much in some ways an image of all that is on the left hand but here he is represented on the right and i think it really is to represent this crossing over that happens between the left and the right hand depending on your perspective and like i said it's not a system it really is a kind of intuitive thing that happened in the in the tradition so ultimately i wanted we come back to this just basic image of the yin yang symbol which i think is probably actually in terms of a geometric representation might be one of the best representations of how the two two opposites come together how one opposite drives the manifestation of the other in this way and so it really is a a powerful image to help us understand what it is that these two streams we could say of reality how they come together and how they work and like i said it's really important to understand that that this is not just like abstract of course can help us understand the art and it can help us understand the stories but it is something which exists at every level of our experience it is something you know this tendency towards identity and towards solidity toward the center and this tendency tendency towards dissipation and breakdown and multiplicity is something which is part of every identity we can recognize and it's important to be able to see how let's say one causes the other in a positive way and also how the excess of one causes can cause also the excess of the other in a more negative way and how they are related together of course there would be much more to say and much more to meditate on but i thought this would at least be a basic a basic introduction to the symbolism and remembering that this symbolism is not of course just in the images i showed you it is there all through the old testament as well it appears as i think even right at the outset as the idea of the fruit of good and evil this basic opposition and then it appears as the column of fire and water in exodus it appears as the two pillars of the temple yakin and boaz if you look at those two pillars you can see that yakin means to establish you know to to no it means to establish so it is the right hand really and then boaz is of course the the one who married ruth who is this the one who went towards the stranger and has something to do with the left hand in this kind of exteriorization and interestingly enough it's funny to notice that in the christian in the in the jewish tradition if you look at the names of the of the the the the angels they do tend michael tends to be related to something more like mercy and the right hand and gabriel seems to be related to gebura or the idea of of more rigor and more strength you could say an exterior sticker exteriorization of strength whereas in christianity it seems to actually flip but it has to do with this facing each other i think think that when you look if you think of christianity and judaism kind of facing and shove each other and exchanging their position you could say at least in the way that saint paul presents it as you know the idea of the those that were under rigor are now under grace and and and vice versa this is the way that saint paul presents it in his in his text there seems to be this happening in even the image images of saint michael which for now for us say michael starts to be represented as red as the sword as all of this all of this while nonetheless also being related sometimes to the right hand and this crossover and then gabriel being re represented rather as mercy as the lily as the blue angel and but then nonetheless also being on the left hand and so there's a definitely a mystery there i of course invite all of you to continue to think about this with me because i've i feel like i've definitely not exhausted all the symbolism you can also look up some articles that i wrote for the orthodox arts journal about 10 years ago on different right and left-hand symbolisms there's of course different aspects to that some have to do with authority and power you know and and there are also other aspects that i've treated in those articles so i'll put those in the description that you can look up so thanks for thinking about this with me and this difficult but important symbolism and i will talk to you very soon [music] you
