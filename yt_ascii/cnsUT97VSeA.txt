hello everyone so for those who have not seen it jordan peterson had a pretty amazing discussion with alex oconor cosmic skeptic who i've also talked to on his channel as well i have to say that of all the celebrity atheists this is alex is really showing himself to be one of the people that is truly paying attention not only paying attention but seems to understand the arguments that jordan is presenting more than any of the other kind of celebrity atheist i've seen him talk to in the past one of the frustrations that i've had and you know that is often in talking to these kind of atheist types it's actually that we just talk past each other it's not that we disagree i mean we do disagree but ultimately at least for me it's been very frustrating because i often feel like people don't understand what it is that i'm talking about don't understand the argument and then also have a kind of a kind of arrogance and not understanding the argument which makes it even more difficult right to to not get annoyed at that kind of conversation but in this conversation between jordan and alex you really get the sense that alex has been working very hard at trying to kind of understand what it is that jordan is getting at not only that but also willing to push his own understanding of what religious thought is and has been thinking trying to think deeply about the stories about you know what they mean about you know what would it mean for them to have happened also in a in a more kind of physical sense or not all of this stuff anyway the conversation is very interesting definitely worth watching and surprisingly alex is able to get questions out of jordan peterson that many people have not been able to get which even surprised me that is alex asked him if someone put a camera in front of the tomb of of christ if it would have captured someone walking out and i think jan sent him like a suspect so which really sur surpris me and so so yeah so so great stuff but there's so i thought i would kind of put peek in and talk about one of the things that they discussed alex had some very interesting insights about the story in genesis about the story of the fall about the question of the serpent of who is the serpent what is the serpent's relationship to christ there would be so much to talk about but one of the things that alex said is that there's a problem in the text because the god says to adam and eve on the day that you eat the fruit you will die and then when they eat the fruit he said well they don't die and so what's going on why is it that when that god says that on the day that you eat the day that you eat the fruit you will die and they don't die and so what i want to do is i want to look at the story i want to look at how in fact they do die when they eat the fruit not only do they die but that the manner in which they die is actually just like everything in the book of genesis in the beginning of genesis is an origin story what we're noticing what we're seeing in the moment when they eat the fruit is an origin of death not only an origin of death in the bal sense but an origin in the sense that it shows us and helps us understand what death is it becomes a lens by which we can look at death after that and so i thought it' be useful to look at that you know just even for for you guys because it's an interesting subject [music]

it's also a great way for you to support what we're doing all right and so as you know in the story of genesis god tells eve not to eat the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil they can eat of all the fruit in the garden except for that one and if they do on the day that they eat of that fruit they will die and so then the serpent comes and says surely you will not die if you eat the fruit you will become like god knowing good and evil and so eve is tempted she eats the fruit and then a bunch of stuff happens now i've talked before about the idea that in some ways the serpent is telling the truth and so i won't go into that right now you know maybe we could talk about it another time that the serpent is not completely lying just like all lies she there's an aspect of it which is true and which will show itself to be true in the story of christ later about the idea of eating the fruit and dying but let's see what it is that happens after the he eats the fruit so i'm not going to go through text but i did made a list of all the things that happened to them hopefully i get this right if i if you feel like i'm missing something go head in the comments all right so when adam and eve ultimately eat the fruit the first thing that it says that happen to them is that they realize that they're naked and then what they do is that knowing that they're naked they hide themselves from each other they put they sew fig leaves on their bodies and then they hide themselves from god then when god finds out he comes to see them and immediately what adam does is he blames eve he says this woman that you gave me she gave me this fruit and then god turns to eve and then eve lays the serpent the next thing that happened is that god cursed the serpent and tells the serpent that the serpent will eat dust he says that there'll be en enmity between the woman and the serpent the serpent and her offspring and that the woman's offspring will crush the head of the serpent and the serpent will strike at the heel of that off offspring he tells eve that she'll have pain in childbirth that she'll have desire for a husband but he will rule over her he says that the ground is cursed then he says that to adam and he says that now it will be painful for to get food you have to work to in order to find food the world will pursue will produce thorns and thistles and you'll have to eat the plants of the field and then finally he ends his pronunciation by saying that for dust you are and to dust you will return you'll have to you have come out from the ground we have to return to the ground and so the key for us in understanding all of these statements is in the last part is in the very end of the statement where god says to adam from dust you are and from dust you will return if you remember in the second creation account god gathers the dust of the earth and then blows the spirit into the dust and that is how god that is how man becomes a living spirit becomes a living being and so you know when you look at that you might at the outset think okay and then they leave the garden it's like well if god says said that they would die why don't they just drop dead you know why don't they just eat the fruit and drop dead and i think it's because people do death is one of those things that we think we understand but that we usually don't have very good definitions for that we don't totally understand what it is that they're referring to and also to understand the death is something that doesn't just apply to a person but that applies at every level every ontological level of reality that there's an analogies to what death death is at ontological level and this is of course what's going on here is that all the elements are trying to help us understand what death is we have a kind of origin story for death and like i said the clue is in the idea of dust so the the idea is that now you will become dust now what does it mean to become dust first of all what is dust dust is basically an amass of things that have no relationship with each other right that's what dust is the difference and then god gathers the dust together all these disperse elements and then he puts a spirit in it he puts a a a a breath in it he puts heaven inside he puts a name inside he puts meaning inside he puts purpose inside he puts all the things that are invisible patterns that legislate disperse elements he puts that in this gathering of dust and now the dust is animated now the dust is now is no longer dust but is is one being even though it's still made of dust and so this is the difference between life and death the difference between life and death is the difference between unity which contains multiplicity and multiplicity which no longer has unity bringing it together that is the difference between life and death and so the difference if you like in the in the most mundane way the difference between a live animal and a dead animal is the difference between all these different elements in an in an animal that are moving towards the purpose purpose of survival the you know the purposes that animals have and then all of a sudden something happens to the animal now the breath leaves right the spirit leaves the animal in the bible it says we don't know if it goes up or it goes down but let's say the spirit leaves the animal and now the elements of the animal no longer coh here completely towards purpose and that's why they will start to decompose the elements will start to break apart from each other it takes time but at the moment of death that process has already become there's a mystery by which death is actually part of of life but that would be too complicated to talk about that right now but the idea of something that is dead is something that has lost now its unitary purpose now this is the best way to understand what death is is and it can be applied at different levels of reality so if you understand that that is what it means for you to die so when you die your body now is still there but it starts to decompose because there's nothing holding it together towards purpose so you can understand then that all the things that move you away from your purpose are akin at least to death that is sickness for example when your body is breaking down and is not capable of of properly moving towards its purpose then that is a process of death old age when you get older and your body starts to to wither and it no longer easily moves towards the purpose that you have for the body then that old age is also akin to death now it's not arbitrary that both death both disease and old age do lead to death in the in the absolute sense like in the sense that now there really is this complete separation between the reason the spirit the unifying principle and the and the disperate elements and you can see the process all along but that is this is what it is that you're supposed to understand but now you can also apply to anything that has commonality and so you can say that you can say you know with a true analogy you can say well the death of my friendship with this person and so what is the death of my friendship with this person mean it's not like you know we don't cease to exist like me and bob we were still there so what does it mean for our friendship to die it means that the things that bound us together that created a third reality which is our relationship which is the communion of us together is now gone and because of that now bob and i are going our separate ways and if you say the end of the death of an empire the end of the death of a nation that's the same thing the things that are that made the empire still there right the res remainders of the buildings the matter the the people are there but what happens is now they no longer have a reason in order to join together and to participate in a common identity it's true for the death of a company for the for the for the death of anything that you can imagine that has a unifiing principle holding it together towards purpose and then that principle going away the elements now disperse and become something like food for something else they become potential for other beings so you know it's like if i'm no longer friends with bob i can still be friends with some someone else and so that you know like let's say friendship is complicated against multiple let's say i'm married to someone and then i get divorced and that's the death of our marriage but now i become potential for another relationship that i can engage in and that's true for nations it's true for companies etc etc okay and so this is what dying means and this is what begins to happen at the fall and so all the elements that are there in the story are there to show that and so what's the first thing that happens the the adam and eve noticed that they're naked and that they have to protect themselves and so why do you have to protect yourself from something you have to protect yourself from something because it's not you it's not part of you you know you have to protect something because it is hostile to the identity so a company has to protect itself from spies from the other company because they're that those spies are hostile to the purpose of the company a being has to protect himself from being hurt from being from someone you know hitting them with the sword or whatever it is that you have to do that is the nature of protection the nature the nature of of having to separate yourself in an act of protection from someone else is an image of separation it's an image now of multiplicity that's losing its unitary function so before that adam and eve were naked but they didn't have to protect each other they didn't have to protect each other from each other and they also didn't have to protect each other from god there was multiplicity but that multiplicity was moving towards communion and unity and now the multiplicity is moving away from communion and unity and is becoming hostility is becoming danger is becoming shame shame is becoming secret all of these things are you know why do you have to keep a secret from other people you have to keep a sec you have to keep a secret because the people that don't know the secret are outside from you so you have this separation between inside and outside which is now formulated as a form of hostility now this is implicit in the very eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil mat my brother has a great way of helping people understand by saying that if when you use the word good and evil it has so much bagage because it's people apply it only to morality but the best way to look at it is to say the true the tree of good and bad right and so what is bad bad is that which is not related to the identity and so a bad chair is a chair that is moving away from the purpose of the chair a bad apple is an apple that is falling apart and is no longer cohesive to the reason why i would care about an apple in the first place and so etc etc that is what bad is bad is the the the movement away from an identity now the thing is about good and bad it is a necessary it is a necessary category for the existence of multiplicity because that you can you can can conceive of bad as simply the distance between beings and so you know it's like how can i say this a car makes a bad lunch and and and you know like a bird makes a bad chair and that's totally fine because bad can be understood as the distance between beings now there is a danger in the knowledge of good and evil which is that you can you know st ephraim the syrian talks about this problem which is that he says that adam and eve were going to be given the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil when they were ready and so that they could see bad from the position of good but he said because they took it for themselves now what happened is now they see good from the position of bad is that they are now trapped in multiplicity without unity and the mult and the unity seems that is it as it appears far away and that they they can they no longer have access to it but if you would see good and evil from the position of good you would say then you would be able to identify difference in a in a way that is completely normal in a way that is that is completely healthy because i understand that like i said that a bird makes a bad chair and that's completely fine if i know the good of the chair and i know the good of the bird there's no problem there and so the problem happens when it happens from the from the other side and so when you look at what happens there the nakedness is the thir part is the first part and so you have the separation they have to separate themselves from each other because they have to protect themselves from god they have to protect themselves from each other and then of course immediately what happens after that is that adam blames eve adam says it's her fault and eve says it's the serpent's fault now that's an increase of that separation when we begin to blame each other for things then we are moving further and further away from each other god curses the serpent and says that he will eat dust now the eating of dust of the serpent is related obviously to the adam and eve becoming dust at the end that now the serpent you know i've told i've said this a few times you have to understand the serpent as this coil as akin to the leviathan that surrounds the world the serpent is the periphery the serpent is that which is around the center it is it represents the marginality it is the dead skins right it is the changing of skins its change its variet its difference it's it's a distance it's all of those things but now this serpent will eat the dust that it it will be only connected to fragmentation and that which is broken down and will no longer simply be an expression of the center like it won't be multiplicity as expressing the middle it won't be variety or change or transformation as expressing the good okay that will change in the story of the bible right this is the story of the bronze serpent and ultimately the story of jesus is there's a restoration of the function of of the serpent as this agent of transformation towards the good but now in this case god says to the serpent you will just eat the dust like you will just be connected to the outside and then he puts enity between the woman and the serpent the serpent and her offspring and you can see now it's the same the same problem so now because of that you have two problems you have chaos and tyranny you have two extremes the the world tends to move towards hyper order in order to control the the situation and then there's also a move towards you could say hyper chaos in order to you know these two now kind of face each other and so you have the serpent wanting to bite the heel of the person and then because of that now the person has to crush and that image of the serpent trying to bite the heel and the human having to crush the serpent is an image of civilization itself it's the beginning of civilization it's the beginning of all artificial structures that try to keep chaos out and and that that which is wild that which is strange that which is different now is seen as threatening to the inside of the city and you have to you know you basically have to rule rule over it in a manner that is different from the way that adam ruled over the world before before the fall adam named the animals adam ruled over the world in in a kind of a capacity to name the beings you know in and participate in their identity but now this is the other side which is this idea of crushing and and and god just says that this is how it's going to be it's it's important to understand that this is just the consequence of the eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil improperly and that the curse is just it's just like the the simple consequence of what that means and it showing us what what death is like i said of course the the the the the the next one is pain and child birth and this is maybe a little harder for people to understand why that's necessary but it has to do with this it has to do with the fact that the production of multiplicity and the production of difference is now painful right it is no longer a natural production of multiplicity you know there's this there's the idea in the church fathers that that adam and eve were supposed to multiply themselves in a manner that was something like intelligence you know going o over all of creation and kind of joining it together in this unity but now you know human nature was broken as some of their fathers say and now we have multiple people and now those multiple people are born in pain because the the the process of multiplication is now a process of suffering just like death is this breaking down of people and suffering is related to that and the and so you have this the same thing that happened so what says that there's pain in childbirth and that her husband will rule over her is a repetition at a different level of what we said before which is that you know the serpent will move towards the outside into dust and then we'll try to bite at the heel and there'll be a crushing of the heel and so now it's the same thing the woman will be producing multiplicity and pain and then ultimately her husband will rule over will kind of crush her in that way and so it's not like and once again we have to always remember that this is just a description of how death functions and what the process of the extremes of moving falling into duality does the ground being cursed of course obviously hopefully this is now becoming more and more more and more obvious the ground being cursed is equivalent to the pain in child birth is equivalent to the eating of dust and now adam has to impose his will on the world in order to in order to be able to live and the thorns and the thistles will resist him so you have the same structure the dust and the serpent and then ultimately the idea that the dust is the the serpent is biting at the heel the man has to crush it the woman is is making multiplicity in desire she she kind of desires her husband he rules over her again the ground is cursed you have and and the thorns and the thistles are attacking and now you have to you have to impose your will on it in order to make it function so this is a description of what death is and you can understand that this is something like i said it's really good for you to understand that this is how death functions because this is this is what happens so think about now the process let's say of a of a city or of of a company and so you have a kind of unity and multiplicity and when that's going well there's a balance right there's a sense in which the multiplicity is moving as a in a kind of dance towards the purpose of the company and there's a there's a there's a flow of identity from the the the company and there's a flow of participation from the bottom up now some things can happen in a a a break where there's a lack of trust where there is a sin from above let's say where the people the the leaders of the company start to take too much for themselves or they start to act unfairly or whatever that is and then that creates a kind of fracture in the body and then the body now starts to act against each other and now they're not focused on the purpose of the company they're basically infighting they're trying to get their own they're trying to pull the blanket they're trying to make things you know they're trying to protect themselves from each other because they see their their leaders or they see their co-workers as their enemies as their competition or whatever and then and then you have this sense of breakdown and so the only one of the ways to deal with that and it can work to some extent is then leadership sometimes has to impose itself more strongly and say okay now we have to put consequences we have to make rules we have to you know we have to create ways to discipline ways to fire people to get rid of them so that if they're trying to infect the company and so the as the company grows at the beginning it'll be pretty organic you know just a little team and everybody's kind of working together and it's great then it grows and as the possibility of death starts to manifest itself then these systems of control will become can become not necessarily it depends on the company but can become more and more tyrannical and then you have this exchange between a kind of distrust here and breakdown here and then more tyranny at the top i've talked about this many times in many videos about this image of this relationship and how it culminates in the image of the prostitute and the beast in revelation and so of course like i said then this ends with this image that from dust you are and from dust you will return as the kind of culmination of the process of death and so by looking at the story of the fall you can actually understand the process of death and what death is and you can understand it fractally like i said you can understand that in some ways death is always somewhat active in the the in your life it's always there it's always part and there is you know how can i say this there is also a way to flip this you there's a way to flip death into glory which is something i've talked about also many times which is that you can make multiplicity into a form of glory if you're able to flip the process of multiplication into a a way in which it expresses the fullness of the unity and so that is also possible and this seems to happen through self-sacrifice this is what i've been talking about with jord has been talking about that through self-sacrifice you're able to then you know if the leader for example shows that he's a self-sacrificial character that he's acting with love towards the people that are making up the company that he's not wanting to take everything for himself that that he cares that he takes care of the people below him and he's also giving himself to the purpose of the company and isn't just trying to make money he has vision and he's willing to to kind of give himself to towards that if he does that then then the multiplicity can become a type of glory it doesn't have to be death it doesn't have to be infighting and and and competition and the kind of fragmentation but it can align itself and then it can become an image of of the become a kind of instantiation very large instantiation of the vision of the company right and so it could be company could be anything you it could be you could be your life it could be your family be all kinds of things but this is of course i think this is good to to see and so this was just a little a little you know a little rejoiner just to kind of jump into the conversation i thought like i said that the conversation between jordan and alex was really wonderful there are many other things that i could say about it you know and maybe in the in the in the comment section if there are some aspects of that conversation you'd like me to comment on that you think are worthy maybe i'll take that into consideration and so thank you every everybody thank you for your attention i hope you're having a wonderful time and i'll talk to you very soon bye-bye
