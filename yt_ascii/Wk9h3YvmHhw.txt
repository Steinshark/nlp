the 1+5 can now be had in pretty much brand-new condition for 220 dollars and yes it's got a very obvious bezel on the top and the bottom but that's pretty much the only criticism for a firm that right now will blow your mind in terms of value listen to this it's got a 5.5 inch 1080p amoled display making it v best you can get for $200 it's really bright and doesn't have any of the viewing angle issues you get with much cheaper lcd screens it isn't as tall as most recent phones so it doesn't fit as much content in on feeds but what you do see pops and the 16 to 9 ratio here is still what most youtube videos are available in and every app fills the screen oh by the way before i carry on i'm launching right now a triple one plus 60 mcclaren edition giveaway all the rules are gonna be in the description okay i'd completely forgotten how slick this ferren feels it's a little smaller than i'm used to not small enough to reach the top corner but small enough that you can do most tasks with just your thumb it's not necessarily a two-handed experience the soft touch fingerprint resisting finish hasn't really changed since this phone and so it still feels just as premium as a latest 60 only much less chunky and that's just it the phone is only seven point three millimeters thick and combining this with its featherweight 153 gram murse it feels felt in an age where flagship phones are actually piling on the mass to fit those larger batteries in and yet this phone is behind in that battery race with a 3300 milliamp hour capacity but you might remember that when it was released a couple of years back it even beat out smart phones with much larger capacity batteries and that remains the case today the smaller display combined with oneplus as lite software means that it's actually pretty efficient and the charging speed still holds up really well much faster than the note 9 or even the latest iphones it's actually really powerful too with 6 gigs of ram and this snapdragon 805 that's a 20-17 component and you've probably heard me complaining about phones now abhart or even using last year's stuff but the difference here is that when you come down to the $200 price point or even the $300 price point you're up against mid-range phones using mid-range chips compared to that an older flagship ship usually comes out on top let's take the new xiaomi redmi note 7 a $200 phone generating massive hype because of its crazy value and it's powered by the snapdragon 660 which is a more recent chip for sure but side by side with the 835 it gets crushed the 835 cpu is about 5% faster the gpu is about 50% faster and is using a more efficient 10 nanometer process as opposed to the 14 on the 660 and that gives you a better performance per watt don't forget that isn't even factor in the better download speeds and support for faster memory on the 8:35 so power we've established and if you combine that with the lightweight software the phone feels really snappy oh yeah and as a cherry on top oneplus is keeping it updated in fact you can download the android 9 beta on it right now and given that they're even updating the oneplus 3 to android 9 there's a pretty decent chance that this phone at the oneplus 5 might even get an android 10 update at some point the camera is noticeably left behind by current flagships there's no night mode and low-light generally leaves something to be desired but you'll definitely forget that you paid $200 for it even at 300 it would still beat out pretty much every phone camera you've got detailed sharp and punchy photos you've got portrait mode to time zoom and pretty well stabilized 4k video the oneplus 5 doesn't support microsd cards it is not wireless charging or an ip rating but for me the 64 gigs of internal storage is enough and people have also tried dunking air and water and it seemed to survive just fine also it does still have that headphone jack which was chopped on the most recent 60 the one thing i do miss is audio quality it's not terrible here but noticeably behind dual speaker phones but yeah if that's the main complaint i'm making when i'm moving from the huawei mate 20 pro to this i'd consider that a victory so is the 1+5 a no-brainer right now should you all run out queue up and try and grab on while you can well it depends on how okay you are with buying a refurbished phone and also what deal you can get for $300 it's good value if you can find it for 250 it is a steal and if you're one of the lucky ones and you can nab it for $200 shake that person's hand right off don't forget giveaway rules are in the description below and as always thanks for watching and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
