hello friends we are going to 
be building i'm going to be taking   you along with me today i'm going to be 
building a web 3 app and smart contract   this is just honestly because it's a project that 
i really want to get or technologies that i really   want to get better at and i thought why not just 
take you along with me and take you through the   process my thought process what technologies i'm 
using just different things like that so let's go   it's sunday today and i feel like at first before 
anything need a coffee so i just ordered a coffee   on ritual and i'm gonna go pick it up back in the 
truck we got the coffee i usually get matcha when   i go here but i was feeling like switching it 
up today don't ask me why got a little crazy   got a cappuccino which today is crazy just cause i 
feel like i always get the same americano and now   we are heading to the co-working space to start 
okay we're sitting down about to start the project   i before i did this project i took a 
tutorial on build space which has amazing   blockchain tutorials i found so shout out to 
some of my subscribers on instagram actually who   told me about them and what it really did taking 
that tutorial was teach me about the basics of   different web3 apps and ethereum contracts and the 
technologies behind it and it was really helpful   to follow a tutorial along before starting my own 
project so the purpose of this project i think as   i mentioned is just for learning purposes and also 
to show what i can do what where my blockchain   skills are at so hopefully i can continue to 
grow my career in the direction of blockchain   so that's really the purpose behind it so the 
first thing we need to do here that i'm going to   do is install hard hat i actually have it already 
installed but i'll install it again just so you   can understand the process and the purpose of hard 
hat is it's a package and i don't know if it's a   package actually let me read you their definition 
so i'm learning just like you are so hardhat is a   development environment to compile deploy test and 
debug ethereum software it helps developers manage   and automate reoccurring tasks that are inherent 
to the process of building smart contracts   contracts so it's really going to help you with 
uh the building the smart contract process and   through the entire i guess 
it's a development environment so   yeah i've only used it a few times when taking 
tutorials i'm excited to kind of play around   with it more and i think one of the best ways 
to learn is actually just building your own   projects so that's what we're going to do okay 
so now that we have hard hat installed we got   our project ready to go the next thing we need to 
do is start on our smart contract so for those of   you who don't really know what a smart contract 
is i'm going to try and put it into simple terms   and i think the more you know about something 
the easier it is to put into simple terms so   i'm still getting there but i think this will 
help me as you so i wrote down here i actually   have on page here so it says a smart contract is 
an agreement between two people in the form of   computer code they run on the blockchain of course 
and they are stored on a public database that   cannot be changed the transactions that happen in 
a smart contract are processed by the blockchain   which means they can be sent automatically 
without a third party okay so i'm going to   pull up on screen here what exactly or an example 
of a smart contract we can pause this video here and you can see the smart contract okay so it's 
one of those things for me anyways that the more   i get into this the more you do things the better 
you become at understanding all these technologies   and they're still really new to a lot of people so 
it's totally fine that you know you don't know it   all and we kind of just figure it out together 
anyways that's what a smart contract is in a   nutshell and now we're going to start building 
one okay so i'm going to refer to the build space   project just for how they built the smart 
contract i already went through this project   and i'm essentially going to be building my own 
but i'm still so new that i feel like i need to   have a reference point when creating these things 
so this is going to be my reference point so it's   like kind of like i always say follow a tutorial 
and then build upon it make your own thing   so now that we have that's essentially our 
smart contract obviously you can get a lot more   complex than that but at the very very basics 
that's what it is so now what we need to do   is we need to deploy it compile it and then 
ensure that our console log will actually run first we need to hydrate because 
we've had a lot of coffee today   and not enough definitely not 
enough water so water is everything so so so so i'm going to take a little break i want 
to really talk about why i'm learning these   technologies and really what the purpose of them 
all is and what my goal is what is my end goal   so my end goal honestly for these technologies is 
to obviously become a blockchain developer as you   know i'm a software developer professionally 
for four years and it's amazing but honestly   i was just kind of losing my spark i don't 
know what it was and i felt like i needed to   i don't know it was just it was time for something 
new and that's why when i came across blockchain   i was like oh my gosh this is amazing i'm really 
enjoying it and it just kind of re-reignited my   interest in technology and coding that was kind 
of just like mundane before and i think it's   because for me it's not necessarily about like 
the money or the investing or that side of things   it's more so about building this really cool 
technology and how it can change our future and   improve our future and just all of that and 
it's just so exciting to me the possibilities   and that's what really yeah it really excites me 
and got me going on it so i definitely do want to   pursue it you know as a career and specialize 
in that there are so many different areas you   can specialize in with software development 
that i've always been really open-minded and   hey maybe it will change still but right now 
i definitely see it going in this direction so   yeah it's fun i'm curious to know are you 
interested in blockchain and if so what part of   it let me know in the comments down below and i'll 
ensure that we can do more videos together going   through it and and honestly i just want to learn 
with you like grow with you learn with you and   you know get better every day because that's the 
whole point of this channel is just to be like   your coding buddy or your friend and connect on 
both personal things and career things and also   coding and and our journeys with it so let me know 
down below what other kind of coding videos you   want to see if you like these style of videos 
where i'm learning new technologies with you   i'm really curious to know okay i 
realized i didn't really talk about   what i'm building for my project so essentially 
i'm just going to be building a really small   web app with the purpose of people can 
go to it and learn a little bit about me   i don't know if it'll be done by the time this 
video goes out but i'll make sure to include it   in the link if it is or if it's not i'll 
let you know when it is done so you can go   check it out and the whole purpose is it's going 
to essentially be reflecting the tutorial i did   on build space but i'm trying to build it on my 
own and it's just a challenge to see how much   i understand on my own where my skills are at i'm 
still referencing the tutorial again just because   i'm totally not there yet but that's kind of 
what i'm building so it'll be a page you can go   to we'll tell a little bit about me and the cool 
part is you can actually send a wave to me so just   like hey what's going on and i can set it back 
so it makes it really interactive that way   i'm gonna try putting you down here and see oh 
jeez please so i just left the co-working space   and very exciting i have to go get a car wash 
uh it's what i am dreading doing but paul is   insistent that i need to take better care of 
my vehicle so i get asked a lot what vehicle   i drive which i think it's kind of strange i 
don't really know why but i drive a range   rover autobiography which we are in right now and 
i don't like to go get gas and i don't like to go   to the car wash so those two things according 
to paul are part of having a big girl vehicle   do you agree with him or are you like me and 
kind of lazy but it is a really wonderful truck   so i need to take very good care of it this is 
a fact yeah but anyways whatever i got on my   smart contract i finished it to the point that 
it is on the blockchain and complete but it's   very very simple like of what the smart contract 
actually is so i decided i'm going to push to   github this project and just so you can see 
the code as we kind of follow along as you   follow along with it but right now when you go 
to it you will see that it's essentially like   the build space tutorial because that's just what 
i'm getting used to building with like the   structure and the steps taking and all that and 
then from there just kind of adding on to it and   making my own so anyways i think it's pretty 
fun last thing i'll quickly touch on is so   when i say that i want to i guess at work for me 
at work one of the great things about where i work   on the consulting side of things is that i can 
constantly be on different projects if i choose to   be so it's like yeah it's a con in the sense that 
you're working with different technologies if you   want that to be a con but one of the great things 
is if you find something you're really interested   in you can really hone in on that and so my goal 
anyways is to be on a blockchain project by the   end of 2022 so then i can really gain more skills 
and experience and it just makes sense since   that's why i really want my my career to go so 
that is my thought process i'm just getting home   but i want to film for you or show you when i 
open the door the dogs go like nuts let me show   you hi hello hello hello sir hello hi harry come 
say hi oh my goodness look at you you're so big   the best oh wow oh the breath this is honestly 
though the best thing to come home to is   well i mean plus if paul was here 
to be even better but he is at   he's watching football right now so the doggies 
just come and greet you like your celebrity   every time you walk in the door i mean hello 
mr mugs say hi look at him look at this face   okay so because paul is watching football at 
a friend's house it's just me for dinner so   i'm gonna make dinner and do a peloton ride i 
need to work out and kind of just get prepared for   tomorrow tomorrow's monday oh wow tomorrow's 
monday so i need to get back into the swing of   things so just kind of take some time write out a 
to-do list and that's going to be my night but i   will make another video following up for my first 
smart contract because we need to continue on with   it so stay tuned for that leave in the comments 
down below if you like the style of videos where i   kind of go through what i am learning what i am 
programming and if you haven't already hit   that subscribe button for more tech encoding
