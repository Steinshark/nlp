you're tired of your wallet getting screwed over by greedy gpu manufacturers so you get mad at me for what not crying hard enough on your behalf that's not how this works that's not how any of this works if prices are out of control it's because gamers keep paying them so if you're not happy do something here allow me to demonstrate [music] oh bravo linus you patronizing canadian you have more gpus than any man could hope to use in a lifetime your performative little boycott means nothing that's true but yours means a lot and you don't even have to put off your next system upgrade to do it all you need is a little bit of scrap yard war spirit thanks to a combination of factors whether it's the gpu mining crash or pandemic gamers who are no longer finding time for the hobby there's a veritable abundance of second-hand gpus out there so let's do some deal hunting shall we oh and some sponsor hunting i begged a paradox their hit forex strategy game stellaris is free to play this weekend check it out starting on the 22nd on steam or at the link down below the main advantage is to buying new are that it's fast convenient and covered by warranty in the event that something goes wrong so secondhand shopping is not for everyone but by following some simple guidelines it is a great way to save money rule number one if it seems too good to be true it probably is look at tea for just 300 bucks parts only parts only is just another way of saying e-waste it is possible that with the soldering skills of louis rossman you could salvage it but even then it wouldn't be a guarantee and you are not going to be getting your money back if you fail so look closely at every listing and use your common sense rule number two is to trust your gut if a seller gives you any indication i mean at all that they're sketchy bale heart there are plenty of other fish in the sea common examples of sketchy behavior at least for in-person pickups include things like refusing to send you a picture of their car or what they look like to facilitate meeting up or if they refuse to meet in a well-lit public place and then probably the biggest red flag for an online transaction would be trying to move the deal off of the platform where it's advertised say for example ebay and then demanding payment up front now ebay does have high transaction fees so i can understand why even a legitimate seller might want to try to avoid paying them but the thing is those transaction fees are for your benefit in the form of extremely strong buyer protections and as soon as you send the money off platform it's basically up to the honor code of the individual seller to put your order in the mail so good luck with that which isn't to say that you have to buy on ebay in fact the best deal that we tracked down was on a classified site facebook marketplace to be exact and we're on our way there right now though i realize i've gotten ahead of myself a little bit here first we need to decide what to buy with current gpus it's pretty easy because recent reviews will contain performance numbers across a wide range of games the 6700 xt for example looks really good in our recent coverage of the 4060 ti where it gets tricky is comparing across generations very few reviews of the 4070 for example include comparison numbers for the 20 adti even though these cards perform within about 20 percent of each other i mean i get it publications can't be expected to test cards forever but wading through garbage results from user benchmark and fluff pieces like this one with no actual testing can be a challenge when second-hand shoppers or upgraders are looking to understand how much ben benefit they'll get from the latest shiny now our intention is to solve this in the long term with the upcoming labs website but that's going to take us some time for now we can bridge the gap by comparing each new generation to the last so we can see the 4070 is pretty close to the 3080 then we compare the 3080 to the 2080 ti but at its best this is an inexact science even if we have the know-how to find reputable sites with consistent test methodologies so i'm going to do the work for you for enthusiast gamers the deal to beat right now is a second hand 3080 10 gig it's got enough gpu grunt and vram for the latest titles it supports most of nvidia's latest ai tomfoolery and it can be had for around 400 or even less if you're patient then there's the 3070 this is a really solid runner-up if you don't need the performance of the 3080 and obviously if you can score a sweet deal on a 12 gig 3080 or a 3080 ti well then that's great too but i didn't really see anything that caught my eye dropping down to the 30 60 range we do save some money but you're not getting the same kind of bang for the buck i really want to see these going for more like 220 to 230 dollars and if we go back a generation the rtx 2080 ti is still a very capable card it just seems like sellers are kind of diluted as to what these things are worth i found one attractive deal but most of them were well over three hundred dollars come on guys i know your gpu is only two generations old but it came out nearly five years ago which means that even if we ignore downsides like much worse ray tracing performance and extra power draw it's a lot closer to losing driver support than a 30 series would be with that said if i was on a bit of a tighter budget i would say that the 20 series has some very attractive bargains namely the 2070 super and the 2080 or there's the rx 5700 xt from team red all of those can be had in the 150 to 200 price range if you're patient speaking of amd normally team red cards are great fodder for second-hand shoppers but that just doesn't seem to be the case at the moment if i had to guess i'd say it's a combination of two things one they aren't as popular so there aren't as many flooding the market right now and two amd has implemented some serious price drops recently that don't seem to really be reflected in the used market on the lower end look at these prices for 6650 xts it literally costs more than just buying a brand new one and then on the high end look at this 6800 just under 500 brand new i mean sure it could be be had for about a hundred dollars less used but the new one is new and it comes with a game bundle that's kind of a no-brainer to me we're gonna have some choice amd cards linked down below if you must have a brand new card with a warranty on that subject i've got a great pro tip for you savvy shoppers out there pretty much every rtx 3080 comes with a three year warranty and since the 3080 came out less than three years ago as long as the seller gives you the original receipt you should still be covered by the manufacturer warranty now some of them are going to try to weasel out of it only applies to the original buyer but if you want my advice don't give them a chance just submit your support ticket with whatever names on the invoice how can they prove my name isn't gaben mclovin ship the replacement to my new address then please got it now there are a couple of things that i forgot to mention earlier some cards are going to come with accessories that you will want to make sure are included for example this 12-pin power adapter is needed to connect a 30 series card to an older power supply oh wait this card doesn't have a 12 pin well if you buy a founders edition you are going to need the adapter oh right and we actually saw a 3080 ti that was only a little bit more than this 3080. the only reason we didn't jump on it was because i felt it wasn't really representative of the kind of deals that you guys could expect to find and it's a good thing we skipped it because we just came across this post warning other users about that scammer this is a really common move where people will ask for a deposit to hold the card and then just keep your money and ghost you never pay a deposit only exchange money once you have the item in your hands in the old days i would even take it a step further i would ask sellers if they could put the card in a working system so that i could see it in action or even let me bring my own test bench and hook it up to that but that's not always possible and i'm a lot less worried about a card that i still have warranty on for a full year time for the moment of truth talked to pretty good games so far but is this actually faster than what i could have gotten brand new to find out we're going to be drag racing it against the brand new 4060 ti in returnal f122 and far cry 6 using our new and improved workflow with our automated mark bench software oh well that's not the smoothest fan i've ever encountered she's a little on the loud side boys and we're gonna have harnesses for games that don't support in-game benchmarking like flight sim soon right yeah sick test parameter games for 1080. this is a 30 80 sir yes but this is also a pathetic card oh right and then do i need a tag for it 3080 maybe no no it automatically saves that data when it pulls it up sick okay now i get to drag race then yeah three two one oh dot i clicked that one a little later don't worry not thrilled about that crusty fan but while we were on our break i found out that replacement fans are a lot easier to get your hands on these days than they used to be like they're in the neighborhood of 10 15 20 bucks wow that is not even close see you later 4060 ti sure i've got to replace this fan but guys i am 20 plus percent faster at 1080p and that performance gap only widens as i increase the resolution that i'm gaming at or as i run games that have heavier demands on my vram so i'm freaking thrilled i won the game oh and you won the segway to our sponsor squarespace to
