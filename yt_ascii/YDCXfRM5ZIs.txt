notice anything different anything that looks 
different on me today what about the hat what do   we think of the hat tiff and tack merch although 
i'm not selling it yet anyways i don't know if   i will or not okay but enough about that today we 
are going to be talking about 10 jobs 10 top jobs   in tech for 2023 and this topic is so important 
to really have an understanding of because tech   as we know and have seen especially the last 
few years is moving quick and i'm not talking   quick like it has the past few years this one or 
two last years it has moved at an ever-changing   pace and even if we're not looking to change 
roles today it's important to be aware of   where things are moving what direction things are 
moving in order to stay ahead let's jump into it the first on the list no surprise here is ai 
engineer and this is a role that there are   not enough people to fill spots for and it will 
continue to go this way as ai continues to blow   up now i get asked a lot around is ai just going 
to be hyped up like blockchain was like web 3   was or is it actually here to stay well so i know 
web3 is here to stay but more so is it just gonna   be this hype this rush and then it calms down i 
really don't think it's the same as the web 3 hype   ai you can see is already being integrated and 
adopted in a much wider setting with businesses   who maybe were more reluctant to adopt to web3 ai 
is definitely catching on to the general public i   mean we've seen the stats around how quickly chat 
gpt caught on with everyone that the user base   mods they can hear that in the video now we've 
already seen with the attention that chad gpt   has had and how quickly it has garnered 
a user base i mean quicker than any other   social platform out there it's kind of insane 
when you think about it and for me anyways as   i mentioned a few other videos ai is definitely 
an area that i'm going to be spending more time   on and really investing my time my energy into and 
i would highly suggest you look into as well now   even if you aren't necessarily an engineer or 
software developer there are so many different   roles within ai that you can pursue whether it 
be specializing i mean there's so many courses   actually which i'll i'll list here i'll put on 
screen here from product management the business   side all of this is encompassed within ai it's 
not just about engineering i list engineering   here because it is a huge area that there are so 
many roles looking to be filled but it doesn't   mean that there aren't a ton of others out there 
for non-technical people that need to be filled   and you need to have a deep understanding of ai 
the good thing is there are so many courses out   there that you can take right from home even now 
this is one of those areas that if you are looking   to break into tech or maybe even evolve your 
career getting into cyber security is one of   the safest bets that you can make and this is 
going coming from someone who is not a better   the reality is as more things continue to become 
online where businesses go online the demand for   cyber security specialists whether you are a cyber 
security engineer cyber security business analyst   whatever role you play getting into the field of 
cyber security in general is going to continue to   grow in demand and with a growing in demand i'll 
share a stat here actually the numbers as you can   see there are not enough people to fill all of 
these roles so in turn what does that mean well   one thing it means is the salary will continue to 
increase this is a great area for you to focus in   on if you are looking for job security and an 
extremely high paying salary another area that   is very in demand is cloud architect and this is 
something that we have seen especially with since   i would say 2020 even before then but really 
in 2020 when everyone was working from home   more businesses were continuing to go online the 
demand for cloud architects or really any role   that touches the cloud has continued to skyrocket 
now how do you get into cloud architecture well   there is no no formal education needed to become 
a cloud architect however you should have a solid   understanding of cloud computing cloud deployment 
models cloud service models and cloud deployment   architectures so how do you get this well for one 
start working anywhere in the cloud touching the   cloud i always say if you're looking to get into 
cloud of course a great place to start is with   an aws course that's very specific but as it is 
the most widely used place for the cloud that's   definitely where i would start i took some 
aws courses when i was preparing for the aws   developer quiz or test and i actually took them 
on udemy they're really great very user friendly   the resources out there are just it feels infinite 
so it's more so what resource to choose from for   me i really like udemy two other areas that i'm 
kind of combining each one although they are two   separate jobs is data scientist and data analyst 
and as we've heard and seen these quotes around   the internet of data is the new oil it's really 
the truth the amount of data that come companies   are gathering about the reality is you and i 
are continuing to increase and increase and   having an expert who can not only analyze this 
data but then provide recommendations on how   they should best structure their products what 
directions they should move into will continue   to go in demand now i'll actually put up on 
screen here the differences between a data   analyst and data scientist because as you can see 
they are very different actually i combine them   in one topic because i think we can cover them 
both in this time span but they will continue   to grow in demand as we continue to gather more 
and more data and the reality is the date is not   going anywhere all right let's talk about a role 
here which is also categorized as a unicorn or a   mythical creature does it even really exist can 
you guess what i'm talking about if you guessed   full stack developer you are correct it's full 
stack developer now some of you might be pulling   out your hair going tiff why are you including 
this on this list it doesn't even exist no one   can be a full stack developer listen if you go 
on linkedin and search up fold stack developer   i'm telling you companies are hiring for this 
and what does that look like well let's not get   into the specifics around what we think a full 
stack developer should be or not be but rather   what companies are looking for which really varies 
it's not necessarily that every company is looking   for the same thing or this magical unicorn they 
are looking for knowledge on a lot of tech and   i don't think full stack developer is something 
that you can get as your first job typically or   you shouldn't anyways but rather use your first 
job to gather experience in various technologies   and then you can apply that to something what 
these companies are calling anyways full stack   developer oh if you haven't already hit that 
subscribe button give this video a like and   leave in the comments any questions or comments 
you have i will do my best to go through them all   next on our list is devops devops is one of 
those areas that i find personally it's very   hard to describe and i think it's because it 
encompasses a lot of different practices and   methods actually instead of me just speak talking 
about it let's put on screen here a visual of what   devops is so devops is essentially the combination 
of cultural philosophies practices and tools that   increases in organization's ability to deliver 
apps and services at a high velocity so they   essentially focus on automating and integrating 
different processes into software development   and i.t they really are the links between a lot 
of different roles and this role is extremely   important because without them things would be 
much slower they are in control of automating   and speeding up these processes connecting all 
the pieces together and ensuring teams are able   to work in an agile setting actually speaking of 
devops here are some salaries for devops you can   see here on screen devops is a great area to get 
into if you have a software development background   or really any technical kind of background you 
can apply it to devops next on the list is mobile   application developer and this is something that 
honestly i don't hear maybe it's because i'm not   in that world but i don't hear a ton about but 
when i was doing research for this video it kept   on coming up in job postings in data as one of the 
most in-demand tech drops and i think it's because   everything nowadays needs to be mobile and a lot 
of the bigger companies are investing in having a   separate app for mobile so android ios whether you 
do both or you do one or the other it's very in   demand whether you do kotlin java ios development 
and swift however it looks i definitely would   suggest if you're interested in app development 
to go forward with it it's widely used and these   skill sets that you will learn through mobile 
development can be transferred into other areas   in the future what does that look like i'm not 
sure what that will look like but i think it   will be one of those things that app development 
will continue to evolve and having really good   quality engineers to bring these apps to life will 
continue to be extremely important next up on the   list is ux ui designer and these well they are 
really essentially two different roles which let's   put up on screen here the differences you can see 
there are a ton of differences between the two   crap at the end of the day though if you are a ui 
ux researcher or designer you need to be really   in tune with your audience who are you targeting 
how will they use this product how will they go   through the flow and in turn this role does 
require to connect with external individuals   this might be through user-focused groups through 
creating different surveys for people to fill out   but having a deep understanding of people so a lot 
of my friends who actually get into ux ui design   love people and i mean very opposite from the 
typical let's say software developer like myself   who would rather just you know talk to people 
sometimes and then work yes ux ui designers talk   do the same thing talk to people sometimes and 
then work but they're always always thinking about   how will the end user use this how can i best 
make this flow for them okay the next on the list   just give me a minute here before you judge this 
next one which is blockchain developer or really   any blockchain specialist i think nowadays a lot 
of times blockchain has a kind of bad rap or for   the general public at least meaning when you think 
blockchain you immediately associate it to crypto   which is definitely not the case yes it's one 
area that blockchain touches but there are so many   areas around sustainability health care business 
growth identity theft that blockchain can touch   so please let's not create the two to be combined 
together blockchain is continuing to evolve and   grow in demand this tech skill this technology 
will be an area of focus for the current and   future as far as we can see it will continue to 
expand so being able to have this knowledge now   and get this experience now will enable you in 
the future to be able to be more senior at the   time that it becomes extremely widely used and ask 
for a really high salary intern i mean you already   could do that with blockchain the possibilities 
of it are really endless so how to become a   blockchain developer or at least very well versed 
in blockchain if you're thinking a bit more from   a business standpoint well for one if you are 
looking to become a blockchain developer the   good thing is there are so many courses online 
in which you can take you need to understand   what a ledger is what consensus is you need to 
understand how to build smart contracts and the   good news is if you're already a developer all of 
those things i can tell you firsthand are pretty   straightforward to learn you just need to start 
building really if you are looking to get it on   it from the business standpoint i would suggest 
as well to take a course once again this can just   be from online just to have that certification 
on your resume especially to you know please ai   as it is sifting through your resume it will see 
that you have these certifications and last but   definitely not least on the list is ar and vr 
designers so augmented reality virtual reality   designers this is an area that touches education 
gaming healthcare you name it and it touches it   actually meta released recently here i don't 
know if i'll get copyrighted for it so i'm not   going to share it in this video but i'll link it 
down below they shared recently an ad and in the   ad what it did is it showed how augmented reality 
and virtual reality can be used in a wide range   of industries they were showing on screen the kids 
learning and going through back in time being able   to interact with these creatures or animals 
that are no longer that are extinct and then   they were also sharing about how doctors can use 
this to you know see the virtual reality scans of   someone's knee as they're looking at the knee how 
it will really impact our everyday lives and this   is coming very soon i mean it's already here so be 
being part whether you're a designer engineer or   once again on the business side this is an area 
that will continue to be in demand is extremely   popular for 2023 and beyond all right we were able 
to list the top 10 tech careers for 2023 and it   was very strategic in listing these and ensuring 
that they were not only for 2023 but areas and   careers that you can grow in be comfortable in for 
the foreseen future for seeing future near future   is it what it is for a scene future foreseeable 
future these are careers that are really exciting   and there's so much opportunity in them 
so i'm really curious to hear what are you   interested in leave down in the comments 
and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone oh
