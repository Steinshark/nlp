amd has responded to nvidia's uber expensive rtx 4000 series gpus with their radeon rx 7900 series don't get us wrong you'll still pay a pretty penny for him as the 7900 xt will cost 900 bucks while you'll pay a cool thousand for the top end 7900 xtx i guess a hundred dollars for the extra x is a fair deal especially when you consider nvidia's top two cards start at 1200 but are these cards a better value or is it another case of you get what you pay for well amd strategy has always been to compete on value against likes of nvidia but this time one of the reasons team red's offerings are cheaper clearly doesn't have to do with lower performance the rx7000 series utilizes gpus made up of chiplets so instead of having a monolithic chip that's one solid piece like nvidia does amd instead is putting several smaller chiplets together to form one cohesive gpu now this saves amd money because the chiplet approach improves yields that is if one chiplet is defective they can throw out just that chiplet instead of the entire gpu which makes manufacturing cheaper additionally the chiplets that are dedicated to memory control and cash are made on a six nanometer process allowing amd to cut costs where they can while still giving gamers a high performance rendering chiplet on the five nanometer process but does this necessarily mean that amd has produced a lineup that can beat nvidia at a lower price without compromises well we'll tell you right after we think secret lab for sponsoring this video secret lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play like their titan evo 2022 chair with four-way lumbar support ultra comfortable seat materials and more all chairs come with up to a five year extended warranty and 49-day return policy

couple aspects where the lower price point does track with what the cards offer the big elephant in the room is ray tracing which you might have predicted considering that we're now on the third generation of cards where nvidia has really emphasized ray tracing as the strength of their products which you can even see from their inclusion of dedicated ray tracing cores and even in how they've named some of their gpus amd on the other hand has cards that support ray tracing but don't quite have the same chops for it as nvidia but here's the thing plenty of games still do not support ray tracing and even if your favorite titles do you may not find yourself carrying all that much at all for many gamers more conventional visual enhancements such as higher texture quality and more aggressive anti-aliasing makes a more noticeable difference than ray traced light and that doesn't even mean that the rx7000 series is bad at ray tracing it just means that the team green options are better at it at least for now now the other way in which rx7000 looks to lag a bit behind rtx 4000 is power consumption possibly due to those six nanometer chiplets which is a bit disappointing as chiplets are traditionally thought of as being more power efficient than monolithic designs the 7900 xtx which competes with the rtx 4080 tends to draw more power across titles and in synthetic benchmarks so this could be a consideration if you're running up against limits with your power supply however the difference isn't obscene and the 7900 xtx superior performance in certain titles may be more than worth it for many of you which card wins in which game depends quite a bit on whether that particular title is optimized for nvidia or amd and if you're considering these slightly cheaper 7900 xt know that while it doesn't quite hit the heights of the rtx 4080 it's not terribly far off and will save you an additional hundo but be warned that also means it's not nearly as good of a value value which is actually kind of crazy to say we also cannot ignore how well these cards could end up maturing over time not just with driver updates as we saw with the rx6000 series but also with fsr3 the next generation of amd's upscaling technology that competes with nvidia's dlss fsr3 isn't out yet but it should be sometime in 2023 and team red is promising significant frame rate gains once it drops however it's an open technology that even works on nvidia cards so it's really unclear at this point as to whether rx7000 will give you an advantage if you use fsr3 and it also generally stinks to pay good money today on the promise that the product might be worth the cost tomorrow so what's the bottom line here right now if you don't care about ray tracing and can afford putting a few more watts of load on your power supply amd's rx7000 is probably a better buy if ray tracing is a big deal to you though you might want to spring for an nvidia rtx 4000 card whatever you do be sure to read benchmark results to find out how the cards perform in the games you want to play before buying let us know down in the comments which card you're going with but please don't turn the discussion into a classic red versus green flame war they're both doing a sturdy these days dislike both of them but don't dislike this video unless you disliked it then then you can hit the dislike
