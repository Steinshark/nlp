so what's your writing process like what's your thinking and writing process like everyday so what's your routine even i guy i guess it's actually the best question because i spent seven days a week doing it the most prepares to answer it yeah but okay so the care i'm sitting in is where i do that's where the magic happens well reading and writing though my nature is usually sitting over there where i have other books some reference book but but i i found his chair which was designed by a swedish guy anyway it turns out this was only chair i can really sit in for hours and hours and not know that i'm in a chair but then i have the stand-up desk right next next to us and and so after i write something with pencil and eraser i get up and i type it and revise and rewrite the kernel of the idea is first put on paper yep that's where right and i all right maybe five programs a week of course literate programming and these are before i describe something in my book i always program it to see how it's working and i and i tried a lot so for example i learned at the end of january i learned of a breakthrough by for japanese people who had extended one of the core of my methods in in a new direction and so i i spent the next five days writing a program to implement what they did and then i you know but they had only generalized part of what i had done so then i had to see if i could generalize more parts of it and then i had to take their approach and i had to i had to try it out on a couple of dozen of the other problems i had already worked out with it with my old methods and so that took another couple of weeks and then i would you know then i then i started to see the light nice and and i started writing the final draft and and then i would you know type it up involves some new mathematical questions and so i wrote to my friends and who might be good at solving those problems and and they solve some of them so like they put that in as exercises and and so a month later i had absorbed one new idea that i that i learned and you know i'm glad i heard about it in time otherwise my i wouldn't put my book out before i heard about the idea on the other hand this book was supposed to come in at 300 pages and i'm up to 350 now that added 10 pages to the book but if i learn about another one i probably first gonna shoot me well so in the process in that one month process are some days harder than others are some days harder than others well yeah my work is fun but i also work hard and every big job has parts that are a lot more fun than others and so many days i'll say why do i have to have such high standards you know why couldn't i just be sloppy and not try this out and you know just just report the answer but i but i know that people our economy to do this and so okay so okay donna grit my teeth and do it and and and then the joy comes out when i see that actually you know i'm getting good results and and and i get and i even more when i see that somebody has actually read and understood what i wrote and told me how to make it even better i did want to mention something about the about the method so i got this tablet here where i do the first you know the first writing of concepts okay so so and what language right so hey take a look at it but you know here random say explain how to draw such skewed pixel diagrams okay so i got this paper about 40 years ago when i was visiting my sister in canada and they make tablets of paper with this nice large size and just the right very small space between lines oh yeah yeah particularly we also just yeah you know i've got these manuscripts going back to the 60s and and and those are wouldn't get my ideas on paper okay but i'm a good typist in fact i went to type in school when i was when i was in high school and so i can type faster than i think so then when i do the editing you know stand up and type then i then i revise this and it comes out a lot different than what you know for style and rhythm and things like that come out at the at the typing state and you type in tack and i typed in tack and can use can you think in tech no so to a certain extent i have i have only a small number of idioms that i use like you know a beginning or theorem i do something for display equation i do something and so on but but i i have to see it and in the way that it's on particular here yeah right for example touring wrote with the other direction you don't write macros you don't think in macros particularly but when i need a macro i'll go ahead and and these and do it but but the thing is they i also write to fit i mean i'll i'll change something if i can if i can save a line i've got you know it's like haiku i'll figure out a way to rewrite the sentence so that it'll look better on the page and i shouldn't be wasting my time on that but but i can't resist because i know it's only another 3% of the time or something like that and it could also be argued that that is what life is about ah yes the in fact that's true like like i worked in the garden one day a week and that's that's kind of a description of my life is getting rid of weeds you know removing bugs for programs and so you know a lot of writers talk about you know basically suffering the writing process is having you know it's extremely difficult and i think of programming especially the or technical writing that you're doing can be like that do you find yourself methodologically how do you everyday sit down to do the work is it a challenge you you kind of say it's you know oh yeah it's fun but it'd be interesting to hear if there are non fun parts that you really struggle with yeah the fun comes with when i'm able to put together ideas of to two people who didn't know about each other and and and so i might be the first person that saw both of their ideas and so then you know then i get to make the synthesis and that gives me a chance to be creative but the dredge work is where i act i've got a trace everything down to its root this leads me into really interesting stuff i mean like i learned about sanskrit nice and again you know i try to give credit to all the authors and so i write like so i write to people who know the the people that got this if they're dead right i communicate this way i and i gotta get the math right and i got a tack all my programs try to find holes in them and i rewrite the program's over after i get a better idea is there ever dead ends dead ends oh yeah i throw stuff out yeah look one of the things that i spent a lot of time preparing a major example based on the game of baseball and i know a lot of people who own baseball is the most important thing in the world you know yeah but it's but i also know a lot of people from cricket is the most important in the world or suck or something you know and and i realized that if if i had a big sample i mean it's gonna have a fold-out illustration and everything i was saying well what what am i really teaching about algorithms here where i had this this is this baseball example and if i was a person who who knew only cricket wouldn't think what would they think about this and so i ripped the whole thing out but i you know i had i had a something that would really appeal to people who grew up with baseball as has a major theme in their life which is a lot of people but but yeah so i said on minority small minority i took out bowling too even a smaller my noise [laughter] you
