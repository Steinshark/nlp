now xi jinping has said many times that this century humiliation will be overcome by the chinese people and that they'll take every square inch of property back that they believe was theirs that they believe was historically chinese you know this idea that they're gonna that china is going to assemble all this land that it lost to western powers or it lost when it was humiliated because it was weak do you think they're not coming for the russian [music] lands [music] hello everyone watching and listening today i have the pleasure of speaking with ambassador robert o'brien we discussed the inner workings of international hostage negotiations the ongoing success and legacy of the abraham accords negotiated under president trump the russia ukraine war and its complexities and the current perception of diminished american strength a situation which leaves much room for improvement so ambassador o'brien you were the fourth us security adviser under donald trump so why were you the fourth and what was it like taking on the job knowing you were the fourth and what was it like working with me he's a mystery to many people maybe he's a mystery to himself who knows but but you stepped into a role that had obviously been contentious and so there must have been some apprehension in that regard why did you do it and what was that like well thanks jordan great to be with you you know i was the fourth we had general flynn was there for a brief period of time and then general master and john bolton it's not a job i expected to receive but i was serving as the president's hostage envoy at the time trying to bring americans home from detention or wrongful det attention or being held hostage by terrorist organizations and i didn't really know the president i i'd been with another candidate in 2016 scott walker the governor of wisconsin and but i i supported the president in the general election of course and he asked me to be the hostage envoy and i got to know him through that job we i think one of the things president trump appreciated about the work i did is we got a lot of americans home and president trump gets the credit for that some people give me credit for it and that's flattering but you know when things go well for a president the president should get the credit and he deserved the credit for bringing these many americans home and so we developed a relationship i i was actually in israel working on a hostage case trying to help some the israelis bring a the remains of a a fallen soldier home and john bolton had resigned or was fired depending on whose story you believe and uh i got the call to come in for an interview and interviewed at the president went well and he asked me to to do the job so i was you know humbled and honored to to have that position i didn't know you know i i was keenly aware that i was a fourth person but i also felt that i had a good relationship with the president and i felt my job every day and the prayer i said as i left the my apartment every morning was that we'd keep america safe that day and i think the president appreciated my commitment to keeping the country safe and i appreciated his commitment to to doing this doing the same and we had a good relationship and it worked out well we had a lot of lot of accomplishments that took place that last year and a half in in office so let's talk about the the hostage cases to begin with so how did you get involved in doing that and then do you want to walk us through some of the stories and and and what it is exactly that you were doing before you became us security adviser and how that set you up for the job sure so i received a call in late 2017 from the white house asking if i'd be willing to fill this role of being the us hostage envoy the the title is spha which sounds like a dr seuss character but it's it's an acronym for special presidential envoy for hostage affairs and i just started a law firm with a a partner steven larson a former federal judge in los angeles we left a big national firm and so i wasn't planning on going into government but i always wondered over my career i've spent time traveling abroad all over the world in international arbitration cases and and law cases i always kind of wondered if our plan was hijacked if if we taken hostage would someone come look for us and when when the job was was offered i went and talked to my wife and we we prayed about it we looked at some of the cases of people who were held abroad and i thought you know i'm going to i'm going to give this a shot and it's a a sacrifice for the family and a sacrifice for my law partners but i'm going to go see if i can get some people home and we did the job and we got a lot of people home we were very successful at it again credit for that goes to the president for his tough stand on on bringing americans home he i think he felt that americans being held abroad just because they were americans just because they h a blue passport was kind of the essence of of poking your your your finger in the eye of the united states and and his america first view of the world was if you do that i don't care who the person is how why they were taken if they were a missionary if they were a tourist if they were a business person a diplomat a soldier if you've taken somebody to leverage them leverage their life to try and get the us to change our policy or try and get a concession from us or money from us we're not going to stand for it and we're going to get that person home and so that that was a job i undertook and it would you know didn't expect it to lead to becoming the national security adviser but again we had some success and i can talk to you about some of the cases and and and again i think at the end of the day the president gets the credit for making it a high priority and you know you you're up against a bureaucracy other people in government have different priorities and getting getting a single american home but but for me my job was solely focused on in that position was solely focused on bringing these americans home so what had set you up in your previous career to be able to conduct those negotiations and why do you think that you were apart from trump's support which we can go into what why do you what do you think it was that made you successful at doing this and what was it like to actually negotiate who are you negotiating with and what was that like how did you do it yeah so so great questions the you know i think my past experience as a diplomat i'd been a diplomat in the bush administration and and had even carried over and working on an afghan afghanistan program for uh the cony rice setup but went into the obama clinton years when secretary clinton was secretary of state that that certainly helped i'd been a army officer earlier in my career and had worked at the un so i had kind of the diplomatic experience but i think the day-to-day experience of being a lawyer in los angeles i i was a litigator and you know we've got the toughest toughest lawyers in the country i think in in la and spent a lot of time in mediations hundreds of mediations over my career both serving as council for parties but also then later serving as an arbitrator a mediator and a neutral i think that was the the experience that gave me the the the the best background for the job as hostage envoy and then to your question about who do we negotiate with it was you know it's tough because you know we couldn't negotiate directly with some of these countries for example the iranians you know i had to work through the swiss so we our inors were the the swiss diplomats who are great diplomats and we worked with them we worked with other third party governments to to get to governments that we could negotiate with negotiated with the russians directly we negotiated with the taliban directly and you've got a you know you've got bad guys on the other side you've got thugs on the other side to you know to some extent and you've got to be tough and and that has to be backed up by american hard power the diplomacy is important the negotiating skills are important but at the end of the day they're looking at you to see you know what's america going to do if we if we don't comply what what tools does this guy have in his in his toolkit what kind of support is he going to get from the bureaucracy and that that goes back to the classic ronald reagan formulation of peace for strength so working for a president who believed in peace through strength who didn't you know wasn't trying to appe or or not provoke the our adversaries but who who believed in a strong america and that a strong america was good for for peace in the world that that helped me in my negotiations so you know that was giv that in the thumbnail the other thing i did jordan which i think was created a stir at the time when i became the hostage envoy there was a memo about the office that had been prepared in the prior administration and the obama administration that described what we did as the office of the spha and it said our our first resort is diplomacy and the very last resort we'll take to rescue americans is military force and i looked at that and i said this is exactly wrong and i changed the memo i said our first resort will be to use our military our special operators and our special operations community was really the modern special operations community was formed after the failed attempt to rescue american diplomats held in iran in 1980 and that's that's how we ended up with delta force and seal team 6 and and it's this very top tier group of operators they originally set up to be hostage rescue guys based in a large part on the sas and the uk the sas regimen and so i said look our first resort if we can if we can affect rescue is we're going to use these highly trained you know national assets these great men and women us special forces to go get our hostages back or our wrongful detes back and then we'll look at diplomatic options and i wanted to send a message to our adversaries that you know we're gonna this is a different approach and we're going to use american hard power and so you know if you've got a chance to negotiate with us or negotiate with a third party country that's coming to you on our behalf take it because you know the the other option we've got and our primary option is to go rescue our people and we had a number of rescues that either using foreign partner forces that engage special operators of foreign governments or our own special operators that were really exquisite where we brought americans home and i think that sent a message to folks and backed up our diplomacy so so that was one thing that we did to to kind of change the policy and at least send a message to our our foreign adversaries and the terrorist organizations or or rogue governments that if you take an american there's a there's a penalty to pay and and we're going to get them back okay so to get so if i get this straight so the people that were taking hostages came to know that they might have an opportunity to negotiate through the intermediation of third parties but that the military option was likely to be brought forward very rapidly is that the right sequence of events correct and and look if if we had a military oper operation that could be launched immediately short you know it it becomes more difficult to launch these operations if a hostage is aged if they've been taken and been held for a while because they're they're moved and the some of the terrorist organizations have pretty good operational security it's always tougher when a government is holding your hostage because you know they'll help a downtown jail and somewhere in caracus or teran or moscow so th those those circumstances make the military option more difficult but if we could find a hostage organization we did this at the end of the administration in late october in 2020 a group had kidnapped an american named walton in in ner we launched an operation within 48 hours rescued them you know dealt with a terrorist rescued him brought him home safely and and the whole thing happened in a very short period of time i think that from from start to finish it was a 72-hour operation from us finding and fixing where he was where the terrorists had him the kidnappers and and bringing him back to washington dc so sometimes you know ne negotiations weren't always an option but it was for for the bad guys but if they if they' secured the hostage somewhere they a government had him in in a jail that was certainly you know that that was one course for them to take right right so were there any downsides to moving the military option up the list of priorities did that add risk in any situations or do you think overall it and in the specifics it decreased risk well i think overall it decreased risk right because it you you you let people know that if you if you take an american hostage the the mil us military is coming for you we've got long reach we can go from you know fort brag north carolina to to wherever you are in a very short period of time but and so we think it was a deterrent and and prevented further hostage taking but any anytime you put the men and women of our of our armed force you know into an operation there's risk to them there's obviously risk to the hostage and rescue situation where you know bullets are flying so you know and there's also a risk of you know an escalation so that you know a hostage rescue turns into more of a conflict but our our our feeling was that the the deterrent effect of of letting folks know we're going to rescue our our people and and the the the high degree of skill and capability our our special operators had to to rescue a hostage if they were taken outweighed the the risk of either escalation or or or death to one of our service members or the hostage but it's a you know those are tough calls to make well there's going to be risks no matter what what approach you take has the has the approach that you put in place place stayed intact as a consequence of the transition to the biden administration or or what's happened what's happened now well we have a really terrific hostage envoy the guy who took over from me is a guy named roger carson's ambassador and he was a former military special operations guy i've got a lot of confidence in him but again he's working in an environment that you know is more of a what i call it don't do not provoke appe pease mentality of the the the obama folks who came and and have now staffed the biden administration and and i think there's a lot less emphasis on hard power and a lot more emphasis on on just pure diplomacy and soft power and that and and you know look that that can work in some cases you know you have different tools in your toolkit but i i think there's a perception of american weakness now and i i i think that makes the job of the hostage onvoy tougher but i think roger's done a great job and and to his credit i think the current national security adviser jake suvan who took my position my final position has been good on these hostage issues but again you're only so good as the environment that's around you and and if your adversaries know that you know military force is off the table and and the likelihood of appeasement or ransom or concession is on the table they're going to look for those you know results instead of just turning over the hostage and hoping that they don't get punished for for having engaged in mign activity and do you think that that's reflected in the broader geopolitical landscape especially in relationship to say what's happened in ukraine with the russians look sadly that sadly that's the case jordan i mean we we we saw a direct line from this catastrophic withdrawal from afghanistan and the way that it was handled to vladimir putin sensing that america was weak and american weakness is provocative you know american strength keeps peace in the world but when when our adversaries believe us to be weak they they take chances and they take they look for opportunities to exploit that weakness and and i don't think america is fundamentally weaker than we were four years ago we're we're a very strong country we've got ge geography on our side we got demography on our side we've got innovation we've got a tremendous military but the perception by by from our that our adversaries develop over time watching things like afghanistan watching the failure to deter putin in ukraine i mean you recall jordan all the talk with the pundits and the the administration folks before putin's invasion was we don't want to provoke them we don't want to give the ukrainians extra weapons we don't want to you know do things that would dissuade the russians because that could provoke putin into an invasion dictators look at the world very differently than we do it's not a rational it's maybe rational from their perspective but it's not how what we believe is rational i mean i remember commentators saying it would be crazy for putin to invade ukraine well putin didn't do that way putin saw us withdraw from afghanistan he sensed weakness he thought he had an opportunity to gain geography to gain territory he's got a demographic problem in russia he could gain 40 million more russians he could get access to agricultural land and and increases russia's ability to trade ukraine has some natural resources some oil and gas so he looked at that as an opportunity to take the whole thing whereas we would think that's irrational for a big country just to invade its neighbor because it could because might makes right but for putin it was perfectly ir rational and so when he sensed our weakness he moved and and we didn't do a good job to turn them and that was a failure of of policy now we've done a pretty good job supplying the ukrainians since then since the invasion but we we we lost a real opportunity to prevent the whole war from happening and that that that was a shame for the ukrainian people and and frankly for the russian people we talk about pre-born a lot on our shows here at the daily wire we believe in their mission and we know you do too who wouldn't want to help mothers and their children in crisis preborn is reaching into the hearts of women by allowing them to hear the heart hearts of their babies and introducing them to their precious lives it's a divine connection that doubles as a baby's chance at life every day pre-born network of clinics rescues 200 babies lives but it doesn't stop there your gift of $28 for a free ultrasound goes directly to women in need and pre-born doesn't take any of that money they independently fundraise for their team to continue to make a difference they offer mothers maternity clothes doctor's visits and the help they need all gifts are tax deductible and will go directly towards saving babies lives to donate just dial p250 and say the keyword baby that's p 250 baby or donate securely at pre-born docomo that's preborn dcom jordan well it was very interesting to me i mean trump's a very complicated character in the us is a very complicated country in a complicated world it was very interesting to me though especially having contemplated trump's legacy in the intervening years that when he first emerged on the scene some of the fears associated with him were that in his sort of bullying and provocative manner that he'd be a real bull in the china shop on the foreign policy side of things but he seemed capable of simultaneously charming people like putin and the leader of north korea well simultaneously keeping them on their heels i would say maybe as a consequence of his perceived unpredictability but also his clear willingness perhaps to use force and the consequence of that and there's two consequences of that that i find quite fascinating it's sort of reminiscent to me of what happened with reag when he bombed gaddafi you know i was pretty young when that occurred and when reagan bombed gaddafi i thought oh my god all hell's going to break loose there's going to be terrorism everywhere because i mean i think reagan if i remember correctly killed a couple of members of gaddafi's immediate family in that bombing raid and i thought all hell was going to break loose but what happened instead was that gaddafi was actually chastened and the degree of terrorist activity emanating from libya declined to pretty much zero and then when trump took power i think one of his remarkable achievements and i really think that he has got far less credit for this than he deserved was that there was a period of four years without with no wars like no wars and that's pretty damn rare and there's always some chronic irritating conflict going on i mean afghanistan was continuing but trump didn't start that and also he initiated the abraham records even though the obama administration had had an opportunity to do so it was trump who moved on it it took a while but he did it successfully and that could have obviously been expanded the abraham accords they could have been expanded under biden the saudis as far as i can tell would have signed those accords if biden would have taken the opportunity that was right bloody well in front of them to take and so we have this strange spectacle of someone who's pretty blustery and noisy and and who might easily be regarded as provocative actually setting up a circumstance where by your testimony the negotiation for hostages was much more likely to be successful but also where there were no incursions of the sort say that russia undertook in ukraine during that four-year period that would precipitate a war and we also saw the initiation of a a really large scale and major peace process because that's certainly what the abraham accords represent so what do you make of all that well so jordan you're you're p you you had a very perceptive comment at the at the outset of that question and that was how could president trump be cordial with some of these b bad guys and yet still obtain the the results that that we wanted as america to we're under our national interest and to deter these these thugs and and dictators and tyrants from from engaging in mali activity and you know there's an old saying that diplomacy is saying the nastiest possible things in the nicest possible way and and president trump was really a genius at that he he was always very cordial in his conversations with with allies but also with with putin or or kim jennan or xi jingping those i was on many of those phone calls he was very cordial got along well with them but at the same time we were sanction we put more sanctions on the russians than anybody since ronald reagan i we we put the russians in a box and yet the president was very cordial with them and so they understood here's a guy who's being cordial wanting to reduce the risk of a nuclear war in the case with russia wanting to make sure that we got our message across but at the same time this is a tough guy who's who's not going to take any nonsense from us and there was a level of unpredictability and the president talked about this that you know what the odds of us sending troops to ukraine were small if russia invaded but there was a risk there and putin had to take that risk into account it complicated the lives of his planners his military planners to say what if what if trump does engage then we lose and that could be a disaster so we better you know factor that into the risk and and not not invade ukraine so the the same thing happened with with north korea and the president had very cordial relations with with kim jonun but it didn't start out that way and and i i was a hostage envoy at the time and when we were talking about little rocket man and fire and fury and my my my button's bigger than your button but it wasn't just the rhetoric and this is what american politic i ob often times miss it's backing up the rhetoric with with hard power so the president moved two aircraft carriers into the y yellow c into the near near north korea and said look you want to keep playing this game i've got you know 80 aircraft per per carrier and and you a good chunk of the us navy sitting off your coast how how do you want to do this would you rather have a summit and try and work things out and denuclearise now we obviously didn't get there but we we went down that path and we and kim jan committed to dlear iz ation we didn't get there but but he at least he committed to it or or do you want to do you want to keep testing your nuclear weapons and see how it works out for you and so it was that combination of cordiality and and frankness and and you know good cheer with our adversaries with our partners as well but backing it up with american hard power and letting them know that you know if you cross a line and we're not going to be like obama we're not going to set red lines that we don't intend to enforce but if we set a red line no it's going to be enforced so you you understand what you're getting into that's your call that's not on us and and that that raises a very important point that you made president trump was the first president since jimmy carter technically probably argue reagan as well that didn't start a new war we didn't send you know we we eliminated some of the great terrorist threats to the country we got baghdaddy we took other measures to protect the country but we didn't start a new war and and the reason we didn't start a new war is the same reason ronald reagan didn't start a new war is because our adv aries understood if we cross american red lines if we if we damage american national interests there's going to be a heavy price to pay and and and we better factor that into our our our planning our consideration and and so they didn't engage in the activity that would have led to us having to engage militarily and so the last president that really truly did that was ronald reagan now he had the invasion of grenada but i i'd argue that was more of a the big hostage rescue of the of the medical students in grenada that turned into a you know taking over the the the country but but other than reagan in recent presidencies republican and democrat no one has been able to stop our adversaries without engaging in military action on a large scale until president trump and i think that's one of the great accomplish great accomplishment of his administration i wonder if that proclivity that trump has to strike terror and disarray into the hearts of his political opponents within the us who seem to regard him as you know the next best thing to satan himself in terms of the danger he presents to the integrity of the state i wonder if that is the same unpredictability and menace cordial menace that inhib that intimidates his potential opponents or the potential opponents of the us on the foreign policy side you think that's the same manifestation you know i'm not sure if it's intimidation i mean he whether it was our allies we had you know pretty competent and and and confident leaders like mcon in france or boris johnson in the uk angela merkel had a very different personality but was a very strong character and then our adversaries you know putin's a tough guy and xi jinping is a tough guy and kim janun is you know unpredictable himself so i'm not sure if it was an intimidation of the the leaders but i think what it was is it was the resolve that he showed and they understood that this this guy represents america and sometimes we look at our adversaries and think they're 10 feet tall and sometimes our adversaries get ahead of us and we got to catch up with them china's gotten ahead of us on a couple of things where we got to catch up with them but the reality is america is a fundamentally very strong country and if you've got a president that's willing to use all the tools of american national power economic diplomatic military and is is resolved to protect our national interest and the other guy guys know that they they can they can do an assessment of of the you know the balance of forces and and decide are they are they going to win or lose if they press the issue and and i think with president trump they understood at the end of the day this guy had a lot of backbone and wasn't going to fold and so they better not cross the red line so i'm not sure if it's intimidation or you know more a confidence that the president shows when he enters into a room and and look that works with adversaries but it also works with our partners so one of the great accomplishments of the trump administration that that's iner to the benefit of ukraine today and and europe today is back in 2019 i had i had been national security advisor very long maybe a couple months and we had a real problem with nato the president was very unhappy that our nato partners weren't paying 2% of their gdp with the exception of not i think at the time it was four or five countries uk was one of them greece the baltics turkey but the rest of the countries were getting a free ride on american defense and we're spending three and a half to four % of our economy of our gdp to defend not only america but the free world and the president said hey that's not right everyone committed to at least 2% that's still half of what we're paying but you got to pay the 2% and the europeans kind of chuckled and said well every president i i went back and looked at this i actually wrote an article about it every president running for president since 1972 the theme has been one of the campaign planks has been on on both the republican and the democrat side is europe will pay its fair share you know europe will step up for its own and no one got it even my you know my hero ronald reagan couldn't get the europeans to pay the their fair share bear their fair fair portion of the burden and president trump made some pretty tough comments about nato and i thought wow you know i'm a big nato supporter and it's a great alliance it's kept the peace in in europe for many years 75 years and so i thought how is this going to play out but it gave me the opportunity to go as you know the negotiator with yen stoltenberg the secretary general of nato who's a terrific statesmen and yen and i were able to go to to our allied partners and say look the the days of of germany you know getting cheap minerals from russia selling expensive finished goods to china and letting america pay for its defense while it runs up a budg of surplus that's just not fair that's that's got to end it's not fair to the american taxpayer it's not fair to your other partner nations and it wasn't just germany it was you know canada was all the countries and so the fact that president trump was being tough and talking about you know article 5 apply you know if you're not paying your dues quot so to speak i mean they weren't dues but you know that's the way the president phrased it that that that kind of struck some fear into the hearts of of our allies so we walked away with that from that summit with going from four or five countries paying 2% to 11 countries paying 2% of their gdp committing to it but we also had an overall increase and you know we didn't get germany as high as we wanted but we got a small increase from germany but because the german economy was so big it made it was a lot of money we got $400 billion in commitments for new nato spending outside of the us over the course of 10 years that that december summit and of course the hand ringers the the diplomatic correspondents and you know the the you know the the folks that cover the state department and cover nato they they rang their hands and said this is terrible and it's it's awful diplomacy and the the standing of america has gone down in the world well yeah i'm sure our european allies weren't weren't happy in some cases that they had to spend the money but guess what they're happy now i was at a conference in prague recently a defense conference and i had germans coming up to me saying you guys were right thank you for making us spend more money and that that additional spending even in the initial three years from 19 to 2022 allowed some of those european countries to get new platforms and new weapon systems so that when russia invaded ukraine a lot of those countries were able to send their old soviet equipment especially in eastern europe their old equipment that was no longer they modernized and they they go went to a stock pilc and they sent that equipment to ukraine and so a lot of the initial equipment that ukraine got was a direct result of the the additional incre the increase in defense funding that came out of that 2019 summit that president trump was pillared for for being you know arrogant and rude and you know putting america first and that sort of thing and in fact what we did is we put our allies in a position where they could defend themselves and help ukraine and so again it's counterintuitive you know someone taking that that sort of an approach and it's it's not something that it may be grading people and and and diplomats might not like it but when you look at the results they were incredibly successful what do you think it is in trump's character that makes him it possible for him to do those things because that is it's quite a track record really of success right because you've laid out four different instances you said he was very effective in relationship to hostage negotiation he was good at keeping potential enemies at bay and established peace for four years but he also he is he he successfully negotiated the abrahamic course which will turn to but as you pointed out and this is this is quite orthogonal to those other enterprises he was instrumental and successful in getting the nato allies to pay their fair share which was something i was watching that from the outside from the canadian perspective and i know certainly full well that we haven't pulled our weight at all and continue to not do so but it was quite striking to me that he was able to manage that the justice of the cause seemed self-evident i mean it's completely absurd that america has to shoulder this burden by itself and also take all the moral slings and arrows that go along with being the prime defender of the west right it's it's just too much to be asked to pay the financial price and then to bear the moral you know appropri at the same time there's no excuse for that but trump was very effective at negotiating for that to be rectified and so what do you think it is about his character and the way he conducts himself that makes him capable of doing those things you talked about you know his his willingness to rely on military force say in relationship to potential foreign enemies but of course that's not going to be an issue when he's talking to nato allies so what's he doing right well look i think i i didn't know president trump before becoming his hostage envoy and i got to know him a little bit during that period of time and then you know came to know him fairly well as his national security advisor but i think it's your background you know we all bring whatever our background is to the new job right you know you're you've got a background as a clinical psychologist now you're doing you know political analysis which is you know par excellance and i think trump what trump did is he brought his background as a real estate developer where you're you're you're in new york you know in the the thick of it whether you know he had a track record some people liked his track record some people didn't like his track record but he built big things he built big buildings you know he built hotel empire and in those real estate negotiations i i used to see this as a lawyer with with clients you you've got to keep two things in mind at the same time and it's hard for a lot of people to understand that you're trying to do a deal with someone and you're trying to beat the heck out of them and get get the best price you can and at the same time they're a partner because you you want them to consummate the deal right so you want to get if you're if you're buying land from somebody or buying a building you want to get the very best price but at the same time you want to keep them at the table and have not go to other guy and sell the building to someone else because you want that asset and or if you're selling the same thing just on the other side of the table i think president trump learned that you know through years of negotiations in in real estate 50 50-year career and and even younger than that watching his dad fred trump you know do deals that you know you got to be tough and you got to get get the best deal you can but at the same time you got to prevent your partner from walking away from the the deal and walking away from the table and striking that balance i think is pretty tough and and look a lot of people don't have experience with it a lot of people come come into government from think tanks or from academia or or from the military where folks are used to falling orders or or even as lawyers but you know maybe without the the litigation or the the deal experience so they come to to government and people expect them to be great negotiators but they've never really had that that experience whereas president trump came to office probably with more experience negotiating you know that certainly anyone in his cabinet anyone in his his immediate circle but also any other politician in the world that he was dealing with so for for good or for better or for worse i mean there you know there are all kinds of different ways to prepare to be president i'm not saying being a real estate developer is the best way to prepare to be president but for for president trump it worked when it came to these negotiations that we've been talking about and and and trying to come to a deal where you get both parties to say yes but you get a good deal for america and so i think that's probably the the the the best preparation he had for some of the things we've been talking about jordan well you've worked as a diplomat and a litigator and national security advisor and all of that's involved negotiation and you know one of the things i've noted in my private life watching people and in my clinical practice and suppose in my role as a as a professor as well is that generally speaking people are very bad at negotiating they don't say what they want they don't admit what they want they don't listen to the other side they don't understand how to strike that playful balance between competition and keeping their partner in the game they're not trained to negotiate we do a very bad job of that in our society people can't negotiate with themselves they can't negotiate with their spouses they're not good at negotiating with their kids they can't strike a deal with their business partners like it's a big problem right because negotiation there's no difference between bringing a successful negotiation to a conclusion and establishing peace those are the same things now you've done a lot of negotiating and as a diplomat which is more diplomatic obviously as a litigator which is more on the offense side let's say and then under stressful conditions when you're negotiating for hostage release what is it that you've seen that makes a successful negotiator what skills do you have to master and what pitfalls do you have to avoid and how have you mastered that or have you you know do feel that you've mastered it well i i certainly haven't mastered it but i have had a fair amount of experience and you know sometimes successfully negotiated deals or or releases or diplomatic accords and sometimes unsuccessfully it so it certainly not 100% track record it's it's a big question and there's a lot that goes into that mix and you talk about all the different scenarios in which we're involved in negotiation whether it's in our home life our business life or professional life putting it totally aside politics and and international affairs we're all negotiating all the time i i think there are a couple of of things that that have been load stares for me in in negotiating is one is understanding that the other party has to get something out of the negotiation and that doesn't mean money necessarily it doesn't mean you know but but it usually means respect so i think being respectful and being cordial with your adversary even if there a you know i've sat across the table from some some pretty uh unsavory characters but if you're respectful and you're cordial that that that's one thing that you can give that cost you nothing other than you know some goodwill and some some humility so that's number one number two you have to listen to the other side and try and figure out what is it they really want because they may be saying they want one thing but they really want something else and figuring out what they what their you know bottom line is what what what's what's the least amount they'd take to give you what you want requires you to listen to them number three i think you have to be honest i mean i i i've never done a negotiation in in my private life or in as a lawyer as a litigator as a diplomat where i've lied to people i just don't think i may not disclose every all the information i've got or that i know but i don't lie to people because once once you get caught out in a negotiation telling something is false or lying you you've lost your credibility and your ability to to get a deal done goes away and i think the last i'd make him response to that question and again probably a hundred if we sat and thought about it and talked longer you've got to be willing to say no there has to be a point at which you'll walk away from the table because if if there's not some level that you'll say no and walk away you're your opponent will understand that and they'll push and push and push until they've taken everything from you you've got to have a red line and and sometimes it's hard because you've you know saying no is going to mean somebody staying in prison longer or somebody you know being in a dungeon longer or not getting the the the deal you really wanted for you know your your client if you're a litigator not getting the peace deal that would you know make the headlines and and and help solve a war but if you're not willing to say no and your adversary doesn't understands you're not willing to say no there's no limit to what they'll take from you and so you have to have you have to have your own and that doesn't mean you have to disclose those red lines and and tell them what you're going to say no and that's kind of the interplay with the the honesty issue but you got to be able to say you know oftentimes you're ambiguous about it where you tell the other side there's a point that i'm not going to go beyond and you're getting close to it and if you get to that point i'm going to get up from the table i'm going to walk away and then you're going to lose negotiation as well because the point that the look they're there because they want something from you as well it's not you coming as a supplicant usually you know they're they're there not supplicating to you you're not supplicating to them but there's a deal to be had you know how how that deal works out you know you have to see but but if they know that you're not willing to get up and leave you're never going to get a negotiation done i had this happen and i'm not going to mention the the country but we're involved in pretty high stakes negotiations when i was national security advisor and we thought we had a deal with the leader of the country and we we came back to finalize it and the the foreign minister and some of the other other leaders kind of tried to put new conditions on try to renegotiate the deal and and i did something at the time i was a little tired had been long nights and couple days straight i just packed my briefcase and i had a whole team of state department folks with me and i don't think they'd ever seen that before and i packed up my briefcase and said okay thank you we tried we gave it our best shot but we're done and got up and started to walk away and i think the other side was shocked by it certainly the guys from the the career officials of the state department were looking at me like i was a nut and i said come on guys let's go we're out of here and and the other side said wait wait wait wait wait you know we then we got back to the deal we had the night before with the leader and but they they you know our state department guys had never seen someone pack up a briefcase and leave well i i'd seen people pack up their briefcases and leave a hundred times as a lawyer in los angeles you know that was if and and and usually if a good plaintiff's lawyer didn't pack up his bags and leave three or four times during the day during a negotiation then you weren't doing a good job so it uh so so you got you got to be willing to to walk away from the table if you if if the other side's not serious and and that doesn't mean you don't come back you you laid out three principles there that i think are worth delving into because this is very important i think for people's practive lives as well so well i learned something very profound from carl rogers and a lot of rogers clinician a lot of rogers work has been instrumental in establishing mediation processes over the last few decades and rogers delineated out what's come to be known as active listening which is kind of a cliched version of what he was attempting to put forward and i've used this a lot in my private life and also in my clinical practice because it actually works it's one of the few psychological techniques so to speak it's not manipulative that i that actually is credible and not just cliched rogers suggested to the people he was attempting to inform the clinicians he was trying to ch train that when they listen to a client that they listened with without interruption and then provided back to the client a summary of what they had just said and asked the client whether or not that summary accurately represented the intent of the communication and that was useful in three ways say the first element of utility is that it indicated that at least that the listener was interested in and attentive enough to fully and brave enough to fully understand what was being communicated so that's very useful because that's a sign of respect right attentive respect the next part of it that was useful was to indicate to the person that what had been said was actually understood right because if you're going to put the gist forward you have to have understood it and that also often helped the person who was committ communicating clarify what it is that they were actually trying to communicate because it's not always the case that the person you're talking to knows exactly what they want and so you're offering them a gift if you can summarize it and then you also have some insight into the potential conditions of satisfaction that the under other person is attempting to establish like if i'm talking to my wife one of the things about something where there's some contention and we've we've negotiated this as a meta negotiation strategy is that it's incumbent on both of us to say to define the conditions under which peace could theoretically prevail you know because you can ask someone well what would i have to give you hypothetically so that this went away and you were happy now i it isn't necessarily the case that i can or will deliver that but at least i'd like to know right okay so that's active listening and then you said also and condition of satisfaction you also said this is something i always told my clients too is that if you can't say no you can't negotiate and then no means this is what no means no means if you continue doing what you're doing something you do not like will happen to you with 100% certainty now that might just be that all leave and that the negotiation ends but you know it could be other things as well but if you don't have that in your back pocket in the back of your mind if there's no line that that that you've put forward that can't be crossed of course you can't negotiate because the whole negotiation is a lie because really what you're doing is walking into the situation saying i'm fully yours for the taking but i'm going to pretend that's not the case and if the person on the other side is the least bit canny or the least bit pushy like a good litigator would be they're going to figure that out by every nonverbal cue you put forward by and by everything you say and don't say so you need to listen so you know what the person wants you have to find out their conditions of satisfaction to see if they can possibly be met and then you have to determine as you pointed out that you can and will say no and that no actually means well it means that something that isn't pleasant is going to transpire otherwise you have no strength as far as i can detail well no that's that's a great summary and again you know i didn't have the formal training from rogers it was more the kind of the school of hard knocks of of litigating a lot of cases and and working as a diplomat and you know learning those experiences but i think it's a great summary so 100% and again i think that that being willing to say no is is just critical folks have to know that there is a a point and as you you know you point out there's a point of no return where the the the unpleasant thing just be that the ne negotiations end but it may be that there's going to be a military strike it may be that there's going to be economic sanction i had this happen with a a relatively well-known case i had i was sent to sweden to bring home an american rapper named asap rocky and it was somewhat controversial because he was being held by an ally it was a result of a street scuffle but we determined that he was being held unfairly and the sweds didn't like the fact that i was showing up as the hostage onvoy in fact i remember one one reporter was joking and as i was walking into the courthouse are you sending a carrier are you going to send the seals and but we had to negotiate with our swedish partners and you know they're they're a new nato ally and they were close partners then but they had no intention of negotiating with us i mean they in their view was this is in our legal system stay out of it he'll get dealt with as we see fit but the problem is the president of the united states to put our credibility on the line the president said he's wrongfully detained we're going to bring him home he thought he had to deal with the swedish prime minister the swedish prime minister saw it a different way which that that that that happens or miscommunications and no no blame on on the to the sweds but i had to sit down and and mike pompeo wrote about this in in his books i'll i'll mention it because secretary pompeo mentioned it when mike sent me i was a hostage envoy at the time sent me to sweden he said listen you got cart blanch you can use whatever economic tool you want you know tell them they're never going to sell another volvo in america and and so at that point even though the the swedes weren't prepared to negotiate when we kind of said we understand that and that's in fact i actually told the deputy foreign minister that's quite admirable that you're you're willing to stand up to the us you're not going to negotiate but you know this is important to us now because i've got hostages all over the world i've got hostages in lebanon and syria and iran and venezuela and north korea if we cave to sw sweden because and and and don't get the result the president said we're going to get our credibility is shot around the world for you know dealing with other regimes are going to say if the swed can push you around well we're far naser than the sweds are we'll do the same i said so i understand your point of view and it's it's admirable but you're never going to sell another ville in america and so so you you know there going to be factories in america that you built and factories in in sweden that you built then that won't have you know you're f the fire thousands of swedish workers and if if you know you've got to decide what's more important to you at this point you know keeping this rapper who you've who was attacked by some some afghan migrants and they' kept that out of the press you know and and fought back and and you know lesson learned for those guys don't attack a rapper in his posy not not a good idea in a street fight but you know if it's so important you you put him in jail for a year or two and in a kind of a dubious situation their argument was that he defended himself but then you know the longer the fight went on it you exceeded his self-defense rights but i said on a on a relatively du be a thing that would never even be charged in a place like los angeles and it wouldn't even get to the da's office the police would have dealt with it and i i said and it's so important you're going put close down some of your factories to to maintain that principle and you know god bless you and we we saw a newspaper article come out a day or two later that said the us is bullying sweden we knew it was leaked by the swedes because we didn't disclose it and so i knew at that point that they'd probably made the decision they'll blame the us for bullying them and that was fine i me i wanted wanted them to be able to stay face and sweden's a great country they were helping us in north korea we i remember meeting with the for become national security adviser a couple weeks later i met with a foreign minister who was a really impressive woman and we had a had a great meeting on north korea we let bygones be got bygones with the asap rocky case and but but again you have to it's easy for a party to come to the table and say i'm not negotiating with you i get everything i want and if you're willing if if that's what you're going to do then just pack up your bags and go home or don't even show up at the negotiation but if you're going to if you're going to try and get the result you want and your credibility is on the line then you've got to be willing to to to let people know that there is a consequence that comes with a no like you can say no but there's a consequence that comes with it and and in that case we were able to get the whole thing resolved sweden convicted them and then let him go for time sered so they they say face their justice system was was able to run its course we i stayed for the trial and after the trial asap was able to get home and and come back to america and it all it all worked out very well we maintained cural relations but it's an example of a negotiation where where both sides were pretty well dug in and it didn't look like there was a way to get it get it done but we we got it done so on the on the with regard to when you should say no so and this is tied up very tightly with the issue of honesty i think it's incumbent on you to say and indicate know when you're convinced of the fact that the alternative position what you're going to accept instead is actually an untenable solution in the long run like if you if you exceed to a negotiation but you walk away bitter and resentful and you believe that the conditions that you now have to abide by are not only unjust but unlikely to be maintained then you should have said no more harshly during the negotiation and that does take a certain amount of forthrightness and willingness to confront and also the kind of honesty that has a long-term view right i mean a successful negotiation should also appear to be should be and appear to be just to both sides because otherwise it's going to be undermined in all sorts of secretive ways as soon as the negotiation concludes well the old saying in in you know la litigation circles was you know it wasn't a good deal unless both sides walked away unhappy you know it's i think another way of of restating what you just said where both sides feel that they had some sort of win and i'm not talking about a chinese you know the chinese talk about win-win negotiations and it's always the chinese win and you lose but but a real win-win negotiation not not a propaganda one you know you you both sides need to come away with something but when it gets to your issue of no and and you you you're just a really good point jordan you can say no in a negotiation that doesn't mean we're done with negotiating you can say no that that's not a good deal i don't i don't want that but let's keep going but when you you get to that ultimate no that that needs to be your bedrock because you don't want to say no and walk away and think you know i could have actually given a little bit more and gotten to where i needed to be you need to be honest with yourself about where is it too painful for me to continue but where where you know i may say no because i don't like the deal and try and get a better deal but but where where where where's the no come that where you pack up your briefcase and you literally walk away and you're not coming back and that that you have to prepare for that before the negotiation and and and and know what you're internally that doesn't mean you share it with the other side but you have to know internally what what are my redlines and where can i where what's that point where i i can't jump off the cliff and and and commit suicide but you know how close can i get to the cliff and still get a deal i can i can be happy with and and that's something you have to you have to think about that before you get before you start the negotiation right right well when i was working with people who were involved in cellary negotiations for example there were often people who had worked worked quite diligently that weren't very good at reporting what they had done to their superiors that were laboring under some degree of bitterness and resentment because they didn't feel that their contributions had been recognized and perhaps rightly so we would always ensure that before they went and had a conversation with their boss that their cv was in order and they'd already checked out the alternative job market and they had at least a lateral move in mind and maybe a better move and then we'd pro the conversation so that they knew exactly what they were saying but the reason for them to get their cv in order and so forth was because they needed to walk in there knowing that they could tell their boss to that they would leave now they didn't want to you know that that was an outcome but if they didn't have that in their back pocket they were weak and if they did have it in their back pocket they're much more effective negotiators they knew what they wanted and they knew where their line was and that stiffened their spine in the and you have to have all that straight in your head before you go into to the negotiation no this a great point what i used to tell people and and still do tell colleagues who are thinking about leaving their job or aren't happy or think there's a better o opportunity i always tell them keep one arm on the monkey bar when you're swinging for the other one but don't don't drop it in the air and hope you're going to catch the other monkey bar make sure you've got make sure you've got a make sure you've got a plan b you've got another job or you can keep your current job but don't don't drop the monkey bar and hoping hoping you have enough momentum to get the the next rung it may work but you could also end up in the sand pit down on your butt right well it helps as well so you know it helps very much as well to walk into a negotiation having plotted out what you'll do if it goes as badly as it could right because there's going to be fears that beset you what if this is a catastrophe and the answer to that can't be oh it won't be a catastrophe the answer has to be if this is a catastrophe here's the steps that i will take to ensure victory on a different front and that also stops you from being pushed around yeah yeah 100% how do i how do i mitigate the downside and and look it helps to have a counselor you know and i'm not just talking about a national security adviser it helps have someone like you or or a lawyer or a psychologist or a friend or your wife that you can sit down before the negotiation and talk these things through because sometimes it's it's hard to do it on your own so if you've got people you can rely on whether it's colleagues or or professionals that you can bring in to help in the negotiation and you walk through these things you know you can you can become more focused and figure out you know here's my real red line if i have to walk away with that red line here's the downsides to me how do i mitigate them and here's how i can here's how i can give the other side down you know here's how i can you know prepare downsides for the the opponent you know so that they've got to keep that in mind when they're negotiating yeah well it's also very helpful to pre-negotiate with people who are quite pushy so that they can push your limits and test you out and that's actually part of the purpose of critical thinking right is you could have all the weaknesses in your position analyzed by you know without any real threat except maybe to your self esteem and your ego you know in with your inability to formulate your arguments clearly but it's a hell of a lot better to have them pretested than to have them fail on the actual battlefield 100% absolutely so you characterized earlier and this will be a lead into some questions about russia you characteriz characterize the withdrawal from afghanistan as catastrophic and so that's all faded away in principle although we may be suffering from the aftermath of that in the form of this you know neverending conflict or a conflict that looks like it's going to never be ending in in russia and ukraine why would you characterize the withdrawal in afghanistan as catastrophic i mean the us did extract itself it was was a messy long-term conflict so in that way it's come to an end and you could imagine that there might be some benefits from that but that obviously that isn't the way that you look at it overall and so what is it about the withdrawal that you object to and why did you characterize it as catastrophic so so let me walk you through that but let me first make a point when you when you said it faded away and you're right because we've got a short attention span in the west it's not just america it's can western europe japan australia well what i kind of call not the geographical west but the the ideological west hopefully india is becoming part of that that group and other countries but we've got a short attention span we go quarter to quarter with our stocks we we go election to election two-year cycles for the house representatives here four years for president we've got a short yeah kind of shortterm view and i think that's true with afghanistan and so people have already forgotten you know that this this just just happened and two years ago but guess who doesn't have a short-term view the chinese communist party so when i was in taiwan in march of this year led a delegation there to for gti global taiwan institute to work on how how do we improve us taiwan relations and how can we strengthen taiwan and make it more resilient to deter china one of the the things that they had the videos that they showed on tik tok and on instagram to to undermine the confidence of the people in taiwan in the relationship with the us but also in their own you know ability to defend themselves is they showed a picture of that c17 that was running along the afghan the the the runway at hamed carai airport in downtown of kabul and had the afghans running alongside it and people climbing on the wing and people trying to get in the wheel well and they said this is what what america will do to you this is how america leaves this is you you'll be in essence you'll be these poor afghans running along trying to hop on the american airplane as they take off off you better cut a good deal with us now because this is your future and so that that afghanistan withraw that we might might want to forget and you know you know forget the 12 or 13 gold star families who lost their their loved ones at hamed k kai airport and the the suicide bombing and we want that all all that to go away our adversaries aren't forgetting it and so it was you know seen those videos embolden putin to go into ukraine but it's also the chinese are very skillfully using it to to undermine the confidence of our allies in asia about our ability to stand with them in the event of a chinese invasion so in other words cut the good deal with us now because america won't be there but going to your broader question why was it a catastrophe you know we wanted to get out of afghanistan that was a forever war secretary pompeo and ambassador kalilo had spent a lot of time for president trump negotiating a deal with the taliban which we signed in february of of 2020 and that deal was stopped killing americans because the president had gotten sick of going to do and was sick from going to do and i was with them on three occasions i represented him on another three occasions for the dignified transfer of the remains of our fallen heroes and you'd have to go on and comfort those families and and watch these young men come home and there were no women at the time in my experience but these young men coming home in a flag drip casket and it was a beautiful dignified transfer but that's not the way their parents or their loved ones or their wives wanted them to come home and that's that's not the way america wanted them to come home and and th those are heart-wrenching experiences and we decided look we got it we've got to end this afghanistan war it's taking number one it's taking too many of our lives of our young men young women who are volunteer to go serve our country and defend ourselves defend america but and it wasn't just america it was canada that was there and france and and many of other partner nations but it was also costing us billions of dollars every month and while we were plunging billi millions of dollars into afghanistan with very little return i afghanistan was not on we mentioned sweden earlier afghanistan was not on the way to becoming the new sweden the chinese were taking those same billions of dollars and launching a new frig or new destroyer every month so they were engaged in great power competition building the biggest navy in the world which they now have bigger than the us navy and we were pumping this money into afghanistan much of what was getting put on pallets and cash and being shipped to dubai and because of the corruption there and we had it had to come to an end but it had to come to an end in a way that that met american national interests and so what we what president trump ultimately decided and that took a lot of time to get there is that we'd leave 2500 troops there as a counterterrorist force to deal with isis k to deal with al qaeda we had 5,000 nato troops so for the first time when when we left office in january january 20 2021 we had 5,000 nato troops and only 2,500 american troops so we had two to one nato contribution to america nato was bearing the burden we were supporting nato with with exquisite capabilities but nato was bearing the burden we kept bm airbase because bogram had big fields of fire it couldn't be overrun by the taliban it would have been the perfect place if we ever had to engage in a somewhat expedited withdrawal bm was a place to do it so we we put everything in place and then we insisted to the taliban that you have to negotiate with the afghan government that you know this can't be we're not turning the government we're not turning afghanistan over to the taliban you've got to negotiate with with your your friends you know frenemies your your fellow afghans and you got to have a government of national unity and we're staying here until that happens and even after that happens we're likely going to stay because you're going to need our help which the taliban is now even admitting with isis k i mean isis k that with the alqa offshoot which is just a brutal terrorist organization is alive and well in afghanistan and and you know it's bad when the when the taliban are calling them extremists you know it's you know it's pretty bad when the taliban are saying hey those those guys are islamic extremists you know it's just got to be pretty bad that's they're they're now taking hold in afghanistan so so had we gone with our plan kept a counterterrorism force there had the afghan government and taliban come together as a government of national unity used american prestige but hard power to make sure that happened that would have been a very different result than what we saw of of afghans falling out of wheel wells and to the plunging to their death at hammed carza airport the leaving behind thousands of of of afghan collaborators who work with our interpreters or afghan special forces afghan pilots leaving behind hundreds of americans i me there are still americans trapped in afghanistan and that gives the afghan the taliban leverage over the administration you know in every negotiation they have to free up funds or that sort of thing because they've got these americans there and they've got our our allies who are still there that they could you know do do harm to so you know it it was a very different scenario that we had in mind than what what played out and what played out led to what we talked about at the the top of the show is this perception of american weakness that we're so weak that we're running out with our tail between our legs with the shinook helicopters going to the top of the embassy and ext extracting our diplomats and racing them to safety while our afghan allies suffered the results of a taliban takeover and again you know maybe the biden administration didn't expect it to happen maybe they didn't expect the the the government of afghanistan to fall as quickly as it did but you could see in hindsight you know which is always perfect you can see how just one step after another withdrawing our our troops down to 600 troops giving up bogram airbase in the middle of the night without telling our allies you know appeasing the taliban you know begging them not to take this city until a certain number of days you know that that's the sort of thing that led to this catastro catastrophe and as church hill talked about with with the munich accords this is something that was going to carry on with us long long down the road it was a defeat without a battle and we're seeing that now with xi jinping and taiwan we're seeing it with with the ayatollah in in the middle east and we were certainly the most concrete example is we're watching vladimir putin you know invade ukraine and with limited success but also with it causing great and terrible humanitarian damage in ukraine and and basically to his own people as well his own soldiers who they lost thousands of young russians lives have been lost in in that meat grinder so you know all of these things you can tie back to what happened in afghanistan and then so in hindsight it was a really poor decision by the bid administration to to handle the evacuation and the the withraw the way they did ending the war good idea doing it in that fashion bad idea well given that that plan was in place to keep 2500 troops there and that there were 5,000 nato personnel there as well and that that would have been a credible peacekeeping and deterrent for force why do you think the biden administrated administration acted contrary to that plan and so precipitously yeah it's i i think there were they there was just bad analysis i think they thought the afghan government could stay in power longer than it did that they they could get out quicker i think they they didn't quite understand the the the structure that we'd left behind although we briefed him on it many many times and so you heard things like well this is trump's fault and trump signed the deal trump did have a plan look i think part of it goes back to what we talked about earlier was was trump's resolve i mean the taliban knew not to push donald trump very far that they knew the results of of what you know that he'd take they saw the b daddy right they saw you know how tough we could be around the world i think they took had a very different measure of of joe biden and so i think all these things played in played into it and look i think another part is biden always wanted to get out of afghanistan i mean as as did we he wanted to get out of afghanistan back in the obama administration down victory yeah well and wanted i think they also wanted to see a like a quick accomplishment on the foreign policy side and that beckoned let me let me talk to you now about the situation in russia and we talked a little bit about what led up to it although there's a lot more to unpack with regard to that i mean i see our relationship i guess we could talk about that a bit i see our relationship with russia since the 1990s as an unbroken string of missed opportunities virtually unbroken string of missed opportunities by the west and i also don't understand what we're looking for what our conditions of satisfaction would be in relation to the current war so this is how it appears to me in the '90s after the wall collapsed there were all sorts of attempts to modernize the russian economy often conducted by economists who were out of their depth because modernizing an entire nation's economy bringing it into the capitalist realm is complicated beyond anyone's understanding you need a bedrock of trust between people before that can even happen and it's not easy at all to understand how to instantiate that trust right i mean in the west we assume that the default economic transaction will be honest and that's an absolute miracle i have no idea how we ever accomplished that because it's so unlikely that distant people on ebay for example can conduct transactions without attempting to rip each other off the fact that that's the case is an absolute bloody miracle in any case the it looked to me like we had an opportunity to bring the russians fully into the western fold and i think that by applying a cold war mentality to that situation either by commission or by omission consistently for 30 years we squandered that opportunity now i know that people view putin as having expansionist proclivities and that may well be the case if you look at what happened in crimea and the dabass but i also think that russians regarded ukraine as an extension of russia and we're very concerned about nato incursion into ukraine and it isn't obvious to me and i'm perfectly willing to be corrected in relationship to this it isn't obvious to me that it isn't obvious to me why we didn't try to bring nato into or to bring russia into nato too especially given that the fundamental concern that we're going to be dealing with in the long run is clearly china and now russia and china are much closer than they might have been and that's further complicated by the fact that we're settling down into a very long war here we're going to spend the sort of money that we spent in afghanistan that could have been put towards strengthening the navy for example we're going to spend the billions of dollars in ukraine that we were spending in afghanistan there and i don't see what we have as a plan for either peace or victory so that's a lot of things to throw at you but but it's quite a mess so that is there is a lot of things to to be thrown there so anything you have to say that would bring some clarity to that would be more than welcome well there's a lot time packed there and a lot of good thoughts i i think starting at the beginning how we dealt with russia after the fall of the wall and and we missed opportunities but i think the russians missed a lot of opportunities too i think a lot of times in the west we're very critical of ourselves if we would have only done this then they would have you know responded reasonably i mean russia was a very corrupt society it had just come off a you know over you know the re revolution was in uh' so you know basically 80 years of tyranny of soviet tyranny of the most brutal kind purges and famines and millions i mean tens of millions of people being killed so there there's no surpris that the fabric of the society across the former soviet union was was frayed and there wasn't the trust that you talked about and by the way i agree with you it's still a miracle that you can do a deal in on ebay and and most of the time on craigslist or something most of the time it works out it's it's shocking yeah it's like 99% of the time yeah it's it's it's and it's a testament to to you know that that our system works and and when we have faith in our system it will work and for the benefit and prosperity of all but russia didn't have that and i think the other issue is you know russia was an empire and britain acquired an empire and then gave it up russia has always been an empire there was the russian empire there was no differentiation between russia itself and its colonies and its constituent republics so you know they're assembled in the soviet union but it was basically the russian empire and i think the russians really struggled with the idea that you know what ukraine is just not that into us i mean if you go to ukraine yeah it was it was subjugated by russia and there were russians speaking people in ukraine but most ukrainians were were were western they were they been at one point the austrian hungaryan empire the polish empire or you know polish kingdom or you know they were roman catholics to a large extent not not orthodox and so they didn't want to be part of russia and i think that was very hard for the russians to understand just like a guy who's pining after a girl she like she's just not that into you the ukrainians just aren't into that into the russians the the bals the lithuanians the lvans the estonians not that into russia didn't want to be part of the empire they'd been subjugated and so but it was very hard for the russians to understand that some of these countries that they subjugated and and dominated didn't want to be part of them and and i i think that was a failure on the russians part so you know we may have you know there's a lot of talk about nato expansion we tried to bring russia into nato we had a part a nator russian partnership the russians had military officers in nato headquarters which you think now is quite shocking you know in 2023 but you know in 200 you know two that seemed like a great idea and and unfortunately the russians didn't take advantage of that and i think the russians are being very shortsighted and this is something i pointed out to to patev when i negotiated with him in geneva a big part of russia and russia's wealth is in the east which is underpopulated in siberia and in eastern russia it's it's where their diamond mines are their platinum mines their oil their gas their timber wildlife i mean their their massive lands a lot of that territory was taken or agreed to be transferred to russia in'60 under a a something called the convention of p king or the treaty of p king about the time of our civil war here in america china gave up thousands and thousands of miles of ac and you know millions of acres of land to the russians including the city of vlasto but r all along siberia resource rich lands that the russians forced the chinese because they had the the z zar was far more powerful than the chinese emperor at the time they forced the chinese to recognize that as all russian land now xi jinping has said many times that the century humiliation will be overcome by the chinese people and that they'll take every square inch of property back that they believe was theirs that they believe was historically chinese that's why you had maau and the hong kong and sjan with the wegers in western china it's why you see them fighting the indians today engaged in bloody battles along the line of act actual control in the himalayas you see it with tibet why you see it with t the threats against taiwan of course you know this idea that they're going that china is going to assemble all this land that it lost to western powers or it lost when it was humiliated because it was weak do you think they're not coming for the russian lands do you think they're not coming for siberia with its treasure trove of of resources that the chinese are desperate for because the chinese are relative for as big a country as china is it's bere of natural resources the way that russia or america has these great stores of natural resources and wealth they're coming for that and i told that to the russians and tom clancy wrote a book about it you know years ago at called the bar the dragon or the dragon coming over the mountain or something along those lines the the chinese are coming for that land and and they're doing it very cleverly right now there's i think n9 million people in eastern russia three million of them are illegal chinese immigrants the chinese are flooding into russia they they throw a bottle of vodka at the border guard and you know get get let in and they're going to take that pro that land back and that goes to this national interest russia's national interest is not with china china look looks russia is being weak as being a country that can be colonized or can be re reabsorbed into china in large part and that can be dominated by xi jinping the russians are proud people and and they they're not they're no longer communists they're they're authoritarian they're imperialists but they're not communist they've got no ideological affiliation with beijing you know vladimir putin or whoever comes after them you know the one thing we know about russians throughout history that whether it's aar or the general secretary of the communist party they don't like to get a back seat to anybody as a russian they're very proud people i don't think they're going to want to be a colony of china and so you know unfortunately what's happened is we you know i don't want to say we've pushed the russians to shina the r the russians would tell you the west has pushed the russians china but we needed to come up with a way and we still need to come up with a way to deal with russia that doesn't allow them to invade their neighbors doesn't allow to invade poland or lithuania lvia estonia or finland or or ukraine but that that po them back away from this unholy alliance that they've got with with beijing and how do you how do you see that happen the russians interest so so what what h how do you see that laying itself out given that this war is devolving into well it's it's very difficult to get accurate representation of the situation but my understanding is that it's turned into something like a grinding stalemate with the advantage possibly shifting to the superior russian forces now like i said i'm not i'm not confident in in the information that i have but what do you see happening currently and how would you outline something approximating a productive pathway forward well look i think you're you're right in describing the situation and this what i said that the ukrainians are very tough and very svy at the outside of the invasion and they they really dealt the russians a bloody bloody nose one of the reasons they did that was that because we got them in the trump administration we got him 600 javelin missiles anti-tank missiles that were highly effective at blunting those three armored axises that came into ukraine and you know up until that time you know when i was national security advisor we were having a heck of a time getting the pentagon to even deliver them to the those javelins to to ukraine because there were people in the secretary of defense's office that didn't want to provoke putin it goes back to this whole theory that if we if we give the if we help the ukrainians we'll provoke putin so after after russia invaded ukraine the first time in 2014 and took crimea and took parts of the dabass you know remember the obama administration said we're going to aid ukraine and we sent them gatorade and mres and blankets and you know a few night vision goggles and what they needed you know was it's like zinsky said this time when they offered to send him a helicopter he said i don't need a helicopter i don't need a ride i need i need ammunition and we we got him the ammunition to to blunt the initial invasion they got more from the biden administration i credit the biden administration for doing that when it came time but the russians suffered but what i've told people is the russians aren't stupid these are very smart people these are technical people they've got engineers and scientists and doctors and you know musicians i mean this is a a culture that's they they got sput to space before we did so so don't count the russians out because they're not dumb and and if you look at russia's wars whether it was sweden or or france with napoleon or or germany with hitler the russians always do poorly at the outset and then because they're willing to throw men and material into the meat grinder in a way that we can't do in the west because the the political constraints aren't on them they can they can go through 100,000 dead young men without losing the presidency that wouldn't work here in the west it wouldn't work in canada or america but it works in russia and they use it to their advantage stalin did it putin's doing it now and and they're between their smarts and their their cruelty to their own people you they're they're going to turn things around and i think they've started to do that that and so it's a you know we're in a very very difficult situation for the ukrainians so now the qu the big question and i look i don't have the answer on this jordan but we need to figure it out is how do we how do we resolve this situation so the ukrainians have a safe and secure country get most of their territory back if not all of it in the war give them security guarantees and the ukrainians are going to be skeptical of those guarantees because they had the security guarant from the us and britain and russia and france and the budapest accords and you know that didn't didn't help him out that was aition for them giving up their nuclear weapons right right which which by the way now is this this whole thing is another you know argument for any country that's thinking about getting a nuke is get a nuke because you know that's the only that's the only real way you can defend yourself against a great power so it makes non non- proliferation tougher and and and and counter pration tougher so the question is how do we get the ukrainians what they need and the the security they need and how do we get the russians to to to back off and pull them away from the chinese and and more integrate them more with the eu and the west and and and try and make them a responsible stakeholder and player well especially because we need much of what they have to offer i mean the the the the world can't do as far as i can tell without russia sl ukraine natural resources on the particularly with regard to fossil fuels but also with regard to well the ammonia that those fossil fuels produce that's a crucial issue but also the amount of edible grain that both of those states produce and of course that's not the their only contribution to the world's economy i mean it's hard to defeat a trading partner upon whose resources you're actually dependent and i mean it's terribly complex as you said i mean ukraine has to be supported because they did give up their nuclear weapons and that's obviously a bad thing if they they give up their weapons and strip themselves naked and now they have no defense that's not a good precedent for operating in the rest of the world i mean i it doesn't look i'm speaking out of turn here but i'm going to anyways because you have to start somewhere i can't imagine the russians ever giving up crimea i think they'd i think they'd go back to the wall to keep crimea with regard to the newer territories they took over over their argument of course is that those territories were primarily occupied by russian speakers who have a primary allegiance to russia and it seems to me that that could be in principle settled by something approximating a referendum in those districts if that was something that could be established under international supervision and then to provide the ukrainians with territorial integrity guarantees and to invite the russians back into the western game looks to me that something like that looks like a pathway forward and maybe i've been accused in my attitudes of being a russia appeaser and i'm certainly not trying to do that i think i'm fairly cognizant of the dangers of the russian enterprise overall i think that makes me more appreciative in some ways of putin than other people might be because my sense is that by historical standards putin is by no means the worst and most reprehensible leader that the russians have ever managed to produce and so you know it might be lovely to consider what the country would be like in his absence but yeah it's a low bar for him that that's for sure it's it's as low a bar as as has ever been established anywhere with the possible exception of the chinese so so anyways i mean those are thoughts about what a what a potential move towards solution might might approximate i mean what do you think of those thoughts and what do you think there is as an alternative i mean the ukraine ukrainians i think are going to become increasing desperate and that also brings up the terrible danger of having the west dragged in you know which is the most likely outcome dragged in by their sleeve into this terrible monstrous machine well look i think a lot of good points and and let me start with the first thing you mentioned about the trading partner look if if russia could get integrated like it was on on its way to into the west selling oil and gas and and agricultural goods and and the agricultural goods are they may not be that expensive may not be considered you know cash crops or or the same as diamonds or platinum or o oil and gas but that agricultural output of ukraine and and russ and southern russia that's a bread basket of for africa for southeast asia for for asia i mean with without that we're we're going to face famine and and it's critical that we get this grain out of ukraine and and a lot the russians to keep trading their grain because there's so many people that will just literally die in in places like you know the congo and egypt and other lebanon that will'll have real trouble if they can't get access to it the other issue in you know canada has something in common with ukraine and russia here is potach which you need for fertilizer and and to grow crops on industrial scale canada russia and ukraine and the only folks that make potach to commercially viable levels they can allow for modern agriculture which has kept the world from going to famine so there there are a lot of important things that you know to to the world in getting this conflict resolved as far as your you know the the kind of the pieces or parts to a compromise or a settlement or an accord that you laid out look i think those are things that people are talking about around the world the ukrainians are smart they're thinking about those issues the russians are thinking about them but i think what's happened is there there hasn't been you you can't get a negotiation if you can't get the two people the two parties to the table and right now ukraine's not ready to come to the table and russia's not ready to come to the table and i think that the the other part of that is we can't do the negotiations for them the west is particularly bad at negotiating for other countries and and you know we're willing to you we we saw this happen with vietnam we saw it happen with certainly with czechoslovakia and and munich when chamberlain talked about these are the far away places of which we know little about so we'll just we'll just give up the sudate land for the checks and they'll be happy with it and we'll we'll end of war and again remember that was incredibly popular in britain when chamberlain came home and said we had peace our time that's now ridiculed that's mocked that wasn't at the time at the time he was met by huge crowds of the airport he came into commons the house of commons and had a standing ovation bar five people churchill and four of his colleagues were the only ones sitting in bipartisan labor and triartisan the time liberal labor and conservative stand inovation for chamberlain so appeasement can be very popular for and we we've got to avoid the temptation as america or the europeans to come in and tell the the ukrainians what they have to do or or negotiate with a deal a separate deal with the russians and impose it on ukraine we've got to have the two parties if we want this to be longlasting and we want to be stable russian ukraine have to do the negotiations we can counsel ukrainians counsel the russians support the ukrainians as we have been you know that's all important and that that those are you know rightful roles for the eu and for america and and canada and our nato allies but we need to make sure that we're not trying to negotiate for someone else because that that won't work and and that'll end that'll end up with another conflict down the road now what what leverage do you think the us has given its provision of arms to ukraine to entice or compel which is more dangerous obviously them to the negotiating table sooner rather than later with with ukraine i mean certainly it's the diplomatic the diplomatic the economic the military support that they're getting that's huge leverage from the west on ukraine but you don't want to use that unrighteously or unjustly i mean you keep in mind ukraine's been invaded the war crimes have been committed in ukraine entire cities have been wiped out and maybe the most pernicious thing that's happened in ukraine and i i know you did a show on o recently and and the the sound of freedom movie a 100,000 ukrainian kids have been taken out of ukraine and sent back to russia now i don't know if this was for sex trafficking or for my my my guess is is the russians were trying to improve their demographic situation because the demography of russia is so bad that they get these kids and they incorporate them into russian families and they end up with 100,000 more russian kids and and families and fathers and that sort of thing down the road so putin knows he's got a problem but but that's think about the parents of these kids who are kidnapped and put with other families i mean this is really dastardly you know stuff that's happening in ukraine so we we've got to support them and we've got to and we don't want to be unrighteous in the pressure that we put on them but if there comes a point where we we believe the russians are willing to come to the table in a good faith manner and and we think we could res resolving the ukraine crisis could help pull russia away from china and and we could get a long- lasting solution then we do go to the ukrainians i think and say look we've been with you from the start we've given you hundreds of billions of dollars in aid we think we evaluate this as being a real opportunity to negotiate we'll be the brokers we're not going to let the chinese be the brokers that's another thing mistake that we made was letting the chinese take the take the lead in peace negotiations that that should be the us and the west job we'll sit down with you we'll be the honest brokers and we'll help try and get a deal done and look i don't know if this administration has the ability to do it for for a whole number of reasons but i think a new administration whether it's president trump or potentially des santis or whoever it is could could come in with a clean slate and and maybe lay the groundw for that sort of a negotiation but it's a it's a heck of a challenge not just not just the ukrainians who are bearing the brunt of it and have paid the biggest price i we spent a lot of money but they paid the biggest price in in human sacrifice for their soldiers sam sailors samar and marines who've been killed by the russians and their civilians who've been killed their children have' been lost but it's it's it's you know it's been a sacrifice for for everybody involved in the conflict including you know third party beneficiaries of grain from russia and ukraine who aren't getting the grain they need to to stay healthy in africa and the middle east and in asia so we we need to figure out how to get this thing to a resolution but i and you you've talked about some of the outlines of what could be a potential solution but right now i i just don't see anything that's going to bring the parties to the table maybe if the ukraine offensive stalls if you know there's a change in government here in the us if there's a change in government in russia which i don't see happening right away you know there there there are variables that could could speed up the process you know that we don't see now but right right now things look pretty bleak right right okay well let's close this i also wanted to talk talk to you about the abraham accords their their current status how you evaluate them overall and how they might be extended maybe you could just start by reminding people who are watching and listening what the abraham accords were and what they signified and how it was that they were successfully negotiated which was somewhat of a miracle and then what you see them having produced and may still be capable of yet producing well look i think they it was one of the great accomplishments of the trump administration but i think it's an american accomplishment i don't think it's just a trump accomplishment or a you know jared kushner mike pompeo or stepen uchin or robert o'brien accomplishment i think it was an accomplishment for our country that we were able to to use america's influence to bring peace and it goes back to you what we talked about earlier in the show about peace through strength a strong america is good not just for america but it's good for the world because it allows for peace to to break out the abraham accords originally started out as a deal between the uae the united arab emirates and israel to bring peace to those two countries both strong partners of the united states both small countries but the small countries have punched way above their weight in international affairs and certainly in the region and every effort to get peace in the middle east up until this time had been styed because the idea was if israel couldn't do a deal with the palestinians they couldn't do a deal with any other arab country so we started out with palestinians and we gave them a proposed a great deal as a the kind of neutral mediator in the the deal we proposed a great deal with the palestinians we had to put a lot of pressure on the israelis to to accept it the palestinians was one diplomat once said never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity miss that opportunity we were able to then have the israelis go to the the uae and say look we gave this awesome deal to the palestinians they turned it down why are we going to why are you going to allow them to to keep us from having a deal keep us from having peace between our two countries and it took took a lot of negotiations with the saudis and and because none of this would have happened without saudi approval they the saudis didn't ultimately sign the deal but had the saudi's been totally opposed to it they it wouldn't have happened we did a lot of negotiations with the uae bahrain and we we i think the parties made a courageous decision because it wasn't just a political decision to make peace it was a really a physical security situation because we look at what's happened to past leaders in the middle east that have made peace sadat or rabine or you know you can end up dead very quickly and so i think it took a lot of courage from the crown prince muhammad b zad from bb netanyahu to the king of bahrain to king muhammad in in morocco who who all entered into this peace deal and you know it was improbable it was improbable from the american side we had to pull together our our whole team and you know the the power that the national security adviser has isn't so much as a line you don't have line authority you can't order people to do do things you can't order ambassadors to do things that's the state department that's the secretary of state you can't order generals to do things that's the you know department defense and the secretary of defense but you can convene people and we brought together a great team of mike pompeo and secretary of state and stepuchin and jared kushner and and our team at the nfc and and others we got that whole team all run on the same in the same direction the same boat which doesn't always happen in the us government unfortunately and and we and we got the president behind it and you know we knew it was a long shot i mean you know we we've been counseled by very senior former officials that said said don't waste your time with middle east peace it's a it's a mirage that everyone every administration goes for no one gets it and you waste all your time and energy you know pursue other priorities but we thought we could get it done and and the parties took big risks to to make peace the the israelis gave up you know settlements annexing settlements in the west bank the the arab countries risk their street rising up or being upset with them they risk potential terrorism from iran or from the palestinians but we got them together and what does it mean i mean number one militarily it's and intelligence wise it's a great alliance to these countries or not quite a military intelligence alliance but a partnership against iran because iran wants like like china and russia iran wants to change how the world operates and they want to place themselves with their their shia ideology their end times ideology at the top of the the region in the middle east dominate the entre middle east and ultimately have great influence all over the world and change the way we live our lives and and this you know this abraham accords took a very strong uae a strong israel and other countries and put them together and helped them stand up to the iranians so so number one militarily it was a and and intelligence wise it was a great deal number two economically you know that we've got the the most dynamic country in the world outside of america outside of silicon valley is tel aviv and jerusalem then israel the the tech sector there both on the hard tech side the the computers and chips the soft side with software but then the egg tech and and figuring out how to make the desert blossom and and grow the food that we need and to manage the water which is you know going to be as important is oil in the future that's all coming out of this little tiny country of israel is just blossoming but they need investment and so the uae has almost an unlimited amount of invest capital to invest they a very wealthy country they've got very wellestablished capital markets you know all they're they're the crossroads of trade and not just for the middle east but for africa and asia so to put the uae and their capital and their trading expertise together with the israelis and their tech was is just a going to create an economic d dynamism that it's not going to be 1 plus 1 equals 2 it's going to be 1 plus 1 equals like five the benefit it had for us as americans is as we've pushed the chinese out of our tech sector with using the cfus process and and other tools the chinese were starting to invest heavily in israel because they were going to you know the chinese are good at mimicking and and and copying but they're not great at innovating and so they were going to go where the the innovation was happening well now what's happened is this arab money this uae money capital is being invested in israeli startups and it's pushing the chinese out of israel which is another great benefit to the united states so you' got this military you got this intelligence you got this economic benefit but the the intangible is peace for peace sake you know we always kind of look at things in my world national security and foreign policy is how do we advance american interests how do we protect ourselves how do we keep ourselves safe you know it's it's kind of a hard analysis but but for human beings every time i see a friend send me an instagram photo of somebody having their bat mitzvah their bar mitzvah in dubai and say isn't this great it's pretty amazing when you think about it that this just happened you know three years ago i mean september of 2020 and you've got all these isra kids wanting to go to their b mitzvah their bar mitzvah in dubai i mean how that that that's that's good for the human spirit it's good for the soul when when you see when you see amadis up on the temple mount in jerusalem going to the alxa mosque or the blue mosque and making the pilgrimage to what they believe is the third most holy site in islam and they can now go fly directly from abu dhabi to to jerusalem to beneran airport and tel aviv and drive up to jerusalem up to the mountains and and and go have their pilgrimage these are things that were just that that were unheard of i mean no one would have even believed that they'd happened you know even when i was a hostage onvoy and and doing work in the region he would have told me that there'd be the peace would be breaking out you know it was it was something that you wouldn't have thought possible and yet it is and so there's a human element and and example to other places in the world that no matter how intractable the problems are and maybe even russia ukraine you know that that you can you know come up with an accord and and i'm proud of the united states that we were the ones that brokered it we didn't there was nothing we gained directly from it we gained indirectly obviously from the security and the economics and the and just the goodwill for and brotherhood of mankind but this was us putting all of our political capital on the line the president taking big risk and putting his political capital on the line you know our you know departments and agencies don't always get along well together playing together to to to put make this push and then you again i want to give credit to the to netanyahu and and muhammad ben zed and king muhammad and you know the others that actually signed the deal and and put their own lives on the line it was really qu quite an accomplishment and and i hope there there's now some talk that saudi that the biden administration is is pushing for the saudis to join the abraham accords i mean put putting all politics aside it would be great if saudi joined the abraham accords that would be tonin and and jake sullivan and president biden i wish him luck because be you know put put inside the politics of how now of course president biden will get the nobel prize for it which president trump didn't get that's okay well he should have got it the team should have got it clearly but but it's it's look it' be good for good for the region good for the world and good for america if saudi joins the abramic cards and if saudi does then you're going to have you know a good chance that kuwait and oman and other countries certainly some of them islamic countries in africa will join and and i think you can have a real you know kind of gold rush for peace here and and change the way that and and then hopefully the palestinians come along right and get on board and and have their own state and they're creative people they're smart people doctors and you know businessmen and and well educated folks literate folks but they've been kept down by these these leaders these corrupt leaders in the palestinian authority or the the islamic extremists in gaza and if they get rid of the corruption and the and the extremism the palestinians would have a chance for a tremendous future in the middle e east and a and a free and prosperous midle middle east so there's a lot of good that can that's you know we did a lot of good but there's a lot more good that can happen and and i you know wish the the biden folks you know luck as they pursue this the next piece which is is clearly saudi arabia look that's a really well it's very nice to be able to end on a high note and and i do think there's tremendous promise in the extension of those accords i mean and and that would be a miracle of peace and a miracle of economic expansion and and man we could definitely use we could definitely use more of that some union among the people of the abrahamic faiths i know they're pushing that hard in the uae and so that that's a hell of a thing to watch for and it's something extraordinarily hopeful so yeah good luck to the biden administration in pursuing that if they can manage it that would be real that would be very forward-looking of them and to and and also you know it require them giving the devil his due and that would be trump in that situation but man the payoff would be so great that you know you'd hope people could lift their eyes above the internet scene conflict u and
