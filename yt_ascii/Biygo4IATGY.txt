i remember hearing that they had cured hepatitis c a biotech analyst on a podcast i listened to was raving about this new drug sophosphere i've been fascinated with it ever since the public largely knows sofas bevere has the one thousand dollar pill and there has been a whole lot of debate about its price a relevant debate but one that i won't touch on here but i have long been curious about the drug itself it is so rare to find the word cure nowadays in modern medicine yet that's what sofas bavir did in this video we're going to talk about how we found the hepatitis c virus and how we cured it but i want to talk about the asian number two patreon first early access members get to see new videos and selected references for them before the release to the public it really does help support the videos and i appreciate every pledge and i recently added an annual subscription option too thanks and on with the show hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver we have known about it since antiquity a sumerian clay tablet from 5000 years ago described an epidemic jaundice that can cause death in just 11 days jaundice is a medical condition with yellowed skin and eyes it is often indicative of liver malfunction however the origins of this epidemic jaundice have long been a mystery the sumerians blamed it on a demon of fevers called aku kazu which i reckon was as good as any other guest people would have for centuries thereafter the greeks and romans also reported outbreaks of epidemic jaundice military doctors saw thousands of such cases during their campaigns causing them to link it to war the american civil war alone suffered 40 to 50 000 such cases in'85 a doctor named lerman noticed a funny pattern with these jaundice outbreaks they occurred about one to seven months after victims received their smallpox vaccine he blamed the vaccine itself human lymph within it perhaps but it was not until 1942 when 56 000 members of the u.s navy caught hepatitis from contaminated doses of yellow fever vaccine that doctors confirmed that an infectious agent was going around doctors split the disease into two distinct categories first an epidemic version with a short incubation period it spread through fecal or oral means and caused an acute dangerous illness that can be fatal second a serum version with a long incubation period it spreads through needles or sexual contact and can end in chronic infection liver failure or even cancer serum by the way is a term describing the fluid that remains after you take out all the cells and clotting factors out of blood i'm going to be using this word a lot anyway the former affliction was called hepatitis a and the latter hepatitis b in 1963 a geneticist at the national institutes of health named barrack bloomberg noticed a strange reaction he had mixed the serums of a hemophiliac and an australian aboriginal in a gel yielding a red stain he initially called it the australia antigen and had no idea of its nature a few years later however he came to associate this antigen with hepatitis b thanks to a technician in his lab who got sick with the disease and tested herself for the antigen the hbs antigen as it is now called there's a harvard joke in here but i can't find it is a structural component of the virus this discovery helped make the first hepatitis b vaccine and one blumberg a share of the nobel prize in 1976. the use of serums to locate this otherwise difficult to isolate virus inspired new efforts to find the pathogen for hepatitis a finally in october 1973 a team of three scientists at the nih stephen feinstone albert capuchin and robert purcell identified the virus in a stool sample from a jaundiced volunteer the results were published in science a few weeks later hepatitis a tests were washed out shortly thereafter by about 1974 tests for both hepatitis a and b entered the market but doctors soon realized that something was wrong despite available screening techniques for hep a and b the number of post-transfusion cases of hepatitis decreased by just 20 to 25 percent so there had to be a third form of post-transfusion hepatitis circulating around and it must be quite common they called it non-a non-b they called it that at the time because it was believed that the agent would be quickly found but the search dragged on for some 15 years as the virus evaded all attempts to find it this search got more urgent as time went on early on doctors felt that the disease was quite minor this was because it did not have a high mortality rate during the viruses acute symptoms phase like with a or b it might even be asymptomatic however people found out later on that this virus worked more nefariously the hepatitis it caused was chronic meaning that it persisted over time while also being responsible for unpleasant things like end-stage liver failure and cancer the problem with non-a non-b virus was that it did not have a defined antigen to find it that was how we found the b virus so that method was out of the window additionally it did not have a distinct look like with the hepatitis a virus that virus basically jumped out at finestone as soon as he looked at it through the electron microscope and thirdly the virus did not grow outside of the body such a method would be used to identify the aids virus hiv so we can't see it can't detect its traces and cannot grow it in isolation yet despite this we can infer things about the virus based on its characteristics we know that it is about 40 to 60 nanometers large and that it can be inactivated with chloroform or heat has the search dragged on new blood screenings were instituted donors would be screened for elevated levels of the serum amino transferase alanine trans ammonase or alt such high levels indicated liver damage or disease this screening did a good enough job in reducing the numbers of post-transfusion hepatitis cases but the virus itself still remained out of reach even without an identified virus clinicians looked for treatment options using interferon had some good results with hepatitis b interferon is the name for a group of proteins released by human cells whenever they detect the presence of a virus the way interferon works is by inducing the liver cells to activate their antiviral responses it's been used before for cancers and other viral infections with good effects a pilot study published in 1986 used regular infusions of interferon with suspected non-a non-b hepatitis cases studies of their liver tissue indicated chronic hepatitis furthermore their alt were elevated indicating liver damage or disease the study found improvements over a therapy session of about 12 months interferon infusions can bring alt serum levels down to normal with minimal relapses this established interferon has the first workable treatment for non-a non-b hepatitis in 1982 a microbiologist named dr michael hooten joined a private company in california called chiron there he started working on finding the non-a non-b virus he and his team went through a series of methods to go about it first they built up a library of dna strands created by rna this type of dna is known as copy or complementary dna or c dna and came from patients or chimps known to be infected with non-a non-b hepatitis they then screened the cdna against the genetic profiles of known virus types like flava viruses toga viruses and hepa dna viruses this is kind of like sifting through random shells in the sand in an attempt to find a certain clam you've never seen before they screened millions of clones but failed despite many years of effort the team also tried conventional methods like electron microscopy or cell culture growth none of this worked over time scientists have tried immunofluorescence immunoelectrophoresis radio immunoassays enzyme immunoassays and so on none of it worked okay so what follows is rather difficult and i'm going to try my best here but forgive me for any errors the method the chiron team tried next in late 1985 is known as immunoscreening simply put this is where you use antibodies to try to identify a particular antigen here you are relying on the human body's ability to create an antibody to capably match up to a chemical marker on the virus chiron's esteemed science panel advice against this approach for two reasons first it does not always work even when you have a very good matching antibody and two non-a non-b hepatitis is a chronic disease which implies that the virus causing it is very good at evading the human immune system so the antibodies probably aren't that good nevertheless dr hooten and his team plunged on they took liver samples from a particularly infectious chimpanzee and created a library of cdna after that they inserted the cdna into a virus infected bacteria forcing it to create many clones of the proteins those cdna fragments are encoded for then on the other side they took serum from a patient with an ongoing very severe case of non-a non-b hepatitis they were basically assuming that this patient's antibodies would be particularly strong putin and his team screened about a million clone proteins testing them against the antibodies team member queen lim cho a singaporean found five positive clones five proteins that the patient's antibodies reacted with two were from the virus used to create the protein fragments two more were proteins from the chimpanzee genome this left a single protein created by a small fragment of about 1 500 base pairs large which dr chu had labeled 511 511 was neither human nor chimp it was created from rna only found in samples with non-a non-b hepatitis it encodes proteins only found in samples with non-a non-b hepatitis from this single fragment they were able to find the rest of the virus's genome with that scientists were able to create a working antibody test which cracked the case wide open the long hidden hepatitis c virus had been found the hepatitis c virus is small about 65 nanometers wide and belongs to the flavavirus family it is made up of a single strand of rna about 9600 bases surrounded by an envelope of proteins the virus is often confused with lipid particles which carry cholesterol in the bloodstream this confusion is one of two reasons why the virus is so good at evading the immune system the other reason is that humans carry only a very small load of this virus this is partly why only 20 percent of the hepatitis c infected people actually show symptoms the virus interacts with proteins on a commonly found liver cell called a hepatocyte it attaches and then uses an acid to fuse its membranes with that of the cell allowing the virus to dump its rna load into the hepatocyte once inside the rna goes about furiously creating virus components structural proteins for its protective envelope as well as the stuff inside the virus relies on the cell to do the hard work using its non-structural proteins to hijack the cell's mechanisms one such class of proteins called the ns proteins is particularly important five of them are interesting ns3 4a and s4b ns5a and ns5b they help the virus replicate for instance an s5a and ns5b help replicate the rna ns5b in particular seems to have multiple functions which includes assembling the baby viruses these proteins are absolutely necessary to viral replication remember this bit it will come in handy a little later after enough virus components have been made the virus then uses another rna strand inside the liver cell to package these components into baby viruses the complexity of this process might explain why the virus evaded detection for so long the virus also mutates a lot with differences of up to 33 percent between variants a function of the error-prone multiplication techniques of an rna virus today the hepatitis c virus infects some 130 to'0 million people worldwide or two to three percent of the world population we see it most often in the middle east and africa particularly egypt or cameroon in asia it exists in high proportions in pakistan and taiwan in the united states there are about 3 million people living with hepatitis c most of them caught it before we discovered the virus the primary but not only way the virus gets around is through the use of contaminated needles in the united states about 23 percent of new infections and 33 percent of deaths come from people who regularly inject drugs for about 75 to 85 percent of people the virus won't go away unless you treat it about 20 percent of the infected will develop liver cirrhosis after 10 to 15 years with the virus this often requires a liver transplant an unpleasant thing and those infected are 20 times more likely to get liver cancer hepatitis c alone is the fastest rising cause of cancer deaths in the united states so in conclusion this virus sucks so what do we do to get rid of it what do we mean by cure when we say cure that means we seek to eradicate the virus achieved as by having an undetectable viral load about 12 and 24 weeks after the end of the treatment 99 of the people in the latter situation will be virus free five years later we can consider them effectively cured whatever that might mean as we mentioned earlier the first treatments initiated in 1986 before we even knew what the virus was used interferon and it worked but with big caveats first it only worked less than 40 percent of the time and second there were unpleasant side effects in 1998 doctors added ribavirin to the interferon ribavarin is an antiviral medicine used for hemorrhagic fever viruses like lassa and marburg this dual therapy was found to have helped cure 40 of the patients when interferon alone cured none of them with them cure rates get as high as 80 but average more around 50 percent depending on the virus's genetic strain regardless there were adverse safety effects to the interferon therapy this includes rash anemia and severe infections for those with a more advanced form of the disease there was a 40 chance of this happening direct acting antivirals or daa are 10 viruses what antibiotics are two bacterial alexander fleming discovered penicillin when he looked into mold a daa for the hepatitis c virus would be a little harder to come by to defeat the bug we must understand the bug but at the start it was hard to do because we could not grow the bug in cell cultures and the only animal it infected was the chimpanzee which presented logistical and ethical concerns these barriers would not be overcome until about 2001 when new cell cultures and mutant mice were introduced but we did know what proteins the viruses rna encoded for and scientists knew about the recent enormous success of protease inhibitors for hiv a protease helps a virus cut down its big proteins into smaller more useful ones kind of like a knife for cutting up big breadsticks into smaller bread rolls the protease inhibitor works by messing with these proteuses the hepatitis c viruses rna strand represents a single continuous sequence resulting in a single big protein a polyprotein this polyprotein is useless by itself so it needs to be cut up by proteuses thus why scientists felt that protease inhibitors might work they zeroed in on the ns3 4a protease the virus does five cuts in the polyprotein the ns34a protease is the knife responsible for four of those five cuts disabling this protease brought us our first hepatitis c daas boseprovere and teleprivier the two were approved for use in may 2011. their cure rate was 65 to 75 percent superior to the then existing treatments however there were big caveats most hepatitis c patients also had hiv and the drug caused side effects in those people the second is viral resistance the virus already has mutations that weaken the drug's effectiveness in some areas as much as 45 percent of the population have this resistance nevertheless went to laprivier or in sevac as it would be set up as hit the market the drug generated 1.6 billion dollars in revenue in its first year a revolutionary drug for a time early on scientists realized how important that protein ns5b was to the virus's replication so they developed and tested several drugs to prevent the protein from performing its functions several of these mersa tapatine vx135 and so on were found to be ineffective but one hit it out of the park was originally developed by pharmacet in 2010 originally called psi 7977 the drug was named after the company's study group leader michael sophia the company had a drug called psi 6130 which worked well in the lab but did poorly in the body because it was not absorbed well when taken orally to deal with this issue that created another chemical that turns into the psi 6130 active ingredient once processed by the liver once there it binds to an essential part of the ns5b protein when the virus rna tries to replicate the bound ns5b terminates the chain rapidly disabling the virus before any mutants can be produced thus the drug is seen has been less vulnerable to viral resistance in cell lines the drug was seen to be effective against the various genotypes of the virus even at low doses without toxicity thus the drug was taken into trials at an earth-shaking clinical study called electron sophosphobir this name is impossible to pronounce showed 100 effectiveness incurring hepatitis c when combined with ribavirin with good tolerance and low resistance the pharmaceut people had turned the concept into a reality we have a cure in 2011 the american drug company gilead sciences purchased pharmaceut for 11 billion dollars people saw it as a risky bet the fda hadn't approved the drug yet and gilead was paying a third of its entire market value but it all paid off when the fda gave its unanimous and accelerated approval in december 2013 has a potential breakthrough drug for serious or life-threatening conditions sivaldi as it was called became the fastest selling drug launch at the time analysts felt the drug needed to make four billion dollars in annual sales to pay for the investment the drug generated 10 billion dollars in 2014 alone 12.5 billion when combined with its cohort harvoni which combines sofas of a beer with another drug sales peaked in 2015. it worked so well that instavex manufacturer pulled it from the market a sad end to a great drug savaldi and harvoni sales have since then declined as people got cured and controversy developed over the drugs price in 2020 michael hooten harvey alter and charles rice received a nobel prize for their work in the discovery of the hepatitis c virus they had all contributed to the virus's discovery dr queen lim chu helped find the original virus but sadly did not share in the award upon reading about the story hong kong tycoon lee kashing donated to him a monetary sum in some ways the virus is cured but it is not exactly cured if you know what i mean there are still millions of people around the world living with hepatitis c do we just go and cure them all it would be nice to have drugs like sofasa beer at a cheaper price but ultimately eradication doesn't happen without a vaccine this part of the solution remains elusive work on this horrible disease continues and i hope to write someday about a vaccine in the coming years alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
