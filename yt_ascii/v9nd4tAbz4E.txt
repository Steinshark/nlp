samsung is no stranger to cheating at benchmarks they've been doing it for years and they're not the only ones the question i have this time is why their new flagship s95btv checks just about every flippin box 4k 120 hertz variable refresh rate over a thousand nits peak brightness and it's got the best color performance of any display i've ever seen ever and then samsung had to go and put this brown stain on their glorious victory by getting caught juicing it's a ridiculous cell phone almost as ridiculous as this segway to our sponsor any cubic the photon m3 air pure and water washable resin is an affordable fantastic entry level combo to explore resin 3d printing you can print detailed miniatures right out of the box learn more at the link below [music] my first hands-on with samsung's qd oled or quantum dot oled display technology was with alienware's aw 3423dw and i said what are the tvs with this coming and here it is in all its glory but while i'd like to start by saying it combines the amazing peak brightness of quantum dot with the perfect blacks of oled with no apparent burn in downside instead i have to address the scandal first vincent from hdtvtest great channel by the way discovered that while the s95b seems color accurate when reviewing it in a standard sized test pattern window if you adjust it to something non-standard the tv outputs a brighter image than expected or i don't know maybe it's just his unit no no it's not ours came off the shelf from the local best buy it was not provided by samsung and when we compared our 2 window tests to our previous ones at 10 you can see right here the eotf curve isn't followed nearly as closely and we get major luminance errors when testing in hdr this isn't what the content creator intended and it shouldn't be happening but it also doesn't mean that the image looks like garbage the color accuracy enthusiasts in our office who wandered by during testing noted that it does look a little too vibrant when watching hdr content but still walked away saying it looked amazing even if they felt like something was ever so slightly off as for sdr it's quite accurate in the standard 10 window netting us a delta e average of 2.7 in filmmaker mode but it gets even better samsung has a little trick up their sleeve if you have an iphone or a newer samsung phone there's a diy calibration option hidden away in the menus so we paired a galaxy s21 using the app and followed the instructions netting us an average delta e of just 1.7 in standard dynamic range with our reds and purple standing out as our problem colors and as for hdr we went from 10.3 with luminance errors down to 7.7 we have no idea how it's getting an accurate enough reading to then calibrate the display using it but it works at least in standard tests let's go take a look at how pretty it is shall we before i can do that i've been tasked with the apparent challenge of getting it out of game mode it enters this mode automatically and then if you're gonna create an error message that says hey here's what you need to do to do this thing you're trying to do right now why not just have a button that says do that oh oh there's a game sound mode why do i have to go to the quick setting isn't this the quick settings why is there a game mode submit no no no holding right on the d-pad brings it up why would that oh my god so it tells me to go to the settings menu that i'm already in to change the thing i'm trying to change i'm going to throw this thing through the screen oh my god it previews with audio yeah it previews with freaking audio though well you've got plenty of time to see it because it's going to play forever netflix does that too a lot of things pretty much this is the freaking home menu of my tv i know maybe you wanna hear it a little bit no i don't wanna hear it a little bit no i want to use the menu of my tv speakers are good though i guess we can talk about io it's got four hdmi 2.1 ports that's really nice to see one has e-arc it's got an optical port two usb media ports wi-fi five it has ethernet but this guy didn't bother to test how fast it goes the internet didn't work in the bedroom set you complain the remote sucks but honestly it's not really any worse than like the shield remote yeah but i don't think the shield remotes any good solar charging usb c2 on the back yeah it seems fine i mean it's the interface that sucks why is it that i keep being dropped back into shadow of the tomb raider here i'm trying to use the menu so my main problem is that there's no input source button oh that's so so try to change source manually look for it try to find it you already missed it oh did i know all settings you're close it's connected devices shut this took me way too long to find and i don't understand why it's here instead of just like on the side when you bring up the menu like why isn't there just like input one and put two input three or whatever that is so stupid yeah and it keeps blanking i know it does that too now that there's like a pc that's got a game running i think it's because there's something active on the signal it's trying to pull you back into that active channel but i'm doing things i know now i know i know i think once we play contact on the shield it'll be like okay we're good i can see why they didn't send us a review sample we go to the shield connected devices where is it how is it why is mark strong in like everything i've looked at lately i don't know we came back after the weekend and found out samsung pushed a firmware update on monday that fixes the window size issue as you can see it's still not quite perfect but it's significantly better than what we saw before they don't get any kudos for this though because this happened only after they got caught and it never should have been sent to stores like this in the first place so if you have an s95b and you want to get the latest updates make sure you download the firmware from their site and install it using a usb flash drive auto update was no help for us and kept telling us that 1204 was the latest and greatest update available thanks samsung and also thanks samsung this is like a really good fire scene yeah yeah around here is fine that's one of the things that qdo led really excels at is extremely vibrant yellows yellow and red a big part of the reason for it is that unlike traditional oleds it doesn't have a white subpixel so it doesn't need that to boost to max brightness it can actually achieve its maximum brightness with individual colors wow that fire looks fiery yeah this is the big one you can really feel the cold there's a lot of white on screen and it's not dimming or anything not even a little the grass is super green still and you've still got these bright explosion flashes and it looks like you can see every grain of dust and stuff in each of the clouds too and of course you get the absolutely perfect blacks in the bar so you don't have any kind of distracting glow or anything that was one of the things james really brought up when he went down to see the panel tech early was that metal looks richer and more metal yeah like look at the shine on that button on the left of his coat yeah you see the reflection on all of the surfaces i mean even in his eyes too yeah okay check out encanto check it on kanto they've got one scene with some fireworks it's nuts wow this looks good the colors hey wow like the bright highlights are just incredible incredible wow that's pretty much it i just want to see the fireworks it's not just bright i know it's the contrast it's the it's the richness yeah you don't think it's brown until you see this and then it's like yellow shining instead of looking like it's yellow wow like that firework goes off and you're like whoa yeah okay it doesn't have dolby vision but check out the dolby vision demo it doesn't have dolby vision no it's the one it's got hdr 10 plus it's got hdr 10 plus samsung what are you what are you doing basically perfect perfect if you can see the tv you are getting the full experience now you don't mind sitting on the side of the room well i'm still going to be centered wow sure but you don't feel bad but i don't feel as bad yet crank up to crank up the noise the speakers are actually really good on this tv man that looks good i know the fire what the sound even the sound it's not bad for tv speakers with no sound bar and it's still gonna work with a sound bar if you get it with all the other speakers in the tv as long as it's q symphonic compatible right and that's something that sony's also been pushing with their their center channel tvs it actually works really well like juicing up your center like that is really important to enjoying anything with dialogue which is like everything the major complaint that people have been complaining about in tv and movies for the last like 15 years yeah i can't hear what they're saying in the quiet scenes i have to and i have to turn it down when there's something big happening did i catch myself falling for best buy vivid effect during those fireworks i think you kind of did because it did because like even though we tested it in a 10 window and it looked great like really accurate yeah when we did it again in a two percent window it's obviously pretty wrong like you see it clearly and this is not a 10 window or a 2 window it's a full screen so i don't know is it okay to just enjoy those boosted highlights when everything else looks so good i don't mind personally i think it looks really good when you put it up next to a direct like actual mastering monitor yeah you can see the difference and it's kind of like okay sure i'd probably pick that one but if i walked into a store and i saw this playing content you'd be like wow wow that's amazing so is what samsung's doing shady absolutely but it still looks amazing just like our new screwdriver t-shirt get yours today while you wait for the real screwdriver to come out soon i promise for real this time now let's pivot to gaming i mean who needs movies when you've got unskippable cutscenes right the panel does up to 4k 120hz with support for variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode and the results are well we're waiting for the lab to figure out a better way to run pursuit tests on oleds but let me say this subjectively the ufo looks shockingly crisp and when it comes to click to photon latency we're getting about' milliseconds which is darn good we've even seen reports of the panel being able to be overclocked to 144 hertz it was vincent right yeah tv test damn wow that saturation though i know oh so that's one problem is in game mode we're stuck between two different picture options it's like content and entertainment or something like that they call it two different things so we we can't get a calibrated filmmaker mode or even the custom like calibrated movie mode that we get using the phone app this is the kind of upgrade that you make where it makes all your old content new again yeah you're gonna go back and play your old favorites again because you've never seen them like this you know what i mean i had just let myself accept that red light meant just brown a red cast on everything around me this looks lit in red wow keep going it gets better but the shooting feels good right like everything's responsive because it's 120 hertz 100 variable refresh rate 500 super like automatic low latency mode whoa are you seeing this brandon of course you are because of the viewing angles man why wouldn't we just use a tv like this for like editing maybe this becomes our new mainstay living room tv huh i feel like for lg it's the equivalent of overclocking your last gen processor to try and compete with your competitor's new gen 1 though yeah sony's actually not just staying 100 siloed these days they're actually using the like image and sound expertise they have across their company to make like their products better screen ratio 16 by nine it doesn't look like it right now i don't know what's going on right now game settings and then you see how it pulls up this mode even though we're already in the game settings mode no i know so this is why i don't like auto can we solve the more pressing issue which is that our yeah i don't know why i did that i think it's a thing in here okay it was a tomb raider thing not the tv oh nelly that it's doing it that is smooth that is responsive and look at those mouse cursors each one is a discrete distinct it looks like a cr freaking t that's my testing every time i get a new monitor is i look at the cursors when you do a circle there's no trail yeah but even here look at like the bright flashlight against like the dark rocks or whatever blinding yeah i want to turn it off yeah look how bright that light is though i know it's and look at how big wow and that's like a huge portion of the screen yeah and it doesn't dim right like it's like it's insane that is mind-blowing no pure oled is gonna do that well that was a useful demo anyway just to see that flashlight sear my eyes did you notice any weird dimming like where it'll just periodically dim or brighten like the lgo lids no but i've got that turned off you can turn it off on this and i haven't seen it happen since then because that's a that's a thing i can't deal with that i hate watching your monitor during script review because it just dims constantly it can apparently be fixed with like a hidden menu but lg has it hidden away because of the risk of burning but if it's not a risk because as the oled pixels fade they should fade fairly evenly since the color is handled by the quantum dot layer then samsung doesn't have to do that it's very impressive and i cannot wait to see the same panel with a processor from sony in the new bravia xra95k i think that's the one that's going to end up in my family room at my new house get subscribed by the way so you don't miss it i'm not taking any sponsorships for that spot because that's a really important tv watching spot for me so it's going to come down to the 65 inch heavyweight champion and there's more than just two contenders lg has been hard at work improving their gen 2 oled panels we've got a g2 on the way as well of course we haven't really talked about price yet while last gen oled is becoming more affordable all of the tvs that i just mentioned are not and the cheapest option currently is actually the one we're looking at today the s95b at 3 000 us dollars that's a lot in a world where you can go to the local best buy and pick up a 65 inch tv for like 500 bucks but it's a value compared to the a 95k and still a couple hundred dollars cheaper than the g2 another major hurdle to overcome with this latest generation is the lack of size options while lg's oleds are coming out in both larger and smaller models sony and samsung are both stuck with just 55 inch and 65 inch for the time being as they perfect the qd oled manufacturing process says samsung not sony in this case we're sure to see more size options but for now you might end up having no choice but to stick with lg since size does matter oh there's more good news though everyone last year's oleds they're still top notch and the prices are finally coming down so you can save a buck now and if you can wait a little longer for this to be last gen wow are you ever in for something special at hopefully a more affordable price you know what else is affordable waiting to hear about our sponsor ting mobile tired of paying for some ting and getting noting in return ting mobile is a low-cost carrier with the perfect plan for whatever your needs might be they offer nationwide lte and 5g coverage in the us as well as award-winning support and all of their plans offer unlimited talk and text with five gigs of data for 25 a month or 12 gigs of data for a measly 10 extra bucks at 35 a month if you're still hungry for more 45 a month gets you unlimited data which is a lot of bits and bytes and if you're not a big data user then worry not their flex plans start at ten dollars a month with just five dollars extra per gigabyte used there's a reason that consumer reports named ting mobile their number one carrier in the us so check them
