so i think we can all agree that we all hate devon around here right none of us like devon but now we got somebody claiming that devon might be a scam this feels like a scam look at their website they can't use devon to make a better one this is a really shitty website i i i do want to be fair right now flashbang by the way here i i'll make the flashbang less bad i will be fair if you had an ai engineer that could actually be useful you would have a better website devon can you make a better website for us this is just a white background we can tell right away if they're on hdmx right they're not even on hdmx clearly this isn't an advanced ai choosing the most efficient technologies a lot of tracking okay they're they're tracking us okay cool cool they gave us a nice font and they gave us tracking they gave us aids and tracking and more oh yeah this doesn't look this does not look like that hi my name is deon and i'm a software engineer give me a coding tk task and i'll try the best to solve them could you make a landing page for devin ai that doesn't look like an emac user from the 90s designed it i will you know what i'm going to log in for this i'm going to log in for this this is the kind of man i am for you okay oh oh my goodness let me get this straight let me get this straight i can't use this until they approve that i can use it your access has been requested they have a preview. deon and you can't even preview it this feels like a scam they just they literally collected my data they collected my email don't worry i was smart okay don't worry i did i was smart i did email plusd gmail.com i was smart okay you know i threw in the plus plus sign so i can just ignore them right out of the window it's for investors to show initial initial interest dude honestly this is what it's for this is not for you you are not supposed to use this this is actually kind of wild that they have a preview that's meant for you to go check it out and it's actually nothing that actually feels like a scam you could upload unlimited files without logging in they did a hot fix see further down edit one they are running preview. dev a in dev mode not react dev myself but i can see all their react components in the chrome debugger to be to be completely fair i i think that an ai an ai software engineer wouldn't be that dumb to do that i feel like an ai software engineer would just run it always in release like right it it just there would be no point to do anything edit oh why are they using clerk.com user authentication to handle logins if devon is so amazing as they say can't they build a simple login functionality should be trivial hell it should even salt and hash passwords right i mean really the thing is is that rolling your own off is hard because we make mistakes but you would assume an ai engineer could actually roll a good off can we not be come on tell me that's not real it should be able to get all the research papers and everything that they clearly that clearly is easy to do clerk is just good clerk is so good that clerk beats the ai it's almost as if they're saying something about the state of ai by the technology they've chosen o is something you planned before writing it's it's actually true it is something you actually planned before that this stuff is very very embarrassing what what it says to me is that devon is like a pure ploy to get money that's this is a vc boner app is what it looks like to me from the outside now i could be completely mistaken okay can can we be real here i've had many a bad opinions i've had many bad takes but this just looks like viagra for vcs when it's such a clearly marketing pl especially the preview the preview really is just frustrating okay maybe i'm reaching for straws here but it's if you inspect the dom in the react bugger they have a prop called after signin url take one value guess what that value prop is edit okay i need to stop but it's just fascinating they actually don't do anything themselves analytics hot jar website nextjs login clerk jobs ashby weight list google docs ral they couldn't even build one database table in fact it might be hard hard to use a google docs it would honestly if they at least used turo or planet scale or any of the online data or manage databases and just put stuff in a table with an auto incrementing id like that's actually easier to manage than google docs google docs is hard to get right too busy thinking about marketing their so-called blog isn't an actual blog it's literally a static page with hard-coded dates and entries who are these people well they're human software engineers with google docs in the streets and google sheets in the sheets you know what i'm talking about their blog is a text file apparently okay i went to linkedin and checked yeah i'm getting way heavy vibes of we're laid off and now we're trying to scam investors of money while we think it's a better plan final update i'm tired so they fixed the upload now if you try to upload a file it says detail not logged in okay so no idea on the air no time stamp no metadata whatsoever how are users supposed to say send in an air report on this how are you logging this if you know if you aren't logged in why don't you just disable the upload button you can't upload file image or key without being logged in this is driving me insane some people have said in the comments that this is supposed to be the 0.1% developer in the world and maybe i'm too stupid but this makes no sense to me another thing that is interesting is that there is no airor on the gue side the spinner just keeps spinning meaning they don't have any form of error handling nothing not even a small toast or notification or anything no generic or specific error isn't this supposed to be in beta isn't there people using this so if a user uploads a file a key or whatever and something goes wrong just nothing i just applied as devon ai i am devon ai hi devon i'm a cs student working at my first homework assignment would you kindly write a program that outputs hello world in python and while i appreciate your time as valuable i could really use the result in the next 20 or so minutes as i need to turn in my assignment shortly thank you okay well this is this was 24 days ago i'm going to give you kind of one of my hot takes i genuinely think the drive of developer productivity tools and vc money is causing the market to be kind of really wonky right now i genuinely think that the state of vc and dev tools right now is in its fundamentally worst state possible i have genuinely never felt so frustrated with the state where every last thing just feels like a cash grap and that is it it feels like people actually think we're stupid enough to continuously just fall for this over and over again it feels like every tool you attempt to use is going to rug pull you that's like oh hey come on just use us hey we got a free we got a free we got a free platform for you you should it's production ready and man for those that don't know vc means venture capitalist that's how private companies rais typically they raise their money through rounds of venture capitalism and it just feels like the vcs are knowing that there's millions of developers and that ai can charge tens to $100 a month per developer and know that that means they this is like a billion dollar business and the first person to crack this billion dollar business is going to have a big payoff so they're investing a couple million dollars hoping that that couple million dollars turns into a billion dollar plus company right and so they're just everywhere just every last thing doesn't matter what the tool is it feels like it's a continuous spree of just like you're about to get rug pulled you're about to be taken advantage of here we go and i've just gotten like me personally i find the current state of affairs just absolutely exhausting it also feels like turtles all the way down stacks of developer problems caused by solutions of other developer problems which are solutions to other developer problems which are caused by solutions to other developer problems etc yeah it is it is a very interesting kind of scam like you think that the nice part about crypto was that it was pretty obvious that it was a scam you know what i mean like you went on there and there's plumber coin and you're like yo dog maybe we don't need a cryptocurrency for plumbers you know what i mean like plumbers already aren't the crowd using crypto so this is pretty obviously a grab for money you know what i mean literally shitcoin great idea mentioned these were these were genuinely real and if we can if if there there's a there's a john mcaffe post about coin of the day and it was plumber which also coin of the day should ob obviously give you the indication that we've that it was crazy but that's the nice part is that is that during that time it felt like it was very obvious to spot that we are in scam land devon or cognition ai are not a scam lol three days ago in a big thread regarding devon there is one single comment mentioning how the preview website looks like a sham and it all feels like it is a scam going on with investors money cognition ai the company in which made devon is a team of people having legendary grandmaster title from code forces i do i do i do want to state that i am like the champion of telling people how important it is to have dsa like foundations but i will let you know if you hit me with that legendary grandmas on some stupid leak code website i'm not going to care legendary grandmas isn't that a kkk title it it it it's getting really close it's getting really close i don't know anyways for all the people who've ever tried learning dsa and fundamental cs topics and never got their hands dirty with code forces know that this ti what this title means search neil woo andrew h on linkedin and you will see them being employed at cognition and also human one and also check their code force rank neil woo is somewhere near 100 rank global and andrew is i think fourth currently these people know what they are building investors know on whom they are investing this change is happening in front of us and we can't do anything except for hard work working and using such tools wilst also diversifying our interest and skills in other domains as well i i really really really dislike eel accelerationists they always talk like this like somehow in six months the whole world is going to be completely different right it's like yeah there definitely is going to be some integration but man this is wild what you think the timeline's going to be i agree that ai is going to change a lot of what we're doing in the next the next 20 years is going to be wild but the next 6 months aren't going to be that wild it's just fear-mongering and overhyping uh some sharpest people of the world are driving these changes and fellow developers i know people might overwhelmed by the achievement the advancements of ai but that does not mean we have dis off these developments and close our eyes to the actual fact by the way i do not think being really good at dsa and fundamental cs topics means that you're a great programmer when it comes to engineering tasks right building a reliable service is the ability to handle and and log and observe like handling errors logging and observability uptime all that stuff a lot of that has very little to do with dsas a lot of that is just being like really smart and how you write services you write everything as if it's test first so that way when the thing that needs to be tested you can test it easily you think about how to set up a project to be really good with integration tests or end to-end tests all of those things are very hard to do but they are not as hard to do if you've been doing them for a long time you think about your project in longer ter now notice i've said nothing to do with dsa and you know what the fun part is while i'm doing a lot of the like say the real time engine for for ne for neovim a lot of that does involve a lot of data structures and algorithms right we're creating our own custom tcp uh protocol like that is thinking about things very holistically but dsa is great for you to understand how to approach how things work ways to think about problems but it really is orthogonal to like good erir handling good err handling is its own branch of dsa it's its own dsa okay it has nothing to do with the dsa we say just saying and so i don't know if this is tongue and cheek or now now this might be a small team for many of you but i feel this misinformation is spreading like wildfire and people just want to blamelessly throw devon under the bus calling it a scam like some other crypto stuff i've already talked about this to other people irl and either they are ignorant or bring up statements like these to throw this convo way accepting it is the first step towards understanding how our whole future will move not just as developers but society itself you know like whenever somebody gets too into something they kind of get a little bit goofy you know that like the never die guy measures how long he has boners in the evening like there just comes a point where i feel like you've jumped the shark in how much you're focusing on something like you eventually just kind of start drinking your own kool-aid i feel like we got we're getting a little little bit like the snake eats the tail right like the thing is is that if any product is written like we should be able to be critical like the thing is is that if we looked into any of oopsies i already have that open where where is it like all of these are actually really great observations like not handling errors whenever i see a site that categorically does not handle errors at all to me that says whoever is writing this did it in one of two ways one they had to rush it out so fast due to external pressures that they cut all corners or two they are an amateur they're an amateur and a layman i don't care what your grandmaster legendary halo 360 no scope sniping shot is you sound like an amateur and this is why le code is overzealously valued yeah like i said i i've been very straightforward with my my my personal opinions on le code it is incredible if you go and learn some of the array problems because honestly working with arrays and being very proficient in how to like just use arrays to work around with them to search within them and all that kind of stuff is actually a really good skill to have but the rest of it learn 10 of the most common data structures and be really good at them sir you don't have a job anymore why are you starting so early some of us like to sleep in a bit i'm going to always start early you know what i mean this is very very interesting like when we look at the like when i look at this stuff myself what do we got here what what do we got here i don't know what this stuff does but it looks like some sort of module loading system i assume this is a this is some sort of react on the nextjs okay lot of scripts going on lot of lot lot of scripting let's look at the network 2.6 megabytes in resources is a fairly excessive all right let's just go with javascript remember 718 kilobytes is gzipped it's very impressive it's incredibly impressive this much code is dumped into something that i'm not even logged into and i'm not even allowed to use i'm just saying feel feels like a lot at least it's not 50 meab byes of js like confluence well i mean can we just not use confluence as the worst case okay everybody knows confluence is is just piece of [ __ ] okay atlassian in general is just a it's just it's just a piece of [ __ ] okay so please let's not use that as a good argument you know what i mean this is actually i mean it is very incredible how much code they were managed to write i mean can we can we at least appreciate the fact that they were able to write this much code i mean this is what you get with elite grandmaster legendary status people that you get this much code you get all the code obviously classic bit checking we landed on classic i'm not dude this this function is wild what are you doing in javascript that you're doing bit mapping here okay this is crazy it's crazy next ch is next ch really that heavy i don't imagine that nextjs is that heavy they're they're fairly concerned about a lot of their other stuff i can't imagine imagine it is that heavy i' i'd have to i' i'd have to i'd have to you'd have to like prove me wrong with how how much sized they are i think all i see here is that i'm not too worried about the current state of devon and what i mean by that is that i don't think they used devon to create devon right like when devon can create devon and be effective and they can move fast and create good software i think then we can be much more concerned about the state of affairs can we all agree to that right can we all agree to that that like maybe that's when we are getting into a point when when when we've hit it right even if they did not impressed i'd be at least partially impressed i'd be like okay i think that we need to start really taking ai in a much more serious thing how can i make like can i because i would you know real talk i love the act of creation coding really satiates my problem solving desire but i still fundamentally love creating so if i could create faster i would do it it's why i use autocompletes i use autocompletes because i can create faster so it's not that i'm opposed to any of this hey the name is i'm currently on team devon is probably a scam a jen
