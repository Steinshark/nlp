you've seen some some hacker moves in the 
90s quite often included a certain scene where   you'd have a lovely super villain style map of 
the world and somebody would say something like   oh my goodness the police are intercepting the 
call and you see a lovely map and you see a little   line working its way across the map what i would 
try and do is use some standard unix tools   traceroute which a lot of people who've done 
system administration be very very familiar with   i thought i'd hack up a bit of python and see what 
we can see see if we can get something that looks   a little bit like that classic hacker movie scene 
we're going to auckland university in new zealand   and now we can get up our result and we can 
see it's hopping from the uk oh to america   over to the west coast america and 
then a massive transoceanic cable   all the way into the ocean 
winding up in new zealand i'd like to talk about the traceroute command 
and is it as it sounds traces a route yeah   but actually there's quite a quite beautiful 
little hack here it's quite a nice nice   way that it's working so i'd like to 
explain that show a few examples and   sure you can be a little bit of a tourist 
using traceroute you can learn a bit   about how the network is working this is the 
network the internet right the internet of   course yes it works for the whole internet 
with some caveats which i'll explain so   in theory we can find the route from anywhere that 
we've got access to a computer to anywhere else   in theory let me draw a few routers or routers 
if you're an american and let's imagine i'm   sitting here this is my laptop some server 
up here and there's some kind of network   connecting all of these things and we 
want to be able to answer the question   which way is the traffic really going before we 
learn about traceroute there's another command   we need to think about and that's ping pings a 
lovely little utility that you use just to test   if something's alive if a bit of network hardware 
is connected to the network written in 1983   it sends out an internet control message and the 
message is icmp echo request it asks a computer   or a router to send back a message 
saying i'm live i'm working okay   so if we want to check if a particular computer 
is working we send out that ping icmp echo request   and if it is working that computer sends 
back icmp echo reply and the ping command   gets that back and you know that 
you've got a connection to our computer   now what we want to know now not just that this 
machine here is working and responding to pings   but we also want to know the route now this wasn't 
actually designed into the internet this ability   it was hacked in later something we 
need to know about here is what's called   time to live every internet protocol packet when 
it's created is set up with this flag time to live   it's as if they've all got a doomsday 
clock on them we've got a little counter   every time the packet goes through a router 
that time to live counter decrements by one so   and there's a very good reason for that because 
if your network is misconfigured you can get what   we call a routing loop so imagine somehow we'd 
messed up our configuration and traffic that was   meant to go to this red router here ends up 
going around in a circle and that can happen   now once that starts to happen the 
traffic's just going to carry on   going around in that loop you've got big problem 
because that's going to fill up your network so   they made this little design choice to have 
the time to live counter and when that reaches   zero they just go this packet's stuck it's 
expired we're going to throw it away and this   allows a really neat trick so this was created 
by van jacobson one of the great creators of   the internet he's one of the men who made the 
internet work and helped in the fundamental   design of transmission control protocol but 
also this is of just a brilliant contribution   because he realized that this time to live counter 
could be exploited normally you'd set it very high   so that the only reason it would expire is if your 
packet was stuck in one of these routing loops   but if you cheat a bit if you set that 
route that time to live very very low   you can set it to one so my packet sets off from 
here gets here the time to live was one and the   packet is expired the router then must send back 
a ttl expired message which you can get back to   your computer and now you've got a message from 
this first hop go again set the time to lift to   two it decrements to one decrements again and now 
you're going to get ttl expired from this route   here you're going to find out what your second hop 
is time to lift three get a message from this one   time to live four you get a message from this one 
and by sending subsequent packets with different   time to lives you can find out every hob on your 
journey very neat that's cool it's very cool   there's a little catch because actually you're not 
really getting a root these are different packets   so if you play with this command enough sometimes 
you'll see that in between this packet being sent   and this packet being sent maybe the roots have 
changed sometimes changed so sometimes you get   something where the second hop is here but 
then the third hop is also here because the   route originally was like that and the route was 
switched to be like that and the route was changed   halfway through your probe but it's it's a lovely 
little hack that can tell you the way packets find   the way through a network what i thought i'd try 
and do is get a little bit of python together to   sort of try and capture that that thing of 
the packets leaping across the map of the world   so let's first let's just have a look at a basic 
ping command which i'm sure most of you see before   so i'm going to use universe there's a very good 
reason i'm using universities we don't always have   a huge budget so we we tend to have our web 
server being one machine somewhere in iraq   other companies big companies like 
google they're doing something a little   more sophisticated so if i ping my university 
queen mary university we're gonna get ping back but we can also trace through to it so this is a traceroute going from my flat in 
south london well from my isp down to queen mary   university and we can see in the middle here it's 
going through janna the giant academic network   a little thing that's happened here it's going to 
the stars that means some network administrator in   the intervening path is blocking our packets now 
there's a number of reasons that administrators   decide i don't want these ping packets i 
don't want these tracery packets on my network   there used to be an attack called a smurf attack 
where people used ping to to cause all kinds of   network disruption but also you might decide 
you know what you don't want external people   to know what your interior network wiring looks 
like so we when we get to these stars that means   the administrator there has taken the decision 
to block my internet control message protocol   my requests to see inside their network 
we'll try a nice long tray suit and we   think sydney university is a good long way 
away so we might see something interesting   each of these lines is one hop of the journey but 
there's actually each hop of the journey we've got   three packets so we get three estimates of the 
round trip time so here we can see it's jumped   from 52 milliseconds response to 250 milliseconds 
response so we can infer that between hot 11 and   hop 15 here it's probably gone across an ocean and 
maybe here between hop where it's 250 at hops 17   and here probably it's gone across another 
ocean there so we're getting eventually   360. well i discovered something quite nice 
here if i actually go for the web server so i   go to the www.sydney.edu.edu we'll see a little 
bit of a different story it stops a lot earlier   it stops here at this akamai technologies 
i don't know if you know the company akamai   is that like a local copy or something yes exactly 
that yeah brilliant yeah that's exactly what it is   a lot of people don't know about them but these 
companies like akamai and limelight content   cdn content distribution content delivery networks 
most of the traffic you get off the internet if   you're going to youtube netflix whatever you 
aren't going to a single server somewhere in   america you're going to the local copy they've 
mirrored and sydney university has quite sensibly   decided you know what we're in australia we're 
a long way from a lot of people are trying to   access our website we'll pay these people a 
bit of money and they'll they'll put a copy   closer so that's quite an interesting thing we can 
see but the other thing i thought i'd do is to   turn this into that scene we sometimes see in the 
hacker movies or a little bit so let's look over   here at some point we can do what we call ipg 
geolocation doesn't always work what we try and   do is take an ip address and work out where it is 
in the world so here's a little bit of python code   that takes a string that's an internet protocol 
address i'm using version 4 because i'm   old-fashioned and i'm kind of used to that but 
this is taking that string sending out to this   particular company getting back a response and 
we can pass out of that response that company   gives us a latitude and a longitude now there's 
no mechanism in the internet that allows that   all they've done is they've got a database 
and they're saying who owns that ip address   so it's not always perfectly accurate you 
get some funny things coming up like if the   only thing they know is that that company is in 
america it will return the latitude and longitude   the center yeah the very geographical dead center 
of america that has some really peculiar effects   people who think they know a little 
bit more than they actually know   they go who's the ip address that's annoyed me 
i'll find the latitude longitude and show up there people who live in that middle address in america 
that's in the very middle of america sometimes   find random strangers showing up at their house 
annoyed with them because they think some company   lives there or they think somebody's trying 
to hack them from there sorry to those people   living in that home yeah it's actually is 
really unfortunate for them because until   ipg location was a thing it was just some address 
in america but now it's the very middle of america can work out very unhappily for them so this is 
the bit of code anyway that takes this string   i p address sends out a request gets some jason 
back passes that jason and gets me a latin long   and i've got some base error checking this is not 
brilliant code i hacked it together in an hour   a couple of nights ago now the other thing i 
need to do is send out a traceroute command   so here's a python sending out a traceroute to 
some ip address that i'm going to pass in from   the command line i'm going to use some basic 
map plotting and i'm going to pass through   the individual lines of my command line output 
split out the ip address on this line here   do some basic passing to see if it's one 
of those stars or an error line and if   i have a new latitude and longitude and if 
i've got some previous latitude and longitude   i'm going to draw a great circle line so i'm 
just calling a library routine here to do it   and plot that on the map so let's have 
a look at that working to somewhere   interesting so if we go to the sydney dot edu dot 
ayu you'll take a little bit of time to go through   the traceroute command and we'll see it's working 
there sending out those sequences of three packets   and now it's going to pop up the map of the world 
and we can see more or less where it's going so   there's one big great circle hop from london i 
suspect i'm not sure i suspect that that is that   is that middle of america address i told you 
about that's definitely not new york is it   no no no that's not new i suspect that all it 
knows about the server there is it's in america   and that's the middle we've got a hop out to the 
west coast there looks like it's somewhere in   california and then bang all the way down to 
australia i think we can also say look kink   there as it comes in on the coast there and then 
makes its way down to sydney for the final bit   can we try somewhere random somewhere different 
uct cape town today okay cape town very nice place   yeah so now we're doing our route to cape town 
south africa i have no idea what this one will   actually look like okay it's going by the way i'm 
always doing the web server because i suspect   that the web server will be a single machine 
on that oh well that's not as interesting as i   we can't see too much i don't think that's 
a full great circle i think there's a there's   a sort of central hop there if we hop over 
to tokyo so let's try and get us over to the   university of tokyo which is in japan and again 
it's going to pop up the route we can see when   we get a big jump from 27 to 100 that's it jumping 
over an ocean that's jumping over another one so   it's interesting to me that it tends to go westly 
is that because of america being a powerhouse   in the internet you can also find that sometimes 
different places even with their country will swap   around and i have seen this i'm not going to run 
it until it does but i have seen this swap round   and and at another time of day it will take 
the eastbound route blue cost of one and   nothing else because we haven't yet switched 
on green so now our black is switched on blue   direction the signal is moving in so the 
speed of those pulses tell us the rate   we know which direction it is because we know 
which roller is coming from and we can look [manual publish]
