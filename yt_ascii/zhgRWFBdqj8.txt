luke skywalker's adopted family were moisture farmers i have no idea what he actually did on that farm but those things looked cool perhaps our society might never be able to produce real blasters star destroyers hyper drives cool droids or lightsabers but what about the moisture farms can we at least get those the methods and machines for extracting water out of the air have long been around the real question is whether they make commercial sense in this video i want to look at commercial scale atmospheric water generation but first let me talk about the asianometry patreon early access members get to see new videos and selected references for them before the release of the public it helps support the videos and i appreciate every pledge thanks and all with the show there is an estimated 1.4 quintillion tons of water on the earth just 2.5 percent of that water is fresh water and almost 70 percent of that 2.5 percent is locked up in glaciers ice caps and icebergs we already talked about the problems with tapping that water source check out my video about dragging icebergs to australia the majority of the other 30 is stored in underground lakes and reservoirs the remaining fresh water representing about 0.4 percent of the world's total is distributed across lakes river swamps or soils and in the atmosphere it is estimated that 50 000 cubic kilometers of fresh water exists in the atmosphere in the form of water vapor that is about six times the water of all the rivers on earth due to its nature this water is essentially inexhaustible vapor is regularly replenished as part of the water cycle which annually moves some 4.5 trillion tons of the stuff and unlike with desalination we aren't sucking up fish eggs along with the sea water and we don't have to deal with super saline wastewater afterwards sounds great the big question of course is whether or not we can actually get our hands on this atmospheric water in a way that is both economically and industrially scalable the first attempts to collect water from the air were based on fog fog is comprised of tiny cloud water droplets suspended in the air the goal of fog collection is to accelerate the formation and growth of small water droplets when they reach a critical size they roll and fall off into a collector fog and dew collection isn't new or original by a long shot nature has been doing it since time immemorial there is a beetle living in the namib desert of southern africa with special slippery bumps that collect water and funnel it towards the beetle's mouth fog collectors sometimes also called fog catchers are inspired by this concept there are basically meshes suspended in the air by cables or poles and positioned perpendicular to the wind for the mesh most people use a specially knit rational weave high density mesh because it offers a high ratio of mesh openings for collecting fog droplets these collectors can be quite cheap depending on the location and the material it costs about 100 to 200 usd to build about one square meter of fog collector the big practical issue with this type of atmospheric water generation is obvious the technology is highly dependent on how much fog passes through the collector's mesh openings that depends on location and local weather conditions fog collection is regularly used around the world one case study in oman found relatively high collection rates 30 liters of water per square meter however the majority of that came during the monsoon season just two months in the year people need water all year round so we need something more furthermore the speed of collection is not that great and the water isn't always clean to drink fog collectors were given to three villages in the namib desert and it did generate water from fog however the collectors also collected salt and dust from the air which turned the water brackish and made it unsuitable for drinking without some additional treatment fall collection is a passive method of collection so it uses very little energy the downside however is that you don't have much control over how much water you end up collecting so i don't really see fog collection has a scalable solution for alleviating water shortages the materials-based water generation idea extends on the fog collection idea a little bit i have also seen it referred to as absorption based or desiccant-based here you use a chemical called a sorbent to absorb water vapor from the air until it becomes fully saturated with water those packets are like the do not eat silica crystals that you find in your ramen or other dried foods sometimes after that you heat up this orbit material some people use solar thermal energy to do this which causes it to release all of its water the most critical element in the whole process is obviously the sorbent material the ideal sorbent material has a lot of surface area heats up relatively easily stays stable over multiple cycles and is of course cheap for instance silica gel granules and powders they're cheap sold commercially at high volume and are very stable over multiple cycles but their water absorption powers are not that strong other candidates include microporous aluminophosphate zeolites activated alumina and so on one of the key issues is how fast you can perform this cycle depending on the conditions it can take up to the entire night for the sorbents to absorb the water so the only way to produce water at scale would be to buy a lot more sorbents at some point this makes the whole venture a bit unwieldy the reality is that when most people think about moisture farms they aren't thinking about fog nets and sorbents so let us talk about the last and most interesting approach to atmospheric water generation active refrigeration this is where we cool atmospheric air to below the temperature at which it condenses into liquid water called the dew point like absorption methods you can run active refrigeration water generation methods virtually anywhere assuming that you have the energy however the local climate does have a significant impact on whether the technology can generate an economically feasible amount of water exactly how much water actually comes out depends on the ambient temperature airs relative humidity and how low of a temperature the chiller can chill that air the less humid the air is the colder the air has to get before it condenses into water so if the air is already very cold then you have to invest a whole lot more energy to chill that air even further for this reason you shouldn't be running active refrigeration in a cold desert location like antarctica you're probably better off using the energy to melt ice to get your water it also cuts out certain arid desert areas like arizona the air is very dry there which means we need to chill it to a very low temperature to get anywhere near enough water to be economically competitive but tropical coastal cities with lots of warm humid air can possibly generate significant amounts of water using active refrigeration methods this includes coastal cities like new orleans in the united states mombasa and kenya perth and australia or any of the major cities in the middle east despite being near the ocean many of these mediterranean weather cities ironically have issues with finding enough fresh water the dominant active refrigeration devices work like dehumidifiers and air conditioners i have a little dehumidifier in my apartment which i run from time to time it dries out my air leaving behind a condensed liquid my little dehumidifier guy works on the principle of vapor compression refrigeration it passes humid air over an evaporator in order to chill that air below its dew point to condense vaporized water there exists a few machines more specifically geared to generate water this way small portable devices can produce about 20 liters of water a day equivalent to about 10 milk cartons and there are larger industrial level devices from companies like skywater great water ecolo blue and airdrop irrigation that can do up to 200 000 liters a day the cost of these devices can range from three hundred dollars to sixteen thousand dollars before operation a slightly related method of atmosphere water generation our water reclamation systems integrated into modern hvac systems most people need to run ac anyway as part of their operations these systems generate water called condensate that water condensate is oft free of solids but is nevertheless unsafe to drink the first reason why is that this water captures dust contaminants and potentially dangerous pathogens from the outside air as it passes through the machine's cooling or evaporator coils this is despite a set of filters the second reason comes from the metal cooling coils themselves the water constantly forming on that metal is slightly acidic reacting with the metal to create chemical contaminants and lastly the whole environment is wet and warm which encourages microbial growth anywhere the water is being collected distributed or stored if this condensate water is to be used for drinking then it needs to be treated accordingly this means reverse osmosis ozonation filtration uv exposure chlorination and so on all of this is expensive and i guess a lot of people are going to ask if we're going to buy and install this expensive equipment might as well do it for ocean water rather than air water i suppose that's fair that being said we use water for more than just drinking hvac condensate can be used for flushing toilets garden irrigation cooling towers and cleaning roofs i am particularly partial to using roof ponds as a way to passively heat and cool a building and you can put fish in them none of this water touches human lips and as a result does not have to be so intensely treated depending on local regulations and requirements of course depending on local regulations and requirements of course one significant technical drawback with these vapor compression style active refrigeration devices is that the machine itself is not all that reliable such machines are technically complicated and have a whole lot of moving parts the more moving parts the higher the chances those parts can go wrong so in recent years there has been some water generation machine experiments using the peltier effect sometimes also called the peltier seebec effect the machine starts with a device called a thermocouple this device has two sides joined together when you pass direct current through it one side gets hotter while the other gets cooler the basic concept of a peltier-based atmosphere water generator would be to move humid hot air towards the cool side of a thermocouple theoretically such a machine lacking those moving parts would be smaller and more reliable than those devices relying on vapor compression they also wouldn't use potentially toxic and climate impacting refrigerants there are a few drawbacks one being that it would take some time to start producing water and while the thermocouple itself is fine auxiliary components like fans and such can still break there are a few companies with products based on this concept though it can be a little difficult to determine this from the outside active refrigeration devices are industrially scalable but regardless of how they operate they also use a lot of energy it is estimated that some 90 to 95 percent of the cost of the water is directly tied to energy cost the range is very broad but research reports and informal estimates find that we need about 500 to 850 watt hours of electricity to generate one liter of water more likely the lower end of that range than the higher depending on how we generate this electricity this can make atmospheric water very expensive both financially and carbon wise a 2021 economic study found that atmospheric water generation cannot compete with tap water but it might be a compelling alternative to bottled water especially in water strained locations like dubai san diego and aruba island one possible way to ameliorate this would be to attach the system to renewable energy sources like wind nuclear and solar but that applies to desalination to a competing technology perhaps the biggest challenge facing atmospheric water generations widespread adoption in addition to the energy cost has been scale depending on the specific local temperature and climate different atmospheric water generation solutions stand out over others it is definitely not as scalable as something like flash desalination technology for that reason the technologies developed to suit one country or region's needs cannot be easily mass exported to many others but i do think that this type of water technology can help augment supply in the right locations i'm particularly struck by how ac condensate water can be repurposed for non-potable use there is something there for sure or maybe i'm trying too hard to make something out of thin air all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the
