the iphone 13s are here so this is everything you need to know in less than 17 minutes what i liked what i really didn't like and then if i think these new iphones will actually beat the competition and i do have something that i want to call them out on okay so on the face of it the iphone 13s look pretty similar to the iphone 12s there's four phones a 13 mini 13 13 pro and 13 pro max and each of them is almost exactly the same shape and size as their equivalents last year this is just kind of how apple rolls because unlike companies like samsung and huawei who come up with a practically new design language every single year to differentiate themselves apple knows that the iphone design is iconic and so i think they almost try to make sure that they don't change it too much which makes the most obvious visual difference between generations usually just the color but this is actually the first thing i'm actually pretty happy with what they've delivered this time for the normal iphone 13 and 13 mini there's five total colors the new pink is kind of whatever but i really like the red this time around it actually looks like red and then for the pros every single year apple has a few standard colors which tend not to change because fun fact black and white are actually the most popular colors over time but they also always have a hero color the one that they always use in all the promotional material and the one that they make sure is different so that true fans can have that i got the new iphone feeling it was midnight green for the 11 pro pacific blue for the 12 pro and we now have sierra blue for the iphone 13 pro it might just be my favorite color yet it's almost mr who's the boss blue the only slightly annoying thing is that they've kept the same ultra high gloss side rails from last year which will probably make the phone almost impossible to keep clean anyways i'm also just glad that the notch is smaller ever since the iphone 10 first came out this notch hasn't budged and as each new generation of android phones have come out its presence has become just that little bit more unwelcome so no they haven't got rid of it entirely this time but it is about 20 smaller thanks to the earpiece being pushed up to the top bezel and i think that's just enough such that it keeps parity with its rivals it means that we have just this little bit of extra usable screen on top which who knows if apple's feeling cheeky might mean we get the battery percentage icon back we still get a completely even bezel all the way around the rest of the screen unlike most phones which do still have a little chin at the bottom all while having no sacrifice to the quality of the selfie camera which we have seen on phones that have tried to be a little bit more experimental autoface id which is the best facial recognition on a phone could apple have made a more dramatic visual redesign probably would it have come at the cost of other things most likely so i'm pretty happy with this one but also before i watch this launch event i was fully ready to complain about how apple had kept the base storage option on the iphone 13s at 24 gigs because honestly in 2021 that's just not good enough however they've upgraded that too all iphone 13s start with 128 gigs of storage and actually the top version of the iphone 13 pro goes all the way up to one terabyte now while starting at the same price as last year's phones actually cheaper here in the uk so i'm not gonna complain about that but what about when you're using the phone well i'm really well relieved actually the battery has been a priority for the longest time companies have been fighting with battery life essentially the bigger it is the better for consumers long term but then the less appealing the thing becomes in the moment because of its thickness and weight and i think that this is plagued apple even more so than with other companies just because of how much emphasis they put on the in-hand feel you can tell that iphones have always tried to carefully tread that line resulting in never giving too much battery but sometimes falling on the side of just not giving enough but this year for maybe the first time ever it looks like they're finally giving users some buffer room in both a 13 million 13 pro are getting an extra 1.5 hours of screen on time and both the normal 13 and the 13 pro max are getting an extra 2.5 hours i am going to do a full battery maybe even a charging speed test too though so if you do want to see those then a sub to the channel would be vitalizing but it's looking promising oh yeah and i'm so so glad that this year the screens are not just brighter but we are getting a feature that has been sorely missing for a long time on iphones that the entire tech community has been banging on about for the last three years non-stop finally finally apple has added in 120 hertz refresh rates instead of every other iphone up until this point whose screen is refreshed 60 times per second the iphone 13 pro and iphone 13 pro max will refresh that up to 120. if you know what you're looking for then this is going to be the biggest jump in perceived speed that we've ever had on an iphone now let's be very clear about something these are not the first phones to get 120 hertz displays actually they're pretty much the last but that doesn't change how significant the upgrade is as with quite a few things on this iphone 13 lineup i would see it less like apple has just suddenly come in and added some next level feature and a bit more like apple has finally removed one of the major thorns on their side these major caveats that i've had to constantly remind people were missing every time i mentioned the last two years of iphones not anymore you do only get 120 hertz on the pro phones which is kind of unfortunate given that it's almost an assumed feature on all android flagships but i can kind of understand it you've got to remember that for the entire year well samsung might release 50 smartphones apple is only making four and so because these four phones have to serve such a huge diverse mix of customers it makes sense from a business perspective to have at least one option that doesn't use all the expensive tech that there is a big portion of users who just won't appreciate there is another side to this argument though i'm getting there but the point i'm making is if we actually do get better battery life this year whilst also being able to have these smooth high refresh rate screens then that is an enormous win i'm also just generally excited to see what this new a15 chipset can do if you watch the launch event you'll have seen that this new chip has a 50 faster cpu and a 30 faster gpu those are crazy numbers what a spectacular set of announcements but if i'm being really honest i think the way that apple has pitched this is a little misleading like if you look closer you'll realize that what they're actually saying is not 50 faster than last year like you'd kind of assume because of how they normally make comparisons to the previous gen but up to 50 faster than other competitors so they're effectively picking scenarios that suit their chips ones in which they're past a14 was already ahead of android and then running those same scenarios again oh and would you look at that the a15 is even more ahead long story short we don't actually know how much faster the a15 is than the a14 but just the fact that it is faster with better and more reliable 5g makes me excited to test it because the a14 powered iphone 12 pro max is the the most reliably fluid experience i've had on a smartphone ever i've used this thing every single day for almost a year now and i've only ever seen it lag once and that was effectively when i was trying to see how many objects it could handle on screen at one time it got to at least 20 000 before it started chugging and even though you might not even actually notice that extra power in day-to-day tasks you probably will when it comes to the camera so for starters it enables the new cinematic video modes you see apple has had portrait mode photos for a while now and when it was first introduced in the iphone 7 plus that in itself was a pretty strenuous task you had to process the data from two separate cameras you had to create a depth map and then apply different levels of blur to different parts of the image according to that depth map however five generations of chips later we finally have enough processing power to be able to perform a similar type of computation 30 times per second now i will say that this footage looks a little soft around the edges where you can tell that this is shot on a phone not a pro dslr camera look at it from what we can see right now this is far far more advanced than i ever expected the first generation implementation to be and i'm telling you now this is the beginning of something huge when this tech improves using phones to make movies is going to be a complete no-brainer they're cheaper they're so much smaller and they're smarter like shooting cinematic video with this iphone you already have the ability to refocus video after you've taken it if i shoot out of focus video on this camera i'm screwed plus this phone can use its ultra wide camera to anticipate when someone is about to walk into the frame of the main camera and get the focus ready for them i don't know how well it works yet but if this is as good as they're making it look this is very big news plus i'm just glad that apple is experimenting my single biggest complaint about the iphone 12's cameras was that yes they're polished but they're also just a bit boring compared to the competition this goes a long way towards fixing that but also every single one of these new iphone 13s has a feature called sensor shift stabilization it means that instead of the lens moving to try and counteract your hand movements it's the camera sensor behind that lens doing the moving we already saw this on the iphone 12 pro max last year and it's not a dramatic improvement but it edges the iphone closer to what i'd call human stabilization by which i mean that you can already get phones like the vivo x60 pro plus that have an actual gimbal system inside their camera for footage so smooth that it looks like the camera is locked in position i don't think apple wants this they actually like that little bit of motion they're just trying to make it smoother but there's actually a slightly more fundamental hardware improvement this time around every single camera on every single one of these new iphone 13s has been upgraded so for the iphone 13 and 13 mini you have a new main camera with a larger sensor that apparently lets in 47 more light and then also an upgraded ultrawide camera to i guess try and keep parity and put simply bigger sensors equals more light equals better photos based on the sample photos apples given though i would say that it still feels like there's a big gap between the main camera and the ultroid now here's where the iphone 13 pros start to pull ahead it really does feel like apple is making sure that the pros feel pro this year but then they've kind of kept the normal iphone 13s as the more simple iterative upgrade for people who just don't care about their phone as much and who just upgrade mindlessly every time their contract runs out because on the pro iphones the zoom camera has been upgraded to three times optical zoom the ultrawide now lets in a lot more lights up to 92 percent they're saying and then the main camera can apparently let in 2.2 times more light i don't know how you can put an exact number on how much better a camera is but these are huge huge claims and what makes them even more significant is that at the same time they've also equipped this new ultrawide with the ability to autofocus which allows it to double up as a close-up macro camera a macro camera that can get all the way up to two centimeters away from an object and one with all that extra light that this sensor now lets in but for a lot of phones the macro camera is a separate lens altogether so the fact that apple has just added basically a two in one on these phones almost gives these pros the equivalent of having a quad camera system there's also apparently the ability on these pros to create your own custom image preset for how you want your photos to look straight out of the camera definitely need to test this one myself though and finally you might know that last year's iphone 12s could shoot photos in a format called pro raw you see with normal iphone photos at the point of capture a lot of the data in that shot is thrown away because most people don't need it but by enabling pro raw photos do take up about eight times as much storage but they allow you to keep that information which means that in the future if you ever wanted to come back and edit it it will look good even if you go crazy with the image now the reason that i'm telling you this is that with the iphone 13 pro you can also shoot in something called pro res which is a very similar concept for videos it is really cool like i totally believe that smartphones will record movies in the near future but it also will almost definitely kill your storage it's possible that they have somewhat optimize the files but if we went off current industry standards if you wanted 4k high quality prores video just 10 minutes would take up 100gb storage or the entirety of a base iphone 13 pro naturally mind you this is probably why they're giving you the option for one terabyte this year all that said there are a few things i'm concerned about okay not you first of all is the entire iphones charging situation for starters no iphone 13s come with a charger i'm not surprised when apple makes decisions they're generally very purposeful and they try to stick to them but the added layer to this is that the only cable you get in the box is a usbc to lightning cable which means that you also need a usbc charging brick to use it which unless you specifically bought an iphone 11 series phone you probably won't have but on top of that it really feels like apple is pushing this narrative that magsafe this snap-on magnetic charging solution is the way forward except that i'm really struggling to see the benefit it's slow 15 watts of max power compared to the over 100 watts that competitors are now releasing it generates heat because the simple fact that you're no longer connecting metal to metal directly means that a higher proportion of the energy is being wasted and more fundamentally it's not even more convenient if you fully buy into the magsafe ecosystem then every time you want to charge you have to take off your accessory and put it back on afterwards plus you're still tied to a cable it's not like this wireless charging suddenly means you can forget about wires it just makes that wired charging more indirect and then also the second thing is this whole situation with comfort look i can see why apple has gone with this whole flat design with their phones it does look slick but just speaking from experience i strongly dislike how it feels and it's looking very likely that given the increased battery on all these iphone 13s they're going to be just as sharp but now even thicker and even heavier and don't get me wrong the extra battery is great but i'm just saying be warned because i don't expect well particularly the 13 pro max to be particularly palm friendly we'll find out very soon though alright taking all of this into account bearing in mind that no one has actually tested these in person yet how out of these new iphones sit versus the competition well i think that the iphone 13 pros seem really competitive the a15 chip 120hz refresh rate combined with apple's optimizations all means that there is a good chance that you are looking at the new fastest phones on the market and if apple can do that whilst improving the battery life and making the camera fun again they've pretty much tackled every major complaint that i've had with the iphone all in one go whilst actually making it cheaper in some regions however at the same time i think that the normal iphone 13 and the iphone 13 mini are a bit less competitive but as well as the expected material differences between normal and pro not having 120 hertz is a huge deal for a flagship phone in almost 2022 and the fact that they miss out on a lot of the major camera upgrades too means that i could see myself telling people to either go android or just get the pro it kind of feels like with the pro iphones apple is looking at the competition and they're trying to make something that's competitive and that matches their features but for the normal iphone 13s it just feels like apple is banking on the loyalty that they have to their brand as a reason to not push forward as much as they could they even actually said that the reason they've shuffled the cameras into this new diagonal position is to make the phones look different because you might not be able to tell otherwise but i've got a few big comparisons coming up soon which will give us more definitive answers so if you did enjoy this then do consider subscribing for those i'm literally not going to finish editing this video until like six in the morning to check out my dear apple video click here or to see the craziness that is the company tesla click here my name is aaron this isn't who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
