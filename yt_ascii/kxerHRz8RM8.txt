let's get started with improving hiring and c plus so i've been known for more than 10 years and doing community work with c bus plus so i've been hearing it for a while now that c plus deaths are just hard to find and before those 10 years are already like they've been like since 2007 i've been a freelancer and then i also always been hearing it from the from the headhunters which were like looking for projects and you know c plus bus divers developers were always hard to find that's just how it is how it always has been and of course one can wonder why why isn't that no well one of the reasons probably is that ziploc is a hard language and that is not as popular like for example python and so itself by itself has a smaller population of developers but that's that's the easy answer right but also [music] on the other hand everyone is looking everyone who you know every there's very few companies who are not looking for new deaths nowadays so that's also you know if ever if the comes to the market and they're good they have multiple offers and only one of those offers they can take unless they're i don't know is there any squarespace developer out there who's like doing two jobs in parallel as remote you know i heard that's a new thing and the pandemic maybe some developer out there is doing that and having a heyday but also like you know the ones which are not looking get a bit alienated by the folks looking i know these messages are in german so most of you probably will not be able to read them but yeah you probably received similar ones in either your native language or in english which are just being sent to everyone and that way you find a candidate but you kind of alienate the the folks which you are actually looking for but the ones which are not looking for a job right now right and it's yeah and i always find it funny that they claim that they looked at your profile okay and this is from from a german platform which is xsync and here i have it explicitly standing that i'm not looking for projects in my profile and so if you've been looking at that then you maybe could have seen that i for recruiting for c plus contact me for that hey cool but that's that's very rare most recruiters just copy paste me their texts and you know the search agents et cetera so today this automated i guess you all know the trick of having this emoji in front of your name at linkedin and then when you get an automated message your name gets copied into the message and you see the emoji and if the with the person contacting you and writing you and saying hey yens then the emoji is not there so you can see like if it's an automated message or not and this is one of the last most recent examples so anxiety my profile pictures like 15 years old when i still had long hair and monitors were smaller and so this image is a lot smaller than it should be and in the modern web this gets blown up to be pixelated and it's like really hard to to see on the image that i'm not a woman or what gender i have but i'm getting misgendered here and [music] on the one hand that that kind of shows that the recruiter cared for my gender and thought that i'm a woman fine i of course answered that or not but on the other hand i want to point out that for women it is very very common to be misgendered in our community especially by folks writing those automatic automatic messages because the default double lowpower you know most developers in our world are still male and so this is basically what the copy paste messages and then they also kind of you know happen to send this to some some woman but then they don't think about that [music] also very common is just to adjust like the the text for for the greeting right then they get that they're right but in the text they're still speaking of the main person that's another thing which is common also an experience i had a few years ago is changing your status to not looking for projects will get you emails from people who are looking for freelancers which are looking for projects or for jobs because that triggers search agents which have been looking for projects and maybe are looking or just for people who change something in their profile which has projects in it i see that i'm seeing like that they often in our show like the things which are like you know which i have in common with the profile i'm looking at and one thing they often show me is that i have hiring and c plus plus which you see like what you know what i offer that that isn't common but then i think that they they match like a text search if something or that text mess matches with something they're offering or they're searching then that's a match and that happens often when i look at the c plus developers profile and they have c plus plus in there you know then they happen to be interested in hiring which yeah that's not always the case and i'm also a disclaimer i'm not working as a headhunter okay so i'm not looking at your pro profile to to see if you're available for a job i probably look at your profile because you joined my group or maybe you visited my profile i'm not just curious who is you know visiting my profile and looking at those people they're interesting that they message them or not you know stuff like that but when i prepared this top last fall for the conference which i think i haven't missed already mentioned yet so this talk was prepared for me it was 2021 and so i asked last fall in twitter like you know how prevalent is that problem that people you know waste their time contacting developers which aren't looking for a job and so this is the result from last fall and yesterday it occurred to me wouldn't it be interesting to run this survey again for a day back then around a week and see what the results are and now if you see like not getting contacted by by one is the highest rate in twitter in last year in fall and it was 35 percent in the beginning of november and now this is the result from just like you know until i think and to choose us today this ran and there you see that this drops by nearly 10 and there's i go back you know it's more than 10 is' now it's 30 so there's this is like you know seems to change over the year which is clear but it seems to be interesting but twitter is not a platform where people are active that are looking for candidates okay so this this is an interesting sample for twitter let's go to linkedin and ask there and this is again the result from 2021 and then it is there 26 we remember 30.5 something 35 something percent was on twitter back then so back then already i get ten percent difference and that's kind of okay and it's clear that it is the case that more people on linkedin will be contacted by recruiters that's common you know but then you wonder is it is it also then different there in in this year in spring and yes it is you see it's like this half from 26 percent of 13 people which have which are not looking for a job not have been contacted by a recruiter only 13 and also i kind of find interesting it wasn't the day i get almost 300 people to to answer this on linkedin on twitter it was a little bit less but it's it's very close so it's just a few words so it's comparable but on the other hand it's a clear difference which is to be expected between the two platforms i guess no one is surprised on that and so i've been thinking there could be a different approach to you know just to bring companies together with those people that are actually looking and since i had started an online user group in 2020 i thought about you know what what can you do with an online user group and our default content for user groups is and has always been talks and so i was looking like the platform which we were using back then which was rainbow what else we could do and rainbow had this feature that there was either a talk mode which was you know the presentation mode like what you see now or that you're sitting on a table and everybody has to sit on a table in rainbow it's not like optional like in this platform and then has to talk to the other people on the table and they freely can go to other tables if they like to and i thought well when we take this table feature to the maximum and have meetings without giving talks and just putting this table feature what what could we do to just have people go from table table to have conversations and one of the ideas for me back then was a job fair because every company can have their own table with their logo on it and they can you know have some recruiters on the table and if you're interested in that company you can go there and that's how this has been looking for the first time and last year for the first event on the 16th where we had 10 people attending the first table was a welcome table which is still the case and then we had the 10 sponsors and some companies with three tables and yeah so that's how the job fair has been born and last year we had it four times and that's also the goal for this year we had the first job fair in march in mid-march and the next one is on the 3rd and fourth may and for the fourth i have to say maybe because right now there is no company sponsoring the evening event sometimes companies do that they attend both usually then they are on the third and the fourth there and that's the best you can do and this time that's not the case so far maybe that still happens but otherwise we'll be only on the third on the afternoon from three to six o'clock berlin time on hubido and also this is accompanied by a form where candidates can share their cv with and they can share it with sponsors but also as the companies in the employer listing and this form creates a light profile by asking for country relocation remote you can click on some of the skills you have on cpus plus like the standard various programming paradigms some libraries cued boost et cetera et cetera you see it some build systems are even they're not trying to extend that list with every event and then there's also like field of work like you know in what fields have you worked which is interesting for companies and then of course there is years of experience so how many years have you worked with c plus plus which is always interesting for companies and if we look at some of the results from that form from last year and this includes now three or four events because the first event did not have the form in that case that was like feedback from the first event that companies would have would like to have more information about the candidates at first glance and so i created that or extended that form it already existed back then i extended it to that also this is an option for the companies to match on the various topics with candy dates so like if you only use for cube but i'm going to talk about that later so as you see the this event last year and always has been very popular with india and then there's a lot of people coming from europe a few people from the united states we have some folks also from asia and south america and canada this is the folks which have used the form which have submitted a cv or a resume over the form it's not the visitors at the event itself so that's not always the same mix now looking at the aggregate for what people actually choose to be you know known as their crossbar skills but what knowledge do people identify you know what kind of zippers plus therefore are you and then we see the most popular thing which people identify with the c plus plus 11 followed by linux secrets 14 op and modern c plus plus and then i also as i mentioned this is the fields of work not very surprising that desktop is the most popular followed by other which i tried to add more choices so that people click less on other but others also very popular because it's kind of an escape for people to to cover something which isn't covered by that and there will always be things which aren't covered by by this field otherwise it would be a list which is too long but yeah embedded server finance automotive is also very popular and telecommunication was actually way way more popular than the first event this year and on the other hand when you see like something like gaming this also has to do with the companies which attend if you have a game if we had gaming companies attend and especially sponsors even that they can you know advertise with their logos we probably would have more people coming from those fields so it's always kind of you know which fields are there at an event to attract the developers that want to work or that are working in that field and want to you know meet those companies years of experience shows that it's overall a good mix which is you know using this form and attending the events it's of course a few people which you know would like to become junior and then there is folks which are juniors and trying towards seniority and then we have the folks which probably think about what what they do after being a senior right so there is yes we had we had some few few folks which have more than like 25 to 30 years of experience of c bus plus then yeah c plus plus itself is only 40 years old so doing doing c plus plus for 33 years that's amazing and as i mentioned this creates a light candidate profile which companies wanted and companies also may filter on this or search it later to find candy dates and for candidates and the next step would be to select the companies to share with so companies don't get automatically access to a pool of candy dates no the candidates still have to you know select the companies they want to share with and then you know of course share your resume and upload and maybe edit a cover letter that's optional not everybody does it so and yeah so i see this event as a long time strategy and i try to grow it with each event and as i mentioned that any companies are having a strong influence on what is showing up as candidates and here you see that is a graph on the submissions per event so the first four events from last year and then the event from this year the march event saw 71 submissions so it's kind of the second place of events with the most submissions and for the main event i have no idea how many submissions we would have at the moment already and that's like also what i learned from the much event from the day this gets announced people start using those forms so at the first day when when when the event is announced naturally there is no sponsor in in this form only the companies which are in the employer listing and so that gets used then a lot and this is the skills from from the first event and this year and there you can notice that ctrl 17 now was the first event moved up into the top five if you put this side to side so it's 22 and 21 and you'll see it's equal to 17 it's not in the top five if it's a sixth place and now it's on the third place with the first event and of course this can change with the audience of the next events but that's nice to see and that's kind of the the biggest change and also modern c plus plus came from being fifth to being second and one one thing i'm thinking about is like actually making a line graph with with all the events on and then having the v line being like how popular is c plus plus 14 and linux and all the other things but i haven't found time to work on that yet which brings me quickly to to the event itself there are sponsor tables which are really important because the platform i'm using is not free and i need to kind of finance my time which i you know used to work on this but also the platform itself this includes then the access to the recruiting tooling and sponsors are listed in the cv sharing form on the website and in the job section and of course when i get money for the event i also can use it for advertising and other platforms so i've spent some money on advertising for this and spending right now money on advertising for this and of course also those the feedback from those sponsors drives and guides the tooling which i write the three tables are inhubilo below the sponsor tables and it's for getting a feel for the event format and i limited it last year then to two visits because i saw too many companies just you know going for the free tables because it's free and it's easy to click and then they just go for the free table but in the end then i have the work with the event and just have a bunch of yeah companies coming and i wanted to you know avoid that scenario so that's not limited to two visits and then you know support the event and be part of it and actually make it useful for the community the three tables are only four seats instead of eight seats for the sponsored tables and right now i'm thinking about like having that making three tables two seats and sponsored tables four seats because with the last event we had seven sponsors and the who below launch was very then it would be better to have a more dense and we don't have the traffic to have like eight seats and filled on every table with seven sponsors or eight sponsors sometimes and this is how the recruiting tooling looks so of course you get a list of candidates where you can click through see see what they uploaded read the message [music] and also the candidates i made the the series two to the sponsors etc that's given and then you also get the graphs of the population of you know kind of which candidates to submit to your company and those graphs are also kind of you know hey know know what what kind of you know people have resonated with you as a company but also kind of have those graphs available to compare with other things you're doing and hiring but also kind of to have that available to to put that in presentations and to you know show we did that and this is a result and also it includes like the search for cvs and resumes where you can filter on certain properties and the thought behind that is that maybe even like 40 to 50 candy dates or submitting to your company you want to have the ability to search those candied dates for certain positions i have some companies which only have a few positions and that's not a very useful thing but if you like have various people use this and they have various other positions and you know one team uses qt then they are interested in and candidates said no cute and the other team is you know using opencv or just generally doing steeper stress then they can use that to find the right combination for them or you know similar things and of course if you like just i made like all options available to filter on and i don't know like how this is used and there's also a text search to to search the not the uploaded documents but the cover letters to to have that covered and yeah that is how the drop fair looks on on hobilo now and as i said i think it's a long time project i need c plus plus employer support because only with companies actually being interested in that and being willing to invest in that we will be able to you know continue to have this as an event online and also for that reason i definitely have to tell companies to sign up early because it's like you know again for the next event in the position that we have like one company signing up very cool but advertising event was only one company and it is really hard so i think this has this time to do something with easter and that probably there will be some sign ups and the next week and the whole thing of course you know is covet everything moving online has helped in bringing this on and i'm still learning with the end like with the day it's what what dates are good for the companies to attend what is working and who below and which feature sets should be used for that and offer and one thing i'm currently thinking about is to extend the event to three days because right now it's like one day in the afternoon and one day in the evening and i am thinking about extending it to one day in the morning one day in the afternoon and one day in the evening so that we kind of you know can be more friendly to asia and also the most of the recruiters rather want to work in the morning or in the afternoon and less companies want to work on the evening but the evening brings the u.s companies if they you know would join this at one day and also bring brings that's like also the feedback i've seen the evening event can be the better candidate dates because the candidates joining in the evening are people which have worked at the day and they're coming because they're looking for an alternative for their job just one look but that can be really interesting developers also so attending the evening event with less companies brings you candidates which maybe just are available at that point and then the advantage of the companies which are coming in the evening is that this is like a strong filter for them they only get to speak with them but on the other hand yeah you have to work on the evening then and i've seen some engineers enjoy that and attend for their companies there and hire for their teams and just have a relaxed conversation this is again the tables which is basically everything that i already covered so i'm gonna jump over that slide and yeah let's have a quick overview over all the companies which have been on the event this is even the first event and it was 10 companies sponsoring this as you see the lowest here in march last year then from these two companies i know that they have been hiring through the event that they met people through through this and i don't have the best feedback mechanism and still kind of working out a feedback mechanism for candy dates but that's the two companies i know about and then also here's at least one company in which at least has talked to candidates and but they told me like that they had some fitting candidates they wanted to hire but as you know there's competition so they already had a different offer and so they weren't on board anymore then that's november and if you counted correctly you get 15 companies in total which have attended that in the last year in 2021 but there's more i also launched this this employer listing last year and three companies are currently listed in that and so if you count correctly that makes 17 and yes the employer listing is basically you are with an employer profile and your logo on the job section listed for one year at meeting c plus and you're also automatically listed in the form for this one here so that is the best way to profit from the job fair because you get all you get like from the first day to the last day and then between all the cvs which are being shared by candidates and when you sign up late as a company to the job fair you're not getting the cvs which have been uploaded prior because i still want the mechanism that candidates choose which companies they want to contact and not like have just a group of cvs or selection of cvs right into companies like a pool where everybody can look into that that is something which i don't i don't want because then people get spammed again right so yeah as i said 17 companies in total and the first event had seven companies and the next event has currently one company signed up as a sponsor which is ivu and yeah that's them and so three plus one yes four companies are currently listed and if you want to submit your cv to those that's the url and like if you you know want to wait a week or until the event that's fine then maybe more companies will still sign up just said this this time i think the easter holiday is like you know blocking companies to sign up so there will be more sign-ups and one pattern i've noticed with companies attending is that they attend one version of it and then they return not to the next but like to like this they usually skip one or two events and then they they come back because they they attend it and they get their 40 candidates 50 candidates and then they try something else or maybe just need half a year until they hire again so the newest feature i implemented in prior to the conference last year was two ways of managing candidate state so the default is normal and just default i think and so this is the priority is a way to manage the sorting so if you mark a candidate as priority or high priority they you know show up above all the other candidates that have submitted cvs to you that makes it easier for your team to find them and then also you could manage the state internally to you know who has been contacted who has been rejected and who you like want to delete so that they are not visible anymore and interface to you and i do that because you know as i said 40 to 50 candidates is for an event normal which companies see and i think that we will have an increase in submissions over time probably so i want to be ready to have like 100 submissions for an event and then people probably want to to be able to do things like that and kind of you know think that would enable feedback to companies to candidates but the problem with the companies is that the the data from the last three events showed that this was not very really used so that was a nice idea but it's not working as much and the submission model is kind of you know explained here a candidate uses a form and the form then makes the candidate select the employers which they want to share with and only employers which already matched with the interests or was it was a profile of the candidate and the application state then you know ideally changes or if they find them over the filtered search later and then the candidate could look up and that i don't have this display to candidate at the moment so there's no way for for you as a candidate to know that but because i was like you know do companies use this and at the current state i have not seen companies been picking this up and the submission form itself as i said it creates like a profile with z plus plus skills i used to call them options but skills is much better field of work in the region so it asks for the continents but later also can you can select your country and years of experience but companies can only like filter on on a region not on on various countries and yeah companies may fail to research on these and for the community i hope that we kind of you can get a better way to have people that are looking for jobs connected to jobs so that part of the funding that goes to headhunters which spam everyone goes rather to more direct way to have people connect directly with candidates and not having everyone spammed on the other hand this allows me to offer free online events which are not about hiring just today you know and the job fair and on the other hand it of course also brings includes companies more in the community and the platform which i'm still building and yeah always looking for employers to join this and other companies to work with and of course many thanks to the companies that have joined in 2021 but also in this year so thanks for listening and if there are any questions etc i will now go back into the
