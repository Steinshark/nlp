so no this title is not clickbait i really do feel like it's time to consider switching to android from ios so just give me a couple of minutes to make my case so i've been primarily daily driving an iphone ever since the 5s back in 2013 now before that i pretty regularly use android i mean phones like the galaxy note 2 and the htc one m7 really were way ahead of their time especially compared to the iphones of their day but once i got my hands on that iphone 5s i was hooked part of it was the camera was absolutely top of its class 4 back on its day but on top of that the performance and especially the fact that ios 7 was such a big step forward and the design really did draw me back over to the ios side of the camp and once i was in i was in facetime imessage the lock in that you find with these apple devices is really real and in the last seven years i really haven't had a huge incentive to go outside of the ios ecosystem yes i can and absolutely have continued to use android devices as a secondary device right so what i'm reviewing something when i'm spending time with it i will absolutely witch over to that device but after the week or a couple weeks or whatever the case is that iphone always has split back but not anymore all this started to change with this the oneplus 17 now like most other devices when i got it i started doing video on it i spent some time with it but the difference was this stuck around in my back pocket for most of last year at least most of the end of last year and for a couple of major reasons first of all i have always appreciated oneplus phones for the very clean simple build of android with a lot of emphasis on performance so that's one of the things that i've always drawn me to the iowa side of the camp because iphones almost without fail since that 5s had been one up if not the most powerful phone that you can get your hands on and the 70 especially with its ninety hertz display made some huge strides and really pulling me away from the ios ecosystem because i realized this phone had pretty much everything i needed except for a good camera naturally that brings us to today where we of course have the 1 + 8 as well as the 1 + 8 pro now these phones really do promise to deliver a full flagship experience and specifically i spent a lot of time last few weeks using the 1 plus d pro this display with a 120 hertz refresh rate and honestly excellent color excellent resolution the entire package has been one of the most appealing things that i have ever laid my eyes on in the phone space when you look at just how smooth this phone is look at how much work that what plus is done on optimizing all aspects of this phone right snapdragon 865 with the high-end lp ddr pad memory with the fact that they've done a lot of work on the optimization side that android and you pair that all with probably what does the best display on any phone out right now it was me this is something to drew me away now that's not to say that you should overlook the standard 1 + 8 again this is not only a cheaper phone and it does have a lot of major features including 5g which we'll get into a little bit later but this still does have an excellent a dp 90 hertz display very similar to that 70 last year that really drew me over sure of all you're looking for our benchmarks then the iphone still is an absolutely incredibly powerful device both the iphone 11 as well as the 11th pro have the incredibly powerful apple a 13 chip and while yes they may only have four gigs of ram aka one third as much ram as my oneplus a pro here there's something to be said for the sheer leadership that apple has had and continues to have in the actual chip space where it starts to fall behind is when you look at the overall package for example both the 1 + 8 as well as the 8 pro have full-fat 5g built in this sure apple likely bring out a 5g iphone and six months or whatever but i don't care about 6 months from now i care about the experience i can get day no they continue to have their warp charge 30 which will charge the entire phone up to 100% like less than an hour but they also now have warp charge wireless now this thing that i've ding oneplus on many times in the past while the 70 in the seventh pro last year were very very solid they weren't the full package right the camera wasn't really there there was no official water resistance and there was no waterproofing when you look at the a pro pretty much all of those things have been addressed it not only has that superfast wired charging but you almost get the exact same speed using the wireless charging sadly this is not a feature on the standard one plus eight which still has that wired charging that doesn't have the wireless charging and it also doesn't have the reverse wireless charging which i find to be kind of useful but one of the things that really does elevate these phones is the camera experience especially on the 8 pro it is a major step up so first of all with the oneplus 8 pro the 48 matrixyl main camera is much better so importantly just like a lot of others flagship this year they've gone with a much larger sensor which means that you actually get surprisingly good low-light performance with you 12 megapixel mode and when you're out and about with the sort of really nicely lit like daylight conditions 14 megapixels actually looks pretty good unfortunately the night mode really can't hang with something like the iphone or the s20 and while i really like the look of the triple or the 3x telephoto camera on the 8 pro that is sadly something which is missing on the standard 1+8 speaking of the 1+8 it's similar although it still has a on paper 48 megapixel camera is a much smaller sensor and generally speaking i have found the results to be better on the 8 pro and if it being real i still feel like y1 plus is sort of stepped up the game they're still behind something like the iphone or the galaxy and specifically when you look at that iphone 11 at 700 bucks it's kind of a little bit of a tough sell on the oneplus 8 because it just simply cannot compete video is also somewhere where oneplus have well i mean they're trying they're making some progress but really the iphone is the undisputed video champ as far as i'm concerned in smartphones which is a problem because obviously as someone who spends a lot of time working with video the oneplus is not really something i feel comfortable using whereas i will use the iphone to shoot video all day long for the channel is this 1 + 8 pro an expensive phone ab so but you know else is expensive pretty much every other flagship out there right nine hundred dollars is a lot of money but so is a thousand souls fourteen hundred dollars to the galaxy s 20 ultra and so is the other phone that is really tempted me away from ios look i have absolutely no problem recommending the one plus eight or the eight pro there are certainly many many people will be very happy with those phones if you've listened to the test drivers you will know that i am a proud member of the z flip game yes that's what we call ourselves i'm mike early and i am austin's new podcast co-host on the test drivers like when i saw that first galaxy fold i felt like i knew that i'd seen a future i think the jury's still out if folding phones can work for everyone right but i think i could see in that device this was something else this was something different this is something we hadn't seen before and since then there's been a lot of interesting stuff and nothing has caught my attention in the same way that the z flip halves which i know is exactly the same for you i pick up the z flip just to play with it after having owned it for months like not in a all let me check out what's going on on instagram kind of way but like let me just hold this device kind of way because it's so much fun for all the faults of this phone and there are many starting with the absorbent $1,400 price tag but if you could look past that for a second i have found that i have fallen in love with this phone in a way which is not particularly rational but it's also not a way that i've fall in love with a piece of technology in a very very long time now if you can ignore me being a z flip weirdo for a second there are many many downsides to this phone it doesn't have 5g like the one plus does it doesn't have water resistance like the iphone and the one plus does it only has a 60 hertz display like the iphone and unlike the excellent display on the oneplus it only has a single mono speaker as opposed to the stairs because on those other two devices i mean there are many many reasons why this falls behind it also has an older 855 versus a 65 pasa there's a lot of sacrifices that you make but the thing is all those sacrifices in my opinion are totally worth it now am i recommending you to go out and buy a samsung galaxy z clip absolutely not right it is a very niche product it is very much for early adopters the thing is while it might be behind in some areas there's no deal-breaker and that's usually what i look for in something like the moto razor for example which while it had that awesome flippin design fell short in most other aspects but with this for example i have reasonably fast wired fast charging suite i also have wireless charging reverse wireless charging doesn't really matter that maybe this is a little bit slower because i can actually no fit it in my pocket unlike the giant 1+8 pro i've always appreciate something which is a little bit smaller a little bit easier to carry and that's really where the idea of a foldable has made a lot of sense for me being able to unfold the phone and getting much larger display to fold it up and not have something massive in my pocket all day that's what she said is really really helpful i shouldn't have said that you know what this is quarantine content i can say whatever i want coz ken's not here to stop me when it comes to the z flip for example the reason why this has still remained my daily driver is because on top of the small size it has some legitimately really cool features well yes it does have a hole-punch selfie camera and i've used it for stuff like video chats like you've already seen in this video but if i want to actually take a selfie all you do is flip it around and turn on the cover display it makes it really easy to frame up a shot so i could just do this and boom i got a much better looking photo that is taken on the real legitimate camera on the back versus the tiny selfie camera alright i'm gonna say that's not my best selfie but we're gonna ignore that for a second there's also the fact that the phone stands up on its own which i really appreciate when i'm watching video or when i'm scrolling through something or if i'm on a video call and i don't want to have to hold the phone in my hands and yes of course there's the cool factor right this is what is new most people have never seen a folding phone i can't tell you how many times before all this stuff happened that people will be like oh what's that phone hey that's pretty cool it's just something that i appreciate because it still makes me smile right it still makes me excited about technology it's like oh look at this awesome piece of thing look at this piece of glass it's like plastic it folds in half how cool is that right but this comes down to a really fundamental question about what kind of smartphone you want to use i have the incredible luxury to use a wide variety of phones right i get to take a look at most phones that come out and so i kind of get to choose whatever that i personally like and with that being said there are some major advantages in android right now so for example if you want a folding phone not only could you go with the z flip but you could go with the galaxy fold you can go with the moto razor you'd go with what i'm sure will be a large number of folding phones that will be coming out over the next couple years if you want to use ios well you get a slightly smaller option or a slightly bigger option or maybe an older option and that's pretty much it apple has and will continue to make an excellent hardware that works really well with the software i mean there are many things that i feel like i would prefer to do on an iphone and the walk in isn't entirely for no reason while yes there are workarounds for like imessage and facetime but for something like the apple watch there is no great alternative on the android side yes where os exists yes there are many very cool watches but do any of them hold a candle to the incredible work that apple has done over the last five years with the apple watch i would argue not really this is still by far my favorite smartwatch and realistically many days i will go out with my lte apple watch and my galaxy z flip with no iphone in sight because that just feels like even though it's a very odd way of living my life and it's not something i would really recommend but it works for me right because this device is so ahead of the game while the current iphones are absolutely the most complete package that apple shipped in years and the iphone 11 specifically is still a reasonable value especially when you look at some of the competitions such as 1+8 what it isn't is really exciting and when you have these devices such as the 1+8 which while expensive offer 5g and a high refresh rate display at the same price as that iphone 11 it becomes a harder and harder justification especially if you were not already locked in if you have all these apple devices and it's difficult to get your entire family to get away from my message that's difficult right and i will totally admit i'm in that camp too i am not saying that you should toss your iphone in the garbage it is still a perfectly competent device and in many ways it is better than what you can get on the android side of the fence but while yes you can wait until this year or next year or the year after to get 5g and high refresh rate and folding designs and maybe not folding designs but all the stuff will come but i've gotten tired of waiting and honestly the z flip is really what has dragged me away from my ios cocoon of happiness and safety for some more adventurous shores so will i continue to carry my iphone and use it for taking photos and answering family imessage threads yep well i still carry my apple watch and my god it's the z flip most days yep but you know what it is i feel like it is really time for me personally and maybe for you guys as well to consider switching to android it really is a fun brave new world of i don't want to say it's different because obviously android has been great for many years but 2020 feels like the time where you're legitimately getting different experiences that simply cannot be replicated on ios because of that i feel like the grass really is greener at this time subscribe you guys next time i don't get yelled at by ken for making very long dumb videos by myself always happens anyway so time [music]
