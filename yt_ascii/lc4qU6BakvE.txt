ladies and gentlemen it's currently monday july 10 2023 although it might be a different date and time when you're watching this video and right now magnus carlson the best chess player in the world is in the mists of a absolutely ridiculous run in the tournament that he's playing at in zagreb croatia it's called the super united rapid and blitz it's part of the grand chess tour and at magnus at some point in this event pulled off a winning streak of 17 and a half out of 19 games he won 16 games and only made three draws at some point winning i believe 12 games in a row and today is the final day of the event and i'm going to be sharing some of these incredible games with you including plot twists and story lines and so on and so forth yesterday magnus played nine games and he won all nine actually two days ago yesterday i took a break from making videos i hope that's okay with you the destruction continued magnus played nine opponents in this tournament and then he defeated all nine of them you literally can't get more perfect than that magnus sits down he doesn't win the first game he draws the first game but then he was right back at it here we go sit back relax enjoy your one-way ticket to oslo norway where we will witness well technically soccer croatia it doesn't matter when we witness magnus absolutely tear souls out of his opponent d4 d5 and his opponent the young gucci d plays d takes c4 the queen's gambit accepted and magnus plays a sideline doesn't play e3 he plays queen a4 check and wins the pawn back with his queen not the computer's preferred choice but this is a rapid and blitz tournament we don't really care about what stockfish has to say we care about a good easy to play position magnus develops his bishop we have a trade in the center of the board and both sides are left without c and d pawns so the pawn structure is symmetrical obviously the developmental scheme is not symmetrical and gukesh very quickly starts asking magnus some very nagging questions magnus plays the queen back to c2 you will notice that magnus has moved this queen once twice three times four times five times in the first ten moves he's played 10 moves five of them with his queen as i always like to say when magnus is doing this he gets himself into a relatively equal position and it's a sophisticated way of inducing his opponents to put his to put his pieces on kind of targetable squares squares that can be taken advantage of when you move your queen five times in the opening in the first ten moves you're an idiot right you we've all been there e4 e5 queen h5 knight c6 oh no scholared mate didn't work i'm gonna move my queen again and then maybe i'm gonna go over here and then but when he moves this queen five times in the opening it's like oh wow well that's very sophisticated yeah he's still need to get his opponent's pieces out of position in order to explode them later i became more british as that went on it's like golf commentary bishop b4 he takes like this and this is the position out of the opening magnus has what we'd like to call the bishop pair he's gonna put the bishops nice and comfortably in the center of the board and do something like this where he can potentially target target this as well he's giving up the pawn on c3 he's giving up the pawn on c3 because e5 would be very weak and also he has this move and then if the knight takes we would get this this with some pressing inquiries for the black pieces instead of that gukesh plays rook d8 magnus voluntarily gets the literal bishop pair versus no bishops at all and then he plays f4 to try to break out in the center and i mean listen the position is equal according to the computer but this looks really difficult to deal with for black magnus brings the bishops back like this laser beaming rook d4 brings his other rook i mean his pawns are together his bishops are together his advantage is growing and let's not forget that he also has a one and a half minute advantage on the clock which is massive in blitz rook c1 pinning winning grinning spinning swimming slowly but surely advancing up the board with his pieces gukesh's time is slowly running out and magnus lands the fatal blow rook takes g7 that is not the sacrifice of urug that is a laser beam of an attack by these diagonal pieces and that's it because king h8 you can go rook g4 discovered attack pick up the queen or you even have other mates faster mates and magnus got the job done to continue the destruction he beats gukesh his next game he's got the black pieces versus his training partner yvonne strateg from croatia this one is i think they're training partners i might have just completely made that up but it's youtube you know like if journalists make something up actually in 2023 they could do that too anyway if like written authors make something up that's bad but on youtube i can just say they're training partners and now they are so there you go i'm pretty sure they've done some training together magnus plays akaro khan his opponent plays the advanced karo khan we have a very slow maneuvering game the bishop goes back to h7 so the knight could go to f5 in the future the knight takes on c5 and i mean i've played these positions quite a bit myself with the black pieces and i hate them so i'm very interested to see how magnus does it like again like you put your bishop in the corner you block your own bishop if he does it it's sophisticated if you do it it's stupid c4 shot it's trying to open up the position and magnus goes for this approach trying to target this pawn on b2 shotage backs out of the position allows this pawn the pawn to be taken but now he starts an initiative right back into magnus's territory magnus plays b5 allows the knight to c6 and castles completely not afraid of losing the bishop because then he will simply take back with the knight and his light scored bishop is going to that was ah what am i doing there we go bishop d3 bishop runs away you didn't take me now i'm not going to let you take me knight c3 rook c8 kicks out the knight clutch move the bishop trades the bishop trades when you are up material is good to trade pieces and my man is making it look effortless trades a couple of pieces off knight comfortably back let's take stock of the position both sides have two rooks knight and bishop same color bishop one side just has more pawns and that side is going to use this majority to win the game all magnus carlsen needs to win a game of chess is a pawn and in this position he has a pawn on the b file and it's very rare in chess that you have like point a point b point c and it just goes like this magnus plays bishop before brings in his rook doubles up plays bishop c3 rotates the rook over his opponent has to sacrifice some sort of material and that's it the beep on goes white tries to create a little bit of counter play absolutely nothing pawn to b2 bishop takes e5 rook a1 b1 coming shout out to resigns magnus plays akaro khan outmaneuvers his opponent wins a pawn on the edge of the board doesn't in any way fear his opponent's attack trades off several pieces and absolutely effortlessly glides through this game like a hot knife through butter and there we go he's won two games again this is now 14 wins in 15 games okay next game magnus now has the white pieces versus vichy anand legend from india d4 and now yet another queen's gambit accepted maybe vichy saw what he played against gukesh and he was like is he really going to play it against me yup these games happened like an hour apart vishi saw that gukesh had this played against him maybe maybe he didn't and was like ain't no way he's gonna play that garbage against me right so this time he plays knight c6 and e5 this is the top computer line this is technically the refutation of queen a4 and queen c4 in fact i've seen this line like i have played this myself with the black pieces this move e5 it's a very very aggressive and dangerous line vichy plays e5 and the idea is that if you take black plays bishop e6 hitting the queen let's say the queen goes here now the knight blocks the pin and you're gonna win this back bishop e7 and you have a very comfortable position okay you can also play knight c5 hitting the queen all right so that's what vichy does and i was like oh okay so vichy saw what magnus played now he's like magnus not gonna get away with this against me he might have gotten away with it against the young guy not gonna get away with it against me magnus takes like this and knight takes e5 actually is a good move you can play bishop e6 even in this position but then white can take hitting the queen so take take bishop plays knight g4 trying to win the pawn back magnus is like please vishy go ahead win the pawn back you actually can't quite win the pawn back because i'm gonna pin you and then i'm gonna play f4 so to defend against that you need to go here but then i'm gonna go here and then you're gonna have to go here and then i'm gonna go here and then you're gonna have to go here to hit the knight and then i'm gonna go here and then if you move your knight i'm gonna go here and then if you go here i'm gonna go here and i'm still pinning the bishop to the king and i'm gonna win your bishop now in this position you could go here and then if i take potentially you have something here but you don't not right now so this she doesn't take magnus says okay well now you can't take but she says i want the f2 pawn max like you can't have the f2 pawn she's like i want the pawn on e5 magnus is like you know what take it f4 and it turns out vishu was right all along and actually gets a pretty decent position completely equal position slight the imbalance of the pawn structure all right all we have different here is that white has four on this side and black has three magnus plays e4 taking the center vichy plays h5 preventing white from taking a little space and wanting to control the stuff over here magnus develops his bishop there she plays g6 magnus plays g3 but she develops his knight and magnus moves his king and kicks the knight out of the queen side the knight goes back and magnus is like all right let's instigate fishy castles things goes here completely equal position after 20 moves and down 30 seconds on the clock there's no way he's going to win this right in fact hasn't he just lost the pawn what's he doing this she takes the pawn agnes plays e5 looking to play knight e4 but she says all right come get me but here come the bishops magnus really good with the bishops as we saw in the game against gukesh knight c5 the bishops are hammering now knight d3 check is very strong here it comes and vishu is doing very well this is doing very well in this position magnus is now under a minute and he's worse knight e1 check is possible and then magnus will have to sacrifice his rook to not lose any more material but then she goes here maybe he misses it maybe he misevaluates it now the position is back to equal magnum's still poking and prodding it's still equal 48 seconds on the clock magnus goes knight g5 vishi strikes with h4 but now take take and magnus removes the knight from the board all the pieces fall off and it's a rook end game it's a rook end game this she goes for this pawn magnus takes on e6 which she takes here king h3 rook g6 oh no oh no oh no and when it's all said and done two pawns versus one but they're both passers the king is gonna come join the party and this is over vishi just resigns the game because if he tries to advance rook d6 stops this pawn and if something like i don't know rook a3 check the king just marches up to f5 and the game is over you're just going to march your pawns up the board from move 20 for move 30 until the end of the game magnus did not lose any time on the clock he had 40 seconds and he never stopped to think almost at all gliding straight into the rook end game and winning it with rook f6 check and king takes g3 the crescendo of this game was right here and magnus correctly simplified the knight for the bishop the bishop for the knight and the bishop for the bishop into a rook end game don't blink that's three wins in a row that's 15 wins in 16 games okay somebody's got to stop him right how about his former challenger yanyupomishi for the world championship b3 all right one of the best ways to mix it up versus magnus get a very aggressive position he can't take because of the pin magnus plays d6 playing kind of like a pierce nepo plays pawn to f4 a very aggressive move trying to put something on f3 exactly like this magnus castles now we have d3 and jana is going to play bishop e2 and castle and knight d2 and life is going to be good magnus strikes the center with e5 this is kind of the issue with white structures that he's a little bit far behind in development and if you play something like g3 i'm gonna take and you really don't want to open up your king that would be very bad and he goes here but now knight g4 is pinning the pawn to the bishop so jan plays here magnus applies even more pressure to the pawn queen e2 knight ge5 and in this position jan should probably castle long because he can because it defends his bishop and because then he can you know begin some sort of attack and throw haymakers in this position plays the move d4 d4 is obviously a very reasonable move because it attacks the knight and after this this the position looks really nice the problem is white is not castled and even this very subtle move pawn to d4 is just a little bit too early to start striking because you are not castle your king is in the center and you need to defend your center while your king is in the center knight takes f3 knight takes f3 rook to e8 suddenly it's a little bit annoying to castle because of this move how do you defend this if you play knight d2 i'm gonna take on d4 probably knight d2 i think i can just take on d4 maybe i'm gonna take with my bishop maybe i'm gonna take with my knight as it turns out i can't really take on d4 because you have this and you're gonna hit this and this maybe i'm gonna go d5 five e5 knight b4 stuff like this maybe f6 well yawn after bishop f5 plays e5 magnus takes takes again gives a check and just goes here he's just winning he's winning because if this i can just go here you can't take if you take check and i win your queen so if you can't do that you're just the pawn down rook d8 bishop e2 and magnus plays b5 why because of this rook c8 you still cannot take the rook because of this if you go here i have root bishop c2 or rook c2 i'm getting to your king yanyaponishi resigns in 20 moves magnus has won four games in a row and 15 out of 16 games 16 out of 17 games 5 12 16 out of 17 games you just won four in a row four in a row yeah 12 wins before that and one draw 16 and a half yeah the other two he had from the other day he was 17 and a half out of 19. magnus carlson won this tournament with three rounds to go he could not show up to three games and he would still win the event literally he could have just finished this game and left and i got news for you he wasn't finished magnus was not finished even with all this he still wanted to win as many games as possible he wanted to get a historic he wanted to have the greatest grand chess tour run of all time and what better way to do it than with his young rival the the the the young man who he said he would stay and defend the title against ali reza faruja oh for this game i gotta crack my neck knight f3 c5 we get a symmetrical structure completely bishop f4 alireza goes for the bishop magnus says no alireza goes e6 bishop g5 f6 confrontational he's not looking to repeat moves if you if you're a baby what you do in this position after bishop f4 is you go back to f6 others is no baby he plays f6 he plays f5 he sets up a dutch stonewall style structure he's gonna play knight to e4 and he is going to have at it this should be five he doesn't care if matt this is really this is what i love about ferrugia he's like oh oh oh oh oh magnus is what 16 and a half out of 17 so what i'm gonna beat him like i'm gonna beat it it doesn't matter bishop d7 castles bishop d6 now magnus takes the knight so that he can drop his knight into the center of the board 95. keep in mind magnus could forfeit this game and win the tournament he could literally just leave the playing hall and go to the beach and by the way it's croatia i mean the entire coast is beautiful all right i mean you know it's not as beautiful as the new york coast but it's a joke if you go into the water in new york you will come out a lizard castles knight to e2 magnus trying to blockade the dark squares alibraz is like all right well i'm not gonna let you move so this is pinned now rookie one he takes on e5 and plays knight g4 queen h4 is winning by the way because it's a fork so for example i don't know if you try to go here i just ignore you and if you take i'll play here and then i'll go back and threaten maid and then i'm gonna checkmate you and it's gonna be really embarrassing and who's your queen it's gonna be really really nasty okay so yeah he's trying to checkmate magnus and he's also threatening to win a pawn magnus plays the move h3 we have bishop takes e2 the reason why ferrugia did not take this right away is probably he didn't like how magnus would get like a steamroller of a position here on the dark squares he probably was uncomfortable with this knight h5 looking very unpleasant maybe the queen comes in the future so he takes the knight first and now this and now knight takes e5 and and perus is just a pawn up but the game is not over because ferrugia committed all his pawns in the game very early to light squares and now magnus is gonna have a very easy time butchering him on the dark squares but you will notice magnus is down two minutes on the clock he's down two minutes on the clock because he went to the beach and he came no i'm just kidding but he's down two minutes on the clock because personally i think it's very difficult mentally to keep fighting for this record when you've already won the tournament like but it's magnus right he'll find a way b4 you can't take it it looks free it's definitely not free because queen d4 hits the knight and mate now i'm assuming alireza won't hang mate but hanging the knight is just as bad to magnus it's still a loss pawn to a6 magnus plays a4 magnus is playing for a win in this game down two minutes on the clock and a pawn this is what you call goat bonus okay there is a secret jutsu you can activate in chess it's called higher rated bonus and what it means is if you're the higher rated player in the game if you're the more accomplished player in the game things go your way the ball bounces your way so even though you're losing there's going to be moments where you can create chances out of thin air because that's just how it works so magnus is down two minutes on the clock in this game and yet and upon and he's still playing for a win b5 queen d4 is trying to checkmate his young opponent rook c2 queen d4 he's still bullying his opponent rook c4 magnus plays queen a7 oh my goodness takes takes knight g6 bishop d4 the rooks are off the board but magnus has an advantage alireza plays h6 magnus plays rook ca check king h7 b6 trades off the queens and we're headed for an end game e5 bishop c5 pawn takes pawn takes magnus is gonna go rook c at rook c7 he's gonna win the spawn he's gonna win the game this is unbelievable rook d7 rook c8 pawn to d4 rook c7 magnus is winning he's winning the game i mean how did he do this how did he get to an end game down a pawn and he's gonna win but here alireza plays a very trappy move that loses the game rook d5 has a nasty idea behind it the point of this move is that if you play e4 i'm not gonna go back and lose my pawn i'm going to go d3 and you can't stop this pawn that's the idea but it's a losing move if magnus plays king f2 and then e4 if you play d3 i go here and i'm in time and then e4 and then this and i'm gonna win but rook d5 confuses magnus a little bit he takes on d4 and then he slides the bishop back and it's still a fight but i'll leave reza suddenly finds a way to coordinate everybody rook d7 rook d5 and oh my goodness oh my goodness they both queen what's going on here 10 seconds remaining on the clock rook to d2 is magnus getting mated queen b7 is only reza getting mated rook takes d6 queen e4 check and it's looking like a draw because magnus has queen e6 rookie 6 and rook d1 that's it but magnus misses it he misses queen takes e6 he misses queen takes e6 ali rosa escapes he's just a piece up and in an unbelievable turn of events magnus is going to lose this game now it takes ali reza a very long time because even though he's a piece up the threat of a draw is always there but it takes nearly 100 moves and magnus loses his first game in like' games now takes a little while but finally made is unstoppable the king has escaped from the checks and in a cruel turn of events the higher rated bonus ran out rook c7 magnus got to his spot but this tricky move prevented him from kicking out the rook he needed to bring his king and instead of that ali russ's pawn survived and it caused all sorts of headaches for magnus and he loses this game this would have been the the the killer game but okay he could have just gone to the beach right i wanted to show that he was not completely immortal but we've got two more games let's magnus immediately trying to get it back against ali again not against alireza that would be very funny against report we get a very odd opening with a king's indian style sicilian a very locked structure magnus playing a very confrontational f5 b4 knight b5 magnus always looking for a fight sacrificing upon and just going for it he's down upon again it seems like he activates his power when he is upon down b6 kicks out the bishop knight f5 here we go starting an attack on rapport g5 on the way e4 on the way very very tense position report plays knight e4 bishop d5 setting up the cannons it's a good position but there is one problem white's position is rock solid in fact there is nowhere to enter this is all covered this is covered this is covered the report has covered every single square that you can infiltrate on except that one but you know magnus isn't going there anytime soon so magnus is looking he's looking but report in the meantime is also navigating and trades off one of magnus's pieces let's not forget magnus is a pawn down last game he managed to create chances because he had the dark squares but this time he doesn't have many chances queen e6 report plays c4 kicks out the bishop bishop b4 tries to kick out the knight rook f1 taking the open file magnus doesn't have an infiltration spot he starts to use his pawns bishop b5 poking in from that side of the board but look at this rapport is just stubbornly sitting around like come get me you got nothing knight d6 bishop h3 magnus in this position does not have to lose a rook he can go knight f5 pin himself and find this pin the knight and come in with rook d3 i don't know if he saw that this is ridiculous i mean it's very easy when stockfish has to play like this when the knight is pain then you're threatening all this stuff it's not easy to play like this like a human instead magnus sacrifices the rook but it's not enough because report just comes back and he's got the squad he's got the whole pawn squad still a4 has to push the bishop back he loses the pawn on a4 but now a fork queen g2 i don't think magnus has enough pieces bishop c6 he tries but he's not calling the shots in this game reports intelligently defending himself wins upon has to trade and this is it two rooks and a rook and a bishop e5 rook a3 here comes reports king magnus is the goat but it doesn't matter if you're the goat if you don't have the material rook c7 the pieces are pushed back rook b8 rook c8 and that's it agnes has lost two games in a row which was the equivalent by the way of going to the beach he could have just not shown up for these games but every great player ends the tournament strong i think magnus really wanted to win that last game got a little bit over aggressive i mean it's you can't simplify the greatest player of all times play to overly aggressive like that's not you know but magnus ends the tournament by playing whatever the hell this is bishop d3 sicilian knight c6 e5 trades the bishop for the knight plays a very strong central setup with bishop b2 d3 knight d2 stops his opponent from advancing on the queen side and has this very very pleasant position where his opponent has to play c4 because if he doesn't he's just going to play bishop a3 so that's exactly what his opponent does tries to create a little bit of counter play and watch how easily magnus glides through his opponent bishop to a3 hits the rook takes takes rook b3 now again if luke belasco had not played c4 i don't really know what he would have done the computer wants him to go rook a8 i mean i have absolutely no idea what this does i think the computer is just totally out of ideas it wants to park the car back to where it was for no reason at all like so he tries to do something and magnus grabs the rook hits the pawn on c6 takes the pawn on c6 sacrifices the rook because he's going to get the fork takes trades the queens pushes the pawn wins the pawn and lupulasco just resigns it just it just shakes in i mean magnus plays a bishop d3 sicilian then puts the bishop on b5 losing upon in the process because there's knight here and the intention was just to damage black structure so black just says all right i'm gonna go here mag is like all right i traded off my light squared bishop so my pawns are going all on the light squares i have a very nice bind on the position beautiful blockade of your pawns defended by four different pieces and then i'm gonna win your rook and after i win your rook i'm gonna trade some pieces with you we're gonna trade everybody i'm gonna win a pawn and you're gonna resign you're gonna resign because you have absolutely no moves you play knight b2 fork you play knight b6 skewer pin skewer gg so i wanted to show that magnus does bleed and lose every now and then but he went 17 and a half out of 19 in this event he won the event by over three points it was the fourth highest ever grantchester score recorded and if magnus hadn't lost one of those two games he would have tied for first so reports of his death are greatly exaggerated not as perfect of a day as nine out of nine but as magnus himself said today he got six out of nine which is also nice it's not as nice as nine out of nine but as we all know six out of nine definitely nice the goat does it again winning the grand chess tour in emphatic style nine out of nine in one of the days doesn't get much better than that that's all i have for you today i'll see you in the next video get out of here
