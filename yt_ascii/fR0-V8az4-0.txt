if students do this for 90 minutes it decreases the chance they'll drop out of university by 50% so that's how well this works that's quite something okay so here's the here's the game so it's not an easy game but but you can do it badly and it'll still work so so that's a good game so the first part of the game is give yourself the benefit of the doubt for the purposes of the game imagine that the universe would not grind cataclysm to a halt if something as horrible and wretched as you had an okay time so it's hard for people to grasp that because you know you might think of people as selfish and and self-centered and out for themselves all of that most people aren't like that there there's about 4% of people who are like that and like look the hell out for them and they're online trolls by and large and the clinical evidence for that's very clear by the way and they're they're they're it's pretty much them and not you if you're in interaction with them it's all about them but most people are the opposite of that most people are better to other people than they are to themselves you know most people are harder on themselves than they are on anyone else and you know there's something admirable about that because it means to some degree that you're looking out for other people but there's something that's not admirable about it because it means that you're not treating yourself with the respect that someone with your intrinsic worth must have to flourish and so and the problem is of course you know more than anyone else how what the full range of inade inadequacies what your full range of inadequacies most precisely is you also know all the stupid things you've ever done and that's a heavy burden and it's hard to look at yourself knowing what you know about yourself and then think that you deserve anything other than suffering for your sins and so it's really hard for people to treat themselves like they would this is some something else i learned from carl yung you know there's this biblical injunction to treat to love your neighbor as if he were yourself but that sort of presumes you love yourself most people are better at loving their neighbors but there's a it's actually an equation that rule it's like so the first part of the equation is you should act out the proposition that it's incumbent upon you to strive to put your life together so the best possible thing could happen to you you should strive to take care of yourself as if you're taking care of someone you love that's hard because you know you're trouble so that's the first part of the game is you have to play it's like okay let's admit for a second that it wouldn't be the end of the world if i wasn't being roasted over a slow fire all the time for my iniquities i'll give myself a break okay now so that's the first that's hard you got to you got to think that through you know you got to open yourself up to the possibility that the earth wouldn't crack open and swallow you up if you dared to imagine that things maybe could go okay for you if you did the right thing and then the next thing you do is you got to ask yourself a question ask yourself whatever that means it's like how can you ask yourself and get the answer if if you don't know the answer and why do you have to ask the question if you could come up with the answer so you're not really asking yourself whatever that means i don't even know what that means i thought it up well how well you don't how do you think things up you don't know thoughts just appear in the theater of your imagination they just spring out of the void and there they are and you might think well i thought that up it's like have it your way but it's not an explanation it's a theory it's a dream that it's you so imagine you ask yourself a question now the first thing you're doing is admitting that there's something you don't know so that's humility there's something i don't know that i need to know that i could learn if i was willing to learn so what don't you know here's the question 5 years from now you could have what you need and want but you have to specify what it is now you don't have to specify it perfectly because as you move towards it you can improve you know you're going to learn along the way but you got to get you got to be aiming in the right direction vaguely and then you have to move in that direction to learn what you need to learn as you move in that direction so then you think and you have to ask yourself this and then you have to imagine it's like okay i get to have what i want and need what would that look like and maybe you're just stump then you know cu it's such a big question and you've never really asked yourself that and no one else has ever really asked you that either and so you don't even know where to begin cuz you're that lost in the desert that's a good way of thinking about it so in this online program this future authoring program we break it down into seven questions for people my clients used to come to me my students too say well i don't really know what to do what should i do and my answer was i don't know what the hell you should do it's like you're you i'm not here to affirm your identity or to deny it i'm here to help you figure out the pathway forward but if you don't know what to do well here's some guidelines don't just do nothing cuz you can't if you do nothing you you just get old and that's something so there's no doing nothing so you should do something what well why don't you do what other people do if you don't know what to do you start with that so what other people do where do people find meaning in their lives well here's a bunch of different domains most people want an intimate relationship and if you don't well you got to ask yourself what the hell's going on you know are you bitter resentful cynical terrified betrayed hurt traumatized or you might be a misanthrope and you're one of those people who's extremely introverted maybe you're extremely introverted and creative and you just want to go the hell out in the woods and not see anyone and do your creative thing and it's like okay you're one in a million you get it pass but for most people that's just complete bloody rubbish and so they people want to have an intimate relationship okay so you admit that and then you think well if i could have that relationship and it was the one i wanted what would it look like you know and and that can get very detailed how would you how would your family conduct itself if you were sitting around the dinner table you know it's like a norman rockwell painting you know that famous painting of thanksgiving it's like if you could have or maybe you're just having an intimate candlelight dinner with your wife or your husband and you get to have it and it works well what does it look like who are you how are you dressed how are you conducting yourself what are you talking about who could you be if you if you could have what you wanted well you can imagine and you can and your imagination will provide you with an answer and then you can write that down and think well that looks like that' be a good deal that'd be worth making a sacrifice for and then you say well what else do people need well family well that might mean children might mean repairing the relationship with the children you already have might mean your parents if you're fortunate enough to still have them or unlucky enough depending on the parents and maybe you should fix that relationship you know and how do you fix it well you try to find out what you can be grateful about that your parents delivered to you and and then everything left over you see if you can work it out with them and then you think well if i had a relationship with my father that i would want to have what would that look like and then there you go you got some you got some work to do right there [music]
