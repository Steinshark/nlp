do this again sometime. what's your twitter? i'll follow you. i could use a follow, do you, chuck? let's conquer the world. - you might've notice the montage stopped at like $460,000. and that's because not every
time i do something good i put it on camera, like when i bought my little sister a car. you know, of course i'm not
gonna use her as click bait. and tons of other stuff, you know. the point is, not every
time i do something good i put it online. and for those of you wondering where a teenager comes up
with half a million dollars, because today, it's actually my birthday, i just turned 20, so everything you just
watched i was a teenager while doing it, giving away all the money. the truth is, most of the
money came from brand deals. essentially, companies give you money and in return, you just put a 60 second, sometimes 90 second
little ad in your video to drive traffic to their app
or whatever they're doing, and then in return, they give you $10,000. or if you're pulling lots of views, literally five figures, like
tens of thousands of dollars just for a little plug in in a video. which is actually really
crazy when you think about it. so in my case, i'm just the
dumb youtuber making videos, one day quidd calls me, they're like, "yo, we'll give
you 10 grand for a video, "you know, just mention our app." i was like, "that's a lot of money." i was like, "what if i gave
it to a homeless person?" they're like, "yeah,
that'd be really cool." and 10 of those videos
were sponsored by quidd. thank you so much, quidd. without quidd, i wouldn't have been able to make all those videos and been able to change that many lives. quidd, i fist bump you. you guys should download quidd, it's actually a really cool app. one of the videos was sponsored by honey, and then one of the videos
was sponsored by epic games. between those three companies, they are the ones who
sponsored all those videos. well, not all the
videos, but most of them. like when i gave my 3,000,000
subscriber 3,000,000 pennies, that was $30,000, that wasn't sponsored. i don't know, i just didn't feel like having an ad in the video. and when i gave $20,000
to homeless shelters, that wasn't sponsored. there's a lot of them
that weren't sponsored. the point i'm trying to make is not all half the million
dollars came from sponsors, but a good chunk of it did, and a really big chunk
of it came from quidd. i mean, they did 10 videos, where as only two were
sponsored by other people. so just huge shout out to quidd. i think only 100,000 of it, maybe, something like that,
came out of my pocket. you know, the rest came from sponsors. i really appreciate
you guys over at quidd, because i genuinely enjoy helping people. it's something i've always kind
of had an issue with almost, like i'm that much of a nice guy to the point where i see a homeless guy, i give them all the money in my wallet, and then when i get to where i'm going, i can't buy stuff, 'cause i give it to homeless people. i don't know why, right? i'm not saying this to
make myself look good, but i've just always
been a really nice guy. i just have. 'cause i'm gonna be honest, i could've just done those brand deals, and instead of giving it away, i literally could've
just put it in my pocket, like nothing would have stopped me. but just helping people's fun, and that's something i don't
think a lot of people realize. helping people is fun. you don't have to just think of it like, oh, well if i give away money, that's money that's not in my pocket. it's just like you spend
money on entertainment, giving away money is just
as entertaining to me. i, sometimes, would rather
give 20 bucks to a homeless guy than spend 20 bucks on
some form of entertainment. 'cause it's just as enjoyable to me. i don't know if that
sounds selfish, but it is. helping people doesn't
always have to be boring, if that makes sense. like, i try to be creative in the ways i help people in my videos, which kind of like makes it where helping people is actually fun. the only job i've ever
worked is youtube, so yeah. it sounds so scummy, i hate plugging things, it really does sound scummy. but if you do want to allow
me to help more people, right here, shopmrbeast.com,
go buy some merch. we just dropped this shirt that says, "i did it all for the cookie." yada, yada, i know people
are gonna be like, wow, you're plugging your
merch, you're so selfish.
