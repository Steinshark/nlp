again maybe a romanticized philosophical question but when you look up at the stars knowing that you know there's at least a hundred billion of them in the milky way galaxy right so we're really a small speck in this giant thing that's the visible universe how does that make you feel about our efforts here i love the perspective i love that perspective i always opened my public talks with a big hubble space telescope image looking out until you'd mentioned just now the solar system the milky way because i really i think it's really important to know that we're just a small pill blue dot we're really fortunate we're on the best planet by far life is fantastic we know of you're confident this is the best planet planet that we know of i mean i searched my research is you know mission worlds and when will we find life i think actually in probably the next decade we find probably past life probably the evidence of past life on mars let's say you think there was pretty like once life on mars or do you think there's currently i'm more comfortable saying about 3.5 billion years ago feel pretty confident there was life on mars just because then it had an electromagnetic shield it had an atmosphere has wonderful gravity level three 3sg is fantastic you know you're all super human we can all slam dunk a basketball i mean it's gonna be fun to play sports on mars but so i think we'll find past that no fossilize probably the evidence of past life on mars currently that's again we need the next decade but the evidence is mounting for sure we do have the organics we're finding organics we have water seasonal water on mars we used to just know about the ice caps you know north and south pole now we have seasonal water we do have the building blocks for life on mars we really need to dig down into the soil because everything on the top surface is radiated but once we find down will we see any any life form so we see any bugs i live it open as a possibility but i feel pretty certain that past life or you know fossilized life forms will find and then we have to get to all these ocean worlds these these beautiful moons of other other planets since we know they have water and we're looking for since simple search for life or follow the water you know carbon-based life that's the only life we know there could be other life forms we don't know about but it's hard to search for them because we don't know so in our search for life in the solar system it's definitely you know search you know let's follow the water and look for the building blocks of life do you think in the next decade we might see hints of past life or even currently i think so i'm pretty active you humans have to be involved or can this be robots and rovers and probably teams i mean we've been at it on mars in particularly 50 years we've been exploring mars for 50 years great day that right our images of mars today are phenomenal now we know how mars lost its atmosphere you know we're starting to know because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield we know about the water on mars so we've been studying 50 years with our robots we still haven't found it so i think once we have a human mission there we just accelerate things it's always humans and our rovers and robots together but we just have to think that 50 years we've been looking at mars mars and taking images and doing the best science that we can people need to realise mars this really far away it's really hard to get to you know this is extreme extreme exploration we've mentioned magellan first or all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration mars is a different ballgame i mean eight months to get there year-and-a-half to get home i mean it's really extreme environment in all kinds of ways but the kind of organisms we might be able to see hints of on mars are kind of micro organisms perhaps i remember that humans were kind of you know we're hosts right we're hosts all of our bacteria and viruses right do you think it's a big leap from the viruses in the bacteria to us humans put another way do you think on all those moons beautiful wet moons that you mentioned you think there's intelligent life out there i hope so i mean that's that's the hope but you know we don't have the scientific evidence for that now i think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing is much more compelling again because we have the building blocks of life now when that life turns into intelligence that's a big unknown if we ever meet do you think we would be able to find a common language i hope so we haven't met yet it's just so far i mean do physics just play a role here look at all these exoplanets 6000 exoplanets i mean even the couple dozen earth-like planets or exoplanets that really look like habitable planets these are very earth-like they look like they have all the building blocks i can't wait to get there the only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away so scientifically we know they're there we know that they're habitable they have you know everything going from right like you know the goldilocks zone not too hot not too cold just perfect for how to have the ability for life but now the reality is if they're ten at the best to a hundred to thousands of light-years away so what's out there but i just can't think that we're not the only ones so absolutely life life in the universe probably intelligent life as well you
