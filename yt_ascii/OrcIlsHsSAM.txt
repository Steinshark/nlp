hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about break by wire so what is break by wire is it safe and the vehicle we are going to be using to demonstrate break by wire is this audi e-tron sportback so this is audi's all-electric e-tron and this is the sportback version so it's got that swept roofline in the back and so what is brake by wire well essentially it just means that you have electronic control of your brakes so when i touch the brake pedal it's not actually i mean it is creating pressure i do create pressure when i press on that brake pedal but that pressure is not doing anything what's doing something is an electric pump so it's electronically controlled so what's actually happening well i press on the brake pedal and there is a position sensor for that brake pedal and so when i am actually pressing on it there is a resistance to that but that resistance is artificial so you have essentially a simulator that's simulating that feel for you and so you know the the engineers can design this brake pedal to feel however they wish so they have complete control over that and there's a simulated feel to it but what the system is doing is monitoring where is your foot on that brake pedal using a position sensor and that position sensor goes to a brake control unit which says okay here's how much pressure we should apply to the brakes here's much deceleration we want now this is quite common in electric cars and hybrid cars because you also use regen so when i press on this brake pedal and my braking my desired braking is less than 0.3 gs of deceleration well essentially what the system is going to do is just use the electric motors and just use regen the mechanical brakes the disc brakes aren't going to be doing anything it's just going to be energy fed back to the batteries and using those electric motors to slow it down when that position sensor goes past the point at which it says okay they want more than .3 gs of deceleration they want to really stop 0.3 is actually quite a bit i mean it's a significant number i think nissan leaf is doing 0.2 g and even that is a significant amount of braking when you feel it you know just at 0.2 g so 0.3 g is fairly significant here in the audi so once you go past that threshold then there is an electric pump which is going to create the pressure for those individual brakes so you're taking out that direct control from the driver and the common concern here is well what if it fails and so it's like yeah they've thought of that there's no worries and so you'll notice in the the diagram of how this works there actually is a path for that brake fluid from what is essentially your master cylinder to get to your individual brake pads normally that pressure is routed elsewhere but there is a redundancy in the system that's monitoring whether or not it actually functions and if for any reason this system were to fail immediately a valve opens up and now your brake pressure from your pedal actually does go to the individual brake pads the pistons applying pressure to those brake pads so in that scenario in that worst case scenario where everything is to fail you still can stop now a lot of people look at this system and say that's not actually break by wire and i think well first of all it is break by wire i mean it's what audi calls it it's what corvette calls it in the c8 it's what all the companies are calling it because it is electronic control of the brakes the computers have control ultimately there are certainly varying brake by wire systems out there and i think eventually it probably will be more common that you don't even have a hydraulic system involved and you can take out some of the complexity of these hydraulic brake systems that are doing you know both electronic brake by wire and have the full redundancy of the hydraulic system but for now that failsafe exists now in pretty much all driving scenarios always it's never going to be used it's only used if it fails and so probably most owners will never ever ever know what their actual brakes feel like because it's not going to fail i mean it's it's a low risk item and if it does fail hey it still works you still slow down so why would you incorporate a system like this well i think one of the main advantages comes from a safety standpoint in that the car has more control over the brakes versus a traditional system so in safety scenarios where it needs to control specific pressures to those brakes that control is all there electronically i think also you know thinking about from a field perspective when you have a car that's switching between mechanical brakes and electric regen then you can kind of have this weird transition period in your brake pedal and so with this brake by wire system the brake pedal is going to feel the exact same no matter what so you know if it's just using regen or if it's using the mechanical breaks you're just getting this artificial feedback which to you you know the oblivious consumer it just feels like you're breaking it doesn't feel different than what you're already used to so i think there's reasons why you know you don't want to make it feel weird and strange when you have that blend from using regen to switching over to the mechanical brakes and then you can also eliminate some of the chatter like if you're to stand on the brakes and get abs you can improve the way that that feels to the driver so it doesn't feel strange or alarming it's just stand on the brakes you come to a halt very simple so how about the audi e-tron sportback this is my first time driving any of the e-tron so i'm excited to get to try out another mainstream electric vehicle and i think the problem from my end is that i approach cars as an enthusiast and i think that's a dangerous thing to do in this scenario we'll get into kind of why but you know they're trying to make a car that feels normal it doesn't feel like this giant leap this weird revolution when you get into this thing it's gonna feel a lot similar to what you're already used to so a few of the technical details this has dual motors there's a larger motor in the rear and the rear motor is more efficient so it's doing most of the work most of the time if you don't need the power it's mainly going to be using that rear motor for efficiency now typically you have about 350 horsepower 400 pound-feet of torque and then you can put it into this boost mode sport mode and you get an additional you know 50 horsepower and you're at about 400 horsepower and 490 pound-feet of torque so with the boost mode you know you put your foot down it certainly is quick 0-60 in 5.5 seconds so you know for the price range yes there are vehicles out there that are quicker i think when you start comparing it to internal combustion alternatives 5.5 is very quick and you do have that very quick immediate you know off the line acceleration so let's talk about this battery because this is where you get into the conversation of this is just made for the everyday driver not the enthusiast so it is a 95 kilowatt hour battery pack they've updated it since the previous year and so it's a larger battery pack and they give you 91 of that to use so you get to use 86.5 kilowatt hours there's no choice on the end of the consumer of hey where do i charge this thing to and i think that goes back to that enthusiast argument like i have a tesla and in that tesla you can set hey what do you want to charge your battery to but that's something you have to think about in order to maintain the longevity of that battery without either saying look we don't want the customer to have to focus on that they don't need to think about it they just need to get in it and everything works and it's no different than what they're used to so it charges up to a hundred percent which is using you know 86.5 kilowatt hours there's a buffer left there so that the battery has a long you know duration it's going to last a long time without degrading versus if you were to constantly be charging it up to 100 percent which causes lithium-ion batteries to lose their useful life so there's many indications to me that this is designed in a way that it's not supposed to just feel like revolutionary it's supposed to feel very normal except it's electric so you get the benefits of electric it's quiet you know have very quick response you've got plenty of torque those advantages you get which all make a ton of sense in a luxury vehicle you know you don't have gear shifts so it's it's seamless as far as the acceleration everything that you would want in a luxury vehicle electric cars are very good at and so that makes sense in this aspect but you know they don't have you thinking about hey what do i want to charge my battery to they don't you know when you let off the accelerator pedal you can choose if you want aggressive regen but naturally it's just going to coast it's going to feel just like you're driving something else another thing when you start up the car it says to put it in gear you know turn the engine on and it's like you you read that as like an eevee enthusiast and you're like i don't know that seems a little weird but if you think about it as just like a normal person is going to buy this car and drive it they're going to read that message and you know maybe it should just say turn the car on if you want to move but they're certainly going to know what hey turn the engine on to put it in gear means gear being you know drive reverse neutral even though it's just one gear that you're using to drive so the driving experience as a whole caters to just not having to do too much extra research about what is an eevee you know and how does it work and what do you need to do to drive it it's very simplified in this strategy and like from my perspective as an enthusiast i want that control i want to be able to say okay this is what i want to do and you can change the regen settings here but like you can't go in and say oh i want all 95 kilowatt hours of the battery for this brief moment okay so let's talk about range full charge this claims epa rating of 218 miles when i plugged it in charged it all the way up the readout set about 240 miles of range and of course that depends on how you drive but about 220 miles of range now i think the important discussion is you know how much range do you get based on the size of the battery and the weight of the battery and this is actually a very large battery 95 kilowatt hour and a very heavy battery this car weighs about 5700 pounds so this is quite a bit of heft you are rolling around in and so for the size and the weight of the battery i don't think the range alone is all that impressive that said i think there's this conversation that needs to be had about evs that we don't need massive range in a lot of scenarios and so i think the big advantage right now that tesla has in the fact that they have you know very high epa ratings for range is that because evs are new people are scared about range and in reality you know someone buying this this is probably going to be in a two-car garage like it's going to be sitting with another car it's part of a family and they've got two vehicles and for everything around town you'll almost never ever need 200 miles and yes if you go on road trip it's and it's your only car then you have to use that charging network there's an electrify america network for vehicles like this in order to use and that's when range actually starts to matter but in the majority of cases where you're charging at home and you're just driving around town and you have multiple vehicles evs don't need really high ranges and so from me when i look at the range of this 220 miles 218 miles that's plenty i think the unfortunate news is the size of the battery and that's what you get there are cars that can certainly go further on the same amount of energy so that's the disappointment not that the range isn't that high i don't think you know looking at 200 mile evs you got to be thinking oh that's not enough range for me just base it on your scenario if it's going to be your only car and you have to take long road trips yeah then it's something you have to think about if there's multiple cars at your household and this is the one for everything around town then you know it's an easy decision it makes so much sense and 200 miles is more than enough and there's plenty of lower range evs that make sense in that scenario and so that's where you can start to pull out price when you can start to have lower range smaller battery pack lower priced evs and it feels like the market is kind of a bit scared of that right now because evs are new we don't want to have something that only has 100 miles of range or 150 miles of range it has to be 300 when you know in reality you really don't need that depending on the use case okay so audi e-tron sportback versus e-tron why would you get the sport back and the only thing i can think is appearance i think that's really its only big advantage i could be wrong but i think that's about it you're going to get more cargo space with the regular e-tron and actually what i was surprised to see this has a lower drag coefficient because of the shape so 0.28 which i would assume would mean it's going to have better highway range real world that said its epa rating range for this is four miles less than the regular e-tron so i don't exactly know why that occurs and why the one that is more aerodynamic 0.28 cd versus 0.3 cd that's strange to me but that's how it played out so you get more cargo space you spend less money and you have more range if you go with a regular e-tron if you get this one subjectively you may think that it looks better so i would probably go with the regular e-tron and finally what's this thing like to drive so maybe it's because for the past two and a half years i've been regularly driving electric cars to me it's not a you know revolutionary remarkable experience it feels very normal except you get the benefits of an ev and i think the other good thing they have going for them is the ride quality of this vehicle i think a big part of that is how heavy it is but it has a nice air suspension very good ride quality very comfortable in here it's quiet in here you get the response and the torque of an electric car which is fantastic so i think you know it's it's a genuinely decent option from a value perspective i think you know you put this side by side with the tesla model x the model x has more range it has more power it's got all those enthusiast things so there's certainly a value proposition to be had and and that's something you got to consider you know which one do you like more but overall i think it's very cool that this car exists and i think for a lot of people that are skeptical of the eevee market driving something like this would be like oh oh actually they're pretty cool they're pretty normal there's nothing bizarre about it and so i think that's a good thing about it anyways that's a description on break by wire and the audi e-tron sport bag thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below you
