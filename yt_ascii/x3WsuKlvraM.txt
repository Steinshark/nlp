oh hi there i'm just kidding i wish it was that candid i thought i would do a that was a really lame joke maybe we should start again thank you i thought i would do a video today going through my career in tech thus far from someone who didn't go to school for computer science or really anything that technical going into starting as a quality assurance analyst then moving very quickly to a software developer staying a software developer senior developer leading a team of developers for just under five years and now to a developer advocate i wanted to share with you my journey how i base my career decisions how i decide what is the next best step for me to take how i calculate what i'm going to do with my path moving forward and all of that okay let's get started if this isn't your first video you know what the next thing is that we need to do in order to continue this conversation which is really the main thing you need to do when you work in tech we need to go get some more coffee let's go come on [music] okay got the coffee but it's too hard to film and carry coffee so i'm gonna leave it in the car while i film this for a little bit here oh gotta lock it that is important there we go okay so i thought i'd come by the beach to do this talk because i mean what's more beautiful like look at this [music] it's really beautiful and peaceful but back to the story so i started actually out in qa quality assurance because it was working for a company that i really wanted to work for it was a startup in toronto and i knew there was a lot of opportunity for growth and a question i get asked often around that is well when you started as a qa did you tell them up front that you wanted to be a developer and the answer to that is honestly i didn't and i think it's looking back i would have because i think it's super important to be transparent but at the time i was just kind of taking things day by day as they came my way i didn't know what life or my career had in store i knew i was still learning how to code i knew i wanted to be a software developer but i was still kind of just figuring it out as i went so started out in quality assurance was doing that for i didn't do it for very long because i knew i wanted to do software development so i did that for about four to five months i would say and during that time i get asked another question i get asked often is well how did you transition into software development and what i did is and i give this advice to anyone who wants to make that transition is simply you have to take initiative no one is going to hold your hand throughout your career you have to take initiative you have to be your biggest cheerleader so often even though it is a lot of times uncomfortable so what i simply started doing was picking up little defects and bugs that the developers were working on i developed a relationship with the developers at the time and said hey can i pick up these small defects small bugs i think i found a solution for some of them and started just taking initiative showing that i'm not only interested but i actually am taking the steps towards becoming a developer and look at this i can solve these problems i can solve these defects and i mean i still had a long way to go but i was so determined and just completely let my ego go in the sense that maybe sometimes i was asking really silly questions maybe sometimes i didn't know what the heck i was doing but i just kept on pushing forward knowing that it would lead to something great and that's one of my biggest pieces of advice that i would give to you if you are looking to break into tech or if you're already into tech and want to take the next step in your career is let go of your ego as i mentioned earlier and be your own biggest cheerleader there will be times in your career where people will really have your back and truly believe in you and and want you to get to the next step but unless you are taking the steps to get to that next step to get to whatever it is you are going after on your own people aren't going to do it for you that's the reality you need to take initiative and do it so from there i started out doing back back-end i was focusing on node and express and i absolutely loved it i mean it was so challenging but i knew it was exactly what i wanted to do and i loved back in development building different apis working with my sql it was so much fun it was a really small team and it was exactly what i needed to do and that's another thing too if you are looking to really learn a lot grow a lot working with people that you can trust and that have your back is so important as well and that's something you can tell even from the interviews is how do these people react to who you are when you ask questions what is their response do they take time to actually engage with you do they care about you and your growth and that's really important as well when you are thinking about your next step so i started on back in development did that for a while for a few years and the startup scene was amazing i really enjoyed it i really enjoyed having a vision building together but as someone who had never worked at a big company at that time i thought okay i need to try a big company so i went to a big company as a software developer and it was a completely different experience both were positive just different experiences okay we got our coffee we got a little walk and then of course if you've watched my previous video about leaving my current job as a software developer and starting a new job in september you know i am transitioning into a developer advocate role and that really came from having done software development for just under five years i was ready for my next step in my career and for me as i mentioned in that video it was definitely developer advocacy and how i really got into that role and pursued those kind of interests was i was doing so much of this skill set already with tiff and tech that it just made sense and i had those skill sets already existing very strongly was doing a lot of that so i was like wow this is exactly what i want to do and and i transitioned into that and once again it was one of those things that no one was holding my hand to do it no one was gonna you know push me along you have to do it on your own you have to be your biggest cheerleader and truly believe in yourself even when people are questioning you or wondering what the heck you are doing just believe that will work out and get comfortable with being uncomfortable because that's the only way you are going to grow and i know i say this a lot but because it's so true you need to put yourself in these uncomfortable situations not situations that are negatively uncomfortable but situations where it you can feel it means you are growing and i think that's so important to always be growing and evolving and no you don't have to you can stay a software developer your entire career path and have a great career you don't need to do the promotions or grow in roles you can stay the same and grow you know senior et cetera and it really depends on what you want to do in your career but my biggest thing my biggest takeaway from all this would be to be open be open to new opportunities that come your way be open to different roles that you might have not heard about be open to changing your career path because if you have it so set in stone that you aren't willing to take some steps outside of the path that you have planned for yourself a it's not going to be fun it's going to be kind of boring and b who knows opportunities that you are missing okay i hope you enjoyed hearing a little bit more about how i transitioned from qa software developers senior developer dev lead to now developer advocate and i hope if you take anything away from this video it is that as i just summed up constantly be growing be comfortable with being uncomfortable even if you're uncomfortable with being uncomfortable just put yourself in that and just small steps it doesn't have to happen overnight and you've got this you're capable of more
