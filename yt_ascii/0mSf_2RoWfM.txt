oh what is even the point to learn how 
to code when ai is just going to take   over my job spend all this time see 
this laptop it's going out the window and what is the point okay before we really dive into how to use these 
ai tools to help us with programming we first need   to know about the history understand the history 
of ai and why it became all of a sudden so popular   today 2022 was a massive year for ai there are 
so many ais that was released it really caught   on and we started to see the rise of ai if you 
will so many new apps came out so many new waves   came out around what was possible with ai and 
it became most importantly more accepted and   embraced by the public the first quarter of 2022 
saw incredible advancements that started to come   out to the public with ai especially in terms 
of image and text to image generators think of   mid-journey think of dolly too these were all 
products that the public was able to finally   play around with and get really excited about they 
allowed for people to quickly generate unique and   high quality content that could be used for 
different purposes this is one of the first   times that ai really started to get hype from the 
general public now their housing cases in the past   for this happen but not to this degree people were 
really starting to catch on to ai and it being   able to generate art in november of 2022 is when 
things really started to open up we saw openai   really chat gpt and things immediately started 
to change chat gpt an advanced conversational   generator that answered questions with human-like 
responses really human-like responses the product   immediately gained so much popularity and actually 
within five days of the release of chachi pt it   gained 1 million users a put up on screen here 
a graph because i think it took instagram i'm   going to quote it wrong i think it was six months 
or so i'll put a graph on screen but you can see   just how quickly ai this chat gbt ai has been 
catching on people are gravitating towards it   think of ai as a tool to help you so there are so 
many other tools that you use in your day-to-day   when you are coding think of ai more so as a 
tool that will help or assist you so we use   tons of different tools in our everyday coding 
already and this is just an additional one it   doesn't have to be look looked at as the sense 
of this is the tool that's going to take over   my job just because it knows how to code a bit i 
mean even before we had chat gpt there was what   is that popular one i'm blanking now give me 
a sec github co-pilot of course we had github   co-pilot and this has been around or used anyways 
by the public more frequently or longer than chat   gpt and then for some reason because chat gpt got 
into all this hype the fear that came along with   it was real or it felt real anyways but rather 
than looking at it as something that's going to   take over your job start looking at it as a tool 
similar to google similar to stack overflow these   are all tools that we use or resources we use 
on a day-to-day basis and now ai it's providing   us some more tools more in-depth tools also on 
the note of ai being such a widely used tool i   want to share with you some other tools that you 
can use that maybe will help you in other areas   in your coding career and i'll list them down here 
okay in this video we are talking a lot about chat   gpt of course because it's mainly the one that's 
been hyped up for so many of us and honestly i   actually really like using it it's very i know the 
data hasn't been updated since 2021 but otherwise   it's still extremely valuable and helpful and i've 
really found it helpful in my career thus far this   brings us to the question though what programming 
languages should we focus in on to use these tools   most effectively the first programming language 
i'd probably focus on is python and also too i'm   walking through central park during this video and 
let's check out this view so i had focus on python   is because it's so versatile there are so many 
areas that you can use it there are so many things   you can do with it and it's one of those things 
that if you are just starting out in your coding   career and you don't necessarily know what route 
you want to take do you want to be a front-end   developer back-end developer data scientists there 
are so many different roles that's starting with a   programming language that is as flexible and 
widely used as python is a great way to go also   too i've been doing a lot with chat gbt and python 
and i feel like it really likes python and knows   python so it's a great programming language 
to start learning with the help of ai another   programming language that i would really suggest 
if you are just starting out in your coding career   or coding journey is to pick up javascript this 
is the first language that i picked up and i would   still really recommend it today mainly because 
once again similar to python is very flexible   and can be used for a lot of different things so 
whether you are building on the front-end side of   things or maybe you're building on the back end 
it is one of those things that you can start your   coding journey without having to fully commit as 
to what role you want and another thing on that   note is you can progress in your career maybe you 
start out in one area with this language and you   can grow into a different role that uses it for 
other things there's it's multi-purpose i guess   you could say so at this point python javascript 
maybe it's another language i didn't list here   i would focus on though taking a tutorial going 
the old-fashioned way if you will versus learning   directly with chat gpt at this point instead of 
just focusing on chat gbt for your beginning of   learning i would focus on taking a tutorial 
now this is where chat gbt though can come in   handy still around asking you questions about 
the fundamentals and understanding if there's   you're taking a tutorial and there's an area 
that you still don't really understand you can   ask it to explain it to you let me show you 
and on that note when you are starting out   and wanting it to explain things to you it can 
be kind of generic let me show you what i mean   all right so in chat gpt now once again i'm so 
lucky i got in because i feel like it's always at   capacity i'm gonna buy i'm gonna upgrade i think 
i'm gonna pay all right let's start explain to me   like an engineer i think that's really important 
too to put how you want it explained so do you   want to explain like a kindergarten teacher 
do you want to explain like a chef how do you   want to explain well my crisp microphone 
okay explain to me like an engineer what   the benefits of using python are let's 
just start with something really simple okay you can see it gave pretty high level of 
why python is so in demand and why you should   learn it but it's really good to start with 
understanding that why is that's one thing   i really missed when i i didn't do until later 
in my career which came to bite me is i didn't   understand why i was doing the things i was 
doing meaning why was i learning javascript   like why not python why not java i just 
was like this is what's put in front of   me this is what i'm gonna learn versus actually 
taking time to understand what it is used for   the thought behind it why use for example react 
over angular or view over react or whatever the   case is the whys behind things instead 
i just started building and that's not   a bad thing but at some point in your journey 
you will have to answer those questions those   whys because that will differentiate you 
from a great engineer to an okay engineer   all right let's get a little bit more technical 
here let's ask it give me an example of how to   python script and explain to me what it does so 
let's start getting into some examples like we're   starting with the basics you are just learning 
you are using chat gpt to learn let's see all   right so it's writing a script for us while 
it's generating let me have my coffee again okay so what it did was generate a script or 
import pandas library which is extremely popular   and it's actually a really great thing though if 
you are learning python for example or javascript   or whatever the cases you are learning i'm just 
using python in this example because we've been   doing a lot with python lately and pandas is 
a library that is extremely popular for data   manipulation and a data manipulation library 
in python and it explains to us what is going   on throughout this code so what is the benefit 
here well if you were taking a tutorial i know   i i'll list some tutorials here or whatever the 
noise is i don't know if i should use at sound   effect or not but here are some good tutorials 
to take and then as you're going through one of   the biggest things that i really struggled with 
was the instructor maybe didn't fully explain   something or i was kind of like a little lost and 
then i'd asked the question say i was taking a   udemy course i would ask the question in the chat 
and it would take days for that person to respond   and i paid money for this do you know what i mean 
whereas this is if you're taking a course whether   it be one of the courses i shared with you or 
or not you can actually just ask it to explain   to you what exactly it is or start from start 
from the basics another way is to get it to quiz   you actually get it to create a quiz for you or 
create questions for you that might be asked in   an interview setting and you can create quizzes 
that are technical soft skill related however   you want to so i just have on screen here an 
example literally just typed in quiz me some   python interview questions and what it generated 
is a list of 10 questions now listen maybe some   of these questions aren't common in interviews 
for example an interviewer might not ask you the   generic question what is python but these are 
questions that will really help you prepare for   an interview you should be able to explain what 
is python in a few simple sentences you should   be able to explain these things how do you write 
a unit test in python how do you open and read a   file in python the interviewer may or may not get 
this specific but these are good challenges for   you to go along as you are learning to be able 
to understand your level of knowledge are you   able to do this and it really also helps you feel 
more confident as well when you are going into   the interview this is a great way i think one of 
the best ways actually to really start practicing   four interviews when you as you are learning so 
you can start literally from day one or two and   questions that really entice you or interest you 
like wait i really want to dive into that how do   i write a unit text in python and there you go 
if you're confused as to where to even start with   your learnings this is actually a great way to 
go as well starting with interview questions and   narrowing down on what interests you or inspires 
you the most you can also use it to help you debug   and explain code this is great as you progress 
in your learnings that when you're coding on   your own you might not understand something or 
maybe you're still in the tutorial portion of   it and you need it explain it in a different way 
also tip actually let me show you and this can be   code that you are getting explained to from your 
tutorial maybe you're onboarding at a new company   or in this example i have free code cam up on the 
screen here and i literally just did i searched   up samples of python code and this is a really 
actually this is a link this free code camp down   below because let me scroll up without making you 
dizzy here it is very long article it's a really   helpful article because it does go through what 
they will cover for different topics in python   so if i go to let's go to recursion because that's 
so hard to explain especially or grasp when you're   first learning so it does do they have in their 
own blog a little article or a little summary of   what exactly recursion in python is but if you're 
having some trouble still understanding it let's   let's go let's do this in the fibonacci function 
copy it go in here and then go explain to me and   then once again this is key explain to me 
as an engineer as a kindergartner however   you want so i'm going to say explain to me 
in very simple terms what this code does   i think say explain to me what 
this code does and you will get   a response but the more specific you 
are the better result you will get says i'm gonna be so i'm gonna be 
up all day like all night from all   this coffee and drinking today i'm telling you see here this cone defines a function called 
fibonacci and takes input of n the function   calculates an nth number okay i'm not gonna read 
this whole whole thing too i'm going to put you   to sleep here you can pause this if you want to 
read it more but it is really breaking it down   and it's one of those things that if you don't 
understand a specific part of the explanation   you can even copy it and say explain this to 
me further and it's just so powerful i'm kind   of i i'm really mind blown i know i shouldn't be 
because i work intact but it's moving fast but i   wouldn't be doing this video justice if i didn't 
really explain to you what not to use chat gpt for   because that is almost more important than what 
to use it for when learning also look at this view you might be saying well tip why not this 
seems perfectly fine this is what it's there   for and while i kind of agree with you to certain 
points you have to be aware especially when you   are learning to code that you need to know what 
is going on with the code if you were literally   just telling chat gpt or any ai service to just 
code for you a it's not going to scale that well   if at all actually b you're not going to know 
what it's doing and in turn you're going to   spend so much time debugging and working through 
errors that you're going to spend your time on   that which is a good way to learn as well versus 
actually learning though the fundamentals chatgpt   is a great tool to help assist you and as you 
grow in your programming career maybe there   will be times where you you will use it or tools 
like it to write different functions for you or   and build more code for you but at that point 
when you are doing that you will already   understand as to the purpose behind it when you 
were first starting out learning to code do not   use these tools to code for you in turn yes you 
might get more coding done faster we'll build   projects faster but you won't really know what is 
going on behind the scenes and that can get very   difficult then when you go for interviews you are 
explaining code and genuinely want to grow your   skills you need that foundation all right i hope 
you enjoyed this video a little tour of new york   while i embarrass myself filming in public for you 
because i love you all so much and i hope this was   really valuable as far as how i would learn 
to code again in today's environment with the   use of chat gpt or other ai tools and if you are 
someone who is learning to code leave down below   what programming language you are learning 
and i will see you all soon thanks everyone foreign
