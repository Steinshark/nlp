so today we're going to be talking about software engineering interns salaries now i've seen videos like this before done in the past and it's always you know top 10 salaries for from the big companies the the big four you know big fang top five blah blah blah companies or whatever the new acronym is i'm gonna go through the averages and then i'm gonna discuss how they varied against you know the money i made at my internships to kind of give you a sense of what you might want to expect from an internship so welcome back to the show my name is jason goodison i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i'm a six-time intern across three countries so i have a very wide range of software engineering interns salaries and you're going to see that today i can't wait to show you guys these salaries so what i'm going to do is waterloo the school that i went to makes you do six internships so they have an average documented what the average is it's actually a well-known thing it's documented i'm going to show it to you so they updated it now they actually have different earnings based on the country so you'll see canada and you'll see america so i'll discuss both of them i can probably fit them both right here for you all right so i'm just going to discuss the canadian salaries i'm going to discuss the american salaries kind of how they differ you know this is for waterloo students so the american salaries aren't for american people they're for canadian people that go to waterloo they got an internship in america so if you look at this right here i'll put it up here these are the canadian salaries and i'll discuss how they differ and how they vary from my own salaries and i think it's important for you guys to see kind of what a real journey is like as opposed to just the flashy stuff so'' an hour in your first one you know that's actually really good so when i was an intern when i was doing my first work term six years ago now it has to be wow i'm getting old six years ago now the average was 15 an hour so now it's'. you know i thought i was pretty slick back then because i got' dollars an hour for my first internship but that's clearly the average right now i mean if you factor in inflation maybe that makes sense take into consideration my first internship was not a programming one i actually just helped people fix their computers it was a service desk job so you know people called me i said have you tried turning it off not again you know the old trick every year it jumps by about i'll say one and a half dollars in canada you're really making like linear jumps in terms of salary for your for your internships so you know i'll discuss my canadian ones i got' i got around 20 for my second one for my third one i got about 22. all these numbers are really accurate for my internships so then in my fourth internship i got in a company in america it's called toast they're based out of boston and they are fantastic company i'm actually wearing the shirt right now so shout out to toast if you get an opportunity to work there i would take it so if i jump back over to the american work term ones what you'll see for the fourth internship is you'd be expecting to make forty dollars an hour wow that's a lot more than i made my third my fourth internship in america now i know the salaries have changed quite a lot since i worked there but when i was at toast i think the salary was about 27.50 an hour something like that and i know they've increased it significantly and that would make sense to to go with this average for now work term five i was in yahoo and the average is 42 an hour that you'd be making in your your fifth internship that's about what i made but on top of that you don't only make money through you know your salary you're usually given a stipend if you live in the states one of these big companies bring you over they usually provide you with a stipend the one at yahoo was about 6k so it was about 1500 a month for your rent and i think i used i paid 1250 for rent you know in sunnyvale california what does that get you well it gets you like a really dingy place with cockroaches and you know you survive 12 50 and i actually did have cockroaches that actually did happen my sixth internship is gonna be a bit different than the ones they have here i could have went back i could have tried to get one of the you know top five fang companies or something like that but i decided instead i think once you hit that point where you're making over 40 an hour's an intern you know if you don't need the money and that the schooling is not that expensive in canada if you don't need it you got to try something different you got to experience new things so i did my sixth internship in ireland and i worked in dublin i actually went back to toast and i worked at toast's dublin office it was fantastic experience however i was not making anything near the money that people were making here so in the canadian salaries you'd be making about 26 dollars an hour if i'd stayed in canada for america i'd be making about 43 an hour american in a in ireland the salaries for your software engineers are much lower i think i was probably making closer to' euro an hour call that 23 canadian an hour so it's on the lower side for sure but you know that experience to be in a different country to be you know experiencing different culture i think is fantastic and it's definitely worth it so there you have it you know you've got the you've got the salaries in canada they go up pretty steadily you get the ones in america they go up much quicker but they start much higher right now i have talked about all the salaries i know it's very flashy very glowy and you know money is important i get that but don't forget about you know growing and learning as a person you're going to want to learn the best you're going to want to learn specific technologies maybe you're going to want to learn in a fast-paced environment i always found that the internships at the smaller companies were the ones where i got the bigger role i mean that's why i love toast so much toast threw me in there as you know just a regular employee a regular engineer and i wouldn't trade that experience for an experience at just a fang company just to get the name on my resume your building skills you know you're becoming more rounded as a software engineer as long as you're getting those responsibilities at work you know it's gonna pay off in the end you're gonna get the job you want so before i leave i really hope
