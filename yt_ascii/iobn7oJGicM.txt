as you know we are currently crowdfunding a beautiful storybook written by myself and illustrated by heather ponton called snow white and the widow queen it really is a desire to recapture storytelling to dive back into the old stories and i thought that as we're thinking about fairy tales it might be a good idea to put out some old patron only videos that i've done over the years which interpret fairy tales it'll give you a good idea of what those videos look like what it means to subscribe to the symbolic world but it'll also be you know a good time to celebrate these fairy tales we'll start with sleeping beauty and look at why she pricks herself on a spindle but then we will move on to snow white jack and the beanstalk and maybe a few more so if you haven't yet please back snow white and the widow queen and in the meantime enjoy [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so as many of you know i am working on some fairy tales working in part now right now i'm working on a version of sleeping beauty and i've been thinking a lot about sleeping beauty i guess for years and there's one thing that i really kind of bother me i guess it was the question of the spindle like why does she prick her finger on a spindle and so i looked into it and i tried to figure out why that would be so i thought that maybe bringing you through my process of figuring out what i think at least the spindle seems to manifest could be helpful and i mean helpful if you're in interested in the question of sleeping beauty but also helpful in order to see the process that i usually go through to figure out what these things are about and so the first thing that i looked at was whether or not there are other traditions and so this is important a way to do that in the bible is to often look at what you would call midrash or legends or things that surround the biblical text in order to notice if there are differences if some details are different sometimes even in scripture so for example if you look at stories in in the book of samuel and then you look at stories in the book of kings for example and you can try to see what the same what's different and sometimes seeing that something is preserved or something has changed can actually help you understand what is going on and so when i looked at the the traditions there were two traditions it seems and one was that snow white snow white sleeping beauty printer finger on a spindle for those who don't know what a spindle is a spindle on a is either on a spinning wheel or sometimes it can be a hand spindle and so what it does is that you take flax or usually it was flax at the time but you could probably have it with wool as well you would take flax and then you would pass the you would you would attach the the flat i don't know how they started it they would like attach the flats to the spindle and then as the wheel turned the spindle would spin like this and it would spin the flax together and then with your hand you would kind of just let it go and it would rotate around the spindle and then it would create a bundle around the spindle so that's why the spindle has a kind of vertical shape you know it's a it's a rod but sometimes it's a little pointy because you want the thread to neatly let's say get gathered around the spindle and so now the problem with that let's start with the spindle the problem with that is that spindles aren't pointy like they're not pointy in a way that you can break your finger on and so that's something that people you know the same kind of person that the same kind of 14 year old atheist but for fairy tales would be like oh it's ridiculous you know spindles aren't pointy this is a silly story yeah this is nonsense or whatever but usually when something doesn't make sense in the story at least especially a story that's lasted a very long time it's actually not a it's actually not a how can i say this it's not a sign that the story doesn't make sense it's a sign that the story makes so much sense that the people who are remembering it are willing to accept a disjunct between the meaning of the story and actual manifestation in the world and so if you look at even the idea say maximus and you know origin and all these early church fathers they talked about how in the text in the biblical text what they called the idea of ambiguous that problems of ambiguous ambiguous problems in the text like when there's contradiction even between the different tellings of the text or when there's something which is very obscure and very strange often it's actually a sign that there's a lot of meaning there because why would you tolerate kind of why would you tolerate for a very long time to preserve a story that is that is just complete gibberish or meaningless it doesn't mean that that's the case all the time i mean obviously sometimes there can be gibberish and meaninglessness and stories but the idea is that you don't necessarily just discount it especially if it's an important part of the story like the spindle in the in the in the sleeping beauty story so that's one so the other tradition was that she pricked her finger on a strand of flax so now it's not the the spindle where the flax gets transformed and turned around and coiled around this this axis but now it's actually the thing like the the wild early part of the process where it's just like a piece of straw basically a piece of flax and then she she pricks her finger on that and so interestingly enough it seems like those are actually opposite from each other when you start to kind of understand what's going on they seem like they're opposite from each other but the fact of them being opposite from each other this is another thing about symbolism is that sometimes that can help you understand the meaning because opposites are bound by a category that's why they're opposites and so you you see that sometimes in when people also mock stories they'll say well it's not what you said it's the opposite of that well if it's the opposite it's still bound by a higher category or else you wouldn't recognize it as an opposite right the opposite of high is low the opposite of orange is in a bowling ball right it's like if it's an orange and if it's an orange and this finds something even weirder it's like an orange and a duck and those two things like orange and duck how do they fit together you can't you struggle to understand why one would be switched for another but if but if it's like the spindle that gathers the thread around it and then the flax which hasn't been gathered yet and hasn't been brought together then you're like interesting you know this is at least seems to be in the same category so so that is something to pay attention to when you're interpreting the the text and so the next thing to do is to not interpret the idea of what the spindle is apart from the story and not interpret elements that you're trying to understand apart from the story you always have to try to stay inside the story as long as possible and so you have to look at the at the event what are the events so there's an evil fairy that is not invited to the chrismation of the the the queen the the king's daughter and because she's not invited she gets annoyed and and then when the other fairies they give her a blessing and those blessings are usually virtues you know it should be beautiful she'll be good she'll be truthful she'll be graceful it's all these goods that they are giving to snow white as their blessing and then the last fairy that wasn't invited to the party will come up and so obviously she's going to prefer her curse now what's interesting now about the curse is that the curse doesn't actually follow at least in appearance doesn't follow the other blessings they're not it doesn't see it seems to be to not fit so the fairies will say she'll be graceful as this she'll be beautiful as that you know whatever she'll dance she'll be a great dancer i don't know like giving her qualities and then the the the evil fairy says this is going to happen to her and she will die so she'll prick her finger on a spindle or she'll prick her finger on a piece of flax and and she will die so like why is it why does that go together so this is where i've been meditating for quite a while and trying to figure out what was going on and so the idea then you know this is kind of like what my brother talked about jordan peterson the idea is like well let's understand what a spindle is what it does what it looks like and so take some time to watching youtube videos about people spinning flax it's like what's going on you don't even understand because they're not trying to explain to you what you want to understand and also because of these spinning wheels have changed quite a bit as you look at the spinning wheels like there's no even there isn't even what seems to be the spindle on it where is it like what's going on in the disney version interestingly enough they don't even she doesn't even break her finger on the the spindle she pricks her finger on something called the disc staff which is not the place where the thread gets wound up but it's actually this like this big rod that people put on spinning wheels to to tie the flax before it's processes so they'll tie this flack before it's processed so it's kind of holding somewhere and then they'll pull it into the process and so that it gets spun around the spinning wheel so it seems like the people who made the the disney movie didn't take the time to understand what his spinning wheel is but i understand their intuition because they ended up making the the spindle which is in the spindle they they joined it with like the most vertical kind of phallic masculine thing that was on the on the spinning wheel which ultimately that if you haven't guessed yet that's definitely part of what the symbolism even of the spindle is so what's going on in the what's going on in the story so there are several things that are kind of brought together the first thing to notice this is where this is where it really started well this the easiest one to notice is the is the idea of looking at other fairy tales and noticing the idea of someone falling asleep around the time that they're teenagers and that when they fall asleep it has to do with with beauty it has to do with at least in this case it has to do with blood in the case of snow white there's also before before she eats the apple there's also a pricking with blood that where she falls and so it's like you know what's going on and it does seem to have to do and then she's of course woken up by a kiss and so this is something i mentioned before i think in in some of these videos it never doesn't necessarily has to do with puberty and with the transformation of the body at the at that time that a woman becomes a teenager and that the the effusion of blood can either be the the menstrual cycle itself and that would have something to do with the wheel or it can also be the loss of virginity which would have something to do with the disc staffer with the the vertical part and so those two effusions of blood which can happen you know after a woman enters into the into into adulthood seems to be what is referenced here or what is played around you could say in terms of imagery so you can imagine that you could read it in two ways you can read it as a young woman who enters into the menstrual cycle and then she kind of loses you could say she doesn't she loses herself in the sense that she's caught in this cycle and she doesn't and it's like she doesn't know what it's for and that's also has to do with like this weird curiosity about the the about the spinning wheel like she doesn't no one's told her what this the spinning wheel is for right we've kept it away from her all this time and so it's like she gets there and it's a surprise she starts her cycle and it's like what the hell is this like why what is this blood like what is going on and so you can imagine that it's you know it says it throws her into a loop and she doesn't know what the reason for that is and that is something like a kind of dying and you see that of course if you compare the sleeping beauty to jairus daughter which i've done here you can see how all of this is connected right you know jairus daughter dies at her puberty has to do with the fusion of blood of the woman that christ heals on the way there so it's all kind of connected together but then there's also the idea of the the actual prick of the of the spindle which would have something also to do let's say with the idea of a young woman who who let's say loses her virginity without totally understanding what is going on and what the consequences of that are and then she kind of she dies to the let's say to the world she dies in the sense that she doesn't she she doesn't have love you could say it that way and so she there's a there's a relationship with her body with sexuality with everything that hasn't to do with the the with with love which would be the purpose or the joining the joining with the male in the proper way through marriage and through you know that would bring her into the into womanhood so it's all these things that are kind of being suggested now again so why the piece of flax or the spinning when or the spindle though so why is it that in particular especially considering that the spindle isn't sharp you could kind of prick your finger on a piece of flax that maybe makes a you know like on a straw that kind of makes a little bit more sense and i think it has to do with what happens to the fairy so think about it this way the spindle is what gathers the string around it so the spindle is a vector of unity and so it makes sense and so it also makes sense in terms of the masculine aspect of the spindle that you know it's the the origin of the name the origin of the seed the origin of the the identity of the family and so the the the witch is not invited to the party and so because of that she basically tells sleeping beauty or tell the king that his daughter is going to prick herself on this unity and so you can imagine it exactly that way that is that the problem of excluding and including and the problem also of unity is that unity in its positive sense is the vector around which that that you can gather things but unity in its negative sense can be something like a sword something like a prick that can that can hurt and that can appears you could say and so it's as if she's saying she will live with the negative consequences of masculinity with the negative consequences of unity because you've excluded me from the kingdom and so it's the excluded one who then kind of calls back to the unity and and uses it as a curse so that is definitely i think the way to see it now if you see it the other way then it also makes sense it makes sense in in the opposite way which this is can also help you understand how symbolism also works is that she's she's excluded and she doesn't fit and so she's saying you are going to be prick your finger not on the final process but on the raw wild straw before it's united and so it's like i am this this wild straw i am this piece of straw which was not brought into the string which was not bound and wound around the spindle and that is what she's going to prick her finger on and so then it also then it's more related to the idea of the menstrual cycle and the the remainder and the residue which is which is bound up in this story now of course it's important to understand that this is why symbolisms have been so powerful is that none of the elements of the story actually directly mean the analogies that i pointed to so it it so it's not that the that the spindle represents a phallus or something silly like that right like that that the kind of modern interpreters would love to say it's that there are analogies between the imagery and the meanings and those analogies point to something even higher which would be something like the relationship between unity and multiplicity the way in which things are gathered into one the way in the way things fray apart the way in which things you know and the relationship between fraying apart falling falling sleeping dying and then being awakened by by love by attention by care from above so there's all these images but it's like you can still if you see the analogies can help you and so you know it so the idea is that now as i'm writing the the sleeping beauty story i can just slowly pull in images and threads and things that will point you or will help you have more in insight into what why it is that it's something like a spinning wheel and a and a spindle because like i said at the outset when you look at the story it might seem arbitrary to us although it's it's clearly not because you know stories that are preserved and remembered and cared for for a long time you have to you have to remember too that a good a good way to understand this is that like the grimm brothers or perot or the people who gathered the the fairy tales you know in the 17th with the 17th'th century they they only gathered certain ones like they probably heard a lot of versions of all these fairy tales like maybe hundreds of versions but they gathered them in a certain way there are certain ones that they brought out and they kind of or they they compress together in order to show them to you but at the same in grimm's fairy tales there are a lot of fairy tales that you've never heard of that have been forgotten that no one cares about but somehow some of these fairy tales are kind of person persevere and become touchstones for culture it becomes like the main let's say fairy tale stories that we know and if there's an element in those that seems strange to us and we don't totally understand we should be careful not to discount it but rather pay attention and try to see well if it's so illogical and random and and arbitrary then i don't think it would have been remembered this way i don't think people would care for it and you know would celebrate it in the way that they did and so so yeah so i hope this is helpful to kind of you know i help you see what my process is and how it is that i meditate on these things sometimes i meditate on these images for years i just drop them in the drop them in the intuition box i don't know what to say and just leave them there and as i move along sometimes they'll resurface and i'll have a bit more insight they go back down they come back up until and then sometimes there's pressure like let's say i'm writing the story then there's like a pressure where i really want to understand this so i kind of keep it on the tip of my tongue or right on the tip of my mind all the time even as i'm cooking or if i'm doing other things and then it's it's ruminating is the word material likes to use and then all of a sudden it clicks and i like oh yeah that's what it is so so yeah so i hope this was useful everybody and thanks for your support and i'll talk to you very soon bye-bye
