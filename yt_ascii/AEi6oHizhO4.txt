- hey, mystery tech. and today, we have a word
from our sponsor, nhtsa. there is no respawn button in real life, which is why nhtsa is dedicated
to keeping people safe. they sponsored this segment of the video to tell you about driver
assistance technologies to keep in mind when you are shopping
for your next vehicle. save the racing seats
for your gaming chair. when you look for a new vehicle, put driver assistance technologies at the top of your shopping list. take like lane keep assistance, which will redirect
your car into your lane if you drift out of it. and blind spot intervention, which will tell you if a
car is in your blind spot, whether you can actually see it or not. in 2020, 38,680 people
died from car crashes. many of them were caused by driver error, which is something preventable
by these technologies. driver assistance technologies keep you and the people in your car safe. they also hold the potential
to reduce traffic crashes and save thousands of lives per year. you can go to nhtsa.gov/drivertech or click the link in the description below to learn more about driver
assistance technologies that can save you and your loved ones. thank you to nhtsa for sponsoring
a portion of this video. (austin vocalizing) - [ken] is that second gear or third gear? (austin vocalizing) - is that a nintendo switch? a mysterious piece of
technology from 2017. and, oh, i know this one
'cause i found this one. this is the orion gaming display. we've done the ultimate switch before. in fact, we've done two of them, but orion did it for us because this is a switch dock and giant display built into one. so actually, we were looking for products for a completely separate video. i saw this on amazon and insta-bought it for mystery tech 'cause this thing is wacky. - [matt] it's not mystery
tech if you know what it is! - [ken] it's true. - [matt] you're cheating. - oh wow.
- you're cheating! - am i breaking the
rules of my own series? - this is not your series.
- our series. - okay. so immediately, this is
much larger than i thought. oh, oh. that's a seven out of 10 for stink. that's not good. it smells like feet. - do you have your son with you? - yeah, sorry, he's right here. - that was mystery tech. - the velcro, the velcro. oh, oh, oh, no? - i would be a little concerned 'cause you're putting
this thing screen down, which means that you could probably pretty easily scratch your screen. - [ken] this is what nintendo should have made to begin with. - does anyone know how big this display is 'cause that feels huge. - [matt] it's gotta be at least 42 inches. - power? okay. orion, okay, so at least
we've got the screen up. and does it turn on the
switch, is my question? how do we actually activate the switch? - [ken] oh. is there a pass through button on the top? - there's not. you cannot touch the button on the switch. - [ken] excuse me? wait, really? - [matt] can you remind
me what video it was that you were looking
for when you found this? - this was scam busters amazon edition. (record squeaking)
- huh. so the product that you
found while looking for scams is not working 100% as intended? - oh, could not connect to tv! make sure you're using
the ac adapter supply with the console. ooh, so switch is not happy with this. theoretically, if i plug
this in now, it will work, or i've been scammed out of, this thing was like, what, 200 bucks? - [matt] this was $200?! - maybe. - [jared] it was actually 298.99. - [matt] 298?! you can go and buy one of
those panels for like $17. - this is top three worst
items on mystery tech and i picked it, which
makes it so much worse. - i mean, it makes sense. you don't know how to pick good items. every time you pick items, it's either a pokemon card or
something that doesn't work. - the mysterious technology. it works! i don't know what i did, but it works. unfortunately, i have to
stay tethered, but whatever. it's fine. - let's trick it, let's
trick it, let's trick it. - no, no, no, no, no, it works. it works, okay. man, this screen is not it. like, this screen is worse
than the regular switch screen in every possible way except
for the fact that it's bigger. - [ken] is there even
volume control on it? - i'm trying to hit it up and down and it's just brightness, not volume. this is actually just bad. in the thumbnail, this looks great.  but for the actual like functionality, it's too big. the screen is low
resolution and low quality. and then there's so
much like jank involved in actually getting it to work. i mean, there's some nice things. the fact that the joy-cons
actually not only mount, but actually charge using
this whole unit is cool, but you're doing a whole lot of work to get a slightly larger display. and i could have spent this $300 to by 7/8ths of a switch oled, and that would've looked
a million times better even though it's a
slightly smaller screen. i just gotta get my pre
mystery tech workout in. - [matt] okay, weird flex. - ow! (laughing) got some gloves. - [ken] what? what are these? - no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - [matt] i wanted to see if you could build a pc with these. - oh, you know what the thing is? you actually can kind of control it. - [matt] oh whoa. - [ken] oh, jesus christ. oh, i really don't like that. - i didn't hate it. - oh, oh.
- look, sometimes, you just need to be caressed
by a cold mechanical object. don't you feel like just
giving someone a back scratch? that's cool! - [ken] those noises don't
sound great for fingers. - this is too spidery. i don't like how spidery this looks. wait, what is this for though? what? i don't get this part. - [matt] i mean, i think
those were just extra 'cause those weren't in the listing. oh no!
- no! - ah, my finger! - [matt] so, ready? - [ken] oh, i already like this. - i apologize to everyone
for the nightmares. - [ken] oh, that's sick! creepy, but sick. - [ken] freddy goes to the rave, dude. (eerie rave music) - can i join daft punk yet? - [matt] you're if daft punk was in "squid game" now. - i can't see anything 'cause i'm blind without my glasses, so. oh!
- wow, it's like. - [matt] it's like if the sun got mad. - [ken] it's just unsettling
that you have eyes. oh, what's this? oh, that one. - [matt] oh,
that's oddly terrifying. - [ken] i actually kinda like this. that's kind of cute. - well, i don't like that
it's looking different. - [ken] it's a minion! - i don't know minion noises. - [matt] he's got
a lazier eye than i do. (laughing) - [ken] when the mystery
tech budget is $15,000. - oh!
- so, that's actually good for halloween. - [ken] i like, oh, that's creepy. oh, that's creepy.
- that's terrifying. - [ken] oh, oh, oh! - what's wrong? - i really regret this. - i wasn't ready! - [matt] when
have you ever been ready? - you can't hit me with
an msi lucky golden figure if i'm not ready for it. - [ken] i love iiisi. - it does look like iiisi, i will say. is there any context to this? - [matt] it's a 35th anniversary edition that's been sitting around for a year. - our limited edition msi
golden lucky figure is... more packaging. matt, you okay? they just announced the ps6. - [matt] on ebay right now? - yeah. - [matt] there's one opened. - yeah. - [matt] for $9,000. - oh, word! that's a whole mystery tech budget, dude. - someone get tape. if you'd like to purchase this item that we definitely got from msi, it's available, the link the description
or on our ebay store. okay. tech meets aesthetic. yo, what? are you seeing this right now? - [ken] oh my god. if only they put this much effort into their peripherals. - ken, can you stop getting
us canceled by iiisi? this is really rad. so you've got the little msi crest here, tech meets aesthetic. on the back, you have
your 35th anniversary. thanks, msi! lucky is great and we're really excited to have him on the background of our set until we need to sell
him to pay rent one day. i'm just gonna put all
this packaging in here for when the price is right. message me if you're interested. lucky's for sale. i'm feeling a wave. would you, one day, let me finish a joke when a mystery tech item hits the table? would you just one-- all right, we've got
ourselves the mx master 3s. there's a 3s? - [ken] that's what i said. - okay. and also, the mx mechanical mini. generally speaking, especially when it came to
like old school tech youtube, these were the absolute
coolest mice around. now, to be fair, i have not used a logitech mx mouse in, i think i probably stopped
using them in like 2013, 2014. so what is new on the 3s? - [jared] so they're upgrading from a 4,000 to an 8,000 dpi sensor, but the biggest thing is
going to be that quiet click. they claim that it is 90%
quieter than the old mouse. - [ken] wait, you're clicking it? wait, you're actually clicking it. i can't hear it. - that's basically not a click. i mean, it feels fine for the record, but it is basically just dead silent. for context, what a
regular mouse sounds like. and the master. i actually like this quite a lot. this is super ergonomic, right? it feels exactly like or very similar to the older
logitech mice that i've used. you've got the little click on the bottom. you have your sort of
back and forward buttons. - [ken] pretty useful on the mac too where everything is like shortcut based. - [jared] so, logitech has always sold a couple of mechanical keyboards before, but this is their first
mechanical keyboard in their mx line. - [austin] so it's higher end, basically. - [jared] premium office
mechanical keyboard. - how much is the mx master 3s? - [jared] so the master 3s, you're looking at $100, which i believe is the same price. - about the same. okay, how about the mini? - [jared] the mini, and mind you, there is a 10 key version
of that keyboard as well. the mini is 149.99. - [ken] oh, get out. - [jared] and the 10 key is $169.99. - [ken] i'm throwing that in the garbage. - that's a lot. oh, actually, wait, hold on, hold on. let's not be too mean to it just yet. i like the look of that. that's actually, i like the kind of the two tone finish. - [ken] they're not the only ones that make low profile mechanical. - of course, look, i'm just no, no, i'm actually just saying
the color way, right? like, these are nice. let's just experience a little
bit of aural bliss together. - [matt] aural! - aural, aural bliss, aural bliss. it's like, you hear a lot of just like sort of
hollowness on the inside. - [ken] it's not even that. i also hear the scratchiness of it. - right. so wait, let the back lighting
turn off for a second. okay, so it's off. - [ken] there's a sensor in it. - yeah, that actually is kind of cool. the sensor does work pretty well. i don't know about spending
this much money on a keyboard. - [ken] i just don't know if you're getting the price for it. it's a good mac mechanical
keyboard, i'd say. - that being said though, the mouse actually does feel really nice. now, should you go throw your
old master in the garbage? probably not 'cause this
does feel very, very similar. - there are a lot of
options out there for mice, but there aren't a lot of
new and unique options. - yeah. - the fact that these are
damped so that they're silent. - i'm a big fan of that, yeah. - why couldn't they do this
with their stupid keyboard? - hello, my friends, and welcome to the most
unexpected crossover of 2022. yeah, friends. i taste like a fresh mcdonald's sprite. - [matt] i don't ever wanna hear about what you taste like ever again. - ken, what would you say is one of your favorite things in life? - anime. - what's another thing
that you love in life? - my car. - keep going. what do you do six hours a day? - [matt] watch anime. - what else do you do six hours a day? - play gran turismo. - what do you do while you're at work that you're not supposed to be doing? - watch anime.
- yeah. - listen to music, i agree. - oh! what? it's like bony. you know, i'm not gonna lie though. i'm gonna take this to
the next anime convention. they're adjustable. - of course they are. so you think coca-cola
would make a bad product? ha, hilarious. - oh, this is actually
really comfortable though. - can i just point out that ken bolido listens to his music at
100% volume at all times? no, no, no, no, no. - price, price? - no, no, no, no, no. you have to listen and you have to guess. i will tell you the price. i am the captain now. - bass actually not terrible. there's not much detail in it. everything seems kind of crushed. there's no, like the bass is not punchy. there's no depth there. it's a little muddy. i mean, there's literally
fur in between my ears and the cups themselves. these are probably $15 headphones with i'll put a $10 markup on it. i'll say 25. - they're 25. - get out. - not bad, right? - you can get better $25 headphones, but these have the novelty. - now, i'm sitting so close to you, take a tic tac, a coke tic tac. - oh.
- wait, that sounds counterintuitive. - [matt] oh, i will take one of those. i will take all of those. - [ken] they look like pills. - [austin] you gotta take one coke a day keeps the doctor away. - whoa. - slaps, right? - i like these. - delightful, like all products
from the coca-cola company. how about we talk about
the actual best brand? it's not coca-cola. sprite earbuds. - these earbuds have
sprite bottles on them. those look funny in your ears. - do these headphones look good? - [joanna] yeah. - good, 'cause they sound like-- - [child] ooh! - one, two, or three? - three.
- cool, here you go. - a mini wireless. man, did you really just
buy every tech thing that was at the coke store? - i walked through the coke
store slightly inebriated and made some questionable decisions on, this would be a great
segment for mystery tech, and then bought like
eight pairs of headphones that had coke on it. - oh, this looks kind of nice though. that metal top though? the satin red finish. ice cold. i don't like this. - i have even more headphones
because i came prepared and bought everything
that seemed vaguely techy at the coke store. - those are what they use
as a base for fake beats. - nope, not true. it's the real thing. i will say, the plastic. - oh, jesus christ. - sounds like matt's knees. - wow!
- wow! - wow.
- wow. - [matt] is that
mariah carey's "heartbreaker?" - nope, it's still thomas the tank engine. - god.
- the biggie version. - yeah, those don't sound good. wait, wait, are you
looking at the last item? oh no, did i leave that in there? you weren't supposed to see that. - you drunk bought $200 worth of stuff at the coke store. - you what?! - but you know what they gave
me for only an additional $8? a mystery bag. why is this empty? wait, did you open this? - no. - [matt] i got scammed by coca-cola. - i was supposed to get
sponsored by coca-cola. how could this have happened?
