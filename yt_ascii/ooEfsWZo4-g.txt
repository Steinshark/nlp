no i then i reversed the polarity which doesn't matter because it's a momentary switch i know do not want to do this four times one muffin okay i'm gonna die it's no secret that our previous attempts at diy smart home solutions have not always gone according to plan the smart garage door opener at my old house ended up de-smartifying itself when the wires we soldered started picking up some kind of radio waves that caused my garage door to inexplicably open and close and our attempts to use gem brighton smart dimmers with motion sensors on them for presence detection blew up in our faces when we discovered that jazzco the company that actually develops the switches and the firmware for them won't send out firmware updates to individual users and the freaking things were broken because they were on four-year-old firmware but not today today we are taking our second crack at smartifying a dumb garage door opener and it's gonna go flawlessly thanks to the this enforcer open and close sensor and this fortress multi input it's a memo it's called the memo multi-input multi-output it takes the sensor it writes to the garage door like a relay what could go wrong nothing i tried it before just like you tried those switches well i told you to buy different ones and just like i tried to segue to our sponsor ridge time to ditch that bulky wallet a ridge wallet can hold up to 12 cards comes with your choice of cash strap or money clip and makes a great gift for dad if you get 50 off until june 8th at ridge.com linus someone get me one i'm a dad [music] the main functionalities you want out of any smart garage door opener are twofold one you want to be able to open and close the door from an internet connected device like a google home or an echo or your smartphone and number two you want to be able to check the status of the door so that you know if it's open or closed that way you can configure automations like say for example if my garage door is still open at two in the morning that's probably not intentional please go ahead and close that as you can see the garage door openers that i have have neither of those things now what i could do is i could buy myself a pre-fab kitted out smart garage door opener the issue as i discovered at my old house is that chamberlain who has a near monopoly on garage door openers at this point forces you to go through their my q platform in order to access any of those controls it's super close down and just has bone-headed limitations like when you go to close it it goes light flashes for like 10 seconds before it will actually start to close i don't need that i just want the door to close chamberlain openers also don't play nicely with simple momentary switch buttons like these ones so you're forced to use theirs which prevents you from using any other ecosystem so the obvious answer is to save myself hundreds of dollars by converting my old dumb openers into smart ones using just a couple of really cool devices and some of them are pretty simple like this yeah that's super cool i can't believe we didn't think of this last time we had that little roost thing that you can't even buy as a consumer they sent it to us but it's battery powered which means the battery died and then i never replaced it this is about as simple as it gets it's literally just a magnetic contact you see these on commercial garage doors all the time all the time we even have them at the office and i didn't think to use literally only on this guy which is the sensors got the wire attached to the frame and then this guy which is our kind of contact to the door oh my god wait that's how it touches something like that that looks kind of janky ah i think this is tightened down and like bending this and i think that's why it's not wide enough to just come on here oh hey there's other parts oh well that makes sense this l bracket might be useful yeah here's some self-tappers are contractors on hand and he's just like watching the stupid way that i'm gonna do things he's like no no really there's a better way linus it's like dude i know but i'm gonna do it this way anyway see watch there we go see it worked no i'm not taking it out i just want to whoops so how does it go on do we actually need to loosen this bolter now well i see an example but now i'm just kind of more confused yeah look see it bends now it bends so i bet i can look at let's get it on there now sort of not really while he's figuring out how to test it i'm just going to yolo install it put it like very close to the bottom so it'll detect even if the garage is open for sure a little bit can i have some self-tappers no i need more oh that's definitely okay that's too much okay we'll just have them it's fine everyone just goes full snark mode as soon as they start doing anything for me it's like oh that's not quite enough here's three times as many this is interesting you got they look like horse hoof trimmers but they're for tools no they look like this hold on i'm at a loss straight hoofing bud everyone's talking to me like i'm crazy horse with true when you even i want one of those oh oh oh man that's not easy to get at any bit and please yeah please remove the screw tripping the end off and then oh that's a good idea that's way smarter thanks dan you're very welcome these are both excellent ideas i like reese's way better oh wait no no reese's idea doesn't work yep nope sorry we're back to dan's solution good job dan dan you win yay i don't know what you win oh my god these are not gonna cut this this is wow what is this screw made of [music] jesus christ totally fine all right rock on then we're good enough is that ethernet or is it two conductor i told them to run two this is cat six okay we'll pick some pairs and all right wonderful thanks so much dan i knew we had you here for a reason dan's here by the way so far he has handed me this cat6 stripper he's a stripper what pairs are you feeling jake should we be green boys today yeah i'm done with green feeling green for success why did you have them run cat 6a if we only need two i didn't i told them to run two conductor and they ran cat 6a anyways and they also ran ethernet from up there to the mechanical room i'm pretty sure for some reason don't know why they would have done that so like that might have been my fault yeah i didn't know that it was going to be all wireless okay jake i'm hooked up we ready to test it okay time for you to get up on the ladder on the ladder i mean yeah that cable goes up there oh yeah it's an a-frame ladder but it's i don't think it goes that high stand twice that height you know that's extremely sketchy okay let's use this ladder on that garage door and we'll just do one first hold on a second let's just think for a second here hey you know what dan's tall oh god don't worry you always want to put it on the last rung that's the safest one i'm gonna die why are we doing this on top of the ladder instead of bringing the ladder down well because we thought that we could do it from on top of the ladder obviously everybody dan dan dan everybody's being mean now totally dead hinge must be locked fully before using really not partially this is what i'm trying to say what are you working the logistics department stop being so logistical about it just let it happen man who pays our bills sometimes is that the only reason you don't want me to die yeah you also get blood all over the floor this is awesome okay we're great you can make it up to me by buying a desk pad on lttstore.com making your workspace look so pretty i'll buy two this cat6 front is the same one that's hooked up to the door sensor so i stripped the same pair the green pair and now what i need to do is i need to wire it into my memo module here this is z-wave plus compatible which means that our smartphone or whatever other smart device communicates over wi-fi to our z-wave controller in our case it's an ao tech stick and that is going to communicate over z-wave to this buddy right here now because of another issue we ran into with those ge switches that they don't seem to support any kind of z-wave security or encryption it seems like we might be having some signal strength issues because they also don't seem to pass through a signal for devices that do require security for a light i don't care but for garage door opener i care a lot so in the meantime jake has plugged in a couple of aeotech smart receptacles to act as a relay for us just to get the signal from the mechanical room to here okay so is that ladder locked at all or no i'll move around it's locked a little yeah safety patrol okay i should be powered now jakku jakku i see lights ah yes it's working when i just had it set up over there it was barely working like maybe one in every 10 tries now that i've added the repeater plugs and told that z-wave device to heal its connection every time i click the button it turns on anyone see again nice signal two in ground yeah and well the appropriate ground i'm sure you can figure that much i'll find a ground well there's actually three grounds what one for power one for sigma why did i even listen to what you said oh i have to ah that makes sense i was tinkering with it over there and i was playing with the sensor and it wasn't updating you have to switch it from periodically update to on change which is what we want right do you have it hooked up now it should be yeah it's definitely reporting a different value okay where is it right now it's on it's like next to it pull it away oh yeah oh nice so i can screw this onto the door then sure nice okay oh this is great this is actually going shockingly smoothly i guess that's what happens when we pre-test i tested this out of these oh that one pulled something ow i'm weak i'm weak guys it's closed right now then right i believe so yeah it's at four should i open the garage no i'm gonna open the garage no i'm opening the garage one mistake are you ready can i do it now yeah you're good which one is it the bottom one no the bottom one is the close one wow that's stupid open okay stop and open and ah oh i'm in the sensor all right okay yeah go ahead and close immediate nice yes yes that works so well and we don't even have to have any janky wiring over by the buttons they'll just work completely as normal they have no idea that any of this is even here yeah you just have to stick a little wire onto the button now i have to stick a wire onto the button sorry what all right okay the button i'm working on it jake you don't happen to know which contacts i'm i mean there's nothing here is there really that many well there's three three so i'm just going to cut myself a nice big old chunk of this i'm not sure what voltage a garage door button runs at but it's probably like 12 volt dc so a garage door opener or something sending signals is going to be way too low voltage to trigger that because this is door two right where does it even go into it's signal two right yeah well they're called no two com2 and nc2 which i'm assuming is no connection to no no that would be normally open and normally closed so you'll want normally open two and come too okay sorry one more time door two i'm sorry i can't look at that right now can you look at it for a sec no yes you can fine yes that store too brandon can you even see from there there's little lights turning on and it's going click click so can we just wait what there's like caulking here why you ready hold on no no don't do anything you're not ready nothing what do you mean nothing i mean it doesn't work i don't believe you okay go nope nothing what the okay hold on hold on jake let's try the red and white one just to humor me i thought you were trying it both way that's what you said you tried it the other way no and then i reverse the polarity which doesn't matter because it's a momentary switch i know it's been a rough oh my god my bad my bad stick it on there this is so uncomfortable i do not want to do this four times i'm a muffin okay my back hurts well move the ladder so it's more ergonomic you tool just get in there jake hit it yeah yeah and the scents are updated immediately okay now it's time to melt this boy so like i mean i guess here is fine right just go for it brother wherever you oh don't don't do that what don't do what you can't get the cover on if you mount it to the ceiling first oh my god the cover screws on from the back yeah why now we need to hook up jumper then so that i can control the other one as well yeah jake i'm doing it what i'm i'm doing it what right now i use the green pairs for both the sense and the signal from the button but now that i know that we have to have two of the pairs coming from over there one for signal one four cents for the whether it's open or closed i would like to color code it i don't care it's your house okay the one downside to an approach like this is we don't really have a way to tell the garage door to open or close we just have a way to tell it to activate which depending on where it is will open or close so i added a little bit of like logic to the sensor so that if the garage door is closed and you say hey google assistant close the garage door it's not going to then open the door because that would suck it'll only close it if it's open but here look at that you got to tell me when you're gonna do that what oh wow yesterday at 7 pm you drew almost 8 000 watts concurrently that's a little did you have the oven on maybe all right ah i think i did it ow my back in order to get voice assistance like google assistant and that other one from amazon to work the best way to do it is to use home assistant cloud which is a paid service it's only like five bucks a month but it is run by the people that make home assistance so i thought the whole idea was i didn't want this to be cloud bound okay well how is it going to be not cloud bound if you want to use google assistant so once you have that set up all you need to do is add you don't need the homes to snap for this i don't well you can get it later oh okay you need to activate the home assistant cloud skill for google assistant you can set it up without the cloud thing but you have to use like a test app and you got to like re-off it every like two weeks it's awful you might as well just pay the five dollars okay set up a device okay so we're done setting up a device which means we should be good to go then oh oh whoa no way open the lower big garage yeah yeah it's the lower big garage closed it's open lower big garage d2 is open and it is shut all the garage doors sweet that's amazing i tried to do that one and i tried i heard it to
