hello everyone and welcome in this video brought to you by autotempest.com we're going to be looking at everything wrong with my brand new it's just got 22 miles on it tesla model 3. now auto tempest is an awesome website if anyone's interested in looking at buying a car they take all the major used car sites and pile the search results all in one spot i've got a link in the video description for you to check out and i'll talk about this more at the end of the video now before we get started i want to reiterate that this is the exact condition that this vehicle arrived in i've got the delivery statement right here which it got put on a truck on november 28th 2018. i ordered it on november 27th it arrived november 29th so it literally just took two days from when i clicked buy this car to when it arrived at my house pretty crazy on the timing there but regardless this statement shows i you know i blocked out some of the important information about my address and things like that but it shows that the original odometer reading was 21.7 miles or 22 miles i literally just took the car from the delivery truck and put it into my garage so it has accumulated zero miles straight from the delivery truck into my garage and then i'm making this video to show you the exact condition that it arrived in as you can see looking at the odometer it still has 22 miles and i'm filming this before the video that was already released going into the review of the core if you want to check that out i'll include a link in the video description so issues with the model 3. now it's been heavily reported on that there have been manufacturing quality issues with the model 3s coming out tesla's trying to ramp up their production and in doing so you know some quality issues are coming through and you know it's not my goal here to say that you know tesla's the worst company ever or tesla's the greatest company ever i'm going to try to remain as objective as possible i know the comments are probably going to range from wow i can't believe tesla put out such a garbage product to jason you're a garbage person i can't believe you complained about such petty things so my goal isn't to force an opinion on you my goal is to simply show you the issues with this core and you can generate that opinion on your own you know does a core of this cost is a core like this should it be coming out with these quality issues you know keep in mind when i start talking about the paint this is a twenty five hundred dollar paint option the red color and so you know does that make sense are the quality issues that i'm seeing in the paint does that correlate with a 2500 paint job option so you know you can form the opinions my goal is to simply show you all of the little defects with the core and then you can let me know you know do you think that's normal do you think it's okay is it unacceptable and also i'd be very curious to know if there are any other tesla model 3 owners out there if the condition that your car arrived in was similar okay so we're going to start with the exterior of the vehicle looking at the paint scratches on it then we'll get into paint defects then we'll start looking at the body panels panel gaps that kind of thing i've got some plastic calipers right here to help do some measurements and where it's applicable i'm also going to try and show a similar measurement on my subaru crosstrek just so you can kind of have a comparative you know a different car to compare and look at and say you know is this normal is this not normal again trying to be as objective as possible here and just showing what how the car arrived exactly as it is right now coming straight off the delivery truck now one of the worst areas is the rear door so this is the driver's side rear door the very front of it so this is our driver's door right here and then this is the rear door on the driver's side and as you can see there's all these little etches cut out of the paint here and actually continues along as you go along down the door this is the worst spot of you know multiple of them all in one area but you can see these little etches here where you know it's kind of been chipped through the paint and there's a bunch of them all across the door here now i learned a cool tip from chris fix to determine whether or not a scratch is actually through the clear coat so i've got my chris fix thing going on right here i've got some water sorry i should say water and so what you do is you simply spray water onto the scratches and if they disappear then it's just in the clear coat but if you spray the water on the scratches and you can still see the scratches the scratches have gone through the clear coat and they're actually scratching the paint okay so now applying that logic to our first set of scratches spraying some water on it and as you can see you can still see those little metal scratches so it is indeed through the clear coat moving towards the back of that same door here you can see another scratch which has gone all the way through the clear coat continuing along to the back of the vehicle we have yet another scratch this is on the rear quarter panel still on the driver's side and this is once again through the clear coat entirely now as we keep moving along so here we can see the scratch that we were just looking at in the top left of the screen this is that rear driver side quarter panel and then we're moving on to the rear bumper right here so here you can see additional scratches some light scuffing there and an additional scratch down there below so you know just in this small little area one two three decent scratches there okay so now we're looking at the rear bumper and so here's one of the parking sensors and there's a scratch that kind of goes along a good distance here along that bumper so you can see you know some different areas like right here an additional area right here where it's scraped and then as you keep moving along that scratch continues and you've got an additional scrape over here so a good long scrape coming from this parking sensor here and then going across so as far as scratches that mostly covers it you know there's a few other little minor scuffs and things around the vehicle but really most of it's all on the driver's side the right side of the vehicle is actually quite good no little scrapes or anything like that and you know just a few other additional little minor scrapes that i didn't show on the driver's side but overall you know those main scratches all on that rear bumper the rear quarter panel and then on that passenger that rear door on the driver's side now as far as defects in the paint this little dot right here is actually underneath the clear coat so this is a speck of dust probably and what this just means is that in their paint room you know they had a little speck of dust floating around it landed on the car and then they applied that clear coat over it and so it's kind of just a sign that you know perhaps the room where these are getting painted in aren't being perfectly filtered you've got some dust floating around in there and unfortunately one of those little pieces of dust got stuck underneath the clear coat so you know you can rub your finger on this you can actually feel it the surface there's a little bump right there and this is just trapped underneath that clear coat now people love talking about orange peel so here you can see kind of the textured surface of the paint when you're looking at the reflection of the light you know instead of it being a smooth line where that light is reflected instead it's kind of got that jaggedness that textured look to it that orange peel now here you can get a much better idea of what i'm talking about so we're looking at the lights on the ceiling of my garage being reflected off of the rear quarter panel and you know as i pan this camera down you can see that textured appearance to the paint next we are going to talk about panel gaps now the internet loves talking about panel gaps personally i've never looked at a car and thought whoa look at those panel gaps that's crazy but you know i'm wearing a hoodie i'm clearly not a man of style or taste so what do i know so let's just look at the car look at the numbers see how the tesla does so the first gap we're looking at here is the front hood and so we're looking at the driver's side here the left side of the vehicle and it looks to be a gap of about 4.4 millimeters there on the right side of the hood looking at the passenger side of the hood it is very visibly thinner than on the driver's side this looks to be about maybe 2.4 millimeters wide this gap on this side so about two millimeters less than on the driver's side now for comparison i did the exact same measurements on the hood of my subaru crosstrek on the driver's side it was a gap of 3.8 millimeters and then on the passenger side it was a gap of 3.0 millimeters now one of the largest gaps on the vehicle is here between the rear quarter panel and the driver's side rear door and so here you can see this gap is about 6.8 millimeters on the left side of the car and then on the right side quite a bit less gap here so looking at about 4.8 millimeters so about a two millimeter difference between the left and right sides i also took these same measurements on my subaru crosstrek 4.9 millimeters on the left side of the vehicle 4.5 millimeters behind that door on the right side of the vehicle at this same portion on the upper portion of the door okay so the next measurements we're looking at are the door gaps so we're going to start on this ridge right here and then we're going to look at the front of the door the gap right there the gap between the two doors right there moving along this same line and then the gap behind the doors so on the tesla on this driver's side right here we've got 2.8 millimeter gap right here we've got a 4.1 millimeter gap right here and then a 5.6 millimeter gap at the back now on the other side of the vehicle we're at 2.9 millimeters at the front 2.9 millimeters in the middle so a bit more consistent and then 5.3 millimeters in the back now once again i did the same measurements on my subaru crosstrek so on the driver side it was at four millimeters in the middle 4.2 millimeters and then at the back 4.5 millimeters then on the right side of the vehicle four millimeters up front same as on the other side 4.5 in the middle and then 3.9 in the back so the biggest difference in any of the measurements on one side of the subaru crosstrek was point six millimeters but also the biggest difference left and right on the subaru crosstrek was point six millimeters so on the tesla you know perhaps it is a design thing that the back gap is the largest but that said the biggest difference in gap on any one individual side was 2.8 millimeters and then between the left and the right side where it was just 0.6 for the subaru crosstrek it is 1.2 millimeters for this center one right here so 4.1 on this driver's side and then 2.9 millimeters on the passenger side as far as the trunk 5.4 millimeters here on the left and then four millimeters here on the right and that gap extends all the way up so you know it's got a larger gap coming up all the way here and then extending up along this pillar now once again i took these same measurements on my subaru crosstrack on the left side of the trunk the gap was 3.7 millimeters and then on the right side of the trunk it was 4.7 millimeters so one millimeter difference on the crosstrek 1.4 here on the tesla but wait there's still more gaps to measure so here looking at the roof of the car this is the rear glass and then this is the middle piece of glass so measuring the gap there on this side of the vehicle you can see about 2.9 maybe three millimeters gap there on this side of the vehicle on the right side of the vehicle we get that measurement and we're at about 4.7 millimeters so 1.8 millimeter difference between the right and left sides of the glass as it comes to the edge here on this side the right side of the vehicle versus on the left side of the car now here you can see the transition between the middle piece of glass and then that rear piece of glass on the roof of the car so you can see that significantly larger gap for that middle panel of glass and then as you get back that gap gets quite a bit more narrow for the rear panel of glass now they did do a good job with the side frame finishing so this all actually lines up pretty good right here you know coming across there everything's parallel in the same plane orientation there so that looks good looks good right here as well and you know interesting little fact i don't know if you guys have watched my rolls-royce culinary review one of the things they were talking about was having that really long side frame finishing that comes all the way around and then back and they were saying that's very challenging to do to have that part where it does come back and interesting to see you know here on the tesla they've actually cut it into two sections because it's a challenging supplier demand to say you have to do all of this in one piece you know i'm not suggesting that this should have the same level of build quality as a rolls-royce something that costs eight times as much but just an interesting thing there to point out on that side frame finishing having it cut into two different sections there and they did do a nice job of having it all line up now another interesting thing to look at as far as the panels and how they're assembled together it's one thing to look at them you know left or right how do they line up what are the gaps between them but then you can also look at height differences in them and this is a bit more challenging to show on video but looking at the front of the bumper right here it's pretty much flush along this right side of the car and then as you start moving across the bumper here is actually raised up above this hood so you kind of have a drop going across there versus on this side it's a smooth transition across here you kind of run into that bumper there as you're moving along down it versus on this side you just come straight across it and there are more examples of this as you go around the core i'm not going to go around and touch every single panel and show it in this video but just another example here so on the driver's side you've got a bit of a difference here on the door so the door is a bit raised above versus this front quarter panel and on the passenger side of the vehicle it's pretty much flush the entire way from the top to bottom whereas on this driver's side this door is higher than right here there's a little bit of an elevation difference right there and then as you get towards the bottom of it actually this front quarter panel is a little bit raised up and the door is a bit recessed there at the bottom so it kind of has this warped angle to it for the door here versus on the other side of the vehicle it's just kind of a nice smooth all the way down now am i human garbage for pointing out these small flaws or are they actually legitimate reasons to be concerned that's for you to decide you know i'm just trying to show you the condition in which this car arrived into my garage you know straight off the truck into my garage this is how it arrived to me whether or not you feel that's acceptable is for you to decide i'd love to hear your opinions about it in the comments also in tesla's defense i did send them several video clips showing the different scratches on the car and they said they will get it all fixed up they said they'd be contacting me about getting service to fix it all up and they even said they would be providing me a loaner vehicle while the vehicle is getting fixed so on their end you know they were happy to say you know what yes there's a few flaws with it we will fix that up don't worry about it we'll get you covered so i do appreciate that on tesla's end that they were very quick to respond and say yes we will do this that said of course it would be ideal to just not have those defects in the first place now a huge thank you to autotempest.com for sponsoring this video i thought it'd be pretty interesting to see you know what is the cheapest electric core i could find used on autotempest.com so the first vehicle i looked at was the smart 42 electric i found a 2013 for just 5 000 with only 5 000 miles on it but we can probably do better than that so i looked up a mitsubishi imeve 2012 with 25 000 miles on it also under 5 000 but still not as low as what i was hoping i could find so then i searched for a nissan leaf this thing's been out for quite a while and found a 2011 nissan leaf sl with 65 000 miles on it for under 4 000 anyways autotempest.com is an awesome place to search for used vehicles and i will include a link in the video description so thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course
