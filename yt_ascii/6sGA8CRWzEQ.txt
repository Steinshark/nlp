out in the link in the description below people really underestimate the power of systems it seems like this abstract thing like what does it even mean to have a productivity system broadly what we need is a way to organize our to-do's to organize our information and our ideas and that's really what all this is about firstly you need a way to keep track of your deadlines so all the tasks that you need to do and when you need to do them having a lot of deadlines can create a lot of stress for me at least will create even more stress is not really knowing which deadlines i have and when i have them and not being able to keep track of all of this in my mind my minds are really good at doing things my minds are not very good at remembering so in the case of a computer you can think of our brain as like the cpu the one that processes all your steps a lot of people try to also use our brain as the storage and even as a computer you want to have a separate ssd on a separate hard drive to keep all the information that you need to remember i hope by making sense here so that's why to keep track of your to-do's you first of all need a to-do app or i mean you can use pen and paper you can use whatever you want but somewhere where you can just write down all the things that you need to do and when you need to do them so that you don't have to worry about what you have to remember secondly you need to keep all your information organized in the modern age this is really all just about your files on your computer if you still have a lot of physical documents then this will apply for that as well but definitely if you're the guy if you're the person who just has a giant documents folder on your desktop yeah yeah we need to talk oh and we will don't go anywhere thirdly you need to organize all your ideas so for example in the case of coding whenever you get project ideas or things you want to learn things you want to build you want to have a place to write all those things down anytime you learn something interesting you want to be able to make a note of it because otherwise you're just going to forget everything and then all the learning you do is really gonna be useless and for me this ranges from video scripts to video ideas to things i want to build or using coding so i write all of these things down okay so now that we've established the three key problems that we need to solve as busy people let me show you how i go about solving them broadly you need four things a note-taking system a to-do app a calendar and a file storage system i want to emphasize that this is not about the specific apps or things i use find the one that works for you that solves these problems for you and that's completely fine don't really need to use whatever i use just because i use it but hopefully you can still get some value out of the way i use the things and why i use the things that i do so let's talk about them for note-taking i just use apple notes and i'm not using apple notes because i think it's the best ever like there are a lot more note-taking apps which have a lot more features and a lot more things that you can do with them but the reason i use apple notes and a big theme around the apps and systems i use in general as you'll see is it's very easy because i mean the apple ecosystem accessing apple nodes is extremely easy it's just one click it works on the iphone it works on the mac and it's very simple and another big theme around my whole system and everything i do is that i like simplicity i really live by this minimalism idea where you try to reduce clutter and reduce friction as much as possible all i need is the basic stuff so that's why i really try to stick to the essentials with a lot of the things that i use in here we can see that we have a couple of folders i have a videos tab where all the videos i'm working on right now for example right here we've got this video that i'm working on right now i sometimes write a whole script but mostly i just have some sort of ideas that i want to talk about and i have stuff for my programming any project ideas any things i learned that i want to remember i put it on there and then we've got checklists for example for my video production process what i do for all these videos and then for picture profiles for my camera i don't have anything else yet but i'm trying to do more of this because i just learned about this idea of like checklist and how they're super useful and all of that let me just go on some quotes for example the journey is the reward any quotes that have really spoken to me that i want to remember i just wrote down in this quotes folder having a folder structure is really important any notes that they don't fall into any of these specific folders i just put it into the basic notes folder right there so any ideas anything as i learned from books for example i will put on here so i have them stored and because they're so easy to access it actually makes me more likely to actually write something down whereas if it was even a couple of clicks further away i might not actually end up doing it so then for our to-do app and i've actually combined to do and calendar into one app that actually does both of these so the app of choice here is tick tick which i just started using recently so there's not that much here yet again i have easy access to both on my mac and my iphone if i don't like it i might change to something else but for now it seems to be working really well you can organize your tasks into folders so that i've done that for any videos any video integrations or branding the questions i have going up in long term learning projects or things i'm doing and there's also a calendar view on this where you can really view your tasks based on the dates you want to do literally anytime i just have a task i'll just type it here this is a really important task by the way you should do it you done it nice okay so now that task is done and let's say this video if i didn't have time to do it today i could just move it to tomorrow or something very simple but the idea is that you want to keep track of your to-do's so that you don't forget and in terms of using calendars a lot of the productivity youtubers who i'm a big fan of and i watch a lot i really live by a calendar and putting everything down in your calendar i've tried that but for me it really didn't work like having blocking time in your calendar like every day so that every hour is basically you predetermined what you need to use it for like sure if you're doing something where you have meetings and all that where you need to do them a specific time saying absolutely you need to use a calendar but for me right now because i haven't started my full-time work yet i can really decide when i do all the things that i do and i found that it was too restrictive for me to have a specific daily routine that i follow every day so now that i'm still able to do that i actually enjoy allowing myself to just do the things that i need to do any time i want to do them as long as i do the things i need to do every day so every morning i essentially write a couple of tasks down on my to do app and those are the things i have to get done that day as long as i do them it doesn't matter when i do them so that is why i actually don't stick by any specific routine at least not at the moment that's probably gonna have to change once i start my full-time job in a couple of months so we'll see and last but not least is my file management system for this i mostly just use the internal ssd of my m1 max macbook pro computer i have a videos folder i have a photos folder and then i have a big programming and computer science folder so roughly all the things i do are organized into this big folder which are in my desktop and then inside of this there's folders for all my projects as well as one big folder for all the courses i'm doing so for example right now i'm doing this course and i'm doing this one so anything related to them like the exercises projects and stuff like that this is a new laptop so there's not as much here yet hopefully i can keep it clutter free then i also use icloud drive a lot of the documents are stored in icloud so that i have access to it on my computer and my phone whenever i need it so i have documents where i've got personal finance any business related stuff for this channel for brand integrations all those things this specific file structure works for me for the specific things that i do the point of this is not that this is the specific file structure you should use or that you should specifically use icloud i used to use google travel up and now i'm pulling in the apple ecosystem it really just made sense to switch to icloud you need to have your files organized and so this is really how my entire life is organized and then obviously when i'm doing something specific like for example when i'm coding i have all like these sub-systems for like how i plan my coding projects for example or when i'm learning a course i have all these subsystems for how i'm organizing my learning for example i use my notion template to organize my computer science self-study check out this video if you're interested and i talk a lot about those things on this channel separately because those are separate things but this productivity system which is the topic of this video is really the umbrella things which really organizes all of this so a lot of people have been asking me for more videos around my project building process and around like coding projects in general and i am happy to say that those are coming very soon i will be making some videos around documenting the process of me building a couple of these interesting app ideas that i have so those videos are coming so if you want to see them make sure to subscribe down below this really isn't all about having some like magical app it's just about having a system that works for you even if you have the best productivity system in the world if you're trying to learn how to code if you're not using the right method to teach yourself how to code then all this is really useless a business system allows you to organize your time but if you're actually using your time in the wrong things it really defeats the purpose so that's why if you want to learn how to code effectively you absolutely should watch this video where i really talk about the specifics of what i actually do when i'm trying to learn how to code and how i was able to force myself to actually learn how to code
