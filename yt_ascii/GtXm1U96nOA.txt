[music] okay the guy you see next to me is the most generous billionaire in the world and i found him the most generous billionaire ever where you can get 10 off on your trading fees these are bad these are very bad but ftx there are no fees whatsoever and if you sign up with our link signing up using my link there are referral links if you use my link below and the code name paul nash oh stop it please you guys are embarrassing yourselves listen what a week it has been for financial influencers their reputations have just been going down the toilet people who promoted absolute garbage companies like ftx us and block five for millions of dollars today we're finally seeing the results as both of those companies are basically bankrupt and so today i'm calling out all the influencers who promoted it some of whom i know and i'm getting third wave embarrassment from it you know i know it's mind-bendingly stupid to imagine that people actually listen to youtubers for financial advice but we all know they do that's why they get offered these insane financial deals and these people had a responsibility to their fans and they blew it so i want to talk about it because it's a pretty big scandal and it involves a lot of people i know some of them some of them i've even done collapse with and just honestly it's crazy how many of the biggest financial channels took deals promoting this garbage and honestly none of y'all are getting off the hook today it's smoke for all of y'all if you do the crime you get the screen time i don't care who you are so i kind of showed a bit of it at the beginning of this video but it was incredible to me as i like looked through the archives just how many people got bought out by ftx us and let's face facts the biggest reason for that is money i asked around the sponsorship deals were absurd i know a guy much smaller channel than me making half a million a year 50k a month just to promote ftx us so i know the bigger guys were getting much more some of them probably the deals were in the millions so obviously that's a big reason a lot of them get it but i don't think that's the only reason because i think that'd be honestly too easy to say oh they were just greedy that's why they they did this i actually think it's worse than that i talked to a lot of these guys and they were a fool that's the scariest part so many of these experts who are giving you guys advice totally bought into this sam character as this genius billionaire right the most generous billionaire in the world who also happened to be paying them handsomely of course and i just think it shows how bad the discernment is out there making videos on how to invest it's alarming how many people fell for this guy's ruse and it's alarming how easy it was to convince them like some of these guys believed in sam because he drives a beat up car sam doesn't need the money to buy a lamborghini or to buy a rolex or to impress his friends in fact his car is a toyota corolla it's you trust the guy more when you see the car he drives he's worth like 20 billion dollars and he drives like this kind i don't want to call it beat up it's like a it's an older toyota not he doesn't even have window tints on them completely stocked toyota does that have to do with anything what does window tint have to do with sam's qualifications as an investor i mean look it's now coming out guys that at alameda research they were just kind of embarrassingly incompetent and the evidence was always there but nobody who is selling ftx bothered to take notice apparently they were too busy looking at the window tint here's the ceo of alameda for example saying she hardly uses math at her job yeah absolutely could pull it off without my math degree i use very little math use a lot of like elementary school math just beyond belief like i don't want to pretend like i'm some nostradamus who saw all this coming and nobody else did right i did call out ftx 24 hours before it shut down i did call ftx us out well before like 72 hours before it shut down but but i wasn't here with my crystal ball forecasting all of this years in advance but that's the reason i didn't promote this you know i get the same offers as everyone else but there's no way i'm gonna risk my audience you guys in a game of crypto among us like will this guy turn out to be a psycho in a year or two let's find out no no i'm not gonna do that and it's not because i'm better than anyone it's just because i know that even though i know a little bit about crypto i don't know enough to know for sure whether these companies are going to be around and that's the crazy thing is i think of everyone we're talking about today i probably know the most i probably have the biggest claim to like crypto expert and i would never feel comfortable saying that because there's just no way you know and so i think it exposes a big gaping flaw in this influencer world where it's not just the greed it's just this systemic failure of people to recognize their own lack of expertise and it's so easy for charismatic geniuses to convince these people based on basically no evidence take for instance meet kevin's seal of approval the guy's brilliant he talks so very very fast but he's brilliant and i trust him and i like him yeah really i talk really fast my brilliance is definitely up for debate but do you trust me with all your money because abysmal and now that this has all come out some of these guys are now coming out and apologizing as they should but is it enough because people like graham stefan now has made a video about it basically he said 24 hours before ftx us went bust like hey baby you should get your money off ftxus has been a sponsor here on the channel for the majority of the year this one i did not see coming i think it's pretty safe to say as a result of that i'm no longer working with them so if you hold anything on ftxus you could still take it out and transfer it to an external wallet or wherever else you please but how many people saw this compared to almost a year of ads or take tom nash someone who's appeared on this channel you know he took a different approach and basically said no one signed up under him the thing that you all deserve me to talk about ftx i was working with them a few months ago for about 30 days somehow during this whole month we were running the campaign literally nobody signed up for fdxus they called me and i was insulted in the beginning and they said look tom we gotta cut it short because we had like a three month plan to work together and they said look we're stopping after one month because nobody's signing up from your channel yeah i don't know if i buy that at minimum these are bad arguments like no one signed up for me or hey i gave you 24 hours notice like it's just such an embarrassing standard for this industry if you can even call it that because it's just a bunch of basically random people giving their opinion about finance and truthfully i just think it's a big lesson another lesson the millionth lesson that you shouldn't be actually taking real advice from the people who who you watch on these screens they're entertainers and they don't know much more than you about what they're actually selling now i will say one small thing in their defense a lot of smart people did get fooled blackrock was an investor and for you millennials even kevin o'leary got caught with his pants down number one i'm an investor in ftx international equity number two i'm an investor in ftx u.s equity number three i have accounts with ftx i have capital there inside of my account obviously like everybody else i'm gated currently yikes i guess it just shows how bad the advice out there was and how many people so many of these financial experts were full and then made fools of themselves by promoting this junk now the next thing i want to talk about is a company called blockfi which paused withdrawals yesterday it looks like they're also going to be bankrupt and i just want to talk about the influencers who promoted them as well here's a few clips of what i'm talking about [music] i have never taken on a paid sponsorship on my channel please use my link to sign up to this credit card and even though i'm not contractually obligated to speak positively about them don't forget to grab up to 250 worth of free bitcoin using this block by link right here it would really help me out a lot we didn't touch on this at all but the thing i'm most excited about for this year is the bitcoin rewards credit card which we're launching in the second oh now this is just a lot more of the same junk and once again i mean i would say this even more so we have evidence that these people were just bad at predicting this stuff they just had no idea what was going on because andre dick for instance said he keeps all his money on blockfi which just went under i keep most of my money in fact all of my crypto with blockfy both my ethereum my bitcoin everything rip to your portfolio my man now i also want to say meet kevin i think personally invested 420 000 into this platform which cool number i guess so i think he also lost a ton of money on that but i just think it's just a big lesson that you cannot take advice from these people i know the parasocial relationship is there and you start to feel that maybe they know something but a lot of them are googling it like five minutes before they go live okay that's the truth of it and i just think a lot of these influencers themselves should take a hard look at themselves because as much as it's ridiculous that anyone takes their advice they actually do and it's gonna hurt a lot of people for a long time so that's basically it i i just wanted to talk about this because i think it's so important and it involves a lot of the people in a i think a lot of my viewers might watch some of these people so yeah i just wanted to make a quick video on that
