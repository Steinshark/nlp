- this might be the best
pc that we have ever built on this channel, not even joking. it's not, but it... - [ken] aesthetic, aesthetically wise. - are you trying to say that like, you've built the best
pc when i'm not around? - [ken and matt together] yes. - you guys said that way too fast. [beep] - hey, what's going on
guys, this is ken, and- - hey, i'm matt. - that was terrible. - what? - and today, we're going to be
building a pc without austin. now, i don't know if you guys remember, but the last time we did this, it may or may not have looked like a bomb. - [matt] it did. it totally looked like a bomb. - but, today austin tasked
us with another project, this time to make a pc
that's a little festive. if i'm to believe that this
is going to be uploaded at the time of christmas. - ish. - ish. also, the last time matt and i built a pc, it was actually his
first time building one. - [matt] yeah, so this will be actually my second time building a pc. - but he's at least watched some of our videos at this point. - i've watched every pc build that austin has done over the past year. i feel like i could do this in my sleep. i'm probably wrong. i'm probably really bad at this. - in your sleep, but you're probably better at it when you're awake. - maybe. - but, before we get started, we need to actually buy some festive things. - all right, so we're trying to get some arts and crafts for the pc build. we're thinkin' something
like a winter village. - honestly, we're not even sure if things will catch
on fire or not, but... - everything we want to do is like, this is gonna be flammable. - but, makes for a good video. i like this. cloth snow. that'll definitely not catch on fire. - definitely, there's a 60 percent chance that it will definitely not. - oh, well, we have more things here, we've got like little trees. that might be useful, right? little trees. this santa, that's giving away gifts. yeah, no, i like the look
of that a lot, little santa. - [matt] you know what
i don't like about it? - [ken] what? - it's got glitter. already, already. - [ken] no, i don't see any, it's fine. you're fine. so far, we have, we've built a little town that has a pond, a skater. - [matt] she's going to the olympics. - [ken] she's uh, she's gonna grow up to be a gold medalist one day. success, right? what? - smells like farts out here. - it's fertilizer. [fart noise] - so if i pull the full austin, i just throw that for matt to clean up later. - [ken] i'm testing you. - i'm gonna be building a pc apparently. - [ken] build a pc so i don't have to. - so i'm gonna start with
this asus prime x470 pro. and you know, we chose
pretty much every single one of these parts, not because
of their price to performance, or even their performance. pretty much all of them is
because they came in white. - [ken] let me see, let me see. ah, yeah, look at that. so, it matches. - [matt] yeah, it's got a
fair amount of black on there but you know, that little bit right there was our deciding factor. - [ken] so this case, to preface, is actually gonna be
in another austin build with his wife karen. and for some reason, he chose this one. probably because it looks cool. we actually bought a second
one of these for our build. - i am not a pc kinda guy, but if i was to be building my own pc... - [ken] this is the one that you'd get? - i would probably grab this case. i'm too short for this, so
i'm gonna bring it down here. - [ken] okay, okay, okay. i gotcha, i gotcha, i gotcha. (yelling together) yeah. this lian li case is actually really cool 'cause it's glass on two sides here. - it looks almost like
it's a display case. - [ken] yes for a christmas,
or sorry holiday, diorama. - dioramas are where it's at. let's see if matty here remembers how to build a computer. i'm gonna put my static bracelet on. (ken groaning) - [ken] no. - with us buying
specifically for aesthetics and not performance, we cut a
little corners on some things. so we went with a second gen ryzen 5. - [ken] which isn't bad. - it's not bad. it's the 2600. i'm gonna look for the little triangle. - [ken] don't bend the pins man. - i'm not gonna bend the pins. - [ken] don't bend the pins man. yeah just, oh don't, you got
your thermal paste on there don't set it down. (both humming) need some help buddy? - i do, i have no idea how this goes on. - [ken] right, to be fair, i've only done one of these before. - [matt] already, you know, i'm so good at building computers,
that i just had ken help me with the cpu 'cause it scared me. i'd never encountered a
latching cpu cooler like this. - [ken] yeah but like,
the interesting thing about this cooler though
is that we're just barely clearing the ram dimms. we can ever so slightly make it, i mean, i'm pretty sure they designed this so that it will just barely clear. no i don't think it's rubbing dude, it's barely clearing it. yeah. - so that is making
slight contact over here with the heat sink, i
don't know how bad that is. this is not a tutorial, how to build a pc. this is don't do anything
that we're about to do. that looks roughly... - [ken] austin, what are you doing here? - it's fine. - get out.
- [matt] is the red light on? - [ken] get out. - i brought you packages [ken] you're not allow- we
needed those but get out. oh my god, dude.
- uh oh. - [ken] i'm locking the door. (beep) - i mean, frick. (upbeat music) - [ken] oh, there it is. - hey! - [ken] there you go. - i've done something that
austin has failed to do. and that's post a pc on the first try. - [voiceover] the next day. - so we finally got the pc done. overnight we got it updating, we got all the drivers installed. we set our rgb, everything's good. - we had to change things
around a little bit. i forgot to get a fan controller, because i don't know what that is. so, instead of the six fans that we were originally gonna have, we just have the three. - [ken] that are going in exhausts. - [matt] yes. - [ken] so it's just gonna let air out. which i think should be fine, 'cause we're not running
anything super hot here, in fact this wraith cooler will
do a lot of the work for us pretty efficiently and pretty well. we could try to overclock it if we want. - yeah we definitely have the ability to. - [ken] we'll try to see
what our thermals are at when we put our winter
wonderland in there. - when we stuff it with buffalo snow. being from, the buffalo-ish
area, buffalo bills i can tell you that this does
not look like buffalo snow. so then we knew we had
this little spot down here. we weren't sure how
the clearance would be. so we thought this little
pond would go well, so... - [ken] hey look at that. - you know, maybe... - [ken] it just sits right there. - [matt] maybe this goes about right here. does she clear this? it'll be clo- (cheering) - [ken] look at that! aw man, it's like we planned that. - i mean we did good. - [ken] i think if we
put this here, like this, go like this... - [matt] oh yeah that's lovely. - [ken] that's really nice. and it hides our cable too. - so what we'll probably end up doing... - [ken] hang him! - [matt] is hanging. right here.
- yeah, on the top. - all right so we have
roughly our layout here. this is looking pretty good, so now we're going to lay down the snow. we're gonna secure these down
with some double sided tape and add a little sprucing. - [ken] oh! - [matt] straight up
pressing up against the... - [ken] the components. - [matt] the components. - [ken] so don't do that. - [matt] so i mean, that's fine. right there, look at that, that's good. - [ken] tuck it in a little. we should totally put
snow on the graphics card. - no, no, no.
- why? why matt? - no, it just- - [ken] look at that. look at that. and hold on, i have the
piece de resistance. - what do we got? (low-key music) - there. - [matt] for safety. - just in case. - so we also have our spray. so i'm just gonna be- (sprays) oh.
- oh. oh boy, it's gonna, oh god. - [matt] in case you guys can't tell, this is super powerful. - [ken] let's see, let's see. oh! yes. oh matt, matt. yo, that's awesome. this almost reminds me of when
we did jimmy's halloween pc, when we did the blood
splatter on the glass. - [matt] yeah. - i'm kinda getting those same vibes, like, it worked surprisingly well. - ready? armed. - [ken] armed. all right. and- (christmas music) - austin, i wanna build a christmas pc. you were like trying to tell me you were gonna build a pc
inside a christmas tree, i was like, ken, go home, you're drunk. what exactly do you guys have here? also can i just say,
that having a fully on, which looks like it's on
pc underneath the blanket, not great for thermals. - this is the least of
our worries for thermals for this pc, as you will see in a second. (laughing) - [matt] yeah, so. - [ken] thumbs up? - dude, two thumbs up. - there's a bow. i know that's what you're laughing at. - you have fake snow on
top of the graphics card. it's about to be intaked by the fan. there's so much flammable stuff here. - [matt] yeah. down here we have a
little girl and her cat. she's getting presents from santa. that's fake santa. that's like mall santa. real santa is actually up here, him and that's donner actually. couple kids building a snowman. that's actually, that is jack frost. - jack frost himself? - yeah, that, so, we
licensed him for this. (cash register sound effect) - this is ridiculous. how did, okay, first of all, props that this has not caught on fire. congratulations. - yes, no, see, we were
actually pretty careful to not actually be
touching any components. - [ken] i mean, as you can see, like, we actually cleared
the fan back there too. - so this is, what's this back here? it honestly looks like
a smaller graphics card. - so gtx here's the thing. we went specifically for aesthetics here, and not necessarily based on, like, perfect performance to price. - are you trying to tell
me that you spent like, 2000 dollars on a pc with
like, kind of crappy specs? (disagreeing) - [matt] there's actually a thousand. - [ken] there's only a thousand. - okay. - this is a gtx 1660. we got it because it was silver, and it was low profile. - yeah, because, well i mean
it's still a double slot card but essentially you
wanted this other space to build a diorama. that makes sense. - to do all this up front we
have a 750 watt power supply. - (laughing) why? - which is way overkill for this. - wait, wait, 'cause it's in
the back of the case here. you can't even see it.
- it's white. - [ken] it's white.
- you can't even see it. - [ken] no, but most importantly
it came with white cables. - [matt] yes. - [austin] oh. - [ken] yeah. - oh wait, so i actually
gotta ask you about that. so i'm looking at the cables. i see that the gpu, the
power cord for the gpu goes inside the snow. - [matt] yes. - that's a really clever idea. - yeah, the thing with the power supply is the cables it came
with, while fully modular, it had the pigtails to do dual eight pin. i thought that was ugly, so i just cut it. - [ken] he just cut it, it's fine. it's fine, we're fine. - you're talking about a fire hazard. - it's taped. - so you take a pc, something
which is inevitably full of very hot, very power
hungry electronics. then you fill it up with what i'm sure is very flammable like, cotton. and then you take a power
connector and you saw it off. - saw it? no, no, we cut it with scissors. don't be insane. - [ken] we unplugged it
before we did it, so. - in fact, you'll be proud. i just took a cable that
wasn't plugged in ever, i just (vocalizing cutting sound), and then (vocalizing cutting sound), and then (vocalizing cutting sound). - guys you did an incredible job. like actually, this is ridiculous. i don't know why exactly,
you felt so compelled to build this pc, but, it's really good. it's honestly better than it should be. - [ken] i mean, we just wanted to add a little more holiday
cheer to the channel. - so what's the plan for this pc? who asked for this? - [ken] none of us did. - k. got it. it was mainly a ploy just to
make a video on the channel that's a little more festive. but, i'm gonna give this one to matt because it's his second
build, i think he deserves it. he can choose to do what he wants with what we did on the inside. - [austin] like remove all
of the flammable material from inside your pc? - [ken] yeah, i mean, if
you want to use it daily. - [matt] for the record,
i didn't even ask for it. he just said, "hey,
you're taking this because "i don't want it sitting around." - we don't have the room for it at all. but, it was a bonding
moment between me and matt. we had workplace bonding. a lot of workplace bonding. - it smells like farts out here. - so thank you very much for watching this holiday themed episode
of the austin evans channel. of course if you'd like a
little bit more holiday cheer in your life, you can
feel free to check out our holiday mystery tech,
it's available right here. and until next time, i will remind you please don't try this at home. and if your house burns
down, you can blame ken. and matt, but probably
ken, i think it's his idea.
