ladies and gentlemen for the first time in two years i played a competitive over theboard chess tournament and i won it with a perfect score of five out of five and i will be uploading all five games in a mini three-part series here on the gotham chess youtube channel this is episode number one and in this video we will cover games one and games 2 this was played at the madison avenue pub which is in toronto canada a month ago april 20 20 24 i was there for the candidates tournament toronto is an electric chess city with a bunch of meetups so they have my utmost respect and i went to this pub on a wednesday night and it was sensational it was an incredible tournament and actually this tournament was a major inspiration for me to restart the road to grandm series here on the youtube channel and inspired me to play competitive chess again i realized when i'm in a comfortable setting and i'm not feeling the anxiety or the nerves of competition i am a demon that night i played 20 games and i went 20 and 0 enjoy episode one of my little trip to toronto and the madison avenue pub tournament here we go oh and real quick i launched the patreon for the road to grandmaster title and i'm going to do a deep dive analysis of all of these games over there but for now enjoy the content okay i mean yeah that up actually [music] is bar h se here i hope the let's try to get you into the [music] second s [music] that [music] [music] [music] got [music] for [music] [music] [music] where [music] way [music] [music] [music] well my time i might have i feel like it's got [music] [music] [music] i for a second [music] was a rook sacrifice but i'm i'm not i'm not sure it was a i didn't see both i was like if i have to do a rook sacrif has to be with you so yes although i think that was more of a a little bit of a donation i mean yeah this case we could grab i don't know what p [music] [music] [music] well since i'm about day it was really close like the whole middle game man it was yeah i think once you i i saw you brought your kn so i couldn't you should have just wenton c5 faster yeah i know but like i thought like you had independence i i i didn't yeah well like before yeah like before you actually you one move before i went here and then you had to go c5 actually i was like i didn't like my position very much all right good luck l all right so [music] powerful okay you got memorize the mov isn't this cheating technically like our this r is this rated okay you just okay i see i see i see interesting maybe not there though what chest is all about no idea if you're making the right move or not like ever all right see if we can get to an end game with a levy okay we did it i mean you don't have to take back i don't have to take i want to take a video but there's like nothing on the board right now take a video take a video i need i need i want to see the exact moment that it all went downhill it equal after five moves like right all right let's see these endgame skills oh no there is none i just want to say that i got there and then people can infer i'm going to say nothing the camera footage dies yeah exactly exactly wasn't magnus here like recently was he oh i i you're the you're the local i don't know no i'm i'm actually from minneapolis oh so from so so wesley sville how did you accidentally stumble over here well i met her in columbia she's from here oh and she was a travel nurse and she spent some time in in minneapolis and that's how we got to know each other and now i'm back and forth oh yeah so very cool yeah h we should just talk for 2 minutes and 7 seconds more and you don't have to make a move you can just think yeah i wouldn't mind if you talk on your turn on your clock yeah i don't want to talk on your on your turn okay out of respect you know oh oh yeah i'm obviously not chess etiquette trained have to be quiet it's okay all right they don't talk at all in the tournaments so all right so we're already breaking rules yeah okay okay just passionately stare at one another this is a turn of events is this it's crazy kind of interested now are you invested invested are you invested okay so if i don't i'm going to have a very if you do this then this i feel like this is going to be a very sticky situation a second okay i don't know what's happening right now but i know what's happening it's not good for me the fut problem of course of course it's no problem all right so have a pawn in the center that's true you also have a minute i also have not enough time to think all right you're right let's just blunder quick quicker now why that's a good move let's just keep complimenting and then i'll catch you off guard and it'll be it'll be it'll be [laughter] great let's see people always say it's like a big accomplishment if they make me think which i find funny cuz i'm like that's what chess is you just got to think so [music] all right all right so let's go right let's try to see if i can just even further into the end game [music] now i have to i have to [music] all right i don't want to think i don't want to think play move so you don't have to think kind of thinking led me you were like oh i'm going to lose and i thought you know 10 moves are going to go by and well it's going to be over now i have to okay well now i have to avoid some checks it's like the kid in school who would say they never studied for the test and then they would actually hey listen listen i i didn't study for the test well not [music] properly proberly i mean i didn't i didn't start playing in childhood so all right you started playing in adulthood you're right that's just going to create issues issues are good i like issues ah all right all right all right all right well i have to move this guy all right well oh got 23 seconds oh beautiful beautiful yes i got fored by love your rman oh my gosh can't even win a game my claim to fame now every time i lose i'm going to be like you know what remember that time i lost to a night for from levy losing isn't so bad you haven't lost yet you haven't lost yet oh wait i can possibly win on time that's not going to happen but i might i i might like hang a piece i lost i've lost on time before it's really embarrassing but i've i've done it all right oh no tra no tra that that's still a trade unfortunately i no trades on purpose okay but that was an accidental trade that's this is not a trade all right that's just that's charitable by the way oh come on don't say that i guess i'll take the this one okay you can't oh yeah just move a piece scary scary ac of king what's going on all about peace activity peace activity peace activity peace activity why' you give me the okay it's psychological warfare the second opponent to sacrifice aook against me but that wasn't a good sacrifice you know i don't want that i don't want the knight on that outpost in the center of the board that's that's end game you know what i mean that's fair that's very smart but now i have two rooks you know but the rooks are not going to be connected soon they're they're already connected though but soon they won't be oh soon they won't be i mean you're right i what did i say what did i say is it a is there king hangs oh no no there's no oh so if you accidentally put yourself in check that's a win cuz it's is chess chess club that's true but i didn't see anything go ahead oh okay i didn't see i didn't see all right right there there we go yes that that we broke we broke the rules it's been a while since i've seen a rook between two kns like that yeah this is this is very confusing i'm going to lose both my rooks what is going on you saying that is going to make me move slower don't i'm really scared i don't want to get for so i'm just going to go over here all hold on hold on hold on random night move oh they forgot there's a 2c incur this whole time yes you you you you really forgot cuz you lost on time oh no a thanks ley i mean this was this is slowly you're going to lose all these pawns and you know i you know yeah what are you like 17'00 1700 w dead on dead on i just hit 17700 it felt sophisticated i mean also technically you're supposed to be higher rated than my first round opponent so well yeah i don't know i got lucky with a win maybe yeah yeah yeah also i'm like the greatest against the elo player of all time so yeah
