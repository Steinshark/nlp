[music] hey what's up mkbhd here and what a day to be a video creator in a studio also if you're wondering about this shirt you can get it at shop.mkbhd.com but also if you want to try your hand at a free one well currently the biggest tech giveaway of all time is going on right now a collaboration with me mr who's the boss and dbrand there's literally dozens of iphones and galaxy s 22 ultras and ps5s and nintendo switches and more and there are some shirts in there with all that tech too link below if you want to enter so today apple announced a bunch of new stuff some of which is kind of boring but some of which is really interesting here so the beginning of the event was pretty chill they dropped an apple tv plus announcement with some exclusive friday night baseball games meh i don't really watch that much baseball so yeah kind of boring then they drop some new colorways for the iphone 13 so there's a new solid green 13 and alpine green 13 pro so that's fine you know they already have a red so they couldn't add that as the mid-cycle refresh but green cool got it and then we got the iphone se refresh that we were all expecting this is the budget iphone and apple absolutely followed the same formula they typically do so they put the new chip in here it's the same a15 bionic that's in the iphone 13 and in the old body which in this case is still the iphone 8. they also give it 5g sub 6 only so no millimeter wave and that's it so that's that's the iphone se i mean they did so the new chip gives it a deep fusion gives it hdr4 gives it the new photographic styles and they did also throw in a slightly larger battery so that's all good but no surprises at all here it's kind of funny the se and iphone sc used to well it stands for special edition but honestly this is the most formulaic boring non-special phone that apple makes and then the price they dropped is actually slightly higher than last year it's 429 instead of 399. still probably one of the best budget phones in its general class that's giving you the best performance and one of the best cameras so i'll probably still review it if you guys are interested there's a lot of competition at that price so it won't be easy to win it but that's the iphone se and then the ipad air also got an update same body and design as before but now there's an m1 chip inside now apple's been way ahead in the tablet performance and packaging for a while and this is just another example of that this will be an absurdly fast chip the fastest in any tablet and it's in the package of an ipad air now for 5.99 plus they also updated the selfie camera to the 12 megapixel ultra wide with center stage it also gets 5g and it's got a thunderbolt port now because of m1 and it added a new blue color as far as i can tell that's that's it everything else is the same same battery same display same fingerprint reader same design all that and they mentioned they wanted to keep making steps forward on their commitment to the environment so they're using recycled design i mean sorry recycled aluminum recycled aluminum in this thing i'm still mad they haven't added final cut pro to the ipad yet this thing is so powerful and still i mean imovie is fine but like come on add final cut pro cowards but then we got to the real meat of the presentation the unveiling of the new mac studio with m1 ultra chip and a new studio display now this this is interesting to me not just because we have a youtube channel called the studio make sure you get subscribed to that and not just because the studio dog's name is mac so we already have a studio mac but yeah this particular machine feels so perfectly targeted it's clearly built for someone like me oh are you a creative professional in a studio okay so yeah this is this is for you you've got my attention so this all starts with the new chip that's inside that they announced which is called the m1 ultra so basically you can think of this as two m1 max chips fused together i mean technically speaking that's not that far off so a single m1 max by itself that chip in the highest end macbook pro that's already crushing was the largest and most powerful chip apple ever made this m1 ultra i guess shout out to samsung for the ultra name behaves like a single massive chip literally 2.5 terabytes per second of bandwidth between the two halves of the chip and then 800 gigs per second of memory bandwidth for the whole combined thing but the whole thing has 64 or 128 gigs of unified memory it has a 20 core cpu with 16 of those being high performance cores for high efficiency and with a 48 core or 64 core gpu so that's good stuff that's good stuff it's the new biggest most powerful chip apple's ever made that lives at the top of their lineup and the only machine that they announce that will have this new m1 ultra chip inside it is the new mac studio so this thing is it's in the shape of a mac mini if the mac mini ate a lot of extra maybe it ate another mac mini i don't know basically it's roughly the same 7x7 footprint but it's much thicker it's a whole 3.7 inches tall so still small enough to fit under most monitors but if you have a ruler or something or if you happen to know exactly how big 3.7 inches is you know you can see that's pretty tall and can fit on most desks but honestly this is a fascinating design basically it has all these perforations at the bottom where it's sucking in fresh cold air and then basically half the internal volume of this thing is for cooling there's a bunch of fans in the top and it's pushing that hot exhaust air out of the top half of the back of it now i'm no expert but i'm just looking at the thing and it looks like it has enough cooling but also it worries me just a little bit just a little bit because it reminds me kinda of the old trashcan mac pro so you remember that thing also had the cool air coming in the bottom all the components in the middle and then the cooling out the fans at the top but i'm thinking apple's learned their lesson from that machine especially because now this is after all their own silicon instead of hot intel chip and huge dedicated gpu but yeah i'm just saying that's a lot of power in a pretty compact box basically but then last but not least there's the new studio display so they dropped a 27-inch 5k display that looks like a junior version of the pro display xdr just minus the whole xdr thing basically so it's got a couple different stand adjustments and i'll get to the pricing of all the stuff in a second it has a nano texture glass option and there's a webcam and speakers in there the webcam is familiar once again it's a 12 megapixel ultrawide camera with center stage built in a triple mic array and a six speaker setup that supports dolby atmos and spatial audio so okay for my take so on the chip i am very impressed i mean i definitely want to get it in here in our studio and do our benchmarking and testing because apple did show a bunch of graphs again as they usually do but they cycled through them very quickly and a lot of them weren't super useful but it basically looked like they did most of their comparisons against the old imac pro which is no longer on their site anymore rip and then against the current intel mac pro tower which you still can technically buy but definitely shouldn't so on paper they're just going to brag about performance per watt right so they're saying it uses less power than this core i5 and better cpu performance than a core i9 12 900 k at the same power consumption and it can deliver the same performance at 100 watts less power which is great for everybody's electricity bill and for thermals and then of course they're saying it'll take way less power than an rtx 3060 ti and can take 200 watts less power than an rtx 3090 while delivering the same performance which sounds absolutely sick but i'm gonna be testing that for myself we gotta see so we'll have those machines in here sooner or later and make sure you get subscribed to see those videos when they come out but then as far as the max studio itself i'm very tempted or i should say i'm interested so this machine actually starts with the m1 max in it and that one starts at two thousand dollars but then they'll ship you the m1 ultra max studio that starts at four thousand dollars and that one has two thunderbolt ports on the front by the way instead of the two usbc if you get the m1 max and on apple's site you can spec it up to the 64 core gpu for a thousand bucks you can double that unified memory for 800 bucks and you can go up to eight terabytes of storage for a total max of eight thousand dollars which isn't actually that crazy but my main question and i tweeted this during the event is basically is this a mac mini pro or is it a mac pro mini and that's a real there's a real difference and that actually matters because if this new machine this mac studio outperforms the literal highest end 28 core mac pro then is this the end of the road is this the highest end machine that apple now needs to make to complete the transition of all the macs this will basically make it the new mac pro just happens to be small enough to fit on your desk but is totally capable of running a whole studio or even doing things that the current mac pro isn't doing it has double the media engine so it can now play back' streams of 8k prores 422 video like how could you possibly need more than that i'm looking at our i'm looking at the the intel mac pros over here with the 28 chord xeon chip and 768 gigs of ram and the vega 2 gpu and i'm like that that got to end of life pretty quickly it was pretty expensive but john turnes did say something at the very end of the presentation together with the studio display these products will empower users to create the studios of their dreams and to continue to change the world and they join the rest of our incredible mac lineup with apple silicon making our transition nearly complete with just one more product to go mac pro but that is for another day now back to tim and see that that actually answers the question see it's not a mac pro mini it's a mac mini pro it's a it's a small desktop computer that sits right on your desk on your mouse pad just like that and costs a tenth of the price of the big dog and just happens to be just as capable if not more capable because of the architecture but yeah it's it's clearly not the end of the line and there's still one more like there's a reason there's still a bunch of mac pro towers behind them in their labs and they're not all replaced with mac studios the tower form factor can still unlock the very highest end of power and modularity and what the mac is capable of so that'll have i guess a new chip we haven't even heard about yet and that's the one i'm going to keep waiting for although clearly the new mac studio maxed out should be totally capable of handling everything we do here in this studio now the studio display stan included starts at 15.99 it's an extra 300 for the nano texture coating and an extra 400 to make that stand height adjustable which is kind of crazy now there is a lot of talk about whether or not this is actually a good price for this monitor overall and i think the reason that's actually kind of hard to answer is there isn't really any other monitor out that's exactly like it so the way i kind of look at it it's like they it's if they took a 27-inch imac display and just popped the display out exact same panel same brightness same resolution same size and then just repackaged it and put a bunch of apple features around it so i mentioned the webcam with center stage you know other monitors have webcams and mics but not quite like this you know other monitors have speakers too but if the macbook pro speakers are anything to go by then these are probably pretty unique as well and then the monitor has a whole a13 bionic chip inside just to act as a super high powered image signal processor for that webcam to do noise cancellation on the microphones and for your three usb-c ports and one thunderbolt port around the back basically this is like everything the lg 5k ultra fine monitor ever wanted to be except that thing came out six years ago had basically the same specs but this is a much cleaner packaged much better looking you know first party version so i think if that's what you're looking for it's still pricey but it is pretty unique in that way you know it's not hdr it's not higher fresh rate there's lots of things that it isn't but you know it'll pair well with basically any mac and that's what it does well that makes it so good but so that that's it there you have it those are my reactions honestly get subscribed to this channel if you want to see the evaluations in the machines as they come in and get subscribed to the studio channel if you want to see my reactions to the events sort of in real time and as we evaluate them when they show up here those videos are always really fun either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys soon peace [music]
