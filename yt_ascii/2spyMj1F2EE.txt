hello and welcome to the third video in the iron man visual effects tutorial series using blender last week i covered rigging the model and this week is going to be focusing on making some photo real textures so by default when you download the model it actually already comes with a load of textures assigned so if i go into material preview you can see that they're kind of already assigned to the right areas apart from the legs which have something funky going on so the good news is we'd have to go through and manually apply textures to the various parts of the model we basically just use these and adjust the material so that they don't look terrible like this for some reason the legs are broken so that's going to be the first order of businesses fixing them for now i'm just going to apply the red material to everything and then we can go back and kind of amend it later and then for these bits on the legs these are meant to be silver i believe so we'll apply the silver material first thing i'm going to do is open up the shader editor so we can get stuck in with the materials let's start with red because this is obviously one of the main materials the secret to achieving photo realism is quite hard to put your finger on a lot of it is from the shading process but if you don't have a lighting setup that kind of makes it sit into your environment it's very hard to judge how close the material actually is to what you want it to look like so personally what i like to do is set up an hdri that's very similar to the setting that we're going to be putting the model in so you can see how the materials react in that kind of lighting now i actually took the time to make my own hdri and i took a 360 photo at loads of different stops of dynamic range which gave me all the lighting information from my bedroom basically where i shot this as you can see the model is now in my bedroom and this is where i shot it so now they're going to be able to light the model realistically get all the lighting directions and the intensity right and also because the suit is quite shiny it'll pick up some reflections of the hdri around it as well which will help embed it in so we jump back to the object settings at this point what you need to do is jump over to a website like textures.com and get some pbr photo textures searching for something like meta will give you loads of options like this already i use something like this for the gold it's actually a bronze texture but it has a really nice kind of scuffed up look to it that looks quite like the iron man helmet when you find one you like you go through and download each of these image textures at the bottom some of them will have more or less maps depending on what the material is but in general i think these are the main four that will contribute to making the material look realistic i spent a while trying to get a good texture for the red and what i found eventually was i searched for a paint material and used like a green blistered paint it's this one here so it's called blistered paint and it is green obviously i hue shifted it so it's red and then for the actual metal material i used this called medieval metal again i went through a few and this was just the one that i found gave me the results i was looking for you don't have to use the exact same ones i've used but if you'd like to those are the names of them but get something along those lines and then you can use those image textures in blender so once they're downloaded we can start bringing them in and applying them to the model a shortcut to do this that i've found recently and fallen in love with is ctrl shift t when you have the principled bsdf shader selected and then go to the folder where you've stored all of your materials for this particular material that i downloaded it gave me more image textures than i actually needed so i'm only going to select the ones i want so those are going to be the diffuse the normal the roughness the specular and the bump we're going to ignore displacement and ambient occlusion for now and then if you click principal texture setup and bring those in it's going to do it all for you it's absolutely amazing you do have to make sure that the image textures are using the right texture because sometimes the automatic setup gets the wrong images if they're not named correctly so for example it set the metallic to be the bump which isn't correct when i was doing this for the first time i looked at a lot of reference images from the films especially the first suit up sequence because that's kind of the main one i'm modeling this after and if you look at the textures on the suit in this screenshot a lot of the materials aren't actually really reflective like you would expect they're definitely metallic but they're not really glossy they have kind of a matte look to them so the reflections become quite diffuse especially in the mask so that's kind of what i wanted to emulate so the first thing i'm going to do is make this red so it's a little bit closer to what we're trying to go for i'm going to use an rgb curves node and just take out the green and put some red in instead so we go to green take out a lot of the green and then make it more red next up we want to actually unwrap the model because at the moment it's not displaying really any of the textured detail because the uvs aren't set up for most things you would go through and kind of unwrap the model really precisely and add seams and stuff where you can't really see them for this because it's mostly going to be procedural shading i'm just going to select everything and then press unwrap and i'm going to do a q projection unwrap and what this should do if we go back into material mode yep is unwrap the whole thing some of these we're going to have to do manually because they've kind of got the scale wrong so i'm just going to go through and do some of them individually so if we go back into rendered view we can start to look at this in a little bit more realistic lighting the bump is obviously way too much it looks like the suit's been underwater for 100 years and rusted so i'm going to turn the distance right down something like .05 and maybe turn the strength down something like point one we want it to have a little bit of texture so it's good to have a bit of bump and stuff in there but the suit is mostly supposed to be kind of like a sports car material so you don't want it to be too rough i think it's still a little bit too matte we want to add a little bit more reflectiveness into that so to do that we can use a color ramp on the roughness texture to kind of fine tweak it a little bit the color ramp basically just allows you to control the black and white points of the image texture and depending on where you put these it will make a difference to the roughness of the overall texture so for example dragging the black in more will make it more reflective and if you drag the white down to the other way it will become really really diffuse we want to go somewhere in the middle of that so i'm going to pull the black in until it starts to look a little bit reflective but not too mental and i'm also going to lift it to more of a dark gray than total black which just kind of helps to even it out a little bit okay we're going to come back and tweak that a bit more in a bit but let's go on to the gold for now so in the gold material i'm going to select the principal shader again press ctrl shift t and navigate to where my gold texture is this one's more simple so we just have an albedo or a diffuse metallic normal and roughness so i'm going to select all of them hit import texture setup it's gone a bit brown so we're going to make a few adjustments but this is already pretty close to what i was after so i'm just going to add another rgb curves node onto the diffuse and just lift it up and make it brighter i'm going to do the same trick with the roughness where i make it a little bit less reflective just by bringing the black point up slightly on the roughness texture something like that looks pretty good let's quickly take a look at the silver texture for now as well so if we jump in here ctrl shift t find the silver bring these in so as you can see this is the medieval metal that i mentioned earlier this one i don't even think really needs that much change it looks pretty good out of the box i think this one could probably be a little bit more reflective to be honest so i'm going to add a color ramp onto the roughness and i'm going to make it more reflective by just dragging the black in a little bit so just go for something like that maybe raise it to a dark gray like i did before and some of the other ones i'm going to make an emission material for the reactor and i'm also going to just add a little bit of detail into this model so i'm just going to extrude it down a little bit and then back into itself and then extrude it down again and make a little thing in the middle then what i'm going to do is add a new material i'm just going to call this emission and instead of a principal bsdf shader i'm going to press shift s on this go to shader and change it for an emission shader that's just going to swap it to a different node add a slight hint of blue onto this set that's something a bit brighter so it's lighting up the suit a little bit and then because that's now super bright and you can't see any of the detail what i'm going to do is go in and assign some of the faces to be a steel material so we just do every other face and then make it the metal material that should add a bit of detail into the reactor when i composite this i'll go in and add a glow onto the reactor so you'll lose these a bit in the glow anyway but they just help to add some detail into that section of the mesh that's nearly all the basic texture set up now the only thing that's left to do is set up all of the stuff inside the suit in these areas under the flaps all of this is obviously supposed to be different materials to make it look cool as you can see here there's also a dark silver material as well as the normal silver one so what i'm going to do is go on the silver material select all press ctrl c to copy it then go into the dark one and then press ctrl v to paste the silver material into here and then all you have to do to make it darker is just pull down the rgb curves so then what you can do is select this whole section and apply a dark silver material to it and then just go in and apply some other materials like the silver to lighten up and add some detail there's also all of these wires running down inside here so what we're going to do is create some sort of generic plastic materials that we can use for the wires so i'm going to add a new material and i'm going to call this blue plastic and for this one because it's really simple i'm just going to make this blue and turn the roughness down a little bit and you can see in the preview here it becomes a bit shiny and then just go in and just press l on some of the ones you want to be blue which selects the whole mesh and if you hit assign that will make them blue then what we can do is grab this principled bsdf node make a new material i'm going to call this yellow make some yellow wires and we can delete this one and then just paste this in here and make it yellow and now we have yellow as a color then i'm going to make one for red wires and then i'm going to make one more this is going to be black and then go in and select the remaining wires that aren't yet colored and there we go that's the internals set up it looks really cool the detail in there is lovely so now the suit is pretty much textured and if you wanted a really clean looking iron man you could basically just use this and it's done but one thing i like to do is go in and add things like fingerprints and scratches and lots of surface imperfections just to add that extra little level of detail i'm going to show you a couple of ways of doing this one of them is procedural and doesn't look quite as good but it's really easy for just making loads of little areas of the suit a bit worn out and then we're going to hand paint some materials for the mask to do some custom scratches so first of all on the red material what i'm going to do is create an entirely separate setup and i'm actually going to borrow all of the nodes from the silver setup and copy and paste these into here and put it above so the silver setup is up here and what i'm going to do is create some procedural areas of noise that will allow us to show this undercoat of unpainted metal through and blender has a way of doing this that kind of detects the edges of a model if they're at a certain angle so we can use that to our advantage and that could be the basis of the effect so the way to do this is to add a geometry node and if you cycle through these by holding ctrl and shift and clicking if you have the node wrangler add-on enabled if we come down to the pointiness attribute if you look quite closely this is highlighting the edges of the mesh so any areas that have sharp angles become lighter and any areas that are flat become darker and to exaggerate this we can add a color ramp node put this onto the pointiness output and just crank up the black levels and as you can see this is exaggerating the edges that are detected so what i can do now is combine the red and the chrome materials by using a mix shader again if you have the node wrangler add-on enabled you can select both the principal shaders and then press ctrl and zero and that will automatically create a mix shader node and plug the two in and then to combine them using the pointiness as a mask you take the color output from the color ramp and plug it into the factor on the mix shader and then if we swap these two inputs around the red will be the predominant one and then on the edges where the mask is you can see it's starting to bring through some of the silver and you can kind of tweak this to however you like so if you want more of the silver to come through you can take the black back and it will kind of reveal more i like it to be quite subtle because otherwise it starts to look a little bit crazy and if i hop between the two so that's the red on its own and that's the red with the silver enabled in some areas for some bits it might be a little bit too much so for these bits what i'm going to do is just assign them to be the normal red texture so what i'm going to do is make a new texture i'm going to add the red texture to this slot as well and then i'm going to press this button here which makes a duplicate of it but keeps the same settings and then i'm going to name the first one red weathered because that's the one with all the scratches and then the second one will just be normal red and then for the normal red one i'm going to basically bypass all of this stuff at the top and just look at the normal red shader for the metal and then all you have to do is apply these to the bits of the model that you don't want to be weathered so for example if i add the red to this one and then assign it that will get rid of all the weathering on this section of the model same thing for the legs if i want to do it to these bits because i think they don't need to be weathered i can assign just the normal red material to them and you can see on the hands it's really exaggerated to the point where the fingers have just turned silver so let's go in and get rid of that completely a quicker way to do this is to set one of them just to be normal red and then what you can do is select all the ones that you want to apply that to and then shift select the one that you've just changed press control l and then materials and that will basically copy the material data from this one to all of the ones you had selected cool i think that's looking good so now the final step is to make some custom painted textures i'm going to do this on the mask because this is kind of the focal point of the suit and what i'm going to do is use a scratch texture to kind of stencil some scratches onto the face so to do this i'm going to select the mask i'm going to exit the shader editor and go to the image editor and i'm going to add a new image so press new i'm going to call this scratches and i'm going to make it 2048 by 2048 so it's a little bit higher resolution turn off the alpha channel because we don't need that and then press ok then i'm going to open another window and open the shader editor inside of here and let's go to the materials slot and i'm going to create a new material i'm going to load the gold material into this as well and then i'm going to duplicate it and call it gold mask and then in the shader editor i'm going to import this image texture that we just created that's currently black called scratches and before i do anything else i'm going to save it because blender loves to delete your image textures when you close out without saving them so it's always good to save and before going in and painting anything on this we're going to have to unwrap it properly because this isn't a procedural material this is actually going to be hand painted so i'm going to go into edit mode and just isolate this because the topology is good you can probably just loop select an entire section so let's try this there we go then you can press ctrl e mark seam and then let's try and do the same for this one there we go mark seam again now let's see what happens if we unwrap this let's go to the uv image editor yeah so we've got the two main sections of the face the front that are unwrapped nicely the rest of this we can just scale down to be tiny it doesn't really matter and then we can make these two nice and big so they're maximizing the use of the texture space now i'm going to press ctrl tab jump into texture paint mode and if i start painting on this you can see how it's going to work essentially instead of painting lines like this by hand what i'm gonna do is use a scratch texture that i found online really simple to find you can just type in scratch texture on google and you'll probably find loads the more high contrast one tends to be better because you get a bit more control over them i find the ones that have a little bit less detail are easier to use because you don't end up with a million scratches when you start painting so if we go over to the tools for the paintbrush we can come down to the texture box and add a new texture i'm going to call this scratches and then you can come down to the texture settings and open the scratches image that you've saved or wherever you saved it so if i open this one you can see now we have a stencil that we can move around and rotate and paint onto the mesh you right click and drag to move it around hold ctrl right click and drag to rotate it and then hold shift and right click and drag to scale it and then basically all you have to do is just go in and start painting on top of the mesh you don't want to go too crazy so i'm just going to paint a few and then sort of move it away and see how it looks it also helps if you keep the brush quite small so you don't do too many that you don't want to then when you're happy with how it's looking come over here and go to image and just save it so that it's definitely saved and you're going to lose it when you close blender then you can exit texture paint mode and we can start to use this in the shader editor so if i go back into material preview mode we've currently got the scratches texture loaded into the mask shader so now what we want to do is similar to how we made the second material for the red paint to be worn away we're going to copy the silver material again paste it up above and then i'm going to select both of the principal shaders and then press ctrl zero to make a mix shader and join the two together then i can take the color output of the scratches texture and plug it into the factor and if we swap these two around like before should start to see some scratches coming through maybe it's a little bit too faint at the moment you can kind of see them there to exaggerate it more we want to add a color ramp into this and just crunch it up so that the blacks are really really black like that basically the more contrast you add the more the scratches will stand out so if we look at this again now you can see the scratches are a lot more visible and if you want the scratches to be darker or lighter you can change the color of the silver material up here with the curves and then on top of that to add some even more detail you can use the scratches texture as a bump map which will basically make you look like the scratches are actually indented into the metal a bit so to do that just add a bump node and plug the output of the color ramp into the height and then to combine this with the metal shader we can basically replace the image texture normal map with the normal map that we created for the scratches so just plug the normal output from the bump into the normal input on the principal shader now if i look at this you can see it creates some really deep scratches you can turn the distance down if it's a bit too much so i might go like minus 0.6 and then you can also turn the strength down to something a bit more subtle and that's looking pretty good so now if we look at the overall shader combined this is with the gold and you can see where the scratches are they're a different color and they look indented into the metal and then the rest of it is gold how it should look and that's pretty much it that's how to create all the textures for the iron man model you can play around with those different techniques and make it more or less battered if you like so that's all the texturing done gonna wrap the video up there next week we're gonna be looking at animating it and actually tracking it onto the body in some live-action footage which should be really fun remember
