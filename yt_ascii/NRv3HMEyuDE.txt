grayscale pictures from interplanetary space were actually sent back from mars to earth in from the mid 60s onwards and yeah i mean we call these black and white pictures as you all know by now they're not they're really grey scale pictures the scale used at the time was one of 64 shades and if i put that there black was shade 63 actually and over here just probably just off the page is shade 0 which is white interplanetary space and you're transmitting radio signals with the shades of gray on it's a very noisy place there's x-rays gamma rays cosmic rays generally there's solar sunspots flares everything the amount of radio noise is quite considerable and what this means is that typically up to 25 of your shade of gray pixels in your photos can get corrupted in flight if you look at these two pictures that one there is actually very fuzzy and when you look at the scar you might think oh there's lots and lots of quasars and tiny stars i know it's not it's noise and if you compare it with the other one that's been cleaned up you can see the contours on mars are sharper the sky is much blacker so that's the idea then you've got noisy photos noisy grayscale pictures being sent back how do you correct them and get them to look really really good the early mariners just did a flyby of the planets i think mariner 3 unbelievable this did a flyby and then transmitted the results back at eight bits per second for a 200 by 200 pixel array it only took eight hours part of the problem of space being so noisy is that you cannot start having mega bits per second between the planets in fact dr bagley dr steve was talking to me about this yesterday and saying what bit rate did they get on mariner 9 and the answer is 16 kilobits per second also don't forget that at the time that the mariner 9 venture took place roughly speaking it took radio signals nine minutes to get from earth to mars now you realize this is a movable feast because it depends where earth and mars are relative to one another in their orbits i think i looked up it can be anything between 6 minutes and 23 minutes and at mariner 9 time it was 9 minutes so the other thing to say is to those of you skeptics who say oh look we got a corrupted picture why not send back a signal and ask it to transmit again are you joking you're gonna spend you know it took nine minutes to get you've got nine minutes to get a knot out knowledge signal back to mars and then wait another nine minutes to hopefully get a better one that doesn't get corrupted 27 minutes no i mean you can forget any idea of tight interaction with planetary spacecraft you cannot do that and this i think does bring it home to those of you who say well if in doubt just send it again no you can't do that here is the real case where you've got to pack enough check bits around the message that you can clean it up without asking for a re-transmit even when you've got the pictures back and you see all this corruption you think oh heck how clever can i be how am i going to clean these up and let me just remind you once again about how you measure payload versus correction bits and so on and then i'll reveal to you what ratios between those were actually used in mariner 9 n k d notation that is total number of bits per code word the code word is basically saying here is the package it's got the message bits in it packed around with parity checking bits to make sure it gets through okay and the idea of this game is to keep the code words as far distant as possible and by distance what we're saying is take a code word take another code word look at how many places in the bit pattern are different and that is your distance and the bigger you can keep that distance apart the more chance you have that the corruption and damage won't mislead you it's like you want to send a parcel of eggs somewhere yeah it's how much packing you put in isn't it and physically how far they are yes how far apart are they exactly so and of course the further apart you put your eggs the bigger the package gets with lots of fluffy woolly stuff in keeping them apart from one another yeah it's it's it's quite right that's exactly what it is okay so total bits per code word is n k is the message bits the payload the ones that really count these are the things that are going to communicate which of your 64 shades of grey that pixel is and just remember because it's sobering every one of these great long strings we send is giving you the colour of one pixel mariner sixth time it was a 200 by 200 grid by mariner 9 you say you make a rod for your own back it had gone up to 700 by 830 not perhaps quite as good as modern video screen but you know getting there so back to this then d is that distance i was telling you about the people at jet propulsion laboratory have got a lot of really really good communications engineers who are also coding theorists and what they came up with a code to answer all of these conflicting claims was one where the overall message length is 32 bits packed inside that is a 6-bit message carefully hidden and carefully protected and the distance is amazing it's 16. for those of you still with us who are computer scientists the reason we've got six here is that two to the power six two times two times two times two six times over is the magic 64 which we number from zero to 63 because we're computer scientists and everything starts at zero this distance will give you a figure number of correctable errors remember this is d and here's my little bit of mathematical notation floor of d minus one over two what does floor mean i'll tell you in a minute but let's work out the four little formula in the middle my d value is 16 okay so on this occasion i'm finding the floor of 15 over 2. 15 over 2 7.5 floor of means if you've got a decimal part to your number in there then round everything down it doesn't matter even if it's 7.8 it would round down so floor means round down ceiling is forcibly rounding up what we're doing floor here floor of 7.5 is seven so this is amazing performance actually what it's saying is that in these 32-bit packages you can have up to seven bits go wrong and they there you always say it's 25 the reason they chose this was they knew that roughly speaking you could get up to 25 errors depending on whether it's a good day or bad day for cosmic rays at the moment you know but this really worked well 32 bits we're in the 1960s older viewers will know heaven sent that fits her into an ibm mainframe word because powerful computers in those days really expensive ones and even the newly emerging deck mini mainframes had 32 bits i mean it's old hat now everything 32 bits being phased out in favor of 64. but this fitted so well you've got a 32-bit package six of those hidden bits in there carrying the message up to seven correctable errors inside here and this particular code is very famous because it had been proposed way way back before the mariner program in the 1950s as a good way of getting lots of error correction going inside a transmitted packet oh and by the way even on mariners you know the camera could gather information faster than it could ever be transmitted so the mariners had a little tape recorder on board and they tape recorded the scan of the picture and then trickled it out overnight at 16 kilobits per second overnight over earth night presumably so it's been a story that's gone on now for the best part of 50 more years and i think it's a good place to stop but some of you i know will want to follow up saying show me how to read them other code works because i want to do it for myself well today is hardcore coding theory relatively speaking it's still 64 shades of grey for those of you looking for the sequel and remember the sequel is always better than the original thing
