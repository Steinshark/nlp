foreign [applause] welcome to dubai [music] [applause] [music] my usual breakfast 3x avocado toast protein powder and sometimes bacon it's actually quite hard to find bacon here in dubai basically in waitrose this is like separate section for like pork for non-muslims it literally says that so i was able to find some let's eat [music] at around 9am and we are done with breakfast mornings are literally my favorite time of the day it's just something about you know being awake early before most people are awake and just getting on with the day that is like really is calming like exciting at the same time because every day when i wake up i'm so excited about the things that i'm gonna be doing that day if you're not at this point yet where you're this excited for life as i am like i promise you it is worth it i just like figure out what is the thing that for you could be that thing that gets you this excited that gets you excited to wake up every morning so in terms of then what i'm actually doing now with my life here in dubai so i've left my full-time job i'm now doing it full-time entrepreneurship essentially and with that there's like a couple of different aspects first of all is obviously my youtube channel that's my main cash flow business right now that's bringing me money to like keep living and to like keep saving and all that my long-term plan is to build something really scalable like a specifically a scalable piece of software and there's two apps that i'm working on right now number one is a fintech startup but then the other software that i'm building actually i don't want to tell exactly what it is it's sort of a secret thing but it's something that's going to be very relevant to you guys like people learning to code essentially and then another opportunity i have is that i might be becoming a co-founder in yet another startup but like there's gonna be so many things going online really gonna have to figure out like what makes more sense to focus on and currently i'm also doing one-on-one coaching for like where i literally coach people to get jobs so i've talked about that before so in this video i wanted to give you a very realistic picture of what a day in my life doing all of these things really looks like right here in dubai [music] thank you foreign [music] the functionality that i've been working on most recently for my app the ability for the user to upload a csv of their bank transactions the way i do that is by clicking here and using a file and after you choose the currency it will display the transaction this is sleek grid or you can move the columns around other things like that the goal is that when someone clicks the save button it's actually going to send that data into a database but for now when they click it simply console logs in so that's the problem i'm solving and this is the react component that i'm working on basically i found this tool called ag grid that's full of ready-made templates for really responsive grid so i've been using that because it does exactly what i want essentially what happens right now is when someone clicks on import csv it will run this massive function which will go through the file and format it in a way that it actually displays we'll set the roles it will set the currency and things like that and then the user can do things like delete certain rows or and after they do that this save function should call this function right here which for now simply console logs the files in the console but the goal is that instead of console login them is going to send them to my backend so the flow looks like this the user uploads their transactions they use the dashboard which sends them to a backend server which instead of node.js i have decided to use django 4 for various reasons and then the django backend will send it to a database where all the user's transactions will be stored so that is why i have been essentially relearning django and databases because it's basically been like six months since i've used it before okay i also decided to film a video today here's a sneak peek of the filming set basically i took my table from where i work from there which is where it was before and i moved it well focus i'm only there on my light a microphone my big camera and i basically just close the curtains and i have this pretty cool filming set right here i think i might like let me know what you guys think i might use this [music] foreign [music] i just remember how much i actually like coding but anyway i do need to head to dubai mall right now because this is actually a funny story well not funny for me but you might find this funny i was at the gym and they have these lockers with this like number combination locks i put my shoes and my backpack inside but then when i went to open it i swear i knew what combination i put on the lock but somehow i couldn't open it you know i swear the lock just doesn't work properly probably is my fault i need to go back and like basically find who is able to open those locks hopefully but at the time when i was there there was no one like that's not really the reason why i'm buying new ones it's like i have been meaning to buy new shoes for a long time anyway and also a new backpack because my old one is kind of broken so i was like okay might as well do it now seeing as i also need to go to dubai mall to do some other business so catch you there [music] get a car the next station [music] [music] foreign [music] i still have a few slots open in my internet
