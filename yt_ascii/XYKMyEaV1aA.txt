this looks kind of suspicious what's it limbs on it though what's this oh camera found it that that was a good one can't get past me though hey hey guys this is austin when you're traveling there's a lot to consider is your flight on time how are you getting around once you arrive what's the time zone difference what you shouldn't have to worry about is whether or not as soon as you get to your hotel or perhaps your airbnb that you are being secretly recorded the story started doing the rounds back in april of the families who found hidden cameras inside their airbnb now there are certainly reasons why you might want to legitimately have a camera for example the security camera outside what's never okay is when these hidden cameras are so stealthy and in places like say the bedroom or bathroom that obviously no one would be comfortable with okay well ken not everyone's you so we decided to stage a little experiment how easy is it really to spy on someone then we try to keep this as simple as possible we purchased a series of cameras straight from amazon with prime shipping and all of them were reasonably affordable i mean we're talking between like forty to a hundred dollars per camera which is very much what you could make by renting your place on airbnb for a night or two so ken and our producer matt have hidden a series of hidden cameras all throughout matt's apartment which i have never visited sonali do i not know the layout i don't know which cameras are using and where they're placed and i have exactly ten minutes to find as many of them as possible and hopefully i'll be able to give some good tips on what you should look for as you go into your hotel or your airbnb or your sketchy friend matt's apartment i shouldn't weigh your sketchy you're a sketchy at all you're like the opposite of sketchy you called me a friend well this is creepy okay well i'm either see a camera underneath the hat hello all right well that was not okay so that's definitely doesn't count i know they specifically told me that that one was here something i would actually normally say is that i'm going to use my flashlight of my phone and essentially if i see any kind of weird reflections i'm going to try to rely that maybe i can notice like a lens or something this would be a lot easier to spot though if it was dark so didn't get it dark in here so the promise he's got to me legos it's easy to hide things okay is this thing suspicious this looks kind of suspicious this is a hidden camera it's pretty oh what the what hello what's this oh camera found it bad that was a good one can't get past me though right so i was actually surprised that he found that one i thought he was gonna find the one next to it before he found that one priority even see like the infrared this looks suspicious but is it though actually is this a real camera i think this is a real camera alright what else what else that clock looks suspicious i'm just gonna hold on this is this deafly camera right the camera in here somewhere oh the back is warm no no how's the camera although i gotta say it looks really like convincing if this is this is a camera i don't see oh there's right there it's inside the ten got it i got it i got it nice try you can't belong on over on me okay think i'm laying in bed what's gonna notice me why i'm laying in bed oh hi oh what's that oh an rf detector okay so if you're like a hardcore nerd then you might want to pick up something like this which in theory i've never used it before well let me know oh okay we found rf so if i put next to the gopro okay there's rf everywhere it's not very helpful so let's see if this is helpful i mean obviously a router that makes sense tv and makes sense wanders i know this is a camera oh yeah yep yep okay so this actually does work three minutes three minutes it's it oh no okay what else what else what else i feel like i'm still being spied on you're getting colder you have to taught me there's something like a vent oh oh that that this is narrow smoke detection this looks too fake yeah that's not smoke detector sucking so we like to point of it the camera actually died on us yet fro yeah i feel like i'm still missing done this thing something i hadn't kinda near the wi-fi though the chromecast now ah all right i'll call it gentlemen so i'll be honest yeah you didn't do great how are you i miss a lot the one that we called which yet didn't you never fail to disappoint that you're gonna find this run what right away and get all cocky about it like oh there is what happened what happened yeah that's actually not functional at all this is oh this guy here is one of my favorites this was up in the ceiling i'm like lounging here i'm like looking up like why is that beeping it i'm impressed with the craftsmanship of this it looks good even while you were holding it the only thing that gave it away was the heat of the back of it this guy here is a lovely terrible bluetooth speaker that has a camera right there oh man this is sketchy dude we want to do this video like oh it's gonna be like this fun thing let's go see if we can find a couple cameras you guys went all out like for real this is like super sketchy what's that one below the router ah say hi one of the points we were gonna make with the rf detector is not foolproof not very good actually no it works really well but in the room like this that's a smart vault that's a smart bulb now i've got a camera up there that's transmitted you got a router right here there are signals everywhere in here if we continue on the tour there more yes there are me no not the pen dude that's pretty good and then there's one that i knew that you would never find no matter how much you tried hyung you're dead giveaway should i have the pilot the pilots out oh yeah like i would know that the pilot eggs belongs in there i went into this feeling pretty confident i was like okay you know what i've got my skills i've got my knowledge i know what i'm looking for but this is me knowing that i'm there a room full of cameras and that's the best i could do i get plays i find half of them maybe not even so that was totally crazy so something i'm curious about you have a mixture of cameras here some of these record two sd cards but some of them actually stream to an app right they yeah most of these streamed the in stream very well to be honest but they did all through a single app so the clock the bluetooth speaker the smoke detector and the alarm clock were all capable of streaming also this is a real battery bank rate yeah so all of these devices actually do something like they actually function - the um the smoke detector you know what really tricked me out is the pen yeah this looks like a real pen i mean you can actually take it off and you'll see it's essentially like a fountain pen right and in fact you were trying to show me earlier that actually you can put those little ink cartridges it will write this when you put it in say like a little thing full of pens you're never ever ever going to notice it the only reason even when you point it out that was able to spot it was the fact that it was warm right and that's one of the things that is a giveaway with all these things a lot of these year they're warm right like a normal clock is not warm and normal like alarm clock or a battery bank they don't ever get warm but because they're constantly recording they do tend to heat up a little bit so i guess if we were going to do this again i would probably want to employ a thermal camera because you would be able to steal a little bit more of like hey why is that thing warm but you're getting into really paranoid territory if you're walking around with one of these things in a thermal camera and you're like flashlights and stuff so this here really didn't work at all for us the rf detection really doesn't work anymore it used to work when there was no smart devices but what we were hoping that would work is the laser detection so if you look through here you know what you're doing your flashlight this red light should have shined these these lenses but it really did we try it ourselves and the only one that really worked on was the actual camera this is meant to be seen i mean it's the thing where technology just come so far right i mean the fact that you've got cameras which are this small or that you know this small that can be easily hidden in these items means that it's pretty much open game and especially given that this stuff is not hard to find right and it's one amazon search away and like you know one day prime shipping and you have a whole host of super sketchy things it's easy to be paranoid it's easy to look at the stuff in odd oh everyone's gonna be recording you all the time but i mean if you are even slightly suspicious there's a lot of things that you can do i would say walk around like really thoroughly check things out i mean a lot of this stuff is very very concealed and the thing is a lot of these things work right like these are proper spy this is like proper spy gear and that this is a real wireless charger this is a real battery bank and yet they do have that camera and it is recording and especially like especially when you look at the app stuff right like it's one thing if like someone has to break into your apartment to plant a battery bank or something or try to get the sd card back but it's a completely other thing when there's a wireless right there which is constantly streaming video there is some consolation is that most of these failed on us they're not recording there's a lot of them that just stripped and work the stream stopped you mean like i have great internet so that's like not the issue they just they're cheap cheap cheap ly made you spend a bit more money i'm sure you're getting stuff yeah it is of higher quality yeah and even more dangerous right so sleep easy at night friends because big brother is certainly watching if not ken will be yeah yikes
